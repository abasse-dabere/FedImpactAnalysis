personalfinance,"I am 21 and have $20,000 in student loan debt, $12,000 in credit card debt, have pending misdemeanor charges, and desperately need to save $2000 in the next two months to keep/postpone it all from crashing down.","tl:dr... I need to find a way to save $2000 in 2 months. The following provides a pretty in depth look at my current financial situation.

I will be grateful for any additional feedback beyond that relating to the 2 grand. I just need some help.

Please try and withhold judgement while considering my situation; I am really not a dumb person, but I have made some very dumb mistakes. I'm being brutally honest here. If you read this whole thing, I really appreciate it. This is the first time I've really laid out exactly how I got into my current situation.

I am 21 years old and have $20,000 in student loan debt, $12,000 in credit card debt, have pending misdemeanor charges, and am completely desperate for some guidance.

**Spring 2012 - Fall 2013**

I graduated 3rd of my 400+ high school graduating class. I scored over 2300 on the SAT and a 35 on the ACT. I was accepted to Berkeley but decided against enrolling there due to cost. I was an unmotivated, yet lovable troublemaker who smoked weed before, during, and after school, and slept through half of my classes as an upperclassman. High school was a breeze to me, and I thought I was the shit for being so smart.

In fall 2013, I enrolled in an expensive 4-year university. I do not come from money, and despite receiving around $6,000 per semester from grants/scholarships/financial aid, I still needed about $7,000 more per semester. No biggy, parents have great credit, they cosigned on 3 different loans which totaled $32,500 to get me through the first 2 years.

I joined a fraternity during my first semester and quickly lost sight of the real reason I was at school. By the end of that semester my GPA was a 3.0, thanks to the university's grade-exemption policy which gave me the chance to exempt the 2 classes I failed from my GPA. By the end of the 2nd semester I had acquired a pretty heavy adderall addiction and was placed on academic probation for failing to keep my GPA above a 2.5. 

My parents weren't happy, but I assured them that I was gonna pull it all together the following semester. I believed this myself and was looking forward to a fresh start. I had quit the fraternity and was living with who I thought were pretty straight edge guys the next year. I went and got myself an adderall prescription prior to beginning my third semester. I had gone the whole summer without it and was confident in my ability to use responsibly.

I soon learned my ""straight edge"" suite mates all liked drugs as much as I did but had a lot more control over it. I became a self-proclaimed junky during this time period. Never went to class, never showered, never ate, and just really just didn't care anymore. I found ways to take advantage of my automatically-refilling meal dollars so I always had cash for whatever. Sold weed on the side out of the suite. Failed out after not passing any classes.

**Early 2014**

Upon returning home, I picked back up at the job I had in high school and quickly (the time was just right) worked my way up into a $35,000/year position paid salary. After scheming the drug test on some 007-type shit that I am admittedly very proud of, I was caking in at a job I knew better than the back of my hand and hired all of my friends to come work for/with me. It was awesome, my numbers were great, all the other experienced GMs were jealous, and I could do no wrong in my bosses eyes. Plus, we had an unlimited supply of 30mg IRs (the good shit). We were living the dream of 20 year old fast food workers. 

After a year, the 80 hour adderall-fueled workweeks responsible for my great work production began to get to me. I began resenting the place and blaming it for unescapable depressive state. This stemmed more adderall use. My friends/employees started to notice I had a problem. After a 2 week binge of adderall, alcohol, pot, nitrous, and a half-sheet of Lucy. This all took place either in the store itself or in my car parked out back (I didn't go home at all these two weeks, I was too fucked up to drive the 15 min home by the end of the day), me and my best manager/friend both decided we were gonna quit and get clean. I had a pretty large amount of money saved up, and I told him I would support him for a month or so while we did this. No two weeks or anything, we called my boss tripping our tails off and told her we wouldn't be at work the next day.

**Early 2015**

We cleaned ourselves up from our DOC and were living off the money I had saved. We were partying almost every night, partly to stay off the amphetamines. Soon, that money was gone, and I wasn't going to be able to pay rent. I landscape during the summers, but this was late spring. I went to the bank to try to get some overdraft fees reversed, and they told me I might want to look into getting a credit card with the bank. I had been paying back my student loans for over 6 months and had financed a car in high school without missing a payment. My credit was pretty good. I was approved for a $10,000 line of credit with 0% apr for the first 18 months. I just had to pay the minimum payment of 2% the current balance... ""Wait, what?!"" 

**June 2015**

Took a cross country trip, spent $2,000 in Vegas, and was making a lot of money with my landscaping business. I never put any of the cash I earned in the bank and used the credit card for all of my purchases, so my checking account balance stayed pretty constant. 

**September 2015**

Maxed out my credit card, the grass isn't growing anymore, I don't have any money left to pay my bills. I begin driving for Uber but need money for gas to start, so I apply for another credit card to use for gas. And then another one. I have enough for my bills and gas the upcoming week, but not enough to pay off the balances on the cards. I start ignoring their existence after I max them out.

**October 2015 - Now**

Me and my roommates are drinking and watching football around noon on a Saturday, pulling straight out of half gallon of rum. I drove all night and was planning on getting real drunk and passing out while watching the games. 

I drank too much too fast, blacked out, and was found by police down the street from my house playing my electric guitar. They call me an ambulance and I refuse the ride. Protocol in this situation is an arrest. I refuse the be arrested as well. They hit me with resisting arrest. While in the holding cell, I become upset and start cursing at the officers. According to one of the guards, every time I told the magistrate to go fuck himself, he raised my bond a grand and then secured it at $5,000 dollars. They added disorderly conduct/defacing a public building. Apparently, I was having trouble pulling down my pants to piss (I was handcuffed) and asked for assistance. When they didn't, I pissed on the floor of the cell. Classy, right? I woke up the next day in 23 hour lockdown with no idea how I got there. I spent 3 more days there before being released pretrial with no bond. The charges are still pending, I haven't gone to court. This is my 2nd time in trouble, 1st arrest.

For the past 3 months I've been sober but struggling. I've succeeded in deferring my student loans but still have $800+ in bills a month, not including food. Uber is just not cutting it, and I need to find a real job. A good one at that. My lawyer keeps continuing my case in the hope that it will be thrown out. He's a respected man around town and says that I wasn't doing anything illegal, was lucid while interacting with the officer (per arrest report), and was a resisting an arrest that was unnecessary to begin with, as I lived within eyesight of my home. Until my case is settled, no one will hire me. I've had 5 good/great interviews in December, all for jobs which I am more than qualified. I was honest about my arrest in all of them and the interviewers seemed sincerely empathetic and understanding. Still, I haven't gotten a call back. These are jobs that pay no more than $9/hour.

Basically, I'm lost. I have another 5 months until I can start landscaping again. I am making about $1000/month working over full time with Uber. The deferment period on my loans is up in January. My credit is absolutely destroyed at around a 450. I need to be able to pay these student loan bills at all cost; I don't want my stupidity to damage my parents' credit. I have $0 in emergency funds. The minimum payment on my $10,000 credit card is $1,750 to bring it current, and I have about 2 months to pay it before they close the account. This is my number 1 priority right now.

Basically, I have 2 months to save $2000 while only making $1000/month. I will literally do anything to achieve this. Any ideas?",finance,1451612040
personalfinance,26 year old trying to figure out which bill not to pay in order to afford business trip.,"Hello, I am on a monthly salary. Right now after paying for my rent, utilities, and highest interest student loans I am left with about $560. I won't get paid until the end of the month and I have a business trip I need to take, I cannot be reimbursed for this trip but it's still necessary to take. The trip itself will cost at least $150 to do comfortably. 

I have several bills left to pay $10 from Netflix, $30 for a gym membership which even if I cancelled they'd still charge me for. Probably roughly $100-$115 will be spent in gas money Then an additional $50-85 on food/groceries. That leaves me with just above $300 left. So I have $150 left to spend.

I have a loan from Navient student loans that is $90 but I also have A Capitol One credit card charge that's roughly $120 both are hounding me to pay up. I can't pay both. Who do I pay? I'm thinking the student loan one as it has a higher interest rate. Any other suggestions?

personalfinance,How to pay off debt optimally?,"So /r/PF, as of 1/1 I have only major/long term debt remaining.  It's not unaffordable, I just want to figure the best way to pay it off.  I'll list it all out, give my plan and see what you all think.



Household income after taxes: $6800



Mortgage:           $3000/mo   @ 4.25% 29.5 years remaining(Yes, I know, absurd, it's a high cost of living area)

Personal loan:      $2500        @ 9% 13 payments remaining (48 payments originally)

Furniture:            $900         @ 0% 8 payments remaining (originally 12 payments)

Personal Loan:      $9700       @ 0% 12 Payments remaining 

My Student Loan: $13,300 @ 6.8% 88 payments remaining (originally 120 payments)

Her Student Loans: Not even making more then the minimum at those, as those are being incurred!



Cars are paid for.  No other debt outstanding that I can think of.  No kids, daily expenses go to chase freedom card which statement balances get paid off monthly.

Had a hiccup last month of surprise needing a roof.  So that cost us 4k out of pocket but figuring we have only long term debt remaining and our tax return should be in the ballpark of 10k, I figured it would be best to throw that at the debt and maybe pad the emergency fund some.  

My thought is to pay the smaller loan at 9% off but considering that is MOSTLY principal at this point, that might not make sense.  It might be more optimal to throw a big chunk at my student loans and then throw some cash into the emergency fund to grow that and maybe throw some in our 401ks?

Thoughts?   Thanks!

Edit: Also worth noting.  The student loan payment and the person loan payment that has the interest rate are about the same, both roughly $200/mo.",finance,1451617663

personalfinance,(CAN-25yo) Advice on how to grow my savings,"Hello and Happy New Year everyone!:)

A little quick background - I am 25 and living/working in Canada as a bachelor. I am debt free and need advice on not only to grow my savings, but what steps I can implement financially to save money to reach my goals.

Investments:


RRSP - ~16K in conservative mutual fund (I've got around 30K room to carry over)

Stocks (TFSA) - ~1K (testing the waters... and obviously a loss at the moment)

Cash (Savings in a non-interest account - I have my reasons) - ~80K

Income (not sure how long this will be sustainable) - ~3K (bi-weekly)


Costs (Monthly):


Rent: 1.5K

Bills (phone, utilities, entertainment): 0.3K

Food/Groceries: 0.5K (30% of the time I eat outside) 

Misc (entertainment/unexpected irrational purchases) : 0.3K

Gifting: 1K


Goals:



1) The primary goal is to have enough savings for a downpayment on a house. I say house and not a condo because it is for my parents. Parents are living in another city in an apartment and I've been working pretty hard to save as much as I can. What's the maximum downpayment (%) should I save/have that doesn't affect the interest rate before getting a mortgage so I can quickly (or not) pay it off for them? I'm not concerned about the ""timing"" of the buy even though there is a ""bubble"". I see it as a long term investment. I plan using/maximizing (25K) my RRSP for the downpayment.

2) My secondary goal is to grow my savings of course, not only for retirement, but as a safety net. I don't have anything significant invested at the moment. As you can see, I only have in cash and with inflation, it's not doing much. Any advice on how I should conservatively balance my investments (couch potato portfolio?) - i.e. ETFs (I've been looking at BMO and Horizon ETFs particularly bear/bullish on crude oil and gold for the long term + american banks), mutual funds (either e-series from TD or Mawer), and low risk/long term stocks preferably in the TSX. Should I invest in all three areas and more focus on ETFs and mutual funds as oppose to stocks? I plan on using my TFSA for this.

3) Finally, what % of cash should I have on the side as a safety net? And how much should I be contributing in my RRSP given my constraints?

Apologies if I may be vague or unclear but any guidance and/or advise is appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1451642620

personalfinance,Unsure if I should pay off my student loans or buy a house,"Let me begin by saying I am not very savvy with money so it's possible there's an obvious answer here that I'm just not seeing, so please go easy on me! I will try to make this as simple as possible but if there are clarifying questions I am happy to answer. I'm an open book and will do anything for a little bit of direction.

I owe approximately $26,000 in student loans, over three loans ($4K, $9K, and $13K). The payments for each are $75, $110, and $430 each month respectively, and the interest rates are 2%, 4%, and 6.25% respectively.

I make a good salary and am able to save a bit each month despite these and other expenses, and in addition to that plus the holiday bonus I just received, I've suddenly and ironically found myself with $26,000 in savings.

The conundrum is, my husband and I are considering buying a house, and the plan is/was to use the majority of that money for a down payment on a house (we also have some money for a down payment coming from his side, but it's a gift/we can't use that to pay loans etc.). But I'm not sure if it'd make more sense to pay off my loans and save the ~$600/month for like a year instead and then buy a house? I imagine I might get a better interest rate if I was debt-free (or had at least eliminated part of the debt) but I honestly don't really know for sure? 

I guess my main concern is that I don't trust myself and I'm afraid that life would happen and I wouldn't end up saving the difference in monthly payments for whatever loan(s) I did pay off. I'm also perhaps nonsensically more concerned about becoming cash poor for the sake of ""not loans"" versus becoming cash poor for ""have a house now""... if that makes sense. The intangible nature of paying off debt seems somehow less fulfilling to me. But again, I have no idea what I'm really talking about, so I would love some help!",finance,1451657538

I currently use Capital One 360 Savings to manage very short term (&lt;1 year) savings.  Each savings account is a bucket of money for things like car upkeep, doctor visits, charity savings, etc.   I like having this money separated so I can easily see how much is available for the various categories.

At the beginning of each month, money is automatically deposited from my checking account into these buckets.  I also look at the previous month's expenses, and if I spent money from one of these buckets, I manually transfer money from savings back to checking.

Now here is the problem.  Over time, I've added more and more buckets (i.e. savings accounts), and there is a federal rule called Regulation D that prevents someone from transferring money out of savings more than six times in a month.  December has more expenses than normal due to Christmas, travel, and charity donations all hitting in the same month, and this month was the first time that I wanted to make more than six transfers from savings back to checking.

I know a lot of folks on this sub use Capital One's savings accounts in a similar manner.  Has anyone else run into this issue before?  What are people's work arounds for this issue?

The Feds provide a maximum matching amount of 5% (assuming you contribute at least 5%). 

**GOTCHA #1**

You must contribute each paycheck in order to receive all of the gov't match.  

**GOTCHA #1a**

If you attempt to contribute beyond the TSP limit, your contributions will be suspended for the rest of that year once you reach the limit.  You will miss 4% of the gov't match for any missed pay periods.  The is no ""true-up"".

**GOTCHA #2**

Attempted contributions above the TSP max will NOT be classified as catch up contributions.  If you wish to make catchup contributions you must fill out an additional form to specifically requests these.  Catch up contributions only apply if you are 1) over 50 years old, and 2) maximizing your regular contributions.

Tips to maximize your TSP:

* Set your regular contribution to 18000/(number of pay periods) = **$693 assuming 26 pay periods**.

* To maximize your **catch up contributions** calculate 6000/(number of pay periods) = **$231** assuming 26 pay periods.",finance,1451679594

personalfinance,"Switching banks, what should I do with my credit card?","I have been with Bank of America for about four years, three of those having a credit card with my highest CL ($6K). I am also a member of NavyFCU and PenFed. I switched my primary bank from BoA to NFCU about a year ago and I am now trying to lose BoA completely by switching my secondary accounts over to PenFed. 

My current problem is that I have a $6k CL credit card with BoA, with a balance of just over $5k. I also have a card with a similar CL at NavyFed (but I have a balance of $3k), an AmEx charge card (paid in full each month), an AmEx credit card (CL $3.5k, balance of $200), a Discover It card (CL $1.5k, $1k balance), and a Apple Financing card (CL $1.7k, balance of $850). 

I have consolidated cards in the past so I know that is an option, but I doubt I will be able to get a loan to transfer my balance over due to my other balances. I also tried applying for a $500 CL credit card at PenFed and was rejected, possibly due to my $100 combined accounts balance at PenFed.

So basically, what is my best course of action to move my money over into PenFed from BoA and to eventually get rid of my savings,checking, and credit card at BoA?

financialindependence,Residential photovoltaic - seems like an excellent investment after tax credits,"I worked up the cost and benefit of installing solar panels on my house.  I'm in New York State, so there's three important incentives that really change the value proposition:

* The NY-Sun Initiative will pay $0.50 for each Watt of nameplate capacity that I install.  On a large system, that's around 20% of the installation cost.
* There is a Federal tax credit of 30% of install cost.
* NYS has a state tax credit of 25% of install cost.

Well, shoot.  My governments really want to buy me a solar array, don't they?  Has anyone done this?  Would you care to check my math?

I priced out panels and a grid-tie inverter.  $16400 would get me a 10kW system.  Let's call it $20k with installation (which I haven't priced out).  After government incentives, the direct cost to me is $4000.  NREL's PVWatts tool says that for my site, and with my existing roof pitch, I would expect to generate 12000kWh/yr, or $1200 worth of electricity.

This gives a **ARR of 31%.**  Excellent, really.  Without the incentives, it's 6.1% ARR.  I also ran the numbers on a smaller system, and came up with 30% and 6.0%.

However, there is something that complicates my math.  I'm paying $0.10/kWh for electricity, but I would only be paid $0.035/kWh to feed surplus power back into the grid.  This fact would diminish the ARR during summer months when I would produce more than I can consume, if I go with the largest system that would fit on my roof.  So the ARR on a small system is 30%, and on a large system it's around 20%.  Very solid.

Am I overlooking something?  Why don't all my neighbors have solar installations on their roofs?",finance,1451695027
personalfinance,My foreign in-laws (60+) stay with me part of the year. What concerns should I have regarding their health insurance?,"My foreign in-laws stay with me more than half the year, but they are not otherwise employed in this country. The other part of the year they spend back in their home country.

They have a small pension from their home country that they use for incidental expenses, they live with us and we pay for their plane tickets back and forth. They own a property back home so otherwise they have a very modest fixed-income retirement. 

My concern is that due to the health insurance reforms, they're kind of in a donut-hole spot. They don't make nearly enough and due to some serendipitous bureaucratic mistakes were not able to come to the US early enough to continue their careers here, so they don't really have good employment options. Because they received permanent residency less than 5 years ago, they don't qualify for any Federal benefit programs (medicaid, ACA subsidies, etc). 

They've been without insurance for last year, and they are in good health. 

Last I checked they are ""fine"" with respect to the ACA tax penalties because they don't really make any money. My two questions are:

1. Is there another option for them to get some sort of catastrophic hospitalization insurance that doesn't cost $400/month with a $10,000 deductible? Anything not life-threatening they can have treated in their home country at very low cost.

2. Because they live with us, can I claim them each as a dependent on our taxes? What consequences would I encounter in doing so? Would I be obligated to pay for health insurance for both of them?",finance,1451696349
personalfinance,[Planning] Where to start with 529 plans and saving for school.,"Looking for advice on starting a 529 plan for my daughter.  She is three months old, but I would rather start now and build up enough while also not skimping on retirement savings.  I live in an expensive area (DC Area), so the numbers may seem higher than they might normally do.  

My financial situation:

**Income and Assets**

* Wife and combined make $170,100 a year.

* We have about $420,000 in cash and equities in a brokerage account.

* We have both have Roth IRA's, mine with about $25,000 and my wife's about $10,000. 
 
* I put 7% of my income into an employer sponsored 403B.  In one more year, my employer will kick in 10% gratis.  They have no match, just a two year waiting period.  My wife contributed 6% matching to hers and the company has discretion to put in up 4% more at the end of the year.

**Debts**

* No college debts left.  All paid off.  

* We have a $380,000 (30 year 3.75% fixed rate) on a mortgage for a house we put 20% down for to avoid mortgage insurance.  Our monthly payment is $2216.00.  We are in the first year as this was a re-fi after one year living here.

* We have about $3500 worth of credit card debt on a card that we used to fix up our basement (it was much higher), but it has a 0% interest rate and I have set it to auto-deduct every month before the 0% rate runs out.

* $236 payment on a car for 2 more years.  $408 on car for 5 more years.  

* No credit card debt, pay off monthly balance.

**Major Bills**

* $1850 a month for daycare.  DC is rough for this if you want a decent daycare.  We were offered a spot at one that hadn't even completed construction for $2350, site unseen and with a 1 year commitment.  

**Insurance**

* I have $230,000 in term life on myself and $180,000 on my wife.  She had term as well, but I can't remember how much.

* My employer pays my healthcare.  My wife has a different insurance and pays monthly for her and our daughter (just turned out cheaper that way).

* We have good home insurance, a home warranty, and full collision on our cars.

Right now, our savings/emergency fund has about $4300 in it.  It got pretty crushed by a few needed home repairs, baby related medical bills, etc.  I automatically deduct about $750 a month into this account, so it will rebuild quickly.  But, baby furniture and medical bills aren't cheap, so it hit us pretty hard (even with insurance).

We're both in our early 30's.  A bit cynical and assume social security and medicare won't be what it is now when we need to retire.  I'm preparing to open an 529 in Virginia for my daughter, but there are a lot of different types of plans and I'm just confused on my options or if there is a better way to save.  I also want to make sure that our retirement is setup, because you can borrow for college, but not retirement.  Any recommendations?

I realize that it sounds like this is a huge amount, but I have had to be very precise and frugal to put together decent savings and what not.  Cost of living is super high here.  Childcare is out of control.  We basically fall into this financial tranche where we get hit with a lot of taxes.  We couldn't afford to live here off one income, but daycare really takes a huge bite out of pay.  Unfortunately, we couldn't afford to live close enough to a metro and ditch one of the cars, but also work in opposite directions, so we need the cars.  I go through our bills and cut it down to make sure we save enough.

Lurked for a little while. Figured I'd post and see how I go. I'm in Australia, I figure that since I'm young (23) Have no real debt apart from a car loan (in hindsight I would have got another second hand car so this is my first and last new car I ever buy). And I don't really have a credit file so my loan interest rate is a bit higher than most (don't know the exact number so I'd have to check). I unfortunately came from a family who think spending like balls on credit is a great idea and using overdraft...so yeah I don't want to be them (they didn't do this under my name thank god). Basically I'd like to get to a point of total financial freedom and like everyone I want wealth (the more the merrier right? I didn't want to be cheesy and say I would like to get rich). So simply put I want to achieve the following:

&gt; -Get a good credit score/file how does one do this? How long does it take? Is it difficult?

&gt; -Save to get a loan for a block of land. I wish to pay this off ASAP then place a house on it and make it a rental (potentially doing this for a series of properties. I am aware of the risks and still learning so this could change slightly however the point still stands I'd like to own my own house and make some kind of passive income).

My situation (at least from what I know thus far) is as follows:

&gt; -I have a stable Job that Grosses 42,500 per year. (After tax I believe it's more around the 28 or 38 grand range...ouch will have to check)

&gt; -I have a girlfriend, she has a child...she doesn't cost much namely because I seem to volunteer to help her out (I'm a bit too kind). She is studying, she and I have agreed that I stop doing that as much as possible (pretty much $0 from here on out)

&gt; -I have a car loan with a balance of around 35 g's (this is inclusive of the interest rate etc)

&gt; -I live at home...and don't have living expenses (so rent food etc)

&gt; -I have some entertainment that I'm slowly but surely cutting out (incl netflix which I don't use...surprisingly novelty has worn off and I *had* several servers in america they were around $10 a month each)

So yeah based on the info above can anyone provide me some advice? I have read some of the links in the sidebar however I have a feeling some of that doesn't work in Australia.

* Canadian credit score of 720
* $15,000 in savings
* $2,500 in debt (student loans)
* $15/hour job, ~15-30 hours per week
* $30,000 in yearly financial aid ($24,000 in grants and scholarships, $6,000 in student loans)
* Undeclared $400 Canadian a month from family 
* Canadian citizen
* US permanent resident, unrestricted green card (~10 year expiration)
* No American credit cards, I expect to apply for 1-2 in the next month (I think this would be the next reasonable way to increase my credit score)

personalfinance,I Graduated Pharmacy School In 2012. I Paid Off My Loans Today Instead of Waiting 10 Years,"I graduated with my pharmacy doctorate in 2012 with approximately $70,000 in student loan debt. For the first 30 months after graduation, I was mired with the prospects of working with various staffing companies. When I was between stints with staffing companies, I decided to pursue a master's degree in healthcare informatics. By the stroke of luck, I ended up with another staffing company right before the master's program so I managed to minimize the need for student loans as I worked full-time during the entire master's program.

&amp;nbsp;

**My Student Loan Debt**

* Undergraduate studies (2005 to 2008) - $0
  
I went to an in-state university which was paid for by lottery-funded scholarship which covered the entire cost of tuition, academic scholarships, grants and part-time jobs.

&amp;nbsp;

* Pharmacy School - $70k (2008 to 2012)

Scholarships covered a good portion of my first year tuition costs and summer/part-time jobs helped covered as much as I could with livings.

&amp;nbsp;

* Master's Degree - $10k (2013 to 2015)

The total cost of the program was more, but I paid for the rest as I was working for a solid stretch during this time.

&amp;nbsp;

**My Job Path**

* June 2012 - Sept. 2014, Avg. Annual Earnings ~90K

I was employed with various staffing agencies during this time period. I was employed as a hourly W-2 pharmacist. I had to pay for my own insurance, did not have any PTO or any of the benefits of a permanent employee. Because of the possible instability, I worked every shift imaginable.

My budget during this time consisted of paying living expenses, save a fixed amount, max my Roth IRA and dump the rest into student loans. During a few several month periods, I was putting ~$3-4k/month towards my loans.

&amp;nbsp;

* Oct. 2014 - Present, Salary ~107K

After being with a company for 3 different stints, I was offered a permanent position with them without an interview process. I was not eligible for the 401(k) until January 2015, so when that happened, the only thing I changed in my budget was divert enough of my paychecks to maximize my 401(k).

&amp;nbsp;

My expenses werely kept fairly low (~$1750 per month), as the nature of working with staffing companies made it potentially very unstable. As I was with staffing  companies, I did not have access to 401(k); it was not until the start of 2015 when I could put money into a 401(k). Rather than blowing through the extra  money, I decided to pretty much put as much of the left-over money as I could towards my student loans which all had interest rates at 6.8%.

Building upon this idea I'm wondering if one can build a new outbuilding on a piece of property to put solar panels on and get the total cost included in the 30% tax credit?",energy,1451748302
personalfinance,A few tax and credit questions from a college student,"Hey everyone,

I've tried googling a few of these questions, but I am want to clarify for sure:

If you answer any of these I **greatly** appreciate it, I just want to be more financially aware than my parents have been...

1. Let's say I make (hypothetical) single-filer $95k a year. That puts me into the 28% (2016) federal income tax bracket. Now, let's say I max out my IRA ($5.5k) and 401k ($18k). Would that put my highest tax bracket into the 25%? Or would I still pay 28% on my highest dollar. I am aware of that you only pay 28% on your income *above* the bracket, but I'm not certain if these mechanics hold for savings accounts.
2. I understand that I can make investments within my IRA account as long as I don't take out until I'm 59.5, is this also true of a 401K? Am I allowed to make any investment I want within my IRA or are there like ""IRA approved"" investments? What is a realistic return on IRA investments? Do middle class (or upper-middle) people have been manage their IRA investments for them?
3. When putting into an IRA do you pick between a ""traditional IRA"" and a Roth IRA? Can one person have both? From my calculations it looks like the Roth IRA generally performs better, are there any circumstances where one can't/shouldn't get a Roth over a traditional IRA?
4. I have one credit card that I do general purpose purchases on. I have a credit score of 690. I only have it to grow my credit score. I have heard it would be a good idea to get *another* credit card once I peak above 700 so I can solidify my score before leaving college 3 years from now. Is that a good strategy?

Okay, I really didn't mean to make this a wall of text, but I would love any insight. Thanks!",finance,1451756490

personalfinance,I did my taxes for 100% free last year (the only year) trying to figure out how again,"Hey guys. I usually do my taxes with TurboTax and I usually pay something like ~$30 for the service, Federal is free and state cost something like ~$20 or whatever. I'm usually fine doing that, but then last year I decided that I should be able to just do it all for free somehow. So I came here to this subreddit (I think) and asked about how one might do that.. someone gave me a link for my state's website that if you clicked the link though them, you get to do your taxes free. So I ended up going through H&amp;R Block's website to do my taxes, which turned out that it was 100% free to do for anyone, even the ""deluxe"" service. I thought it seemed weird that they would do it for free, but then I realized that is when TurboTax made the news that they had a vulnerability and may or may not have been hacked. So I assumed they were doing it to bring over customers. Then, later the same year, TurboTax offered refunds for 100% free as well - I assume to win back lost customers. Either way, taxes were 100% free to do last year (both service and e-filing), and I want that again this year if I can.

So now basically this year I am trying to find out where/how I can go through and do my federal and state taxes for free again. I checked my state's website (Michigan) but there is nothing available yet, since it's too early in the year.

But other than that, does anyone know anything about doing your taxes for free, both state and federal? By the way, I am a home owner so I'm assuming I don't want to use the standard packages that these places provide (which are free).",finance,1451760308

personalfinance,Looking for someone to lead me in the right direction on repaying credit cards.,"Hi /r/personalfiance!

Was wondering if anyone can show me the correct way on paying back a credit card balance.

A quick summary:

I was laid off a roughly about a year ago. During that time, I was on um-employment, using it to pay off rent and student loans. Apparently, I could've contacted the student loans services about this and they would've made my life easier by either holding back payments or making them cheaper. That was my mistake for not doing that.

I took a risk and used my credit card to pay for a convention and a few social networking events due to a career opportunity, which in turn landed me the best job I could've possibly hoped for. I've been happily employed for a couple of months now.

I now have the credit card balance (which I've been just paying the bear minimum needed each month) and my student loans to pay off. 

The student loans are easy, it's the credit card balance that's kinda rough. My main concern is that the interest is going to stack up quite a bit (15%, if I remember correctly).

My job pays decently, which is understandable since I just started. 
Does anyone know of a way where I can start a payment plan for my credit card balance but somehow be able to lower the interest rate? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

PS: Not sure if this helps, but I have good credit.",finance,1451773176
financialindependence,"High Income couple with $147k in student debt, but have the cash to pay it off. Marriage will cost us more in taxes than being single.","I'm active on this subreddit under a different name, and feel more like minded with you all vs. personal finance. I'll take the hint if you don't want this thread here though. 

**TLDR;** My girlfriend is $147k in student debt, and I have the money to pay it off. I’m planning on loaning her the money @ the lowest federal interest stipulated (0.05%?). Any other options? If we got married and I gifted her the money, we’d owe an additional $5k+ in taxes annually (according to my CPA)

My girlfriend and I have been together for 4 years, cohabited for 3, and we’re incredibly solid and communicative about all things: money, sex, wants/desires, children and our future. We’re 30 years old. She has debt of about $88k @ 8.2% private loan, and $59k @ 4.2% federal. She just started working 5 months ago, and makes around $150k annually. I’m self employed, and make $160k annually. FI is very important to us, and it seems like the most prudent thing to do is use my money to wipe out the debt. Otherwise, I'd drop it into Betterment. Please consider our relationship stability/seriousness as that of a married couple. 


**My Financial Break Down**

* $215k in Cash (just received large injury settlement. Broken leg.) 

* $75k in Betterment Index Funds

* $37k in 401k

* No CC debt, or other loans 


**Her Financial Break Down**

* $7k in Cash

* $9k in 401k

* $147k in student debt 

* No CC debt or other loans


**My questions:**

1. Even after we max out 401k’s we’re still hitting a tax bracket that will cost us an additional $5,100/year in taxes by getting married (in Ca) and filing jointly making $300k as a couple. Is there a way we can still get married, and not have this financial penalty? Marriage is something we’re both interested in, but we don’t value it at $5,100 in additional tax! I’m already on her healthcare, as she works for a laid back company that respects our relationship. 

2. By paying off her loans in a lump payment, I’m seeing some interest calculators show me that I could save us around $55k in interest by not dragging these loans out over 5-6 years. The loan my CPA recommended can be enforced by law in the event  that we split up. This makes us both feel comforted, and reduces her sense of guilt. We are focused on FI and will still be saving like crazy even though the debt is gone. I’m emotionally comfortable with using “my” money for our mutual gain. Other options that I'm missing? 

Happy to fill in any holes, and thanks for your time.

To make things short I was fortunate enough to have a good deal of money to my name when I graduated high school due to an accident I suffered during childhood. The plan was to spend a lot of the money on university but frugal 17 year old me decided to not attend a private college and go to my state university. Worked my butt off and ended up being able to graduate college in 3 years this upcoming May with a BA in Mathematics. Ultimately I hardly touched the money really only spending around $35,000 on my education over the last 3 years.

I was hesitant to really touch the money while I was in college just in case something came up so it's been sitting lonely accruing 0.8% in annual interest rates. Anyway, the last couple of years I have been suffering from depression as university has not really been the best time for me. I've been budging a trip I plan to take over the next couple of years but besides that I really have no career aspirations for when I return at the moment besides maybe attending graduate school. Basically to make things short I don't really have any direction or anything planned really for the future but a lot of money which will pretty much just be sitting around until I return from my trip.

economy,"In your opinion, fellow economy-heads, what will be the cause of the next crash?","I think if oil prices drop too low in 2016, big oil companies will reach a point of too much debt and start failing, causing the supply of oil to decrease, and the price of other commodities to decrease with the increase in oil prices (after the companies fail). If these companies collapse suddenly, it could create some shocks in the market and some panic dumping (lol) of other commodity-tracking ETFs.

Another possible cause could be the interest rate hike. I don't believe .25% will do anything too major (besides what it has already done to the bond market) but once we are a couple years into this gradual hike we will definitely see what the U.S. economy is really built of. Hopefully the housing market won't be hit too hard and I really hope we learned our fucking lesson from 2007.

My husband and I are 36 years old. He worked for 15 years, during which time he amassed about 120,000 in a 401k, which was rolled over into a traditional IRA when he left his job, which is just sitting there.  We have not added to or withdrawn anything in the year and a half since he took a buyout.  He is currently a SAHD, and small business owner.  The small business is just getting off the ground, and is not profitable yet, but is not costing us anything, either.  The kids are 11 and 9, and we have no college savings as of yet.  We also have no debt, other than the mortgages on 2 houses, one of which is rented out currently.  Both mortgages have good interest rates.  The house being rented out is worth about 215k, and we only owe 167k on it.  The home we live in, we don't have any equity in to speak of, having lived there only about a year. We don't have car payments, or any credit card debt.  I am a registered nurse, and made 68k in 2015.  It's my first year in this career field, so I can expect my income to increase.  I am currently putting 10% in a 403b.  The match from my employer is a pittance, so I'm definitely maxing that out.  Prior to this year, I have saved nothing for retirement, but my marriage is solid, and I consider the IRA to be a joint resource with my husband. We don't currently have an emergency fund, but we do have a significant line of credit we can use in an emergency.  I also expect a fairly significant tax refund (probably in the neighborhood for 4k or so), which needs to go in part to some home improvements, and hopefully there will be enough to start an emergency fund.

Income-$19.65/hourly, guaranteed 40 hours a week, usually squeeze in 1-2 hours of OT/week but not guaranteed and will likely lessen during slower season. Schedule is completely unpredictable and changes week to week so having a second job is out of the question. However, I am sitting for the February Bar exam and hope to get a better paying job after I pass (cross your fingers I pass).


Expenses-I live with my SO who also works full time. We split all expenses evenly but we don't track food very carefully-I tend to buy more groceries, he tends to pay when we go out so it probably breaks pretty even. 

Fixed monthly expenses: Rent $487

Utilities: Roughly $100

Car payment: $319

Insurance: $95

Gym: $20

Wells Fargo student loan: $95

(Soon to start in February): Consolidated income-based student loan to Greatlakes: Approximately $200

Food: Roughly $50/week? Admittedly I've been stupid the last few months and been eating out far more than I should have. Ending this has been my first step towards being less stupid. I just spent $115 on groceries that I anticipate will feed both my SO and I for roughly 1.5-2 weeks.

personalfinance,"High Income, Low Discipline... Trying to improve and could use some direction.","I am married, 31 years old, and have two children under the age of 3.  I own a house, 2 new cars, 2 student loans (mine and my wife's), and have a hospital bill that I pay monthly.  I have no credit card debt, and my credit score is in the 760s.  

My (and wife's) discretionary spending is pretty out of control, mostly due to major depression, ADHD and anxiety causing us to struggle to plan and prepare healthy/cheap meals and to sometimes engage in ""retail therapy"".  We have some expenses, such as house cleaning that are key to our survival (cleanliness=improved mood, which is invaluable in raising kids, etc.).  Ultimately, I think it is our mental health (and more specifically self-discipline) that is the cause of most issues.  

Here are the numbers:

I make gross 5k every two weeks.  After taxes (1303.45), medical (228.36), and 401k (200, due to 4% match offered), I net around 3280.

I have the following debts:

(Name, Current Owed, Rate, Monthly Payment, Asset Value)

 * Hospital Bill,$5,050.00,0.000%,$150.00,$0.00 (Paying Minimum) 
 * Student Loan - Federal,$7,164.07,5.600%,$130.00,$0.00 (Mine, Paying Minimum)
 * Student Loan - Sofi,$42,000.00,3.750%,$410.00,$0.00 (Wife's, who is stay at home, no income currently)
 * Honda,$22,892.42,2.790%,$504.00,$29,500.00 (Paying Minimum)
 * House,$171,964.58,3.625%,$1,275.00,$181,000.00 (minimum is $1075) (5/5 ARM, 18 months in)
 * Hyundai,$27,029.02,0.000%,$501.00,$26,710.00 (Paying Minimum)

Total monthly outflow towards debt is $2970.  Adjusting 26 payments for 12 months, my monthly inflow is $7107.  

In theory, we should have $4137 remaining each month for added debt payoff and all other expenses.  Here are my remaining non-debt expenses:

 * Preschool - $135/month
 * Gym - $20/month
 * Cell - $162/month
 * House Cleaning - $100/month
 * Video Streaming - $28/month
 * Internet - $62/month
 * Insurance (Car/Life) - $170/month
 * Energy Bill - $250/month
 * Food - $1400/month
 * Gas - $200/month

That adds up to $2527 spent, or total $1610 remaining.

The remaining $1610 just sort of evaporates.  Which as I'm typing seems to be totally ridiculous.  Some of it is things like Christmas presents, travel to visit family, hobby costs (I do woodworking on the side), kid's clothes, doctor's visits, medicine, vehicle tax/registration, toiletries, diapers, various supplies, etc.

A few other numbers, then some conclusions and questions.

 * 401k amount, fully vested: $31k
 * Savings: &lt;$1000.
 * Work bonus expected in January: $19.5k gross (11k net, guessing)
 * Tax Return expected in Feb/March: $3500 (guesstimate)

So, here's what I think I should do:

1. Reduce food costs - perhaps use one of those online services that deliver meals so we don't go spend $40 at Cracker Barrel on a whim.  I'd love to find someone to do all my shopping for me with a specific budget so we don't have the chance to overspend...but that doesn't fix the root problem.
2. Identify what the hell I'm spending money on with the remaining $1610 and make cuts where possible.
3. Sell Honda.  The Hyundai is slightly underwater, but its a 0% interest rate, and my Honda would yield $6-7k and insurance reduction costs.  The MPG is about 8MPG higher on the Hyundai.  We'd have to share which would be tough and my wife would fight this hard.
4.  The 11k I'm expecting to come in, use a portion to pay down the small student loan (highest interest), use another portion to attempt to negotiate a reduced total payout from hospital (I owe $5050, propose I pay one lump of 3k to wipe the slate clean)., leave the rest for savings.
5.  Stop paying $200 extra on mortgage.
6.  Take all the savings from above (guesstimating $1750-2000 and start paying extra on Sofi loan)
7.  Tax re-evalutation coming in 2 months for my house, and depending it be worth an appraisal to improve our LTV on the house.

All that being said, I'd love to hear your thoughts on a few items:

1.  What are your general thoughts on above?  Is my plan logical?
2.  How should I handle the crazy oscillations that come with the uneven schedules of month payments vs. bi-weekly paychecks?  Sometimes I have almost no money left, and sometimes I have more (which gives the false feeling of having more money than I really do).
3.  What about savings?  At what point in my debt payoff should I sock more away in savings, investments, retirement?
4.  There is a strong possibility that I'll need to sell my home in 2016 and move to Dallas with my company.  How much the company will give me for the move is entirely uncertain--my guess is $10,000, probably with restrictions on how I can utilize.  Additionally, I could make between 0-80% bonus this year depending on company performance.  Should I take any of this into account?

Sorry for the novel--I don't know anyone personally who can help advise me on this...my whole family is not well off (probably for the same reasons I overspend), and no one has experience in this level of $.  Most of my decisions have been made by learning on this and other subreddits and reading blogs, books, etc.  Clearly the biggest issue is self-discipline, which is more a a journey than a quick destination.

personalfinance,How do I make the right decision?,"Making the right decision is always a struggle for me. I have this problem for years. Normally when I need to find a solution for a conflict, I always list the pros and cons for each potential solution. However, even seeing this list, it makes it difficult for me choose. I always tend to make the final decision at the last minute. 


**My question is how do I make the right decision?**

**Optional:**


My current conflict is to choose between 3 different sales jobs. They all sell the same product but the way they are selling is differently. Here are the pros and cons for each job:


**JOB A** (currently working here): At this job, we sell the product with a lot discount (40%+ in savings) in exchange for visiting a vacation resort to become a potential member. I do not sell the membership, rather I convince customers to visit the resort. (Similar to timeshare) 

**Pros:** very laid back and the hours (full time) are great. I have a lot potential to make a lot money in a year. 

**Cons:** I believe in the discount but not in the membership. This job questions my morals. Pays only minimum wage or commission. Commission is often difficult to get since I do not pressure customer to do this. If I do pressure customer to visit a resort, I can earn more money.


**JOB B:** At this job, they sell discounted tickets at a store that is quite well known. Their discount is not a lot but better than the gate price. There is no timeshare involved.

**Pros:** no pressuring the customer, no timeshare, very laid back, pays $1 more than the minimum wage. There is potential to make commission, but it rarely happens. 

**Cons:** only part time hours. Since this small company is short staffed, I can get more hours if the owner is generous, but this also means it is hard for me to take off. 

**JOB C:** At this job, they sell tickets at different location. It is a very famous company. Their prices are higher ($10 - $20) than the gate price, but some people buy their tickets mainly it save time than buying it from the gate. 

**Pros:** Pay is great, $2 more than the minimum wage + commission. No timeshare involved. 

**Cons:** It is only part time. Their location often require more travel time, which can be difficult as my family members are using my car sometimes. Their price is considered a rip-off, but I do believe the customer will save time. 

These are the three option I have. Whichever I choose, I have to quit by next year, since I might be attending a professional school/graduate school. 


As you can see, I find it difficult to choose between these three jobs. **Any advice how to make a decision regarding these three jobs?**

Buying stocks (even 'value stocks') and then going public is a technique that's banned for most people with access to the media (analysts, tipsters etc.) because it works by pumping stocks.

Buffett's failure to expand his paradigm to include bitcoin cost his followers dearly in 2015 and this 'money order' is teaching value investors about the combination of utility and scarcity in money.

Sorry if this is a bit OT, but I got fed up with reading about Berkshire Hathaway shares outperforming bitcoin in the short term a year ago, so I thought I'd remind us all that Buffett is not Harry Potter--he's Ron Weasely.",cryptocurrency,1451803249
personalfinance,"Update: still need help, not good: 26F - abusive house- $118k in student loan debt, no degree yet, want to return to school - severe depression/anxiety/health issues - fluctuating income - need public assistance -trapped ....","I posted here 7ish months ago under a different screen name:
https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/37und7/25f_abusive_house_118k_in_student_loan_debt_no/

I'm getting downvoted to hell but I desperately need help.  Abuse wise, my dad screams at the top of his lungs for a 15 minute drive to work about how I'm a fucking asshole cunt who deserves to die because I was 2 minutes later than I should've been getting out of my house.  My brother tells me routinely to die of cancer because I'm scum.  My mom berates me telling me what a bad person I am.

When I was 3, my dad smothered me with a pillow as I screamed and wouldn't stop until I stop screaming.  When I relayed this to him recently, he said it was too bad that it didn't work (in killing me).  

He's come at me with knives more than once.  He's come at me with his fists, screaming, more than I can count.

When I was 8, I huddled in a cardboard ""house"" I made with my stuffed animals.  When my mom asked why, I said it was so that when my dad killed me, at least my stuffed animals would go to heaven with me.

When I was 14, my dad tried to kill my mom by choking her, and I intervened.

Those are just tiny tidbits.


The debt?  Yeah, I deeply regret it.  DEEPLY.  It is my biggest issue and I want to do EVERYTHING I CAN to get it paid off AS SOON as I can.  I made a huge mistake by taking on the debt in the first place.  Most of it was for 2 years I spent at art school straight out of high school.  I then took a three year break, decided to switch to nursing, did one year of pre-reqs at a state school, a year and a half of nursing at a private school (I withdrew during the third semester as my mental health was deteriorating to the point of no return - I ended up calling the suicide hotline a few times in a week and nearly attempted suicide).  As of now, I would be transferring, again, to a community college for nursing for cheap that I wouldn't have been able to attend before because they have a three year waiting list.

I've seen a psychiatrist for 6 years, tried 20+ psych meds and am still trying more, have been hospitalized and done php, have depression, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and ptsd. I've seen multiple therapists.

TL;DR on old post: almost the same situation, (26F - abusive house- $118k in student loan debt, no degree yet, going to return to school - no car - severe depression/anxiety/health issues - average income $2,000 gross/month - trapped .... (self.personalfinance) ....except I've recently (last few months) been experiencing PTSD and, my function has gone down hill, not returned to school, income has decreased.

I've also since gone on MassHealth.  More money related things below.


Situation emotionally:
When diagnosed with PTSD, finally, a whole crapload of memories poured out of me of physical and emotional abuse.  Basically, anything can trigger me now, from the way someone says something, to phrases someone says, to authority figures, to emotions, scents, scenery, etc.  I am getting nightmares every night.  The other night I had nightmares every 30 minutes, would wake up in distress before going back to sleep, wake up again after 30 minutes, then went to sleep again.  If not that, then I wake up after 2 or so hours and then it continues.  They are horrific - I die, get tortured, abused, raped, murdered, or have memories of my abuse replayed.  On top of that, I'm still dealing with the depression and anxiety I was already dealing with.  I'm seeing a trauma based, CBT, EMDR therapist.  She knows her stuff and has been incredibly helpful even after 3 sessions.  I see her twice this week.  She suggested a PHP program (I tried one in August-September that helped a tiny bit) and some books, but suggested maybe I can do school, but I have no idea if I can handle it.

Since the last post, I've been diagnosed with chronic migraines, so I dealt with a 3 month long non-stop migraine.  I get migraines practically every day due to stress.

Mental health wise, I have gotten worse.  I have tried new medications and switched things around, and am soon to do so again.  I get a panic attack at least once or more a day.  I frequently get flashbacks.  I have anxiety literally all the time I am at my parents' house.  I deal with abuse from them on a daily basis and even being in my room avoiding them doesn't help anymore and I am always scared.  Taking showers is now my biggest trigger, next to work (because my dad, my main abuser, drives me), so it's a struggle for me to do basic every day things.  Even the sound of my parents' voices sends me into a panic.


Money situation:

I have MassHealth.  I have no copays for Doctor's visits and very low copays for medications.  I take about 8 or more a day for my mental health plus migraines, allergies, and GERD, then occasionally for IBS, eczema, muscle relaxants, as needed anxiety meds, or asthma, etc.

I'm trying to find a way to live with my boyfriend, because I feel safe here with him and his roommates.  We've been dating a little over a year.  However, I need money for rent ($300/month).  

At the same time, I am bringing in less money because my functioning is deteriorating.  I have called in 3 times in the past month.

I made $300 last month, and anywhere from $700-$1200 in the three months prior.  I have $800 on my credit card, $550 of which is due this month.  I have $1200 in checking and $500 in savings.  I have $200 on a vanilla visa gift card that my grandma gave me for Christmas.

My phone is $60/month.  I bought a metro pcs card that can be implanted in my phone to save $30/month.  I spend a lot on food but I am working on reducing it.

So- my income varies every month since I work per diem as a nurses' aide at a hospital.  I have not gotten an actual salaried job because I don't think I can handle it with my fragile mental health and don't want to get fired.

I'm trying to become a nurse.

I have student loans, which payments amount to about $800/month, I think, at the moment.  My parents have helped with two, but one is almost 60 days delinquent and it has piled up to $1200.  I am terrified about what to do for that one.  I have been handling the federal loans which are $180/month (and don't qualify for IBR but I should probably call because of the per diem?) and a private loan company whose loans amount to $100/month.  However, at the moment I obviously cannot handle that bill.  I am going to talk to my mom (yikes) and see what to do.  However, if I move out, I have no idea how I would handle this immense payment on my own.  My parents have paid it ever since I left school, even refusing to share the information with me in the past, and have used up all of my deferments and forbearances.

Is there any way that Chase or Loan to learn would allow me to lower my monthly payments, given my situation?  Something?  Anything?

I just emailed a disability attorney firm near me who helps apply for that, because I have been seriously struggling and it would help immensely to have that.  They do not charge unless you get it.  However, my doctor says it takes a very long time to get it. Is anyone familiar with how long it takes, generally?  Any take on if I'll get approved?  Honestly, I think I can, but I've read so many stories about it being so incredibly difficult.

Another thing - I was wondering if I qualified for food stamps.  I emailed them as well.  I explained the whole situation about my fluctuating income, my mental health, etc, and asked about that.  Any thoughts on if I could qualify?  I really don't know.  But in any case, I will find out from both the lawyer and the food stamp people on Monday.

And, I will be talking to my therapist on Monday, and my psychiatrist ASAP.  He wants to try me on meds that I already tried, at this point.  I've tried 20 meds in the last six years.  I just want to trying increasing my newish med Effexor, but we'll see, I guess.

I need to get out of my house.  I function a million times better away from my family.  I still struggle very much but it is still better than when I'm at home.

I also am still accepted into nursing school starting January 20.  I haven't finished all the paperwork.  I fluctuate greatly in my confidence in being able to handle it with everything that is going on in my life.  I see become a nurse as the out to everything in my life, but how do I do it?  I need to get my mental health in order, but how?

There's a trauma focused PHP group at McLean Hospital that looks promising, and there's more to a PHP program near me that I could try again.  I'm not sure if it would help, but maybe.

Could I handle school?

How can I make it so that I can leave my house?  I'm trying to get as much federal assistance as possible for the time being but it seems like it will take time.  I don't know if the disability lawyers will really know much about that.  Would someone be able to point me in the right direction of someone who might now about all that stuff?",finance,1451820033

personalfinance,"Students Loans, plan to never pay them off or pay them off as soon as possible?","While speaking with a lot of my peers, I've noticed that a lot of college grads simply never plan on paying off their student loans. They are having them dropped to as low as possible, barely $20 a month and always defer when possible. I guess their plan is to hopefully be forgiven after 10 years/120 payments with the public service loan forgiveness act.  I should add that my peers and I all work for non profits and earn very little. My first reaction to this sort of financial plan was that it was irresponsible and not a ""plan"" at all, but now I'm starting to wonder if they have the right idea.

My current plan to deal with student loan debt was the exact opposite, Ive been trying to pay off my loans as fast as possible and just want to get it over with. I left school in May of 2013 with about $55,000 in student and private loans. I've been paying around $750-800 a month on these loans and have it down to around $40,000. I only make around $1200 a month but have room and board included. Although my other monthly bills are minimal, $750 is a month is a lot to handle and I have to be very careful. I put 200 a month into savings every month as well. My private loan is a 5 year pay off plan at $464, not much changing that. But would it be worth it to go with ""pay as you earn"" payment options for my federal loans and put what I would be paying to them away in my personal savings?",finance,1451824581

personalfinance,Should I pay off my 0% interest credit card asap or just make the minimum payments each month?,"I got myself into some bad credit card debt last year - roughly 23k. I started tackling the mountain about 3 months ago and have paid off 8k leaving me with 15k. Last week I took out a new credit card with another bank offering a 0% interest rate on balance transfers for 15 months. So I offloaded all my debt from credit card A with a 22% interest rate to credit card B with 0%.

To pay off the debt while making use of the interest free period I would need to pay $1000 a month to have it cleared within the end of that 15 months. However I could probably clear the debt in a 3rd of that time if lived semi poor and threw most of my pay-check at it each month. But it got me thinking, if I were to just pay the minimum $1000 a month towards the debt, but then put that extra money from living poorly into a savings account I would actually be earning interest on it whilst not paying any on my debt.

personalfinance,Overseas bank account in India for higher interest rates - seems too good to be true. How does this affect taxes?,"My parents want to invest some money in India to take advantage of higher tax rates on CD's (called Fixed Deposits there). Like, MUCH higher **(6%+ interest on 90 day CDs at some of the largest banks).** They have relatives in India who would invest the money for them.

I know DICGC (their FDIC equivalent) insures bank accounts for up to 100,000 rupees (about $1500), so I've made my parents aware of that. 

But beyond that, what am I missing here? **It seems too good to be true, so I assume it probably is**. My parents are US citizens and hold OCI cards. 

1. Would they need to file dual taxes or does India's DTAA agreement negate that? 

2. Would they need to ensure that their interest income in India is less than 250,000 rupees to fall into the 0% tax bracket? See http://finotax.com/income-tax/slabs

3. How would they file this income for US taxes (which I hope are the only taxes they'd have to file)?

4. What would be the best way to legally transfer that money back to the US, in terms of conversion rates, tax implications, etc?

personalfinance,Planning Timing for Purchase of Home,"I am 24 years old and have been keeping a close eye on the housing market the past 2 years or so. I'm now in a position where I am considering purchasing a home.

My thought process up until now has always been to avoid PMI at all costs. Now I'm starting to wonder if I should avoid interest rate risk and not wait as long -- I have always planned on renting out the extra rooms, which would far exceed the monthly PMI.

In fact, I'd plan on putting as much roommate income as possible toward extra payments. I know I can't make a financial decision that would ride on this extra income, but my concerns are strictly based on accumulating my down payment. As my first home purchase, I want to pick a reasonable home that isn't ""too much home"".

***

*Here's my financial picture:*

**Area:** Northeast Ohio

**Current Rent:** $825/month currently

##Income

$95,000/year (I have additional 1099 income beyond this as well, but I'm excluding it for the sake of reliable income)

##Debts

**Credit cards:** paid off in full each month.

**Student loans:** none

**Car loan:** balance is just under $1,200 at 0% interest. Milking this for as long as I can - will be paid off by May.

##Retirement

* Maxing out Roth IRA at $5,500 each year
* Contributing max of $18,000 per year to 401(k), pre-tax.

##Liquid Assets

* Have a taxable investment account, currently about $3500 balance - $250/month auto-transferred via ACH.
* $12,500 in checking/savings.

**Net cashflow:** ~ $1300/mo on average over the past year.

***

I am looking at homes between $115,000-$200,000 for now.

I have a credit score of around 775-780.

I want to balance the opportunity costs associated with different down payment amounts and time to save up.

I am strongly leaning toward a 15 year or 20 year mortgage (the monthly payment does not concern me).

The main things that seem important to me are interest rate risk as the federal has more rate hikes throughout the year, balancing the interest rate premium associated with high LTV, and keeping in mind I can offset PMI and make additional payments with either spare cash flow or income from having roommates.

Thanks for your thoughts, /r/personalfinance!

**Edit:** to be more explicit, should I opt for 5% down, 10% down, or 20% down, with the time required to save for those down payment amounts for a house between 150-200k and given the interest rate risk of waiting that long and the interest rate premium applied to high LTV loans?",finance,1451839663
personalfinance,My income is about to rise by 20k. Help me prioritize what to do and choose retirement funds.,"Hi all!

Throw away account for obvious reasons.  Just got offered a job that I will begin in late January, and my income will be going from 42k to 62k.  I am a 26 year old female and my general goals are (in no particular order): (1) pay off my student loans ASAP (2) save for retirement (3) have a healthy emergency fund (4) start saving for a downpayment for a condo - my goal is to be a property owner by my early 30s. 

**1. Student loans:**
 
My current balance is: $17,738.80, with the following breakdown (amount, interest rate):

* $3,409.36, 4.5%

* $4276.71, 5%

* $3,558.91, 5.6%

* $2,941.70, 6%

* $3,551.92, 6.8%

**2. Retirement accounts:**

I have a Vanguard Roth IRA with a balance of $1,936.18.  This is all invested in Target Retirement 2060.

I also have a 403(b) account with a balance of $24,418.54.  This is in an account that's managed by Fidelity, but again it's all invested in Vanguard's Target Retirement 2060. 

Just got my Fidelity Packet for my new job: the new company ""will match 100% of each dollar you contribute on the first 5% of pay that you contribute.  In addition, a retirement contribution of 5% of your compensation will be contributed to your retirement account every bi-weekly pay period"".  &lt;-- if I am reading this correctly, they are by default taking 5% of my paycheck OR is this an additional 5% of free money? In my offer letter it's worded as ""in addition, XX makes a 5% retirement
contribution to your 401(k), whether or not you make your own contributions. XX retirement contributions are 100% vested as soon as they are made.""  

Here are the funds I have as options (name of fund, expense ratio) let me know if more info should be included:
 
* Northern Trust Collective S&amp;P 500 Index Fund - DC - Non Lending - Tier Four, 0.015%

* Vanguard Institutional Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares, 0.02%

* T. Rowe Price Institutional Small-Cap Stock Fund, 0.67%

* Northern Trust Collective Russell 2000 Index Fund - DC - Non-Lending - Tier Four, 0.03%

* Harris Associates Oakmark Global Collective Fund, 0.8%

* Northern Trust Collective All Country World (ACWI) ex-US Fund - DC - Non-Lending - Tier Four, 0.065%

* Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund Class I, 0.87%

* Vanguard REIT Index Fund Institutional Shares, 0.1%

* Janus Balanced Fund Class N, 0.58%

* Company Stock, 0.006%

I don't know much about choosing funds, so this is **probably where I need the most help**.  I'm not really sure what's important to watch out for aside from expense ratio and general allocation, but not really sure what the allocations I should be looking for.  From my reading here on PF, maybe these options I have are not great, but still need to contribute to get the match.

I am planning on rolling over my Roth 403(b) to my Vanguard Roth IRA.

**3. Emergency Fund:**

I recently had a lot of random emergency things come up, so my EF went from ~8k to 4k.  I know my first priority should be to bring this up, and I plan to bring it up to 10k. 

**4. Saving for a downpayment**

Currently non-existent.

I know I should contribute enough to get the company match, but after that, should I prioritize retirement or student loans?  Is it realistic to expect to be able to buy a condo by age 30?  Any and all advice would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance for all your help!! I come from a poor family and have no one to ask for advice, so this community has provided invaluable support and advice!!  Not only was I the first in my family to graduate from college, I was also the first to get a retirement account! ;)

Now - http://imgur.com/a/p1L8B
In Progress - http://imgur.com/a/vI8ok 

My friend suggested that I post this to the internet!

We have been a bit sceptical about posting, but my wife and I are finally comfortable enough where we can now show our Man/Woman Cave!

We started this project from a bare room almost 1.5 years ago. 

It’s been hard work, and a lot of effort. Unfortunately, there are still things that we are not happy with, and as we go into the New Year, time will be precious so we will have to fit things in around life. 

A list of our set up;

**Computer 1 – Top Left**

AMD Sabretooth 990FX  
AMD 8350 FX
32 GB Kingston ECC 1300
2 x Intel 1GB Interfaces 
120 GB SSD – ISO repository and OS (Xen Server)
2 x 2TB WD Red – Raid 1

This is used as a virtual server. Its uses are 
1 x server 2012 - ADDS
3 x Minecraft servers (2 x Windows 7 &amp; 1 Ubuntu)
2 x Terraria Servers – windows based
2 x Ubuntu Servers – Backup 2 x external email servers
1 x Debian Server – Stuff
Probably some more minor ones.

(Incoming 2 x 8TB WD as Raid 1 for more media and as a capture device for my gaming, and will use a VM to file share as I cannot fit any more drives in the following machine)

**Computer 2 – Top Right**

AMD Sabretooth 990FX
AMD 4100 FX
8 GB Ripjaws 1600
2 x Intel 1GB Interfaces
120 850 EVO 
2 x 2TB WD Red Raid 1
2 x 2TB WD Red Raid 1
2 x 3TB WD Red Raid 1
2 x 4TB WD Red Raid 1

This is used as an active Plex server which I have a few family members and friends that log in. The processor is getting a bit dated for transcoding, but I can still have about 5-6 people viewing files at the same time with no lag on the system, or internet. 

**Computer 3 – Pink/middle**

This is my wife’s machine, if you couldn’t guess! 
Its only got a AMD 1090T 6 Core – 8GB Ram – 120GB Samsung 850 + 1 TB WD Black – ATI 5850

**Computer 4 – Bottom Machine**

This is my personal machine. 
Its running a Sabretooth Z77 – i7 3770K @ 4.5 – 16 GB Ram – 2 x 120GB Intel SSDs Raid 0 – 1 x 1TB WD Black for Games – 1 x 1TB WD Black for VHDs (Virtual Box and VMWare Player) – AMD 7970 HD Ghz Edition Vapour – X OC 3GB

We run mainly Razer peripherals (BW Ultimate Stealth’s, Mamba and Nagas), with the exception of Hyper-X 2 headsets. 

**Computer 5 – Off site**

I have another machine almost identical to Computer 1, but with the capacity close to Computer 2, which sits at my business, as an offsite backup. Family members use this with Owncloud and keep their images “safe”, well better than them not backing them up!

**Network**

With all of our internet needs, we run 2 x fibre lines to the house, with static IPs. These are then fed into a PFSense box, and then bridged together. On multiple files I get about 152Mbit/38Mbit. Translated this is about 19 MBs down and 4.75 MBs up. 

Once it leaves the PFS it then comes into a Zyxel GS1910-24 switch. The wireless is fed by an Ubiquiti UniFi AP-AC v2. 

**Station in front of window**

This is where I work on client’s/friends machines, and testing. The left monitor is fed from underneath cables, and the right monitor is fed from the test bench to the right. 

**Consoles**

I think the images explain themselves! Both the PS4 and Xbone have upgraded HDDs and both have 2TB of space. 

Every console works and displays output onto the screen, in the consoles best format, with the many connecting devices. Just cables and equipment to show is cost in the region of £350 

We have the Logitech G920 and G29 with a pretty cool stand. We chose this one for space reasons. Inside the black foot rest is where we keep most of the current gen controllers. The other controllers are in the top two tiers of each side in the cotton boxes.

We have more games than we can shake a huge stick at.

Everything is individually switched, and none of the outlets have switches on them. Each two “cubes” are controlled by one switch.

All the consoles can go through the Hauppauge HD PVR 2 Gaming edition – Tested and works.

The children have their own area in the living room, with the HTPC, Wii U and PS4. 
We have many handheld consoles.

**Plans**

There are LEDs in place hidden from view, that glow the whole room RGB. This is not complete yet, as they keep falling down and I haven’t had a chance to Hot glue them all in place.

Create “Y” cables for the Hauppauge HD PVR 2

Complete the “server” cupboard for better extraction of heat

Make a bespoke desk in front of the window to maximise work space, as once the cupboard gets a door, the left set of drawers will have to move. 

The above will tie in with raising the height of the window, and make the window smaller.

Creating a new area in the garden approx. 7 x 6 meters. This will become a workshop, and a new area for old PCs based gaming systems.

For reference, all figures are in Australian Dollars (0.73 to USD / 0.67 to EUR at the time of posting).


**1\. Personal Information**

Background: I am male, 28 years old and single.

I have worked for the past two years in a finance job in Sydney - specifically, asset management. I have recently changed roles to a larger bank and wanted to take a moment to assess my financial situation. In my opinion, my financial position is quite sound. I have written this post to see if anybody has anything helpful to add to my plans, and also so that others can see the way that I break-down my savings/expenses - I always like to look at what other people are doing because most of my friends won’t discuss money.

I would be grateful for any answers to any of the questions at the end of this post, or for any other comments (general or specific). 

**2\. Current Position (‘Net Wealth’)**

**2.1 Investment Property**

I bought an investment property in 2014 for $640,000, with a deposit of $128,000 and an 80% LVR mortgage of $512,000. Eighty percent of the mortgage is fixed at 4.72% until July 2016, and the remaining twenty percent is on a variable rate, currently 4.75%. 

Total mortgage repayments are currently $1,984 per month. I have an interest-only loan, not repaying any principal at this time. I have an offset account attached to the variable component of the mortgage, but I am not currently depositing savings into this account. The mortgage on this property is my only ongoing debt.

The property is rented at $2,511 per month. Tenants pay all utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet).

Additional expenses for me are are owners corporation fees ~ $250 per month, landlord’s insurance ~ $50 per month and council rates ~ $90 per month. I also budget $50 per month for repairs (not much required, so far). Total expenses are $440 per month, so I have a net gain of ~ $90 per month.

My goal is for this property to ‘break-even’ or make a small profit. The property is in a desirable area ( &lt;10km from Sydney CBD) and I expect to benefit from capital gains over the coming years. I manage the property myself without an agent.

**2.2 Equities**

At the moment, I am directing my savings each month into an exchange traded fund ('ETF') - S&amp;P500 - ASX:IVV. Buying this ETF effectively invests my money in the S&amp;P500 with a low management fee and an exposure to fluctuations in the AUD:USD exchange rate (AUD goes down, the value of my securities goes up). I have about $30,000 invested there at the moment. There is a small dividend of approximately 1% per annum, but I am generally invested here for the prospect of capital growth. 

Due to the industry that I work in, I need to seek ‘clearance’ in order buy/sell shares. Buying and selling individual shares is tricky. ETFs or broader indices are generally considered to be acceptable. 

**2.3 Superannuation**

I currently have a balance of ~ $35,000 in my superannuation account (retirement savings) invested 100% in foreign shares.

**3\. Consumer Debt / Student Loans**

I do not have any ongoing consumer debt other than the credit cards described above, and I do not have any outstanding student loans.

**4\. Banking**

I am currently banking across a few different platforms, and this may be an area that I could consolidate or improve on. 

1. Commonwealth Bank - My ‘main bank’. I have my general day-to-day cheque account (into which my salary is deposited on a monthly basis). I also have an online savings account, not currently holding any money in that account because I think there are better returns elsewhere (deposit interest rate ~ 3%). I have a CDIA account to connect with my CommSec trading account.

2. Westpac - Mortgage and offset accounts described above. I also have a credit card issued by Westpac (applying for it reduced the interest rate on my mortgage), which I do not currently use it all.

3. Woolworths/Qantas Platinum Credit Card (issued by Macquarie Bank) - ‘Main Credit Card’ with $12,500 limit. One-for-one Qantas points for first $2,500 spent on this card.

4. Citibank - ‘Travel Debit Card’ - I deposit money into this account when I travel. No transaction fees on purchases or ATM withdrawals.

5. 28 Degrees - ‘Travel Credit Card’ with $1,000 limit. My travel emergency card card - Used to have free overseas transactions, but policy changed a couple of years ago. 

Since I pay off my credit cards as they fall due, I consider my consumer-debt to be ‘zero’ (even though I often carry a balance of $500 - $2,000 at any given time). 

**5\. Income and Expenses**

**5.1 Income**

I earn a monthly salary of $9,583 (or $115,000 per annum) gross (before tax). This amount includes the compulsory employer superannuation contribution of 9.5% and PAYG income tax. For those playing from another country, superannuation is the name for our compulsory retirement savings program in Australia. Compulsory employer superannuation contributions are taxed at 15%, so I will see about $12,100 in my account at the end of the year (including superannuation on my bonus).

In addition, I expect to receive a cash bonus of between 25% of my salary (approx. $30,000) to 35% of my salary (approx. $40,000) at the begginning of next year (before tax).

Therefore, my net salary (after tax) during the year is $6,337 per month, and I expect to receive a lump sum bonus of ~ $24,000 (after tax) at the beginning of next year.

Over time, I expect my salary to increase significantly from this point. On my current career path, my salary should double over the next 4 or 5 years. After that, things become a bit more uncertain.

For the sake of this analysis, I will ignore capital gains and net rental income. 

**5.2 Expenses**

Here is my current budget. It includes ‘everything’ that I plan to spend money on this year, including holidays and new phones/computers, etc. I aim to track every single expense and categorise it into the list below (I use 'expense manager' for android). It is highly unlikely that I will arrive anywhere near the ‘total’ figure for expenses. Likely to be ~ 20% lower based on past experiences, but I am trying to spend more in some areas (for example, on clothing) to reflect a more balanced savings plan.

**5.3 Savings**

- Savings rate = $889 per month / $10,668 per year
- Plus bonus at beginning of next year = $24,000
- Plus superannuation (retirement savings), after 15% tax = $12,100 per year
- **Total annual savings = $46,768**

**5.4 Discussion of Expenses**

Now, here is the part I find tricky. I am trying to balance a few competing priorities:

*Investing*: I come from a ‘conservative’ financial background that encourages saving and investment. I want to continue to save and invest a significant proportion of my income (in addition to the 9.5% of my salary that automatically goes into my superannuation account for retirement). With this budget, I will ‘save’ about 50% of my net income if you add back in the balance of my superannuation account.

*Superannuation/Retirement*: I do not currently make voluntary additional superannuation contributions. Two reasons: (a) I believe there to be considerable uncertainty surrounding the ‘rules’ of superannuation tax concessions - I am certain the rules will change before I am ‘due’ to retire in ~ 30+ years; (b) I might want to access my savings sooner in order to buy a home, study or travel. 

*Enjoying Late 20s* : I am a single guy and I like to go out on the town to meet people. I don’t particularly enjoy alcohol, but I do like going out for a big party every two months or so. In order to save for my investment property, I tracked expenses meticulously and made some sacrifices (eg, no coffees or lunches out, only replacing clothes when genuinely not wearable). This year, I have relaxed my budget A LOT. There is plenty of room to ‘tighten the belt’. But I am aiming for a balance - not trying to win the highest savings rate competition or retire at 35.

*Study/Travel*: I will probably take a career break at some point in the next 5 to 10 years to study or travel for a year or more.

**6\. Questions for the Personal Finance gurus**

1. What do you think of this budget? Do you think it is balanced? Yes, I know there are many areas that I could tighten up, but that is not my goal at the moment.

2. Do you think there is anything that I have not accounted for that should be accounted for?

3. Do you have any views or ‘rules of thumb’ for the proportion of income to be spent on casual clothes and work clothes? I don’t enjoy shopping and I am trying to force myself to pay a bit more attention to my appearance for social and professional reasons. Do you think I have budged too much or too little to this area?

4. I am contemplating increasing the rent on my investment property by 3% each year. Since I don’t use an agent, I am basing this decision off anecdotal evidence from a few acquaintances. Is this the right thing to do?

5. Are any young people (under the age of 35) in Australia, making voluntary superannuation contributions? If so, could you please explain your reasoning?

6. For Australians that own an investment property, are you contributing money into your mortgage (thereby reducing your interest expense over time, and the tax deductions available for interest expenses) or making investments in stocks?

I'm a casual PF redditor who has $6000 to invest short term (I will need the money in ~10 months time). I have been reading into the following options:
1. Savings account (yield ~1% @ ally's or barclays, possible capitalone startup getting $100-$500 one time reward and 0.75%)
2. Vanguard index fund- honestly know very little but know that this subreddit &lt;3's the vanguard index funds.
3. Certificate of deposit (~.9- 1%)= ~$30 for period of investment

From what I understand the ""best"" option is actually a savings account if it has a start-up bonus (keep money in for 30-90 days and receive somewhere from $100 to $500) on top of the interest rate. I am not very familiar with the costs to buy vanguard fund nor the return gains and thus would love if someone fills me in on that. If there is any other option I am overlooking pls let me know :)

Bitcoin,"We should not be taxed in units of a currency on which is printed ""in god we trust"", nor in any currency which has ever been a religious movement. Please choose a different store of value to tax.","Separation of church and state. What more need I say? I dont personally find it that offensive, more of a curiosity of like how people saw god in lightning strikes and now see in the galaxies far away (while I think of it more as the sum of all possible shapes and patterns), but maybe it has been overlooked that I have been commanded to increase my perception of value of a social movement which subtley and nonaggressively prints the advertisement for authoritarian religion in general (god above, instead of we could all be equals none above or below), and I do take offense that I must connect my perception of value to an advertisement that I must trust such authority of ""god"", or that I must use such currency that has in the past been of a religious nature however small, and I ask that people separate church and state by not taxing me in dollars and instead in some other nonreligous currency which has been that way from the start. Since I have not met this vision of god referred to, one life form unified, I would not know if I should trust or not or what interaction I may be interested in. I do not believe the universe is so centralized that any set of reality could be accurately described that way, though I do think there are so far unimaginable things out there. Since I define money as ""tradable perception of value"", I request further separation of church and state by not taxing in units of any currency which has ever, for many years in this case, been attached to any religious advertisement.

I realize this would reduce the market value of federal reserve's claimed assets, being the people in their religious organization, but I dont think everyone opted in to that.

We owe something about god? Money is free speech. Is speech taxable? Werent monopolies illegal? When did that change?

Why would I have to trust god, as the dollars say? We are all gods, at least in potential, in a physically real way like in the curves of the field some shape.

Even if people dont so much care about the religious advertisement, it is a violation of contract by federal reserve, that contract being, in USA at least, the constitution which says congress can regulate the value of money and we have freedom of religion. Maybe some people arent of the religion named on the money they are taxed, that being the trust of monotheism and it being connected with the military industrial complex in excessive ways.",cryptocurrency,1451852711

personalfinance,"$20k signing bonus - pay off student loans, max out Roth IRA, or save for a home in the future?","Hi there!  I'm looking to get some opinions and reasoning for two different options on what to do with a signing bonus I got for a recent job.  I already have a fairly sizeable emergency fund, so we can skip that discussion :)

I'm trying to decide between three options, as specified in the title.

My student loans are all Stafford loans (gov't loans) in the current amount of ~$17k at a bit over 6% APR.  I haven't refinanced them as it would increase my interest rate.  I also have a car loan at $17k, but the interest rate is under 2%, so I'm not overly concerned about it.

A reasonable home (very small house or a small townhome/condo) in my area costs around $400k currently, and has been going up by double digit percentages for the past decade or so.  Not sure if it's a bubble - I think there's just a lot of demand.

Since my student loans have such a high interest rate, I've been focusing on paying those off rather than contributing to an IRA, as a 6% guaranteed RoR is pretty good.  So I could also put the max for 2015 and 2016 into my Roth IRA if I so chose.

For details, I'm 25, in good health, and with very good employment prospects if something were to happen with my current job.

Would love to hear other people's opinions on what best to do with this medium-sized windfall.

As a sidenote - always negotiate your job offers.  I got a $20k signing bonus just by asking for it.  It may not be so dramatic for everyone, but you can always negotiate.

personalfinance,"What to do now that I've realized I can't improve my $180,000 law school loan situation","I know the basic answers and I've tried them. Consolidation does nothing to fix the fact that I've got a pair of 8.25% interest loans festering on my balance sheet, pulling up the interest rate of anything I try to consolidate with them. Although I work as an attorney, I make less than $40,000 per year as a solo attorney...which wasn't my first choice of career, but law jobs are still hard to come by. Graduating in 2011 from a school with an absolutely useless career service office put me behind the 8 ball before I even got my bar license, so none of the private refinance companies are interested in buying my debt. 

More basics are that I'm on a 30 year repayment with all of my loans. If I tried a shorter term, I would default immediately. As of right now, I have never missed a payment, but debt is about the only thing my money goes toward (I get pretty far on exactly one suit). I live with my parents, work from home, have a mid-range car that I've leased and literally cannot do my job without, and spend about $300 per month on things other than debt or required insurances, like gas and clothing. Student loan debt costs me $1450 per month.

The only other idea I've had is to go on income based repayment, which has a lot of downsides in the long run. This seems like the most obvious thing to do, but I know that it's just a time bomb. I wouldn't even cover the interest on my loans with that type of payment structure. The balance would swell up and I'd wind up on the hook for almost half a million dollars in ""forgiven"" debt that gets treated as earned income. I will never be able to pay that, so bankruptcy and tax penalties in the future are inevitable with this plan.

I'm here because I'm out of hope. It's been almost five years and not a week goes by that I don't feel like kicking myself for not committing suicide after graduation. I have no cosigners on my loans. They would just go away if I died. After graduation would have been the time since I still lived on my own and had somewhat alienated myself from the friends I had outside of law school. I could have avoided all this misery if I'd just had the guts to go through with it back then. Now I'm stuck. People got attached to me again, so I'm expected to keep trudging along.

I know that the obvious solution to this is to take a nap in my running car with the garage door closed, but I still can't get the courage to do that. My situation looks completely hopeless and has for years, but I need to know I'm right about that before I try explaining to the people around me why giving up is the best choice.",finance,1451863677

personalfinance,Monthly Expenses husband/wife,"Good morning,
People talk about savings rate and income and what not.

What are people's average total monthly expenditures on here.
My wife and I have been doing the Math for last year.
All expenses came to about $1,700 to $1,800 on average per month in 2015.

Going to try to cut this to €1,500 per month for the year ahead.

A short breakdown per month-
Rent- $180 low-interest due to a large deposit down
Food/Shopping- $500
Bills- $ 200
Other CC expenses- $ 300(always pay in full)
Transportation- 100$
Insurance and Healthcare- $ 200
Other/ Extras/ life-  $ 320
Total-  $1,800
This was about our average expenditure in 2015 as I said. 

Total Income between us in 2016 will be about $40,000 after tax and some deductions.
(This may rise to about $45,000 if we get lucky with extra work- but want to work off the 40k for this)

That would leave about..  $20,000 in savings for a year. 
($2,000 will magically disappear no doubt)

How do all these figures match up to others then? 

Some more info- Mid 30's.
Living in Seoul, Korea.
We have an Emergency Fund for about 3 months of living and have about $80,000 in total assets (cash) most of which $65,000 is used as the deposit on the home we live in. $10,000 is in high enough savings accounts @ about 6%.
We can live in our current place with the low interest rate due to a government incentive to save for a max of 6 more years. Will consider buying at that stage.

No real retirement funds or anything else other than what we have saved up which is a concern.

Would love to hear some feedback on all this..
Thank You.",finance,1451871327
personalfinance,Pay down mortgage or pay down school loans first?,"I'm 35....in the process of having a house built. I move in June. House was appraised at around $445k. When I move in, I'll owe about $259k on mortgage (with 3.75% interest rate on 10 year ARM). Thus, I'll have about $180k in equity.

I also have 135k in school loans (law school) at 4.675 percent. I'm not using the degree right now. My payment now is $550 and will balloon up to $1,300 or so in 15 years. In other words, it's going to take 25 years to pay this off.

Retirement....I have about $125k in pre-tax investments. I normally contribute max to that per year (around $30k). I have no credit card debt. I have about $65k in bank account (I guess you could call this emergency fund).

I make about $150-200k a year (I own a business). I kind of fell into this business 10 years ago and have stuck with it (which is why I'm not practicing law) because of the money. That being said, businesses can fail at anytime so I don't necessarily have the job security.....at least not the security that I will always be making $200k/year. 

Brings me to my question...I normally have $30-50k at end of year to spend. Do I pay down the mortgage or pay down school loans? Personally....I feel I should pay down the mortgage. This is because it basically is money in the bank (house will never sell for less than $450-500k based on market here). I like to imagine worst case scenario. If my income falls quick to $75k year....my mortgage is paid down enough that I can still afford it and I still basically have several hundred grand in equity once it's paid off (or I can sell house and get most of my equity back). However, what if I pay my school loan off and then something happens and I can't pay mortgage...then my house and equity is gone. Worst thing that can happen if you fail to pay school loan is they garnish your wages (and I'm self employed so they can't) or put a lien on house (which doesn't matter if I live in this house forever). Yes, my credit would be shot....but I already have a mortgage (which is why most ppl need good credit).

Thoughts? This would be different if I only owed like $50k on school loans (as then I'd just pay those off quick)...but $135k isn't going to be paid anytime soon. Same with retirement...if I had none, obviously that would be a priority....but I am already putting a lot in there.",finance,1451881747
personalfinance,Still Trying to Figure This Interest Rate Thing Out..... Specifically Chase CC. Any Help? (Credit),"First time posting /r/personalfinance and just wanted to say some interesting/insightful shit on here! So thank you for that!

On to my current situation and I was hoping for some help from anyone on here?!

It has been months and months of continuous reading/studying for me to try to better understand interest rates and how they are applied to credit cards.. Online articles, Reddit posts, Youtube videos, cardholder agreement statements, etc.. I'm just not getting it. I would by no means consider myself stupid or uneducated but I feel that I've looked to deep into it which has made me brain fart/check out and now in dire need of some quality Reddit assistance. 

Never have had issues with any of my credit cards in regards to paying the balance in full from the most recent balance statement by the required due date. What I am currently having any trouble with is understanding the process of how Chase will be applying interest on my Sapphire Card. From what I understand (since the beginning) is that there would never be any 0% APR period while owning this card and it's statement balance is expected to be paid in FULL by the due date. So here's where I am at:

- Dec. 17, 2015 statement balance: $1,809.00
- Due Date (in full): Jan. 14, 2016
- Next Statement Balance: Jan. 17, 2016

I spent a little more than usual in December for Christmas presents, some travel, get myself some stuff, etc..  due to the fact I was under the impression my raise and yearly bonus was effective by the end of 2015 but shit... Found out I won't be getting it until Jan. 15 -_- (one fucking day after the balance due date.. bs). As of now, I've put $700 towards the balance and plan on putting about $400 more towards it before the due date. Thus:

$1,809.00 - $1,100.00 = $709.00 remaining on the actual amount put towards the original statement balance. 

From here... I just don't where the hell to go! I'm under the impression that since my APR on this card is 24.99%.. So I simply multiplied: $709.00 x .2499 = $177.18 (interest applied to remaining balance?)

Does this mean that my next balance will be $886.18? Or am I going to be accruing daily interest until I pay that balance off? Will I be getting charged interest on any purchases made before that balance is paid? 

I do all my banking through Chase, I've never had any late payments/interest charges, and overall a good relationship with them but anytime I call to get an explanation about the interest charge, I'm basically just told either ""just pay the balance in full..."" or some complex mumbo jumbo I don't feel like listening to over the phone. 

So if any awesome person on here is able to give me a ""4th - 5th Grade Level"" breakdown right now, I would truly enjoy that! 6th grade seems a little too difficult as of right now..

personalfinance,[Auto] I just bought a new car and was able to negotiate a lower price than what TrueCar recommended,"**tl;dr** I got a honda pilot for $500 under TrueCar's target price with some add-ons thrown in all by walking away a few times.

**BACKSTORY:** My wife and I just bought a 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L with a couple of minor additions. Pilots have been flying off the lot and most dealerships are pre-selling them.

The specific Pilot we were looking at had a retail price of $39,090 including add-ons and we were able to get them down to $37,350 with a $550 package for mats, etc. thrown in free, 0% down and 1.99% interest rate.

Negotiation was tough because there are no other Honda dealerships for 2-3 hours and stock is extremely low.

How we made it happen:
First, we went into a dealership at 6 o'clock on a Tuesday night when the weather was terrible, there was no one else around and we test drove the pilot getting the sales rep's full attention.

Two days(23rd of Dec) later I called in to see if they had the one we wanted in stock, which they didn't but it was set to arrive within a day. We came in and told our sales rep that we wanted to close that day. He said the MSRP for this model was $39,090. I asked what they could do to get the price down because we were willing to sign that day.

He said he could give us a military discount because I'm a veteran which gives $500 off but we have to use Honda Financing - Not an issue. However, that only got us down to $38,590 which was more than we were willing to pay. TrueCar was telling us ~$37,900 was a good deal so I was looking to get there. He asked what we were thinking and I said $35k. He said that wasn't possible but he'd talk to his manager. The manager came back saying $39,090 with a $500 veterans discount. I told him thanks and if anything changes to give me a call and that we were leaving.

You could feel the sales manager and all of the sales reps' eyes burning a hole in our back but we left confident that they'd contact us.

That evening [he reached out via text](http://imgur.com/LyGP1Rw) and said that they could give us $1k off MSRP but now lower. That was $38,090 so we said no again.

**THE NEXT DAY:**
He [reaches out to us again](http://imgur.com/uzakbME) saying that he can go lower but it has to be in the $37,XXX. I then told him we'd do $37,350 with them paying DMV fees or $37,250 with us paying. He told us he could do it. At that point, we caved and went into the dealership.

**DEALERSHIP:**
Once there, he had all of the paperwork ready. We moved quickly and got to the finance rep who told that Honda was offering 3.99% which we had to use because the $500 military discount was wrapped up in that. I told him that % was unreasonable and that after talking to other Honda dealerships(which I did) folks were getting much better rates. He said that was the best unless we went outside of Honda which meant we lost the $500 military discount. I told him that USAA was offering a rate of 2.5%(that was a lie, I could only get 3.5% from USAA) and if they couldn't beat that that I'd use USAA. I asked him to run the #'s and let us know.

He quickly ran the #'s and came back to us w/ 1.99%  with 0% down but the military discount was gone. I'd set that anchor in my mind so there was no way I was giving that up. The finance guy made a mistake and moved the $500 discount away from a military discount and put it in the standard discount. Also, all of the addons they offered we passed on.

We shook hands on that because we were at $37,350. Next, we signed papers. We make it all the way through and on the last paper to sign it said ""There are no add-ons included"" which was wrong. Our sales guy had promised us a $550 pro-pack thing but it wasn't here on the paper. He said that that had been removed to get our price down to where it was. I told him we would walk unless it was included. Of course, they threw it in.

**LOOKING BACK:**
I'm not sure there's much more than we could have gotten out of these guys. TrueCar puts our price down in the ""Very Good"" category, I got a $550 add-on for nothing and only spent about 2-3 hours at a dealership. 

I'm happy to answer any questions folks have because if you're willing to be patient(which I generally am not) you're definitely able to get a huge discount on a car. 4% may not seem like much but I was buying a car that's in huge demand.",finance,1451885453

personalfinance,Advice on tuition repayment,"Hello there. I finished grad school a year ago and I could use some serious advise on how to tackle loan repayment. I met with a CPA in the small town that I live in, and he couldn't offer any advice for me since he doesn't have many college grads for clients. I'm hoping I can provide a little bit of my details and maybe someone could give me directions.

* I work as a physician assistant for a 501c3 not for profit hospital system, and make $95k / year

* I owe $190k in tuition, all federal loans at 6.5% average

* My wife also works for a 501c3 not for profit organization, and makes $45k / year

* She owes $100k in tuition, $50k of which is federal loans at 6.5%. The rest are private

* We have one newborn child
 

My initial thoughts were to consolidate my loans, apply for income-based repayment, and then apply for Public Service Loan Forgiveness to hopefully wipe out remaining debt after 10 years. However, according to the calculator on the fed's website, it states that IBR would have me do 220 months starting at monthly payments of $1000, and ending at payments of $2000, of which I'd end up paying $330k total with zero dollars forgiven. I have no idea if this is a mistake in the calculation, or what... but needless to stay I'm feeling pretty bummed out about this.
 

Can anyone provide any sort of recommendation about what they would do if they were in my shoes? I feel like between my wife and I, we'll be paying debt for the rest of our lives. :( In the meantime, I'm going to try to hunt down a different CPA, but would be sincerely grateful for any advice if anyone else is or has been in this situation.",finance,1451887629

I have around $5-7.5k that I definitely will not need for the next 6-10 years. I will most likely be in grad school then, though it is possible that I never will end up going to gradschool. I cannot invest in any common stock or bonds other than US treasury bonds. 

What do you think I should do with this money in a mean time? I don't know if it is safe to invest in a S&amp;P 500 index because the market has been very bullish and I am afraid we may have a similar year 2000 with all these tech company that I think are overvalued.

I don't want to put my money in a CD because I will be losing potential money as the fed raises rates and my money is total stuck in this fixed-rate CD. 

$7.5k compounded annually at 9.6% over 8 years would probably pay for a semester of gradschool which would be nice. 

I am also going to assume that in 2 years I will be able to add $1k, 3 years: 2k, 4 years: 3k, 5 years: 4k. (pretax, but I will probably put this in an IRA Roth because  summer jobs while in grad school earn more than summer undergrads, generally. I can take 10k out, right? For rent?)

personalfinance,"New job, 46k gross, 67k in student loans","Recently graduated and I have finished onboarding for my new job and will begin in two week's time. An overview:

I have 67k in federal student loans at 5.8%. According to the federal website, a standard plan makes that $750/month for 10 years. Naturally, I would like to be aggressive and finish much sooner, but being this is my only debt, it's very comforting to know there's a finish line. I will be working in NC, where, through my calculations I will be clearing about 1250 per check (bi-weekly) after taxes. If I choose to max out my matched 401k that would entail an 8% investment from my gross pay with 50 cents on the dollar from the employer. After that, I will clear about 1,100 if my calculations are correct.

My other expenses are simply phone and food as my employer provides a vehicle and insurance, and I will be moving in with family, removing rent from the equation. That said,I have researched the location and have found studios for $625. 

My goals are to save enough for an engagement ring (~7.5k would be lovely), aggressively pay my loans, and also put money in my spending account as well as my emergency fund (currently have 1000 in a money market account that I will not touch unless dire circumstances). 

My main inquiry is into the priorities of it all. Naturally I want to throw every dollar at my loans. Logistically, I can afford to pay twice my loan payment and pay it off in half the time. But that seems like it would slow down my savings (both personal and emergency) to a halt. I would love to hear what you all would do if you were in my position! 

To note, should it come up, I am very much in love with the girl I would like to purchase the ring for. $7.5k is merely a number I would like to set for myself, as she would be happy with much less. However, as any man, I would really like to afford something special for her.

Here's the story, Early 2014, I deposited $2500 into the bank so they can open a credit card for me to use to build my credit, this was on Jan 21, 2014 according to Credit Karma..  With that account, it stated that the 'account was closed by consumer' On Mar, 2015 which also seems about right, all of it's details such as highest balance all sound about right.

Here's the problem, according to Credit Karma, it stated that there is a second credit card that was opened on the same date as the previous one(Jan 21, 2014) BUT it was closed on August 22, 2014 with the remark 'Credit card lost or stolen'..   On the detail, it stated that the account also have $2500 credit but it was never used as the highest ever balance is $0.

Not really sure who I should contact about this so I'm here for some help. I know it's been a while since I open/closed the credit card account as it wouldn't really affect my credit in the future  but it's bugging me a little bit..

personalfinance,"""New"" windfall of Stocks. What to do with them?","Hi folks.  I am very fortunate to have the following “problem”, and would appreciate some insight. 

*The long and short of it is* (1) I have ~$250,000 in individual stock sitting in a brokerage account at Vanguard and I don’t know what to do with it and (2) we are expecting an $80,000 bonus (gross; probably $50,000 net of taxes) later this year and don’t know what to do with it either.


##Personal Background:

My wife and I are in our early 30s with professional degrees.  We have a 1 year old in daycare, but are on the fence about having any more kids.  Both of our families are well enough off, so there is no immediate concern about having to support aging parents, etc.

 
##Financial Background: 

My wife and I make $176,000+ net ($300,000+ gross).  We max out our 401(k)s, both make a full backdoor Roth IRA contribution, and invest another $24,000 in a brokerage account.  This comes to $71,000 in annual investments.  All of these investments are into Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 Fund, or if not available, a similarly constructed portfolio using index funds, etc.  We have approximately $120,000 in student loans that are federally backed with a decent interest rate (maybe 5%).  We think we can utilize the [2007 program that forgives any federal student debt](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) in 4 or 5 years to get out from under the remaining balance.

In addition to this brokerage account, we have $104,000 in our 401(k) and Roth IRA accounts, $3,000 in a 529 account, and another brokerage account with $13,000.  I similarly have tried to align these accounts with the Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 Fund (except the 529 account, obviously). 

As to the brokerage account at hand. a parent passed away nearly 20 years ago and left me this chunk of change as part of my inheritance (the rest is tied up in a family partnership).  Until now, it was actively managed and had okay returns.  In the past year or so, I have taken the initiative to have more control over my financial well-being, and in doing so, have drunk the Vanguard/Boglehead Kool-Aid.  To that end, I moved this $250k to Vanguard, where it now sits.

The breakdown of the brokerage holdings are as follows (rounded to nearest integer):

* Stocks          97% (large cap – 93%; mid cap – 7%; small cap – 0%); majority of holdings are in sin stocks

* Bonds           1%

* Money Market         2% (~$6,000)


##Questions:

What should I do with the brokerage account now that it is no longer actively managed?  I do not want to deal with day to day trading of individual stocks and would prefer to hold some sort of fund (index or target date), but am not sure how to navigate moving to such funds without incurring large tax penalties.  I also have some personal objections to holding so much sin stock (oil, gas, tobacco, etc.).  Finally, I am really not comfortable with the distribution of these stocks.  I feel that there is too much weight placed on U.S. large cap stocks. 

What would you recommend we do with the bonus?  I’m not sure it’s worth paying down the school debt immediately in light of the loan forgiveness program.

Am I okay putting so many of my eggs in the Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 Fund basket?  I feel like I should dump every extra penny I have into these funds, but it’s nerve-wracking having such a simple investment plan.",finance,1451937818

I come from a middle class family, so I'm fortunate enough to have my parents paying for my education.  My major is also computer science if that's of any relevance.  
I want to do something with my money so it collects more interest or something.  So far, I've been browsing around reddit and the internet and found that online banks like Capital 360 offer saving accounts with decent interest rates.  Furthermore, from another thread I found, someone recommended in investing in index ETFs that mirror the Nasdaq, Dow, etc.  
I'm not a huge stock expert, so I don't want to individually pick my stocks, so if I do choose to invest in stocks, I believe ETFs would be the way to go.  Basically, I'm just looking for some advice for what to do with my $10,000.

tl;dr  18 year old college kid with $10,000 collecting nothing in the bank.  What do I do with it?",finance,1451945874
btc,"BitSharp, a (very work in progress) C# node","There seems to be lots of healthy interest in alternate clients these days, so I'd like to present a C# bitcoin node that I've been working on off-and-on over the last couple of years. Originally, I wanted to write a little code to help myself understand bitcoin better, and the project has morphed over time into an (aspiring) node from that.

Currently, the project is only really in a prototype state. This is definitely not something usable by end-users, but it might be of interest to other developers. There are huge chunks of functionality not implemented, I've mostly been prototyping ideas around the core architecture. I've mostly settled on that, now.

My documentation is mostly non-existent, and the wiki page is very out of date. But if anyone is interested, ask away and I can answer any questions!

https://github.com/pmlyon/BitSharp

Some goals/features that I currently have implemented:

* No re-indexing
 * Power loss, etc. shouldn't corrupt the chain state
* Merkle tree pruning
 * Fully spent txes are pruned from blocks while preserving the merkle tree
 * should allow for SPV proofs while also pruning (SPV proofs are not currently implemented)
* Wallets fully decoupled from validation
 * Wallets operate by replaying the addition/rolling back of blocks
 * Replay means the wallet is fed transactions with the previous outputs of each input populated
 * Replay will replay re-orgs, a wallet only needs to keep track of its chain tip, and ask to replay to the current state from there
 * Pruning determines how far back blocks can be replayed
* Parellization
 * One of my big goals was to figure out ways to parallelize the node operations, to that end:
 * Validation is done in a pipelined fashion through TPL DataFlow, with parallelization throughout
 * Replay is parallelized, the fetching of all input's previous outputs is done in parallel
* Streaming Validation
 * Blocks are validated in a fully streaming fashion, you validate a header and an IEnumerable of transactions
* Validation Pipeline
 * The validation pipeline looks like so:
 * Block Txes -&gt; Merkle Validator
 * Merkle Validator -&gt; UTXO Pre-fetcher
 * UTXO Pre-fetcher -&gt; UTXO Calculator
 * UTXO Calculator -&gt; UTXO Applier
 * UTXO Calculator -&gt; Block Validator
 * The UTXO Pre-fetcher looks up every UTXO entry that will be needed by a block in a parallelized fashion, which then feeds into the actual UTXO Calculator so that all look-ups are already warmed up when calculating the new state of the UTXO
 * The UTXO Applier writes out changes to the UTXO as they become available from the UTXO Calculator
 * Block validator is where all the usual bitcoin validation rules go, scripts are executed in a fully parallelized fashion
 * Adding a block completes when both UTXO application and block validation are completed
 * Multiple blocks could be validated simultaneously by delaying the UTXO application until after validation, as it is the only operation which writes to the database

Some important notes:

* Only windows is supported, due to my storage layer (unless you want to run the pure in-memory storage layer)
* The windows storage layer I use makes humongous database files. My fully caught up copy of the blockchain consumes 24GB, with merkle pruning enabled.
* I would like to add LevelDB support, but every wrapper I've tried has resulted in memory corruption (I assume I'm using them wrong)
* The node will only leech from the network currently, no data is served back.
* The project really is in a very, very, very alpha state. You'll see reflections of that all over the code base. I knew exactly nothing about bitcoin when this codebase started.
* Anything related to packaging this into a nice and useful product can be assumed to be unimplemented. :)",cryptocurrency,1451946709
personalfinance,Advice on budgeting with variable income from growing small business.,"HI! I am using a throwaway for this post because of the information it contains. I started a business a few months ago that has been growing. I made almost 3k in December and from the business we have lined up it looks like I will be making at least 2k a month and probably closer to 3 in January with increases soon thereafter as we get more clients and business. Here is a breakdown of my income, debt, savings and expenses:
Income:

$2.5k/month from business

Expenses:

Car Loan: $91/month

Carecredit: $106/month

Student Loan: $50/month

Rent/utilities: $420/month

Food: $250/month

Gym: $20/month

Spotify: $9.99/month

Auto Insurance: $68.2/month

Gas: $40/month

Savings:

Cash in the bank-$8500

Debt:

Student Loan (3.6%) $4000

Carecredit: $3,000 (no interest until March 2017, interest at 15% afterwards)

Car Loan: $3900 (1.6%)

I hoped that some of the readers here might have advice for me on where I could save myself money and whether or not I should hold onto my savings or put them to another use, either as an investment or paying off loans. I was waiting to pay off the carecredit until March of 2017 when I plan on doing so in full. I was also going to just pay the minimums on the student loan and car loan because the interest rates are so low and it allows me to have a nice-sized emergency fund.

personalfinance,Has Anyone Looked iIn To How To Legally Purchase A Treasury Security by the US Treasury?,"I always wondered how people ""legally"" purchased a US Treasury security.  Only the Federal Reserve Board can legally purchase a US Treasury security and even then they wouldn't want to.  They would have to buy the treasury pay the fee and the 100% interest rate along with it.  I don't know why the ""Fed"" would ever think about doing it.  Plus any investor or entity out there who thinks they have a US treasury security is flat out wrong and mislead as only the Federal Reserve can legally purchase them and they can't even resell them.

The worst is if you buy the fake things from treasurydirect.gov, they are sold by a scam company called ""Bureau of the Fiscal Service"".  Which may be an official name, but not an official agency as Congress never approved it and the treasury secretary has no authority whatsoever to even create the damn thing.

So hopefully anyone who thought they bought a fake treasury bill should try and see if they can get their money back.  The only real ones are the ones the Federal Reserve Board can buy.",finance,1451950232

I am planning on doing a 9 week boot camp for computer science which costs $10,000. There's a loan option for the interest rate to average 9%. The likelihood of me receiving a job once I finish looks great. Is it worth it to this?

investing,"Why coal stocks such as Arch Coal (ACI) are set to explode in 2017, all thanks to President Obama. (Analysis is a bit long, but worth the read. lol)","What if climate change is a lie? 

Is it truly possible the United States is going to fully transition from fossil fuels to “clean, green energy”? Do we really believe the United States is going to abandon proven fossil fuels, such as coal? Even when the U.S. is commonly referred to as the [“Saudi Arabia of coal”](http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/Energy.html)?

[It has been proven that coal resources in the United States (the entire estimated volume that is within the earth) totals 10 trillion short tons, and would last over 9000 years (!!!) at today’s consumption levels.] (http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HutzlerPowderRiverBasinTestimony.pdf)

Folks, coal isn’t going anywhere for a *long, long, long, time.*

So, what does this have to do with “climate change”?

Well, when in doubt, follow the money.

**Education Industry:**

Barack Obama, a constitutional law professor, has received over $3 million dollars from the University of California/CALPERS ([2008](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638) and [2012](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638)) and over $45 million from the education industry, mostly teachers unions ([2008](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/indus.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638) and [2012](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/indus.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638)) as political contributions.

We also know CALPERS and various teachers unions is [invested](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=ACI+Major+Holders) in coal companies Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) and Peabody Energy (BTU), which both make up over 30% of the coal production in the United States.

**Banking Industry:**

Barack Obama has received over $22 million from investment banking industry ([2008](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/indus.php?cycle=2008&amp;cid=N00009638) and [2012](http://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/indus.php?cycle=2012&amp;id=N00009638)).

Billionaire-banker George Soros has [contributed to the political campaigns](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/soros-donates-15-million-to-pro-obama-pacs/2012/09/27/6c8cb472-08e4-11e2-afff-d6c7f20a83bf_story.html) of Barack Obama AND Hillary Clinton. We also know George Soros [has large stakes](https://www.snl.com/interactiveX/Article.aspx?cdid=A-33567529-11817&amp;FreeAccess=1) in some of the [same coal companies](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/17/the-new-king-coal-george-soros/) as the teachers unions do.

Billionaire-investor Warren Buffett has also contributed to Obama’s campaign, [both](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/09/warren-buffetts-rule-give-big-to-get-obama-re-elected/) in 2008 and 2012. 

Warren Buffett already owns key elements in the supply chain of the coal industry. For example, two of Arch Coal’s (ACI) mines operate in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming ([Mine 1](http://www.archcoal.com/aboutus/coalcreek.aspx) and [Mine 2](http://www.archcoal.com/aboutus/blackthunder.aspx)). The coal from these mines are transported away as part of a joint operation with the rail system Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which is fully owned by — you guessed it — Warren Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway!

Berkshire also [owns](http://www.investingdaily.com/11155/warren-buffett-is-betting-big-on-coal/) MidAmerican Energy, an electric utility that operates 11 coal-fired power plants, four of them located in Wyoming.

Side note: Buffett has allowed Obama to [use his name for political clout](http://whitehouse.blogs.cnn.com/category/warren-buffett/) to sell the public on why they should pay more in taxes (“Buffett Rule”). Still trying to figure out why that one out…

**Now onto Obama’s Coal Plan:**

Since entering office in 2008, Obama has been relentless in his pursuit to shut down the coal industry. Some have even gone so far as to call it a [“War on Coal”](https://gop.com/obamas-war-on-coal-is-official/).

His EPA regulations have [crippled](http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/06/04/coal-industry-utilities-brace-for-epa-carbon-rules/) the coal industry, forcing them to continually implement more technologically efficient processes simply to stay alive.

But Barack Obama and his cronies friends are no dummies. He doesn’t really want to KILL the coal industry. He simply wants to get it down to it’s [last dying breath](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACI&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=0&amp;p=m). 

He knows that whoever the next president is will immediately repeal all his EPA regulations that are hurting the coal industry and its workers across the country. This regulatory relief, over time, will eventually increase coal production in the United States back to pre-Obama levels. This production, along with the efficiency technologies implemented during his presidency, will greatly increase the value of the coal companies thought to be left for dead from regulatory burdens.

The United States has coal resources [worth over $20 trillion dollars](http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HutzlerPowderRiverBasinTestimony.pdf). I don’t care how many climate change [playdates](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations) are held. That kind of money simply doesn’t get left in the earth untouched.

**In Conclusion:**

So, in conclusion, who benefits? I think this arrangement might resemble what is going on. 

• President Obama: Receives campaign donations ==&gt; Use EPA to shut down coal industry
• University of California: Donates to Obama ==&gt; Buy coal stocks at dirt-cheap prices
• Teachers Unions: Donates to Obama ==&gt; Buy coal stocks at dirt-cheap prices
• Bankers: Donates to Obama &amp; help sell policy to public (“Buffet Rule”) ==&gt; Buy coal stocks at dirt-cheap prices (side perk: Warren Buffet gets awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom…[apparently for getting rich, I guess](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-02-15/obama-honors-buffett-george-h-w-bush-with-medal-of-freedom))

[Companies](http://www.rockthecapital.com/02/20/top-1o-american-coal-producing-companies/) such Arch Coal Inc. (ACI), Peabody Energy (BTU), and Cloud Peak Energy (CLD) are all slated to reap HUGE profits after the Obama presidency and in the end, I think this is a concerted effort to snap up these companies at bargain basement prices.

What do you guys think? Have I connected any sort of dots here or do I have my tin-foil hat on too tight on this one? lol

**tl;dr:** President Barack Obama, along with the teachers unions &amp; bankers who helped fund his campaigns, is part of massive global plot under the guise of “climate change” to artificially lower the prices of coal companies by way of federal regulation in order to purchase them at very, very, very low prices. But whether or not you don’t believe my crackpot theory, there’s no denying that [coal will continue to play a VERY large role in the future.](http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/HutzlerPowderRiverBasinTestimony.pdf)",finance,1451977340

**Terror on Moonbase Alpha** - Chapter 51 Part 1
___
___

Kara threw herself forward, through the ragged, jagged, flapping fragments of memories that poured in.  The creatures below, on the Earth's surface had been vicious in their duties, ripping out and sending only the most potent memories, the most pure expressions of raw emotions regardless of context.

In flickering detail she watched a man slip a diamond ring onto a woman's finger, the entire stadium erupting into cheers as she kissed him, tears streaming from her face.  

A little girl smearing her pretty pink dress with paint, tearing at her pageant curls in rage and frustration - her mother staring in horror, bathed in stage light.  

A young man reaching out to his dad, grabbing him, holding him close, begging him not to go. Fighting tears the father kissed his son's forehead, pulled himself away and climbed into his TAK armor before falling into line with his squadron.

Onward she pushed past these and more, flying toward a light that went beyond brilliant, beyond blinding.

Slipping through the light, through the shell, into the core she found herself facing the enormous pulsing, tentacled nexus of energy that was the Overmind.  From all around her, thousands upon thousands of streams of memories were pouring into it and it reveled and gorged itself greedily.

Kara watched as the streams hit home, as the color and vibrant light of the memories were stripped away.  And then, for a moment, everything stopped. The streams ceased, the light dimmed as the being exhaled and released a massive pulsing wave of fluttering, black wisps.  

She pushed her way onward toward the Overmind, trying to ignore the curled and crisp faint images, empty husks of once-treasured memories - a tired, sweat-covered, blood-streaked woman cradling her hard-won newborn, kissing it on its forehead - that flashed past her as she charged the being.

It had been alone.  All this time, for eons and eons it had never met anyone, anything even remotely close.  That means that it had never *fought* anything like her, had never had to defend itself.  Kara thought of her struggles with Mary, who - if the logic held - was closer to this thing than human by the end.  She thought of the woman driven mad by the minds that she'd collected, by the emotions that had consumed her.

Kara was 1 and 0 when facing 'her own kind', whatever that was... and no matter how small that win was on the scale of things, it had to be more than what this creature, this being had ever faced.

At least... she hoped.

Loosing a cry that she doubted would ever be heard, Kara straightened her tentacles forward before her, holding them tight, pushing them outward into the closest thing to a point that she could manage and plunged herself - the entirety of the psychic energy that had once been 'Kara Anderson' - into the crackling, swirling plasma of the Overmind.

Darkness.

The universe swirled around her, stars and planets formed and cooled and warmed and shattered.

But it was there.

It hadn't known where it was, or where it came from, or why it existed.

It knew only one thing, out there, alone, in the emptiness of the void: that it was hungry.

Kara felt the hunger gnawing at her, a primal force that drove it onward, forward, searching, scouring.

A beacon.  Light.  Lights.  A world unlike any that she had ever seen, a planet engulfed in green flame inhabited by quadrupedal creatures that galloped and loped across burning crags and swam through molten stone -- were they even sentient?  She didn't know and it hadn't cared.  It fell upon the planet, it was so small back then, so fragile.  But it found a home and gorged itself, driving its host mad in the process, the other creatures, their long, beaked snouts roaring in fear, the herds of them scattering from it, sensing... sensing that something wasn't right.

It had fed and taken hold of the empty carcass, spending lifetimes on that planet hunting and feeding and spreading and growing.  Taking all that it could, leaving the mindless, savage creatures behind as the last dozen or so bit and scratched and killed each other on that raging, lifeless hill.

Worlds upon worlds, lives upon lives, creatures and beings of all kinds, food and energy to be consumed.

Kara felt the being that would become the Overmind growing around her, as planet after planet fell by the wayside.  Until that one fateful planet, that time that the being had 'awoken'.  

Had 'thought'.

There, amongst the tree-like fungus forests, the dominant life was a simple species of creatures that lived quiet lives.  Their greenish-grey skin drawing energy through the haze from the distant, faint sun.

The being entered these creatures with ease and felt an instant, strange form of kinship with them.  

They shared a basic, telepathic connection and this energy, while not... food... was pleasing.  Through this shared hum they warned each other of threats, laughed at the tickling tassels that grew from the ground, called all together to huddle and share and be one.

The creatures were not afraid of the entity, instead they welcomed the newcomer with great enthusiasm.  As one they invited it to share with them, to live amongst them.

So, for a great while, the being did live amongst them and it shared of their stories - tales of lights beyond the haze, of creatures and threats that soared high above and swooped down and carried off, and listened lazily to the pleasing, soothing, warm hum.

Yet, after a time the lights around them began to dim and the shadows grew long and, eventually, the creatures welcomed it to dream with them through the long, bitter cold night that was soon to come.

And so, as the last mote of light left the world, the creatures piled on one another for warmth and the being joined them and they dreamed together.

But the dreams that they shared were open and full and the entity could not hide who it was there.  They tasted the darkness, saw the planets and the beings and the hunger that had come before and they shrank back, recoiling from it.  

There, amongst the shadows of their dreamscape, only too late, did they see the predator amongst them for what it was. They ran and they hid and they tried to escape but they could not, for the slumber was long and once started, impossible to waken from until the long night had passed.

And the being awoke from its lazy reverie, for it had no need for sleep.   

While the creatures slept, the being remembered that original 'thought' that had once blossomed so brilliantly in its mind and it went to work, this singular 'thought' echoing throughout it as it began to change them, began to remake them.  

The night drew onward, ever onward and the being worked and slaved over every change.  Their shared dreams ran rancid with fear and they slept knowing that the morning would not come for a long, long, long time.

They woke with the first crack of ruddy orange across the horizon, shaking off the layer of ice that had formed over them as they slept.  Standing together, waking as one for the last time, they felt the bonds between them fall away and cried out in sorrow at their first taste of loneliness.  

Helpless, they turned and awaited the first commands from the light-that-soured-dreams.

investing,When does it make sense to open a position on margin?,"So right to the chase, when does it make sense to buy a stock on margin?  To me the answer would be when your expected growth + dividend outpace your margin interest rate, but I would hope that you could invest on margin in order to just get value rather than speculate on large growth positions.

I ask because I'd like to open some positions in a few solid dividend growth stocks but am not optimistic that the combined dividend + growth would be currently be greater than the expected interest rate.  So at that point I feel like I'm just ""renting"" a losing stock and hedging against the possibility of it increasing in price and keeping me from buying in later.  Is that the right way to look at it? In most cases, am I better off not buying anything on margin and using cash when I have it available?  

I just got finished paying off my new car and have some extra cash to put towards investing, but am not sure if I'm better served investing on margin and setting up a larger bi-weekly deposit (how i contribute to this account now) or contributing cash until I have enough to make the purchases I'd like to make.",finance,1452000992
investing,Guess What? We Still Need to Eat — The Case for Investing in Agriculture,"To quote Jim Rogers (as reported in Barron’s, November 16 issue), “I would buy agriculture with both feet, energy with a toe, and watch the others.” Mr. Rogers, an investor extraordinaire and former partner-in-crime to hedge fund manager George Soros, is long the Elements Rogers International Commodity Agriculture (RJA) [an instrument he fashioned], which has lately been flirting with the dramatic low reached at the end of 2008 and thus is quite depressed… If you are a contrarian investor of sorts, it’s got to catch your attention. Mr. Rogers comments, “There are more people in the U.S. who study public relations than study agriculture. It has been a nightmare industry for a long time, and that’s got to change.“

Here is the bottom line: the law of supply and demand may soon change the performance profile of agricultural investments. Agriculture supply is constrained by the limited expansion and saturation of agricultural land, resource scarcity, increasing environmental pressures, global warming, droughts, the lack of major recent technological breakthroughs to improve productivity, and rising production costs. The growth rate of global agricultural production is thus expected to drop to 1.5% over the next few years from above 2% over the past few (based on OECD forecasts).

Meanwhile, demand continues to grow rapidly thanks to a combination of growing populations, higher incomes and evolving diets in developing markets like India, China, Africa, etc. (where caloric intake including meat consumption is exploding). The growing structural imbalance between supply and demand may augur a rise in agricultural prices — and the number of parties organized by exuberant farmers!

The fact that the world needs to be fed is undeniable and the pressure to improve crop yields and produce bacon and ice cream augments everyday. Add Starbucks’ (SBUX) insatiable quest for beans and our families’ appetite for chocolate and you get the picture. But the trend is your friend. So far there has been little momentum building up from an investor’s standpoint. Most agricultural ETF’s and mega agricultural corporate players have underperformed the major indexes. How early do you want to be?

Assuming you want to invest at the earliest stages (that is, before the rally ignites, whenever that is), how do you play the hopefully-soon-to-materialize trend? Well, you may follow Jim Rogers’ lead and go with RJA, which follows the Rogers International Commodity Index – Agriculture Total Return index and represents 20 agricultural commodity futures contracts; it has an expense ratio of .75%.

Or go with the more liquid PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF (DBA), which tracks the performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index – Optimum Yield Agriculture Excess Return; this index is composed of futures contracts and widely traded commodities. DBA has an expense ratio of .85%. The iPath Bloomberg Grains Subindex Total Return ETN (JJG), which tracks the Dow Jones-UBS Grains Subindex Total ReturnService Mark, is yet another option. 

Alternatively – or concomitantly – you may choose to invest in ETF’s for coffee (JO, CAFE) and/or sugar (SGG, CANE). All of these vehicles’ prices have been depressed for some time and seem to be in the process of bottoming out. But again they have yet to make a significant move upward, hopefully in high volume, to signal a change in trend. Oops, seems like CANE and SGG are trying to do exactly that, aren’t they?

personalfinance,Recent graduate (23) and relocating for a job. No common banks exist from current location to new location.,"I currently have a college checking account with Chase and a savings and checking account with a local credit union. However, I will be moving in a couple weeks and neither branch has a physical location (or ATM) in my new city. 

I am thinking of closing my Chase account and closing the checking account with the local credit union. Then once I relocate, open new savings and checking accounts. 

My reason for wanting to keep my savings account is that I have been at this credit union for years (10+), so I am thinking that my reputation there would help get a lower interest rate when I apply for a loan sometime in the future.

btc,Bitcoin Unlimited (BU): Design document and/or technical specification?,"I've been scolded recently for having reservations about Bitcoin Unlimited vs. BIP101 scaling. I have a bit of time and would like to learn more, but am not finding the information I need.

I've listened to the articles of federation from the nice youtube lady who read them, which is great, but I am not looking for community rules or values. Is there a formal specification of how the BU client differs from core or XT? I plan to look through the github also, but it will be a lot faster starting with a design document/tech. spec.

Ideally this would describe BU in enough detail to illustrate technically:

* How max block size is determined (4 block depth x 4MB or 1MB, how does this work?)
* How does the block size scale, when, and who/what decides?
* How the ""simple UI"" is used by node operators to determine their max block size

Off the top of my head, the detail should be sufficient to answer these questions and more:

* How user/node choice of max block size do not create forks in the protocol
* How user/node choice of max block size will not create propagation/orphaning issues, or even be used to attack other miners
* How user/node choice of max block size does not create new or worsen vulnerabilities such as eclipse attacks, or similar",cryptocurrency,1452003674

personalfinance,Could someone ELI5 the logistics of a Home Equity Loan?,"I bought a foreclosed home for a great price a few yrs ago. 

Loan: $91,665.00
Owed: $86,355.08
Interest Rate: 3.8750 %

Market Value appraised for $145,000 (just what the city is determining for tax purposes) We haven't had anyone inside to see improvements, etc for actual appraisal for when we sell in 2-3 years.

So it looks like we will most likely make anywhere from $40-75k hopefully when selling.

My question: What is the reason for a home equity loan?

I have outstanding student loans, credit card bills, etc. But mainly want to know if a home equity loan could help us with some small repairs around the house: electric work, waterproofing and mold evaluation, some small repairs, etc. Things we will need done likely before selling.

Would a home equity loan be right for this and how would it effect mortgage payment. Or additional payment. Really I have no idea how they work so please explain like I am 5. Or 15.

personalfinance,College's financial aid office didn't cancel my loan,"Before my sophomore year started in 2014, I signed my MPN for the full federal loan value I was entitled to: $7500. Just after the semester started in late August 2014, my dad called me and told me to return part of the loan, since my family was going to be able to cover more of my expenses than they originally thought.

So I headed to the financial aid office, signed some papers, and reduced my federal loan to $4000. I remember this meeting, and I even have an email from my aid counselor saying she reduced the amount.

I checked my loans for the first time last week, and wouldn't you know it, those $3500 were never actually cancelled and returned. My loan provider has me down for $7500 for that year, plus $408 in interest.

I have a meeting with financial aid next Monday. I'd like to go in and tell them exactly what they're going to do and how they're going to do it. How can they pay me back the original $3500 plus the interest on that portion of the loan?",finance,1452010134

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Advice,"I've done a lot of research lately regarding this, and I want some more personal advice.

I have:
$11,575 in federal student loans, all subsidized, all with 4.66% interest;
$16,200 in savings;
$1050 in an emergency fund - - - adding $50 per month right now;
$800 in Roth - - - adding $50 per month right now.

I currently intern fulltime and make $2000 per month, and have $300 in monthly expenses from now until I move out in fall 2016. I'm also going to graduate in September 2016. I will continue interning where I'm at now until September 2016, making the same amount of money.

My question is this:
Do I pay off all of my student loans today, leaving my savings at around $5000 with little chance of maxing out my Roth for 2016, or do I max out my Roth in 2016 by adding $5500, and waiting to pay off the student loans by making monthly payments until after I move out and get settled. Should I make the monthly student loan payments to help build my credit?


I know moving out with bring about $1500-2000 in monthly expenses, so not having a student loan payment will be nice, but not having a larger savings account could push me closer to living paycheck to paycheck, which is one of my primary avoidances. 


I'm also 22 years old in the US. To make things clearer: My goals include maxing my Roth IRA every year from 2016 onward, possibly buying a new(used) car in the $6000-8000 range, and being completely financially independent from my family asap.

I've missed many payments over the course of this loan trying to keep myself from being homeless but I managed to turn a 15,000 loan unto an 1,800 loan as of today. It has come at s great cost as I now have some sort of crazy 20%+ interest rate on my payments. 

My loan is set to end in feburary and the lender is thinking of repossessing my car bluebooked at $7,000 to cover the remaining $1,800. They are less than willing to allow me to make arrangements since the loan is set to end soon.

I tried to get my car refinanced but the missed payments and the age (2009 is the cut off) have proved uneventful even with a secured loan.

I don't blame them for this action no one knew I would be injured before I signed those papers and I take responsibility for my loan. A repossession would cost me my job though so I want to try and come up with that $1,800 before January 5th.

Am I just out of luck or is there an avenue I have no explored. My mother passed away in the accident that hurt me so I don't have much in the way of close family and my credit is around 600. I live in PA and rent an apartment and have no other debt except a $300 credit card I pay monthly. I have no savings and I get paid $1200 bi-weekly.

personalfinance,Advice for paying my overseas debts as quickly and responsibly as possibly. (CAN/UK),"So here is my situation.  In September, I moved from Canada to the UK, from which I incurred a lot of expenses, as was expected.  Things such as a visa, immigration health surcharge, flights, expenses for the flat (internet, furniture, etc.), and many other things cost me a fair bit of money.  Unfortunately for me, the CAN Dollar was at the lowest it has been for a long time, which made the expenses that much harder on my Canadian Accounts which I was using to pay for the move in UK Pounds.  I had no income during all of these expenses either.  I started working in the UK in October, and make a fair wage, but I still have debt in Canada that I need to take care of.  My account balances are as follows:


Canadian Accounts

Savings

Chequing……………….. $1,408.47 (£704.24)

Savings…………………… $960.61 (£480.31)  

Credit

Credit Card…………….. $6,170.18 (£3,085.09) @ 10.99% Interest Rate

Line of Credit…………. $4,400.67 (£2,200.34) @ 8.99% Interest Rate

Investments 

TFSA………………………. $6,277.16 (£3,138.04) 

RRSP………………………. $7,803.74 (£3,825.36)

Self-Directed RRSP…. $12,900.06 (£6,450.03) (Currently Un-invested)

UK Account

Chequing………………… £2,760.38 ($5631.18)


I earn £2200 ($4400 CAN) per month, until April when I will earn about £1700-1900 ($3400-3800) because of the way UK Taxes work.  Without getting in to the specifics, I should be able to save £1000 ($2000 CAN) per month until April, where I will only be able to save £600 ($1200 CAN).  After June however, I can only guess that I’ll be able to save £400-500 ($800-1000 CAN) as I am moving to a new flat which I am sure will be more expensive, (this is necessary). 


My question is, what is the best way to pay down my debt?  
I do not have a lot of financial experience, as I am in my early 20s, but my current idea is to redeem my entire TFSA, and pay off my Credit Card.  The remaining amount from my TFSA will be put on my Line of Credit.  At the end of January, I am expecting to have £3800-4000 ($7600-8000 CAN) in my UK account, to which I could transfer £2250 ($4500.00) and pay my remaining balance on my Line of Credit.  Once my debts are paid, I could save here in the UK, and transfer back to Canada when I see that there are good exchange rates.  Once the transfers are made, I can reinvest in my TFSA, and build it back up again.


One problem I have, is that I have no idea how this will work with my taxes.  If I transfer money from the UK to my Canadian accounts, do I have to pay Canadian Income Tax as well as Income Tax I will be paying from the UK?  I am scared that I am overlooking something crucial, and that I may be subject to some tax law and get dinged either here in the UK, or in Canada. 
Can anyone advise me if this is a good idea, and if it isn’t, what may be another, better, option to pay down my debts as responsibly as possible?


Sorry if I left anything out, this is my first post.  If anyone wants clarification, please feel free to ask, and I will do my best to reply.

personalfinance,Is the TurboTax app worth looking into?,"Hi everyone! For my entire adult life filing taxes, I've always had them done by a personal tax professional recommended by a friend of mine. For the last 6 or so years using him, I've been okay with it since my federal tax returns have always been satisfactory and filing with him has always been (somewhat) painless and quick.

I say ""somewhat"" because the only big downside to using him is that the fee to pay him (10%) is usually the entirety of my State Tax return. 

This year, I'm looking to not only try to get a Federal Return similar to what I got when going through him (life hasn't changed too much in years, so I expect it should be the same), but also hopefully KEEP the amount I get from my State Tax.

As someone who is absolutely CLUELESS about taxes, I need the easiest, most reliable way to do it myself. My biggest fear is making a mistake and possibly getting audited or receiving half of the return I usually get. Math is one of the last things I should trust myself with.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on contributing to my 401-k,"Hello Everyone, 

I am interested in contributing to my companies 401-k plan but am unsure how much to match and what exactly the matching percentages mean. I have included the 401-k outline from our companies HR handbook for reference below. Specifically, I do not understand what is meant by ""Company Match: We will match 25% of the first 6%."" They are going to match the first 6% of what? 

Background I am making 40k a year. 
 and want to contribute the max amount that my company will match. Can anyone advise on how I igure out what that is exactly?

401-k Snippet from Companies HR Handbook:

RETIREMENT PLAN
401k Plan: The retirement savings plan provides an easy way to save, get special tax treatment, receive a matching company contribution, and the opportunity to invest your savings for growth. The many advantages the 401(k) plan offers makes it a valuable part of your future financial security. Participation in the 401(k) plan is voluntary, although Prospect automatically enrolls eligible employees at 1% upon meeting the eligibility period, which is 1st of the month after 60 days of service. You can contribute between 1% and 90% of your annual pay on a pre-tax basis with a maximum of $18,000 (Employees age 50 or older may contribute an additional $6,000) in 2016, certain IRS restrictions apply. The savings plan gives you double advantage of saving for the future while paying less tax today. Your savings come out of your paycheck before taxes are taken out. This lowers your income for tax purposes, which means you pay less federal (and in most cases, state and local) income taxes. The dollars you do not pay in taxes show up as increased spendable pay.

Investment Choices: The 401(k) Plan offers you a choice of 23 investments, which range in their degree of risk. You may invest your savings in any or all of the funds in any increments. The plan also offers balanced/asset allocation funds, which are an alternative way to invest and easily diversify, for a total of 23 options. You’re not locked into your choices. The 401(k) Plan gives you the flexibility to change your investment strategy at any time by calling or online at www.401k.com.

Company Match: We will match 25% of the first 6%. The match is discretionary and based on your elective deferral contribution and compensation for the payroll period. The match is on a three-year vesting schedule as follows: 

Years of Service Vested Percentage
1 year - 33%
2 years - 66%
3 or more years - 100%

Bitcoin,I am becoming convinced that we're headed for a major financial crisis - bitcoin is my only option.,"I finished watching ""The Big Short"" last night (it's awesome, check it out) and it got me thinking about our current world macroeconomy again. As I see it, there are many signs pointing to some major financial crises in the future - only postponed by market manipulation, investor deception, and federal reserve ""tools"". 

Headlines and market insight tell me it's already begun: 

* China's stock market crashes, 
* Chinese currency volatility &amp; likely devaluation, 
* Chinese housing bubble still hasn't popped,
* [Brazil is headed for their worst recession since 1901](http://www.bdlive.co.za/world/americas/2016/01/04/brazil-heads-for-worst-recession-since-1901), 
* Our federal reserve has leveraged our dollar's debt ratio to terrifying amounts, 
* Quantitative Easing (QE) finally ending AKA the ultra-rich's charity bank,
* The effects of QE ruined our middle class,
* Inflation increased in December, 
* The looming inflation increase world-wide, 
* Real unemployment in America over 10%,
* US economy isn't growing,
* Oil prices crashed, 
* Housing rebounded while banks still sell CMOs under the name ""Re-Remic""s (repeating the last mistake),
* I'm convinced our stock market is going to crash (it's already starting),
* COMEX (the exchange for precious metals that dictate prices of gold and silver) is controlled by the banks &amp; fed. Selling multiples on futures for gold not in a vault,
* The rich are buying stock in companies related to moving Chinese money internationally,
* The rich (and countries like Russia &amp; China) are stocking up on real gold and silver,
* Potential crash of the EURO,
* Potential crash of the USD,
* Governments defaulting on their debts,
* The continuous expansion of rules to keep you from withdrawing from your own bank account,
* Banks potential seizure of citizen's money like in Cyprus,
* Militarization of our police forces,
* Beginnings of new gun regulation (may be unrelated though),
* One major crash will stick the ""bill"" on citizens again and fuel the wealth inequality (compound that wil a potential inflation spiral and we're back in The Depression or worse)

I'm sure this list is just touching the tip of the iceberg and it's unsettling. The past few months, I have been buying bitcoin as a hedge on my worries although it isn't a perfect solution. I bought more last night... I'm starting to bet big (but responsibly) on my future in it.

Given the state of COMEX and gold/silver manipulation, it isn't really even a sound investment to hedge on this stuff either. I'm considering shorting stocks as well but I don't really want to touch the stock exchange - it isn't a free market (although my best assumption is that it will crash... hard).

I am investing more into bitcoin because, although it is manipulated by whales, it is the closest ""free market"" I can think of. The bitcoin price is most closely correlated to supply/demand compared to anything else. The biggest questions right now have to do with scalability (which I'm confident will be resolved w/o issue), political threats, and the lack of education on it/misinformation.

When will governments learn that they are ineffective at trying to manage/play world economies like a game? I hope that time comes someday. China could be the ultimate example of this. They did a lot of things right, actually, but it's counter-intuitive and destined to fail (as we're seeing / in my opinion),

How do you think bitcoin would perform in various financial crises scenarios? I'm obviously betting it'll go up. Regardless, I feel very unsettled by how irresponsible our politicians, fed, and banks are.

I've been browsing Reddit for awhile and decided this was the best place to post this question. 

First, a little background about myself.

personalfinance,paycheck increase by contributing to Traditional 401k?,"This logic may only make sense to me so bear with me which is in part why I am posting because it sounds too good to be true, I am likely mixing apples and oranges.  At least maybe someone can clarify whats wrong with this train of thought I can't shake so I can get my head straight.

Just recently started a new job.  Due to the increase I have received by taking this job I will be in a higher federal tax bracket than I previously was.  At my last job I did not have a Traditional 401k setup but at this job I do.  I got my first check including all benefit deductions and its about ~$300 more than I made at my last job (sweet!).

I am no mathematician however I cant keep help but think if I were to contribute ~11k into a traditional 401k over the course of the year I would reduce my taxable income and fall in the lower federal bracket again at the end of the year (pending no external income).  Am I correct in thinking this would mean I would actually see more than $300 increase in my checks as less tax would be taken out or am I just all out of whack and need to go back to basic math class?  Either way I am strategizing the best 401k strategy for me today in the event I can't max it this year and I am fully aware I will be taxed either way and that it just kicks the can down the road.

* we have $80k in cash (in a savings account) still in a Canadian bank account we want to move to the USA to invest. this cash is the result of having to have unbundling some of our investment vehicles in Canada (called TFSAs) for tax purposes.

* I make $100k salary and roughly $50-100k a year in bonuses + dividends in the company. Wife makes $60k year salary.
* I've got a 401(k) set up for a 5% matching from my employer, but it's only been running for a couple months so it's minimal.

* I'm in the country on an L-1A visa (a management visa) and wife's on an L-2. We had zero credit in the USA when we moved, which proved challenging, but we managed to lease a Ford Escape @ $280/mo + get an Amex card, due to our good Canadian credit.

* We have a house in Canada we're renting. Turns out we can't pull equity out because we are now deemed residents in the USA so it's not allowed. 

* We want to buy a house this year, but we want to wait to get good credit before buying a house. Our down payment would be roughly $100k, meaning we can get a house for $500k if we have 20% down.

Here are my questions:

* Is there any way to ""transfer"" Canadian credit to the USA so we can get a good interest rate on our mortgage? Note that Hawaii doesn't have any of the ""major"" banks (i.e. Citi, BoA, etc.). We have accounts at First Hawaiian Bank, which seems like the best bank on the islands.

* How long does it take to build good credit from zero? We have TV, internet, utilities, auto and an Amex as forms of debt that we pay off extremely well.

* What's the best way to check your credit in the USA? 

* What's the best way to save for a house? Do you just put in a savings account until you can get the money out? Can you put in a 401(k) and take out without incurring any penalties?
* How do you guys save for houses? Do you still max out 401(k)'s + Roth IRAs before setting any money aside for housing down payments?
* I know this isn't the real estate thread, but does the USA have the some mortgage insurance if you put a low down payment on a house? In Canada if you have less than a 20% you have to get private mortgage insurance and then this increases your monthly costs. So in essence we'd like to get a mortgage without PMI - what's the minimum threshold? Are there exceptions if you have good credit?

personalfinance,Financial Protip: Opt for 'Rental Reimbursement' when it comes to your car insurance,"Long story short: My front-passenger headlight and bumper made love, sweet love to Bambi a couple days ago.  $1,800 in damages; I'm not concerned because I have a $100 comprehensive/collision deductible on my car.

However, where I effed up is that *I didn't include rental reimbursement* with my policy, so I am stuck without a rental car - as much as I love driving, I cannot afford paying $20/day for a vehicle while my car is in the shop.  My vehicle will be fixed within three weeks; they have to special order parts.

Total cost for a having a rental for 3 weeks? $500 bucks.

Total cost for having rental reimbursement on my policy for an entire year? $16 bucks.

*Thankfully*, the claims adjuster called me a day after the accident on his personal cell-phone and thanked me for being a long-term customer for Progressive, and is going to reimburse me for a rental.  I can now get a rental car tomorrow.

I was also told that this is ""peak"" deer season, so please make sure you have rental reimbursement on your auto policy! :)",finance,1452080968

personalfinance,[Need advice] Buying a home - Paying cash vs Mortgage with bad credit,"I’m looking for some advice. Here’s my situation.


I’ve been living very cheaply in South Am. for the past 8 years and I’ve saved most of my income in that time.


I’m now looking to move back to the US and I’d like to buy a house soon after. The issue is my credit history in the US is awful. Unpaid student loans, back taxes (under 8-10k depending on penalties), no credit cards, no loans, no property, no retirement accts, etc. Also, no credit activity since I left.


I’ve given myself a two year window to take care of what I can before going back.  But, given that my credit is likely shot, if I get a loan (I qualify for a VA Home Loan), the interest rate is going to be terrible. 


I'll still have the same income in the US as I have now but I wont be able to save nearly as much. 


I’d rather not tie down so much cash for a house but, I also don’t want be be locked into a ridiculous mortgage because of my bad credit. I can afford a house in the 350-380k US$ range if I were to pay in cash and still have enough cash for a decent rainy day fund.

personalfinance,"Possible Pregnancy, stressing out about finances","I'm confident we can do this.  Doesn't mean I'm not a bit stressed about it.

My wife and I got married a few months ago.  Yesterday she took a pregnancy test and came back positive.  While we weren't trying to have a kid, we weren't not trying either -- we took the position (heh heh) that if it happened, it happened, and if it doesn't we won't be too concerned about it for a while.

Well, it's looking like it happened.  My wife takes home about $800 every two weeks.  My gross salary was 65k last year -- take home about 45k -- though this year insurance premiums are going up, my boss has also been teasing me with a promotion with a significant pay bump to go along with it.

Due to her income, I feel like we may be better off if she becomes a stay-at-home mom/housekeeper, as opposed to having to pay for childcare, which would likely cost close to as much as her income.  Not to mention the costs of fuel, vehicle maintenance, and the savings of eating more home-cooked meals, etc.

Here's a rundown of my current outstanding credit:

 - My Credit Score: 730 (TU) / 724 (EF) 
 - Credit Cards are largely paid off on a monthly basis - with the exception of two store cards which have 0% interest offers on them -- Best Buy (~$1600 -- bought us a new TV on black Friday) and Zales ($110 - wedding ring, will be paid off next month).  The cards that are paid off monthly are Chase Amazon, Citi Dividend Platinum Select, and Target.  I have not been in the habbit of funneling all purchases through credit cards -- most purchases are made with Debit, aside from some automated payments (Amazon, PSN) and purchases at Target and Home Depot.  The plan on the 0% interest offers has always been to take the balance, divide by months remaining on the 0% offer, and pay the quotient rounded up to the next dollar.

 - HELOC has $12.5k balance out of 15k limit.  Wedding was financed with the HELOC.  When the wedding checks came in, I used the money to pay off the credit cards instead of the HELOC, then put the rest towards the HELOC.  Then decided now would be a good time to fix up the bathroom, which is an almost-complete project -- at this point I just have to buy paint and a floor.  I've DIY'd the whole thing.  Will likely have to make a few more inexpensive home repairs before the kid arrives -- things like fixing damage the dogs did when they were puppies (chewed up molding/cupboards/vinyl floor), painting the peeling bulkhead + garage, painting my office and moving my office to the basement so my office can become a bedroom again, etc.  The bank is automatically drafting interest payments only from our joint checking account.

Monthly expenses currently include:

 - Mortgage - with tax and insurance rolled in, $1041/mo
 - Autos - we both have payments on our cars.  Between car payments and insurance, we pay $761/mo.  Both cars are 2013 models purchased used with 7yr loans -- one in 2014, one in 2015.
 - Internet - $60/mo
 - Hulu, Netflix, Amazon - about 30/mo
 - Her parent loan - $41/mo
 - Gas and Electric - $110/mo-ish.  
 - Oil heat -- haven't filled up yet, that's coming soon.  Last year I think we got by on only 1.5 tanks.  This year oil is much cheaper -- we do COD oil which is currently around $1.65/gal in my area.

Interest rates on the HELOC, Auto Loans, and Mortgage are all fairly low, though I don't know the exact amounts.

Quarterly expenses include: 

 - Water + Sewage - about $50 every three months
 - Auto Tax - my taxes were $107.19 per quarter last year.  While we drive the same year/make/model car, hers was purchased after the tax year started, so we did not pay taxes on her car last year.

Other expenses - her student loan balance is 22k.  However, we are so far not filing jointly to keep that payment deferred due to her income.  We have so far not paid anything on it.  

Upcoming savings: 
 - We will be cutting 10% off home taxes next year by signing up for the local Homestead Tax Savings Act.
 - We will be shaving $86/yr off our auto insurance by being married
 - If I add her to the deed, we'll likely be looking at savings on the homeowners insurance as well.  Not sure what this entails.

I'm thinking that at this point, the first thing I should do is increase my HSA contribution.  I am only contributing $30/pay period (every two weeks) to our HSA, and have only about a $1000 balance on it.  Now that we are married, not only have my premiums gone up, but so has my deductible -- which is now $4000/yr.  If I bump up contributions to $187.50 or more per pay period, we should have $4000 contributed to the HSA by 9/1, which should cover the deductible by the expected due-date.  

After that, I hope to take the entirety of our tax refunds (the plan so far is to continue filing separately due to the aforementioned student loans) and apply it to the HELOC balance and hopefully knock a good chunk off of it.  Then start to try to use my income solely for our living expenses, and as much of her income towards the HELOC as we can.  In the interim, treat the HELOC like an emergency fund (though I know it shouldn't be) and try to save. 

But what next?  I'm seeing that we have about $2100 in estimated monthly bills and $3725 in just my net income, with a potential for a significant raise before September. Can we do this?  How can we prepare? 

Edit to add: despite the $1600 difference in my income and our expenses (not including food, fuel, etc), and the other $1600 that she makes -- we are still finding ourselves living paycheck-to-paycheck.  I know this is due to a lot of unnecessary spending -- I can't imagine it adding up to $3200/mo but it must -- but there are certainly things we can cut out.  Less take-out, less smoking (it'll be a lot easier for me to quit now that she has to), less of her shopping sprees at target/homegoods/clothes stores, etc.  Fewer luxury goods for me as well -- though not as often, I am a geek and a gamer so my purchases tend to be fewer, but more expensive...etc.",finance,1452097478

I would appreciate another set of eyes and calculations on this. 

I was hired at current company in late 2014 with a starting salary of 32K. I was given a 4K raise in early Feb 2015. I was given another raise in May 2015 of 1K. So, that means my YTD pre-tax salary shown on my W-2 and final 2015 pay stub should be around $37k, right??

I'm coming to you guys because I want help with what to do.
I have about 22k in Student loan debt ranging anywhere from 3.4%-6.5% interest rate. I have 6300 dollars in savings and about 1.7k in checking.
I'm trying to consider what's best for me in my future. I have 700 credit score, not great but not bad. I'm considering consolidating all my student loans,

430 - rent (electric, rent for the house I rent, internet and anything else I use to survive)

200 dollars every 6 months for car insurance

100 dollars - cell phone

300 dollars - savings

As far as food, I eat out probably too much, maybe about 200 dollars a month that goes on the credit card, that I then pay off and get rewards on. As far as groceries
that's the only thing I get help with and it's paid for via my girlfriends parents for living with her. I don't have to pay for gas much, because I work from home
and when we go places we normally take my girlfriends vehicle. I pay maybe 20 dollars every 2 months.

on a house for my girlfriend and I, and lastly, eventually, when I stop working from home, I'll need a new car, which I'd prefer to pay as much as I can while keeping atleast
6-12 months in savings for expenditures. I also am aware of the student loan interest i'm paying.

personalfinance,"Refinancing to eliminate loans, is it smart?","Hello r/personalfinance,

Like the title says I'm wondering if refinancing a vehicle to combine several loans is a smart move. 

My wife and I just had our first kid and we are exploring options to allow her not to go back to work. We make over 6 figures currently but I have loans out on my truck, my Harley, her car, and the engagement ring. I want to refinance the Harley because I have the most equity in it and can refinance it enough to pay off my truck and the ring and take a large chunk out of my last 2 credit cards. 

Right now with those 3 payments I pay around $900 a month and if I refinance the Harley and eliminate those 2 payments I would be only paying $300 a month, which obviously is a huge savings per month. However I'm torn because all 3 loans are in their last few years of payments so most of my payment is going to the principal and not the interest. 

Refinancing will alleviate some of her lost salary, and not having to pay daycare will alleviate a ton more, but will mean I'm paying for all of them much longer and thus paying more interest. Albeit at a much lower rate since my credit score has improved a ton since taking these loans (low 600s to mid 700s score). 

 We don't have the means to pay them off now but with my work we work a lot of overtime so I can throw large chunks at it when I get those checks and pay it off quicker than the 5/6 years I take the loan for, while not having to pay a lot when I don't work the overtime. 

So I'm curious, is this a smart move? Or just dumb? Thoughts?

Quick edit before I read responses - interest rates currently are truck-8% Harley-6% ring-12% new refinance on the Harley loan would be 3% 

And I know selling the Harley would be the best route, however it has sentimental value (long story) as well as I've put a lot of work into making it mine and I know that if I sold it I would never get another one as it's hard to justify buying such a toy, but I already have it so it's easier to justify keeping it.

I can realistically wipe that credit card out within six weeks (which is the first thing I'm going to do with my additional income) and then start allocating $1-1.5k a month towards my student loans with the goal of being debt free by the end of this year (something I never would have thought possible seven days ago). 

However, my last year in college my university had some clerical error and didn't charge me for a class until about 2 months in the semester. I was then stuck with a bill for $875 that I didn't have the money for but was able to work out a $50/month payment plan with the registrar in order to not have it go to collections...well about four months in I tried to call in the payment and for whatever reason, they had dumped the account to some agency.

Fast forward a month or two, the phone starts ringing and I explicitly tell the person that I could pay the balance in full in about two weeks (I was getting paid monthly). They told me no problem and gave me a 1-800 number along with my account number and said I could take care of it. For reasons unbeknownst to me, they offed my account to another agency. The short and skinny is that I can't find the debt and don't want to pay it off at this point (three years later) if it's going to impact my credit more negatively than positively. We shall refer to this as ""Problem #1"".

Additionally, my last year of college I was negligent with an AMEX credit card and it was ultimately charged off with a balance between $700-800. This is ""Problem #2"".

I should be able to save around 20.000/year, I’d like to know where to invest my money with attractive returns. I’ve been lurking this subreddit for a while and have read about Vanguard/Schwab but I’m not a US citizen and they don’t offer links for Irish citizens.
Tried to contact them via email inquiring about opening an account but since I’m not currently a customer, don’t really expect an answer…


What can I do with 1500€/month? I’d like to know where to start my life savings as I’ve had zero financial advice in my life so far…
Saving accounts give very low returns…
I’m not knowledgeable enough to be playing around in the stock market…
Mutual funds seem to have good returns…
Can you offer some guidance?


With proper investment and help from compounding, I’d like also to retire early (or at least not work until 65). Am I too late to even consider this, starting now and putting “only” 1500€ aside?


I'm debt free and owe nothing to nobody, but am only now starting my professional career.

personalfinance,Graduate Student Balancing Loans and Credit Card Debt,"I am in my 2nd of 3 years of full time graduate school. To this point my parents paid for my undergraduate tuition, but I am responsible for paying for graduate school. I take out the maximum $20,500 that Federal Aid provides and my parents pay the difference to cover tuition. I live at home.

Currently, my monthly income is around 800 from working part time when I dont have class.

I have about $1,500 owed spread across three credit cards and around that much in savings too.

My question is, am I better off applying for a graduate PLUS loan for $1000 or $2000 and paying off the credit debt to get my score up or paying it off so that I carry a small balance on my cards?

Need your help on how to be smart with my money.  
A little bit about me.  I’ve been on my own from the get go.  Put myself through college and I cover all my expenses.  I am now in my 30’s and in a pretty OK spot.  Not a millionaire (or even close).. but not struggling either.  Here is what I look like on paper:


Age: 30  
Status: no dependents/no mortgage  
Salary: 110K a year  
Savings account: 90K  
Checkins account: 10K  
2 credit cards - monthly I end up spending around 3-5K (this doesn’t include rent)  
Roth IRA: 10K to date (investing with Vanguard)  
Rent - 1500  


I am trying to learn a bit more about personal finance and make sure to set myself up correctly.  

My parents, make almost double what I make but have always been financially strained… as I get older, I really want to make sure that I am set up correctly.. so that I don’t have to struggle or be “tight” on money.  

**Smart decisions that I’ve already made:**
I moved 50K of my savings to Ally’s 1% interest saving account.  Before that everything was just being wasted in my Wellsfargo college savings account. I’ve also gone ahead and signed up for the Chase Freedom Credit card, in addition to a wells fargo credit card. 

**Need to know:**
I have about 40K that’s still in my Wellsfargo checking account and I’d love to know how I should invest this money in a smart way… I have looked for CD’s and money market accounts, but nothing seems to have good enough interest rates to justify locking it away. Not sure what other options I have.

Need advise on saving plan.,"I been lurking here for the last few moths but never took it seriously until 3 weeks ago, reading and soaking as much as possible, am a male 34 years old from east coast who has been consulting in the IT field for the last 8 years, English is not my native language in case you haven`t noticed in my writing style.

I got married 5 years ago and have a beautiful family, in the next 2 weeks our second daughter will be born and this for some reason does not let me sleep at night, am always thinking about the future and how to plan for our family schools, retirement ect.

My wife used to work when we 1st started dating and for the 1st few years of our marriage but after we had our 1st daughter we decided that it was best for us if she stay at home and take care of the baby, our situation was not in our side when in came to baby sitting and we prefer to be us who take care of the little one so around 3 years ago she been stay at home mom and I haven't regret that decision ever since.

So I was the only one bringing the money home, 5 years ago I been making around 100k+ consulting but had to pay taxes on that so that was really 75k, now since 2013 I have been always on the 180k range a year and saved enough to buy a house 2 years ago.

I been looking to invents money but every time I start reading it scare me away, we also have some land in the dominican republic that we bought 5 years ago and that`s almost paid for, around 80k USD worth of land.

Am terrible at budgeting, when I started making money I got all the things that I always wanted, new car, new cell every 6 moths, nice tv, we ate out a lot, the one thing am good at is we don`t take too much vacation and trips that cost lots of money, we usually go to vacation at my parents house in the Dominican republic and we can do all of that with 1500k and even bring money back, on top of that we only do this every 2 years the most.

Right now index low funds specially vanguard has caught my attention and I really like what am reading about it, I need some advice of how to start investing in there, below is my current expenses and income.

Don`t forget, am terrible at saving money I know I should be on a better position but I never had any financial education before, I left home at 16 years old and came to the US lived by my self for most of my young life.

Income is around 180k sometimes more, I make 3,800 a week 40 hours a week 95 per hour.

Expenses are mortgage 255k 3.75 interest rate.

Moth 2,200 house including taxes.
Car 1 lease 670   ----&gt; Ends in 4 moths, getting used car now learned from this stupid mistake. (Always wanted new car BMW ect same BS like everyone else.
Car 2 lease 299 Wife car.

Monthly expenses are around 1700 a moth, including utility bills, groceries, commute.

Everyday expenses around 600 a moth, lunch, coffee, tips ect.

Now we have around 30k in saving account, around 20k in checking account.

Never had emergency account or fun account, I change that recently, want to separate the accounts, business account where the ACH gets deposit every week, from there 1 checking for house and bills, another checking for fun. And 2 savings, 1 for long term and another for emergency funds. 25% going into each account.

I want to invents some of that money into low index funds how can I start now, I want to invents 20% of my income going forward for the next 30 years hopefully. How would you do that right now with those numbers. Thanks sorry for the long tread.",finance,1452123989
personalfinance,"21, Getting a loan for $7,000 car - How much should I have saved before I pull the trigger?","Hey Gang. I'm 21 and looking to purchase my first car soon. I am set on a 2006/2007 Subaru Impreza. I just wanted to see if I could get some advice before I go seriously looking in the next couple months. A little info:

- I currently have ~$600
- I will be working 25-30 hours a week @ min (7.95) making anywhere from $300-$390 every two weeks (I go to school so 30 hours is my max workload)
- I have a tax return that will probably be anywhere from $400-600 (when I get this I will probably start seriously looking)

Given this information, what would you say my best plan of attack would be? I will have roughly 5-6 paychecks more before I want to start looking which given those numbers should probably bring me $1500-$1725 more, and including everything else I should have around $2400-$2750 (using low estimates) all together.

The dealer told me anywhere from $500-$1,500 would be good to put down, and I'd probably be looking at a 60 month loan. I dont know what my interest rate would be (equifax credit score is 680 w/ just student loans on file) but I would suspect around 5%, which is $132 a month. Full coverage insurance would be around $150 a month (have a couple tickets on my record). 

So my expenses would be around 280-300 a month, bringing in $300-$390 every two weeks, with maybe $1000-$1500 saved after a down payment. Trying to be conservative with my estimates as I will probably spend a $100-200 in this time period on going out.


If anyone has some advice I'd really appreciate it, thank you very much!

personalfinance,Creative way to refinance student debt to 0%?,"This will be a little long.  

I've been a long time contributor on PF, but I'm using a throwaway because many, many PFers would decry this plan.

My wife anf I have $279k in combined student debt at an average rate of 6.8% from professional school and graduate school.  Together, wife and I make $195k.    All our student debt is federal, with lots of forbearance and deferment options available.

We have a 5-month emergency fund put together, already maximizing tax-advantaged retirement accounts, but the rest of the income is available for debt repayment.  We live fairly cheaply for our area, and have kept lifestyle creep at bay. My FICO is 789, and wife's is 819.  We're currently paying a bit over $1500/month in INTEREST ONLY on student debt. We're on IBR now, but barely making a dent in principle.

I've examined my refinancing options with SoFi, but I don't want to lose my federal loan options for the relatively small reduction in rate I was offered (4-5%), and even if they're refinanced with SoFi, they're still non-dischargeable student loans.

I had two separate people pitch an idea to me over the holidays I had never considered before.  One of them is the retired CEO of a multi-million dollar corporation, and the other is my creative brother.  This isn't my idea, but I've spent some time thinking how I could adapt to our situation below.


1) both my wife and I slowly increase our credit limits (currently 93k combined) on our exiting credit cards and/or open new cards.  Just the other day, I got an offer for 21 months of 0% APR for balance transfers and purchases...tempting.

2) once we have sufficiently large combined credit lines set up, we begin to charge all our expenses on 1 or 2 of the cards, cards that have 0% rates for at least 6 months.

3) we use all of our available earnings to put as much money on my student loans as we can, hitting the highest interest rate loans first.

4) as the 0% APR window runs out, balance transfer to a different card that has 0% for at least another 6 months, and begin running up a second 0% card for our living expenses.

5) continue this strategy, always rolling over balances to the next 0% card, and continue paying down student debt.  This roll-over process is apparently possible to continue forever according to the retired CEO (obviously subject to the availability of new 0% offers). When student debt is paid off, switch to paying credit card debt off, while maintaining 0%.

6) over the period of approximately 6 years, all my student debt gets effectively refinanced to 0% AND becomes dischargeable as consumer debt.

7) as a variation on the above, use 1 high-limit card to take out a massive cash advance, like $30k, and then immediately roll that balance over to another 0% card.  Do this 3-4 times, and one could raise a huge amount of cash very quickly to throw at the student debt, greatly reducing the $1500/month of interest we're currently paying.  We would likely never be able to raise as much money from private lenders at reasonable rates.


Risks I can see:

1) credit card companies can apparently lower credit limits.  they might lower our limits once the balances go up and our consumer debt:income ratio becomes less favorable, making the end-game impossible

2) risk of 0% offers drying up, being unable to keep rolling balances over, and getting stuck paying high rates on huge sums of consumer debt

3) risk of any future bankruptcy ruining our credit for a few years.  This isn't the end of the world, and is recoverable fairly quickly using strategies to actively rebuild credit, but it wouldn't be good.


Benefits I can see:

1) refinancing student debt to 0%!!!

2) converting non-dischargeable student debt into dischargeable consumer debt.  this is HUGE.

3) Old age and disability happen to everyone.  I'm 35, already somewhat disabled due to an accident, and its only going to get worse over the years.  If at some point when I cannot work any longer, we can declare bankruptcy and discharge the debt if its consumer debt.  

4) could relatively immediately lower our monthly interest payments by hundreds of dollars/month, with further reduction coming quickly.

5) as far as I know, this strategy is 100% legal.


At one point in my life, I would have abhorred such a plan.  I've always been a very responsible user of credit, and this plan is arguably irresponsible.  However, we're sick and tired of paying high rates for secured student debt.  What's the point of maintaining a good credit score if it doesn't benefit us on the largest loans we will ever have?  Why not use our good credit to actually benefit ourselves? The federal government shouldn't be in the business of shafting people who opt to educate themselves, but their persistent refusal to allow refinancing to reasonable rates (without losing the safety net benefits) is forcing us to look at other options, and this is one of them.  

Our preliminary analysis:

The worst outcome, in our opinion, would to lose the nice safety net options of federal student debt by refinancing with a private lender like SoFi, still be charged unreasonable high rates for secured debt, and still have that debt follow us through any future bankruptcies.  Its not a good option.

The best outcome we think would be to refinance at a good rate (&lt;2%), and not be subject to the continual stress of never-ending, undischargeable debt payments.  When disability lowers our income, we don't want to deal with wage garnishments, IRS withholdings, etc.  Private lenders would never give us a rate like this, I've checked, but the credit card companies will.

We're currently in a middle-of-the-road outcome, have some safety with the federal loans, but have ridiculously high rates and undischargeable debt.  Not ideal.

personalfinance,Dealing With Irregular 401(k) Contributions When Maxing Out,"Looking for advice on how to deal with my situation please.

I am an employee of a company and am on 100% commission. I am paid a fixed, non-negotiable monthly draw (loan) and then every quarter, this amount is reconciled against sales and I am paid a commission check which can be in the 10's of thousands of dollars. I have recently received a large commission check.

My employer matches my 401(k) contribution in only one manner: if you contribute more than or equal to 6% of the gross amount of a particular paycheck (be it the monthly draw or commission check), they will contribute 3%. I contribute 6% of my gross draw check every month to capture the 3% employer contribution.

With having irregular and unpredictable incomes, it makes it impossible to make regular, equal contributions to my 401(k) to take advantage of dollar cost averaging. In order to max out my 401(k) in a given year, I would need to contribute over an addition $10,000, which would have to come from elected contributions from my commission checks. I have the flexibility to pick how much I contribute from each commission check to 401(k), Fed taxes, state taxes, etc. I am a buy and hold investor, this is my retirement basket.

I am in my early 30's and at this point am 100% (in my 401(k)) in low cost S&amp;P 500 index funds. I know the conventional wisdom says to not time the market, but I can see a few ways to deal with my issue:

1) If I get a big commission check, save the large amount and then increase my monthly draw check 401(k) contribution to be equal to the max 401(k) amount / 12 draw checks. I can then transfer the additional monies that are now missing from my draw check into my account from my savings to allow me to pay monthly bills

2) If I look at where the S&amp;P is currently, it does seem that it has dropped a bit from a linear trend, so perhaps maxing out the 401(k) now, early in 2016, will allow me to get into the market low(er), AND get the money out of my hands. I wouldn't say I have an issue with restraint, but we all know how this goes.

3) On the other hand, the Shiller P/E Ratio of the S&amp;P is 25.21, compared to the long term average of 16.65 which would suggest the market is overpriced and that I should either do #1 above, or wait until I see this drop. Problem is that when it/the market drops, I may have to wait until the end of a month for my monthly draw check to contribute anything (could be bad timing), or the issue that I could only theoretically contribute 100% of my gross monthly draw that month, which would not fully max out the 401(k). I would have to wait another month or to the next commission check to then make another large contribution which could cause me to lose my timing. Perhaps I could put the money into a money market fund in my 401(k) account so that the large amount could be in the account, but not tied to the market.

personalfinance,lowering my withholding to pay off debt?,"in my job, i'm able to adjust my federal tax withholdings very easily (via internet) 

I currently have about $10k in credit card debt (luckily it's all on a card that is 7.9%) but still, it bothers me, and I want to get it cut down asap.

I gross about $9k/mo but after all my deductions/taxes etc I take home about $4.2k/mo. I know, sucks.

I have cut my 401k back to the minimum to receive full match, but doing so, made it so I have much more federal tax withheld. ~$900/ per check (paid biweekly)
claiming single 01

Here's my thought, I dial back my withholdings, say, 20 exemptions, leaving me paying about $100/per check instead of $900.. this allows me to put $1600 more towards my credit card a month..hopefully paying it off quicker.

After it's paid off, I will put the withholdings (expemtions) back to 1, and also pay an extra fix amount in order to not be under my required tax due at the end of 2016. 

does this sound like a sound plan?

Anyone else ever do this?",finance,1452144011
personalfinance,25[M] making $66.5k/year and worried I'm not saving enough for retirement. Are my goals incorrectly prioritized?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I'm a 25 year old male in the tech industry, making $66,560 in Seattle.  It's not a whole lot, but it's enough to make me lower middle class here.  My girlfriend (26) makes around $23,000 per year after taxes and we split shared expenses 80/20.

I make roughly $3800 net income each month (not counting a second year signing bonus of roughly $450 each month), and I have the following debts:

* $13,466 in car loan @ 4.75%
* $53,600 in student loans @ 6.75% (Federal consolidated loans, no private loans)

I have no credit card debts or debts of any kind other than the two loans above.  I'm contributing 4% of each paycheck (gross, not net) each pay period to my 401(k) and my company matches 50% of that.  It's not the best, but it's better than nothing.

My assets:

* $4500 in liquid cash as emergency fund
* $5200 in 401(k)
* ~$56,000 in unvested RSUs that vest over the next two years

I am worried that I'm not saving enough for my retirement.  I don't have any retirement savings except for my 401(k).  My goals are to pay off my car and student debts as soon as possible, so I'm throwing as much extra cash as possible at the car loan in order to snowball that into my student loans to get the principle down.

I've paid off around $7,000 on the car in the last year and I only recently started paying my student loans (July 2015, paid off around $3000 with most of that being accumulated unpaid interest thanks to forbearance).

My question is: should I be focused more on saving for retirement  or continue paying my loans off as quickly as possible?  I've been focused on the debt because I feel like my life won't really be able to start until I'm no longer underneath the burden of all of that debt (won't be able to save for a down payment on a house, etc).  Can someone give me some advice?",finance,1452147004
personalfinance,"Triumphant Thursday, Thank you's, and a little advice to those with limited income who struggle saving money when it's ""visible and accessible""","I want to begin by saying thank you to not only the commenters here at /r/personalfinance but also to the thread creators. I’ve learned vocabulary, tips/techniques, and gained sound (and not so sound) advice from you all. It appears that many people look to the threads where others are talking about maximizing interests or maxing out retirement accounts—and this is all invaluable advice—but I truly grew in my financial walk from reading success stories by those who do not have nearly as much income or have never budgeted before. Unfortunately I cannot find the posts, but I recall reading two posts that changed everything for me. 


*  One was a user who was ecstatic about saving $2k. S/He was incredibly proud of that accomplishment. 


*  The second post was about a user who talked about the relief of having even a small emergency fund set up. This users talked about having car repairs and other bills spring up but not feeling any pressure because of prior planning. 


So here I am working 55 hours a week between two jobs (one working with children and one entry level) making roughly $25k. It hit me that I graduated with a Master of Arts in Teaching in May but no longer wanted to teach; I am essentially “floating” this first year trying to gain a modicum of self worth and find a real career but failing miserably (even though I’m an extremely valuable employee); and all I have is $300 in my savings account, $500 in checking. Something needed to change and since it doesn’t appear like it will be my current job(s) for the time being it needed to be my money management.

*  Between September and now I have managed to put away $3,600 in a savings account and have $1,600 in my checking account. 
*  I was able to invest in a hobby of mine (retro video games) by creating enough financial stability to spend $500 upfront on a mega deal, turn around and eBay some of the assets, and ultimately come out with $350 of merchandise for $30 out of pocket. At any time I can sell any of the remaining assets and make at least $320.
*  I was able to purchase 4 new tires and an oil change out of pocket when it was absolutely mandatory (in November) without feeling the slightest bit of pressure to my normal daily life.


For anyone who does not have a large income and struggles with spending money when they see it in their account, my best advice to you is to open an Ally savings account and *mainly* use it instead of your brick and mortar savings account. The benefits for me are 3 fold.

1. Your money is *just* far enough away that you cannot spend it on a whim. There is a few day transaction period that limits impulse purchases. 

2. Your money is not *too far* away in case of an emergency (assuming it is something you have a few days to take care of). You can get the money out of the account relatively quickly, however it doesn’t hurt to have some money in your brick and mortar savings account for those immediate emergencies. But again, if you are someone who needs that buffer then be leery of your ability to not touch this emergency money.

3. Ally currently offers a 1% interest rate, which while low is much better than 0.05% my brick and mortar account offers.

Going along with opening this account, I **highly** recommend setting up a reoccurring, automatic transaction from your checking account to your savings account for the day after you get paid. It doesn't have to be much, make it realistic for your income and expenses, but most importantly *make it*. Even if you are putting $20 a month into the account it is still better than nothing. If you can live without that $20 (or however much) the first month or two then it will get easier from there on. You will become accustomed to not having that money and it won't be on your mind since the transaction is effortless after the initial set up.

I am trying to help them dig their way out of this.  I might stop posting here.  Everyone has been incredibly helpful, but I think this problem needs to be handled offline.  Thank you all for your responses.

**TL;DR: My budget is rock solid until a phone call from my dad last night where he told me about a $255K loan in his name.**

I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this all the way through.  I am terrified and fear for the future.  I am a 25/F who is currently living in an apartment.  I make $61,500 a year and max out my 401K, leaving me with $2,548 a month.  I have very minimal bills and do very well for myself.  For reference, my current monthly budget is this:

Rent: 750

Electric: 50

Cell phone: 50

Internet: 60

Food: 300

Emergency fund: 1,000

Flexible spending: 274

Sounds great, right? Well, that's what I thought until a phone call last night that rocked my world.  My dad is absolutely awful with money, and I never knew the extent of it as my parents kept their problems private.  My dad said that he and my mom would pay for my older brother's and my college.  It was greatly appreciated, and I was able to start my life on the right track.  However, it turns out after 3 years, I get a phone call that there is a major problem.  My dad has an extreme loan that includes my brother's college loans, my loans, and loans he took out for a brief period that he enrolled in extra schooling (which he never told anyone about.)  

The total current balance is $259,264.06 at an 8.25% interest rate.  This is comprised of the current principal balance of $255,942.26 and unpaid interest of $3,321.80.  The monthly payments are $1,951.18 and it is obviously only covering part of the interest.  He took out federal loans to handle this and now my parents are over their heads.

I am sick to my stomach as I adore my parents and want to do anything I can to help.  I will move back home if I have to and am willing to give my entire check to help them out.  My mom is not educated and did not understand college loans, so she let my dad handle it and this is what he has done.  They have been married for 31 years and my mom wants to leave him after finding out about this loan.  My dad said he is better off dead and says he wants to stop taking his insulin (as an insulin-dependent diabetic) in order to die and end this problem.  All of this was brought to me in a phone call last night.

I love my parents and would do anything for them.  Yes, my father is awful with money, but I want to help all that I can.  My question is: how much interest is accumulating on a daily basis?  If I paid the $3,321.80 in unpaid interest, how much would have to be paid on a monthly basis to keep the interest down so the principal could start being chipped away? If I set up a 5-year plan, how much money would have to be paid on a monthly basis to pay off this horrible loan?

Relationship advice aside, they are my family and I love them no matter what.  If my parents divorce, that is their business, but I will not go down without a fight.  I will move back home and help them pay this off as much as I can.  

For additional reference, my dad makes $100,000 a year and my mom makes $60,000 a year.

I was told that it was better to refinance for a longer period of time(say 20 years at $500 per month instead of 7 years for $975)  and still pay the $975 instead of the minimum payment.


The reasoning for this was to be able to pay less if I have to (i.e. emergency such as losing my job) and if not, then I can pay the regular amount and still pay it off in the same amount of time.

After hanging up I told myself ""How about I take it all and put it into BTC"".. Because of what I have been seeing in the economy already, I knew it would work out, also **it is on its way to getting worse**, another is because I may be moving to NY and taking all this cash isn't an option.

# Relevant Info

This year I am projected to be making a minimum $138,000 salary. This may be greater depending when the end of the year bonus is distributed (either last paycheck of 2016 or first paycheck of 2017).

* **Income** ≥$138,000
* **Age** Late 20s
* **Location** Oregon, USA
* **Status** Single
* **Contributable Retirement Accounts**
	* Simple IRA (2016 Limit: $12,500)
	* HSA (2016 Limit: $3,350)
	* Roth IRA (2016 Limit: $5,500)
	* Brokerage (Money goes here once the above three are maxed out)

	* Rollover IRA (Current Value: $13,000)
* **Other Info**
	* 100% Debt-free
	* Nine-month emergency fund (+ two months budget buffer)

# Trying to understand the phase out

For the sake of simplicity and education let’s just assume the EOY income is $138,000.

The phase out for a 2016 single filer is the following:

* **Starts at** $117,000
* **Ineligible at** $132,000

Am I correct to assume if my MAGI falls in range the contribution limit is the following linear formula:

    [1 - (MAGI - $117,000)/($132,000 - $117,000)] * $5,500

As an example lets say I max out the Simple IRA and HSA for 2016. My MAGI would be the following:

    $138,000 - $12,500 - $3,350
    =&gt; $122,150

The max contribution limit for the 2016 Roth IRA would then be the following:

    [1 - ($122,150 - $117,000)/($132,000 - $117,000)] * $5,500
    =&gt; $3,611.67

Is this correct?

# Lowering the MAGI

Beginning of every new year I have front-loaded 100% of the available space in the Simple IRA, HSA, and Roth IRA within the first two months. Time in the market &gt; DCA.

Given the new circumstance I obviously shouldn’t front-load the Roth IRA until after 2016 when I am able to calculate the MAGI. Basically I am forced to earmark the funds and hold it in my savings for a year.

Are there additional methods to lower the MAGI below phase out?
Are there tricks to obtain access to the full Roth IRA space?
Are there any other available tax-advantaged accounts at my income level/status?

I am aware there is the Backdoor Roth IRA, but given I have one Traditional IRA account (Rollover IRA), the $5,500 would be subjected to the pro rata rule. Not ideal at all.

    # Tax-free portion
    [$5,500 / ($13,000 + $5,500)] * $5,500
    =&gt; $1,635 (30%)
    
    # Taxable portion
    $5,500 - $1,635
    =&gt; $3,865 (70%)

The ideal method to avoid the situation above is to roll the Traditional into the something like a 401k. Unfortunately I don’t have access to one. And as far as I know rollovers into a SIMPLE IRA are not allowed unless it is SIMPLE IRA → SIMPLE IRA. Also does anyone know if SIMPLE IRA is exempt from pro rata? In the above calculation I didn't include it.

I know I am well above the deductible limit for Traditional IRA contributions for someone covered by a retirement plan at work (end of phaseout for 2016 single filer MAGI: $71,000).

Given the information it seems I may have to settle with either a partial Roth IRA or none at all. And it seems I may be better off just contributing to a taxable over the non-deductible Traditional IRA, assuming my retired income rate puts me in a situation where capital gains tax is less than the federal and state income taxes.

Hopefully someone knows something I don’t.

Would I be better off trying to get money from a bank and paying back to increase my credit or just asking my family with 0% interest. Also, what is a good interest rate for a personal bank loan?

personalfinance,Why Are People Not Refinancing Their Student Loans Once Out Of School &amp; Employed?!?,"I started this conversation with a group of my friends who have been out of school for 5+ years. Almost all of them had not even considered or didn't know it was possible to consolidate and refinance their student loan debt. Only one of them had rid himself of some loans by lumping it in with a new mortgage.

&amp;nbsp;

Why are sooo many people paying high interest loans once graduated and employed?! You're no longer a high risk borrower. There's no reason to pay 6-8% interest when you could be paying 3%. 

&amp;nbsp;


PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! But here are couple questions I had at first and got answered.

&amp;nbsp;

1.) You can combine both private and government loans.

2.) You can pick and choose which individual loans to pay off, even within any given account (I only consolidated loans with interest rates higher than 2.5%)

3.) There're are some risks of consolidating federal loans like loss of Loan-Forgiveness (Most benefits are only available to people working as teachers or at non-profits) (also you may lose the option for deferment of loans. The lender I choose offers unemployment deferment)

&amp;nbsp;

For me personally there was really no down side to consolidating. I went from an average of 7% interest to 3.1%. Also my new lender has AMAZING customer service. Previously I had loans with SallieMae, Navient, and Nelnet; and hated dealing with each and everyone of them. I have some real horror stories, including one of them loosing thousands of dollars in payments. SAVE THOSE PAYMENT RECEIPTS!

&amp;nbsp;

Do some research on which lender works best for you and if refinancing is the best option. You're potentially loosing thousands of dollars, if not 10s of thousands, by not looking into this!!!",finance,1452189543

The student loans are the thing that scare me the most. I belive this amount to be around 30-40k. I am less sure of this amount because I paid some here and there, when I first finished school, and the we have had our taxes withheld because of these loans.

personalfinance,"[28] new years resolution was to get my finances in order, would appreciate advice particularly related to consolidation of loans","Hi Personal Finance, 

I've long lurked in this subreddit and been too afraid to confront my financial reality, but now I need to figure out what the hell I'm doing with my life.  I have in total about $34,000 US in debt, including one credit card maxed out at 1900, a used auto loan I've been making repayment on which currently sits at about 1800, and the balance in student loans, one subsidized Stafford, one unsubsidized Stafford, and one direct student plus.  

I want to start saving for a life, I've met the woman of my dreams and I want to buy her a ring and ask her to marry me.   I can't do that if I am being irresponsible with my finances, and I'm sick of living paycheck to paycheck.  I make about 40k a year from my full time job as an Admin at a university, but I have significant expenses living in a metropolitan area relating to rent, car maintenance, and groceries.  

My credit rating, last time I checked, was around 675. I have a 401k with a current balance of $3,079, but I am not currently contributing to it due to my paycheck to paycheck lifestyle I've been living.

What I'm wondering is this:  Should I pursue loan consolidation, lumping together my credit card, my used auto loan, and my student loans.  The idea of having them all in one place and making a single payment on them is appealing, but I'm wondering if this would cost me more money in the long term.  I did fill out Mint's ""see what I qualify for"" loan application, and they estimated that they could loan me 15k, at 11.12% apr, an interest rate of 8.32%, and monthly payments of 469.15 (which is significantly higher than the current 370 ish payment I make for my auto loan and my student loans separately).  

I know this is a wordy post, but I've long felt overwhelmed to the point of apathy about my finances, I am realizing just how screwed I'll be if I continue that way, so really any help and guidance you great people can provide would fall on grateful ears.  

Thank you sincerely.",finance,1452194409
personalfinance,SCRA pre-service interest rate deduction still available if active duty period was extremely short?,"I recently attended Officer Candidate School and therefore was active duty military beginning on the report date on my orders. Before I reported, I mailed a copy of my orders to credit card and loan companies I have accounts with and requested that SCRA benefits be activated, specifically the requirement to forgive pre-active duty debt interest in excess of 6% APR. This was very recent, so the changes have not gone into effect yet to my knowledge.

Unfortunately I had a family emergency at Officer Candidate School and the best option was for me to Drop On Request to return home, and therefore I have been discharged. Because of this, I was only active duty for less than one week. I know that credit card and loan companies will sometimes check a DOD database to confirm active duty status in addition to reviewing the copy of the orders provided by the servicemember, and I'm sure that since the requests haven't been processed yet, I won't come up as active duty when they do these checks. If they actually are able to verify that I was active duty for a small period, am I still eligible for this benefit? I've noticed that the wording in the SCRA states that the pre-active duty debt in excess of 6% is forgiven rather than deferred, so wouldn't that mean that I'm technically still eligible for that interest to be forgiven? I'm not sure exactly what discharge code was used on my DD214 but I was told it would be some type of miscellaneous code and would be equivalent to an honorable discharge.

The emergency was legitimate and it was a lifelong goal of mine to be a commissioned officer, so I was in no way trying to 'game the system' or anything like that. However, my financial situation isn't great and I have a lot of high interest debt, so if I am still eligible for this benefit, it would be a tremendous help.",finance,1452195144

personalfinance,Recovering from loss of Mother; finances are not. Drowning.,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I will do my best to keep this concise as it is a subject I could talk endlessly on.

I am 28 years old. I lost my father when I was 14. After that it was only my stepmother and myself.

I have not always been great with money, but I had at least gotten to a point where I was paying all my bills on time.

Just over a year ago my mother was diagnosed with Ovarian cancer. They gave her about 3 months to live and that woman fought for 7 she passed.

As I mentioned, she was my stepmother, though she raised me. I have stepsiblings who do not take interest in my life, nor were they around to help during her final weeks.

I spent the greater part of the year travelling between my city and her town (about 2 hours), to take her to chemotherapy and stay with her for the following days to nurse her. Although I did not have disposable income, I did use my credit to by things to make her more comfortable (for example, an electric blanket, a small tv for her bedroom, things not given to us by hospice such as a shower stool, a hotel here and there for when her sister came to town, etc.). I didn't feel warm and fuzzy about the money spent, but if I hadn't done it, no one else would have.

I also had to make the choice to leave that job of 5 years to spend time with her. I have since started working.


So, fast forward to present day: 

I am about $6000 in debt barely scraping by from paycheck to paycheck.

I have one part time job that brings in $1700 a month

I also have a job as a delivery driver that I haven't been able to work due to my license being suspended. I got pulled over a couple of weeks ago and found that I had a 5 year old unpaid ticket that has racked up over $800 in fees. I entered a payment plan and am not eligible to drive once I pay another $105 reinstatement fee.

Here are my monthly finances:
Income: 1700-2100 (depending on when I can drive for my other job)

Rent: 700

Elec: 50

Phone: 100 (I know this is high...I do not have a laptop or internet at home though. I do a lot of work from my phone)

Insurance: 80

Groceries: 250

Debt:

personal loans: $2650

CC 1: $1800

CC 2: $500

CC 3: $900

Tuition: $300

Ticket balance: $600

My credit score is low (576). I applied through my credit union that I've been with for years for a loan and they said no. After I figure out my budget, I have $50 remaining at the end of the month. That gets by the interest rate on my cards.

I feel so overwhelmnod. I still would like to take out a loan, but no one wants to mess with me without a car title (i own my car, but just moved. No telling where that title is) or paystubs (I have worked consistently for at least 7 years, but just began a new job and only have one small paycheck to show for it.

personalfinance,Graduate Student-Should I rent or buy?,"Hello everyone, I am looking into my housing options and I am trying to weigh the benefits of renting vs. buying for my own specific situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Here are the details:
I go to a fairly respected, private, technical school that has an extremely high placement rate (especially for my major), and I will be receiving my bachelors degree in May. I have decided to stay here for graduate school and have applied for the MS program in hopes that I can continue on to get a PhD when I've finished my masters. This means that I will be staying in the area for the next 2-6 years, including summers where I will be doing research. If you are a TA graduate student (which is what I will be), tuition at my school is waived and a stipend of ~$24,000 per year is granted. The town where the school is located is extremely small but has 4 college campuses, so as you can imagine much of the housing is used for renting to college students. My plan is to purchase property and live there while I rent out to other students (2-4 others is the plan). Since the town is so small, it is difficult for students to find decent off-campus housing and rent pricing is fairly high compared to other places. Even though rent is often high, actual property values are fairly low and the people who own these properties are making an absolute killing. It is with this in mind, and the fact that I could potentially be here for another 6 years, that I am looking into buying property instead of renting.
 Here is some relevant financial information for you guys:

* 22 yr/o college senior graduating in May 2016 with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering (currently have an AS in engineering science if that matters)
* currently ~120k in debt (all from college loans), interest rates on loans range from 2%-3% and are fixed

* current credit score is ~725 (all from a credit card in my name that has been in use since I was 18, and I have 
never missed a payment)

* Properties being looked into are in upstate New York and are in the $80,000-$150,000 range

* Currently I have only ~3,000$ in savings

* Grad student stipend is ~$24,000 per year

* Rent is typically $800-$900 a month if I didn't buy my own home

It is worth noting that I do not have to pay off my college loans and they do not incur interest until my education is complete, including finishing graduate school. My reasoning for buying rather than renting is that I could take the money I would be spending on rent and use it for my home, and at the same time be covering that mortgage cost with what I make from my tenants. When I am finished with school I plan to keep the property, and possibly buy more, as another source of income. I have many questions that my research online hasn't been able to answer and I am looking for any advice that reddit can provide, thank you for the taking the time to read my post!",finance,1452199186
investing,I saved old newspapers from 2008. This isn't 2008.,"I was subscribed to the WSJ as part of a college class I was in at the time. At some point I thought I was seeing some unique headlines, so I started saving them. I didn't get all the good ones (somehow didn't think to save the Lehman bankruptcy), but enough to look back on market sentiment at the time. With so many people comparing today's markets to 2008, I think this is a good time to reflect on it.

From a US perspective, this doesn't look or feel like a repeat to me. I haven't seen anything that would say the US economy is in trouble. I think it's more likely a reversion to the mean. We far overshot the appropriate valuations, and we're just getting back to those levels. The Fed's actions certainly influenced stock prices, and they had to start letting things to back to normal at some point. Everything is gonna be fine (unless you bought something that was way above an appropriate valuation, then you're probably screwed, sorry).

China is a big deal, but people who are smarter than me have been calling them out for a long time (since at least 2005). Their infrastructure spending and FX controls were unsustainable, and a huge part of last year's market rise came from new, inexperienced investors entering the market. This affects commodity demand, but not much else. I think China's weakness is a net positive for the US.

Personally, I love it when stocks go down. It's the part of the rollercoaster where everybody screams. You get to see who was making foolish trades and who actually knows what they're doing. I've been waiting for this for a long time. Stocks might finally be going on sale again.

personalfinance,Is it safe to keep the money in my account until I figure out what to do with it?,"**The Story**: I inherited (actually was gifted) stock in a private company a year or so ago that at the time was valued around $25k. Just before the holidays the company president worked out a merger deal in which stockholders would be bought out. We voted, the merger passed, and I've been asked to hand over my stock certificate to an escrow company in exchange for some $75k. 

**The Background**: 

* My income is unpredictable and I work three jobs; one is seasonal and the others are on a project by project basis with one of those being a 1099. I believe I made less than $24k last year. The most I've ever made was $30k when I had a 9 to 5. I don't know what I want to ""do"" with my life. 
* I've got about $25k in federal student loans, with rates varying between 3% and 7%.
* I live in my girlfriend's house and pay her utilities. 
* I drive a Chevy gas-guzzler with a blown carrier bearing (and a host of other safety/reliability issues). I need a vehicle to get me to work. 
* I'm at least partially literate in finance and I know the basics of picking stocks from my time working for financial advisers. 
* It's my understanding that I may need to pay the capital gains tax of 15% on the $50k difference. 
* I'm interested in paying off most, if not all of my student loans (depends what y'all say). I obviously need an emergency fund. I'm also interested in investing this money for retirement as well as for future generations. I probably need a safer car. I would love to someday purchase some land for a home and perhaps some farming ventures. I'd love to buy some plane tickets and enjoy some travel while I'm still young. 

**The Questions**: 

* Is it OK for me to send in my stock certificate to the third party (via certified mail) and pay a $50 fee for them to wire the $75k to my bank, presumably my savings account, until I figure out what I need to do with it? 
* Given my plans for paying off loans and reinvesting, will I have to pay more taxes than necessary if I put the money in my bank account now? 
* The third party is asking me to fill out a W9 and claiming they will pay the state taxes (the stock is for a company in NY). Does that all sound legit? 
* Do I need a tax attorney? Do I need a financial adviser? 
* edit: Does paying off my student loans change the amount I will pay in capital gains? What about for starting a retirement account?",finance,1452201756

I have about $6,000 dollars in credit card debt because I was young, poor, and stupid. Now the finance charges are starting to hit me where it hurts. On one of my cards, it basically nullifies each monthly payment, so my total balance basically goes nowhere.

My new year's resolution is to tackle my credit card debt head on, and it also involves canceling one of my cards and putting the other in a locked safe to use in absolute emergencies only.

personalfinance,Looking for help with online banks.,"Hey everybody, recently I have found out about these online banks that offer amazing interest rates on checking and savings accounts. I'm sure most of you guys have heard of them by now, but I have done a lot of research on these accounts and still have questions. 

So most of these banks offer interest rates anywhere between .10% - .89%. But that just seems to good to be true. I know they don't have physical locations, thus they pass the savings onto the customers but when they say .20% interest would I expect to actually see 20% interest earned on my money? Let me ask that again in a different way, for example; If I open an account at .20% interest or .20% APY (usually both interest rate and APY are the same for most banks I've researched) and deposit $5,000 does that mean I will earn $1,000 in interest on my original $5,000? (Because if so, shouldn't I put most if not all of my non-savings money into an account like this?)

Another question I have is while these banks are great for direct deposit and paying bills online or automatically, they do have a downfall which is depositing cash. I know there are a few solutions to this problem, but the solution I like the best is linking a physical bank account to your online one. This gives you access to a physical bank to deposit cash, that you can then transfer to your online checking (bill paying) account.

So my question for you is IF I were to make this change to online banking, how would I do it to make my money work for me best, while still having a physical bank to deposit cash?

personalfinance,Continued Problem with Wells Fargo forced insurance is hurting my credit score.,"I made a post a few weeks ago about Well Fargo. I bought a car from them 6 months ago and I have paid my car payment on time each month. About 4 months ago they charged me close to $1000 for forced insurance. They claimed we didn't have insurance at the time we purchased the car which is untrue. Since then we had provided them proof of insurance 3 times. Each time we talked to our car insurance company and they assured us we had no lapse in coverage. Wells did credit me for all but $130 of the money they charged me for insurance. They then applied my car payment to the insurance not to my instead of my car payment, do every month about the time my car payment is due they call me and tell me my payment is late  and we go through the same cycle again.  After sending them a copy of all my payments the collection manager has apologized and refunded late fees but I still often get calls, hell I even got one on Christmas Eve.

I was frustrated and made a post a month ago and received some solid advice about insurance laws, but around the same time my wife had a three way call with my insurance company and Wells. Wells requested a different form of proof of insurance which was faxed to them and they said that it should take care of everything. I should note originally they were telling me since we didn't add the car to my policy on the Saturday we bought the car there was a one month lapse, my insurance company told me this is untrue in Ky. Also I requested that Wells send me a written notice of what I owed them and they will not.  They claim they send us a written notice before we were charged for insurance but I did not get one. 

This month we got calls again, apparently the 3 way call and new insurance form didn't solve the problem.  Worse than that we are thinking about buying a house in the next 6 months and we have been talking to banks.  Today the finance guy told us that Wells is reporting all of our payments as being late, and it is hurting our score to the point it will cause us to pay a higher interest rate.  He also said he has had 4 clients before us have the exact same issue.  

At this point I may just pay this and move on, but I really don't want to do that.  I feel like they are scamming me. Wells specifically lost a class action lawsuit over forced insurance on mortgages.  Frankly I am tired of getting screwed over and not being able to do anything about this.",finance,1452207420

My very kind parents lent me that money to pay it off, that I am to return $100 per month. I have $9500 in student loans from my post-bacc program which I completed in order to get my masters in public health. However, I dropped out of that program a couple of months ago, resulting in about $25K in student loans, due to health issues and the decision to change career goals.

I am currently living off my credit card and some leftover student loan money; I currently have about $14K in credit card debt. I also have quite a few medical bills that I am slowly paying off. I have assistance in terms of food stamps, and will be applying to temporary disability, and am hoping that this depressive episode will end in a month or two, allowing me to work full-time (I am usually pretty high functioning, but have to call off work more than employers would appreciate.) I will be applying to full disability just in case. If I am approved, I can bring in about $1200 a month, and make a couple grand on top of that without losing my benefits. Ideally, I will find something that can accommodate my needs. I do live in Cleveland, and have no plans of moving. Cleveland has a very low cost of living, and I don't really doubt that I could find something that would allow me to break even, and normally when I am not in such a serious episode, I can work quite a bit - probably make a slow dent in my debt. When I was healthier, I was able to pay off some of my debt. There may be times when I am not so productive, however. Working with the disability office will help me find a job that I could legitimately keep (it wouldn't be something minimum wage; probably something about $15 per hour.) I'm considering some options: pharmacy tech, copy editing. I am planning on Ubering very soon, as I can make my schedule when I am feeling well (which is about half the week right now), and I also tutor as a side job (which is quite lucrative.) I have seriously cut down on my spending, and am far more frugal than previously. 

I would ultimately like to purchase a home in Cleveland (this is a dream goal for me - I would like to get married, but no kids.) A move-in ready home in the neighborhood I would like to settle down would be about $100K, so I'm thinking a down payment of about $10K with a mortgage that is most likely cheaper than my current rent ($525 for one bedroom). Cleveland also has many duplexes, and some people rent out the other part of the duplex to cover their mortgage (often plus extra.) I understand that owning a house would really allow me to refinance my credit card debt, which have really high interest rates (18%). Is this plan completely unrealistic? Should I focus on simply paying off my debt, or is a longer term goal of saving up for a down payment make more sense (I currently have about $2.5K in my bank account)? Should I expect bankruptcy at some point? If I do declare bankruptcy, when/how/could I still purchase a home? Is there some sort of financial scheming I could do? I understand there are many, many factors in this equation, and there is probably no good answer. Any advice, suggestions, or simply circumstances I have not considered would be greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Issues with a home purchase. Need some input/advice.,"I'm in the middle of closing on a home purchase, got to the point where I was to sign the loan documents and everything with the title company. The main thing we were waiting to hear back from was our request for repairs. Originally they said that they ""might"" give us half of what we requested for in repair costs in lieu of doing the repairs themselves. We responded that if that happened we would walk away. They turned around and said that they will now give us the full amount we asked for, but are now no longer giving us a roof certification that was in our original agreement. At this point, I was fed up with everything, and had fallen out of love with this house. Another point to mention is that I never signed the Contingency removal letter, because I wanted to protect my earnest money deposit. We sent the cancellation letter today because they still had not responded in giving us the 2 year roof certification, so I told my realtor to send the cancellation letter. She sent it and as soon as she did, they are now saying that they'll get the roof certification done before close.

Now I'm hearing that I may not get my earnest money deposit back because it has to be a mutual agreement between myself and the seller to get that money back, and they have done everything that I have asked for. My realtor is fighting for me, but I don't understand how this is even an issue with never signing the contingency removal, and we declined their counter offer when they removed our roof cert. Am I just being naive? Or should I definitely get that money back? Any input/advice is much appreciated.    





**TL;DR-** Seller removed roof certiciation that was in the original agreement at the last minute, so we declined their counter and want to walk away. Now they are doing the roof certification, and trying to keep my earnest money deposit if I walk away.",finance,1452211952
personalfinance,Awkward situation with PMI on home mortgage,"Hi everyone,
So I am closing on my first home at the beginning of February and we plan to put down 15% on a 30 yr fixed rate private Mortgage.  We already have $10000 of equity in the home after our appraisal.  Based on that and our incomes we should hit 20% equity in about 3 months and 20% of the purchase price in 4 months.
When and how can we cancel PMI? I am reading conflicting things online.
1. The Federal Homeowners Protection says we can request cancellation at 18.5 to 20% equity and they must cancel at 22% equity
2. We have to pay PMI until our scheduled 78% date (5 ish years)

What's the deal? Should we borrow from relatives short term to get 20%?

Any help is greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Just finished with Bankruptcy. Lawyer suggested a program to rebuild my credit but I'm being denied for credit card applications.,"I started my bankruptcy back in Feb 2015 and my case was finally closed a few days ago. It's time to slowly rebuild my credit again. My bankruptcy lawyer suggested a program called 720creditscore that gives lessons on what and how to go about rebuilding my credit to 720 in 24 months.

One of the first lessons in this program suggests applying to 3-5 credit cards listed at www.720creditcards.com (or just replace the last 2 words with either securedcards or subprime). I guess these are supposed to be easy to apply to cards with really crappy interest rates/fees but the lessons from this program should help me use them wisely until my credit score is back in good terms.

My problem is that none of those cards accepted me. Credit Karma tells me that Transunion and Equifax show 650~ scores (but I'm sure my real FICO score is 550~). Where would I go from here if I wanted to rebuild my credit? I thought this was the sure fire way for me to put small purchases (gas, groceries, necessities) and just pay them off to slowly rebuild.

I financials are:

Salary: 52,000k/year

Bills: Cell (78/month), Auto (200/month), Auto Insurance (170/month)

The bottom line is that it's next to impossible for me to afford my monthly loan payments on my private loans from Sallie Mae. I've managed to lower my federal and state loans to a very reasonable amount through income-based repayment plans, but I have these awful ""Smart Option"" private loans from Sallie Mae that have left me with $1300/month in payments.

Right now I was considering calling Sallie Mae and asking to put my loans in forbearance while I search for another job, but this is obviously a temporary fix.

Can anyone give me insight into what I can do to help out my financial situation month-to-month?

investing,US Market 2016 predictions and strategy,"The plan: Based on the reasons noted in the links, there is good reason to believe that the bull market has ended and is headed for a sharp correct back to pre-QE levels, estimating about a 60% decrease. 

**Step 1:** The S&amp;P 500 will experience a sizable correction

**Step 2:** After what I think will be about an initial 20% correction, the Fed will probably do all of the following things: NIRP (negative interest rate policy), QE4 (which will be the last hurrah of asset purchases, using all of the fire power they have), and unleash helicopter money (which means giving a tax-free payout to citizens to help increase spending). As noted here (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-05/we-frontloaded-tremendous-market-rally-former-fed-president-admits-warns-no-ammo-lef) the former Dallas Fed President believes that the Fed has no more real ammo left to sustain the current market environment.

- Regarding helicopter money, you can see that this is a very real possibility with Finland already utilizing this tactic (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-06/it-begins-desperate-finland-set-unleash-helicopter-money-drop-all-citizens) and Citigroup's Chief Economist saying that this is a valid strategy (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-29/citigroup-chief-economist-thinks-only-helicopter-money-can-save-world-now). The only problem is that 2/3 of American's don't have any savings (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-01-07/sad-state-affairs-two-thirds-americans-have-no-emergency-savings), so why the heck would people actually spend this money when they have no savings and are neck deep in debt. 

**Step 3:** The real bear market starts after these last ditch efforts by the Fed. This is when you hedge your 80% stock allocation by purchasing TVIX -- a 2x leveraged ETF that tracks volatility -- with your 20% in cash. Conservatively, I think TVIX will increase by at least 400% from the peak of the Fed’s final intervention. By looking at the following 6 month historical chart of TVIX (http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=TVIX+Interactive#{""range"":""6mo"",""allowChartStacking"":true}), you can see that the stock increased by almost 400% during the August event when markets limited down and fell about 7% in a span of five trading days.

Not to say that there isn’t risk in this trade which has such swift swing movements, but in my opinion, this is the perfect hedge by replacing a potential wipe out of your 80% in stocks with a potential gain of 400% with TVIX. 

I also believe the buy-and-hold approach that has been really successful for you is a thing of the past. I think this next recession will mark the end of Central Bank intervention. By looking at the historical S&amp;P 500 chart, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the stock market exponentially increased right around the time when the Fed started expanding their balance sheet and intervened in the market. Of course, there are other reasons for these increases (e.g. innovation creating high growth revenue streams). But, to give an example, instead of letting the Dot-com bubble naturally pop they decided to intervene making the subsequent crash that much worse.

Here are several other articles that should be helpful when you consider this plan:

- Retail investors (you and me) are always the ones that are crippled during recessions while the “smart” money gets to the sidelines, invests in volatility / gold, shorts the market, etc. (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-30/next-time-your-financial-advisor-tells-you-buy-stocks-show-them-chart).

- In addition to the Fed, corporate buyback programs have been another big reason why stocks haven’t fallen...yet http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-05-10/chart-day-record-stock-buybacks-hit-escape-velocity. Of course, in addition to CEO compensation plans being based on stock prices, the Fed’s Zero Interest Rate Policy is to blame for record corporate stock buybacks by giving them incredibly cheap loans. Now it’s ending (http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-07/why-stock-buyback-spree-may-be-ending) so how many corporations, not just banks, will have to be bailed out this time?


It appears that we’re already in a recession...the Fed and corporate buyback programs are the only things keeping the stock market afloat. So what happens when the bubble pops? Consumers start spending even less, companies revenues decrease, they have to cut costs by laying people off to increase their profit margin, thus causing people to have no source of income (they already have no savings), so they default on their auto loans, can’t pay off their student loans, etc. etc. 

It’s going to get ugly and I unfortunately think it’s going to be worse than ‘08. Recessions are supposed to be an opportunity for reform. If only we actually learned our lessons and didn’t sacrifice everything for the fear of short term pain.",finance,1452224319

personalfinance,Question about Student Loans Wiki,"Hello PF, 

I have been researching student loan consolidation for a few days now, and have been bouncing in and out of a few different resources. I have researched multiple private loan options - and gotten a few quotes for variable and fixed rate consolidation loans in the 2.5 - 5% range. 

 I was reading through the [student loans wiki via the banner](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans), and noticed some of the information about consolidation didn't match up with my understanding of what is available. Specifically - the benefits to consolidation seem much more than ""minimal.""

&gt;  ""Federal Loan Consolidation - For federal loans, the monetary benefits for consolidation are minimal""

Additionally, I seem to be finding private options below ~5% even with my credit being just ""average.""
&gt;Private Loans There are number of companies out there that specialize in refinancing and consolidating private and federal loans. Each company is different but generally the lowest I have seen for refinancing is ~5% for borrowers with good credit. 


I'm wondering if this is because I'm not comprehending something, or the information is a bit outdated. Figured I would pose the question as a call to update - or just a call to update my understanding :). 


Edit: I see now that the ""Federal Loan Consolidation"" was referring to consolidating federally not just consolidating your federal loans.

 That said - the general private loan consolidation rate given is still a little high and what threw me off. 

Anyone who stumbles upon this post considering consolidation right now - from what I have learned it's not a good time to get a variable rate loan. Most have lower offered base rates but the actual rate each month is calculated by the base rate you qualify for, plus the 1month LIBOR. For the last &gt;3years the Libor has hovered below .2 (So if you qualify for a 2.15% consolodation loan your interest rate a given month with a .2 1mo-LIBOR would be 2.35%), in the past 2 months the 1mo Libor has more than doubled as the [Fed Raises interest Rates](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/17/your-money/how-to-handle-your-finances-after-a-fed-rate-increase.html). It's possible that private fixed rate loans could see a hike in rates because of this, but that's only an intuitive statement.",finance,1452257618

**Terror on Moonbase Alpha** - Chapter 52 Part 2
___
___


It was a rush unlike any that she had ever felt before, a power that enveloped and charged every iota of her being.  She could feel the Overmind squirming in her grasp, trying to break free. 

Something else slashed at her in wide, desperate arcs, trying to scrape her off, to pull her free.  Another slash and another - it was pulling at her, getting more and more ferocious, lashing out again and again and again but the energy was flowing through her now, beyond her, up into the entity's grasp, joining them - binding them.  

The memory burned and the waves of energy continued to cascade upward through the 'fingers' of the Overmind, up through the invisible arm, carrying her into someplace deeper - into a place that she wasn't supposed to be.

Kara was connected to its mind now, its true mind, its... core... and she could feel the seed of fear that had taken root within it begin to blossom.  This 'fear' wasn't quite the same though, she could sense that it wasn't an 'emotion' per se, more like an 'alarm'.  More akin to a warning klaxon than a true, nuanced, layered, kind of fear. 

The klaxons were certainly warranted, however and so she decided not to belabor the point.  She had breached its defenses in a way that it hadn't expected, had caught it entirely off guard and she could feel it scrambling desperately to hold her off, to push her back - only she had no intention of letting it.

Kara shoved her way forward, fully into the core -- and found herself looking at the planet Earth through billions of eyes.  

On Earth, in cities, in towns, on farmland and even aircraft carriers the creatures stood silently amongst the frozen humans, unmoving, unblinking... waiting.

Could she put it all back?  Could she undo the damage that had been wrought?  The memories were here, inside her -- inside it -- she could feel them, but she couldn't single them out... they were meant to be food, meant to be processed for energy, there were no catalogs of what came from whom.

There was no going back.

But that didn't mean that those precious memories would have to go to waste!

With a pit forming in her gut she called out to the creatures, told them to leave the planet, to leave orbit - to head home.

And they moved all at once, without questioning, without thinking, fleeing the planet as suddenly as they had arrived.  Through her billions of eyes she saw the imperfect roundness of the Earth shrink away as if being slowly enveloped by the darkness.

As they left her planet behind, before they stepped through space to return home, Kara sent the memories out, emptying the contents of the Overmind's 'stomach' into the minds of the creatures.  They may never know or truly understand what these memories were... but at least they'd live on somewhere, safe, protected.

With a series of flashing blips, the creatures took the first of many, many jumps back across the void, back to their home planet.

Then there was only darkness and distant stars.

There was silence and she was alone.

In that silence she felt the first pangs of hunger dig deep within her.

Here, from the driver's seat, with a full accounting of the Overmind's 'body' at her command, she understood why it had come running like it had. 

When it had discovered her planet it was not unlike a starving man wandering through the wastes stumbling upon a feast laid out just for him.

The body, its body, needed sustenance, constant sustenance and it had been so long since it had fed, it was already so weak, so tired.

It was dying of starvation.

The Overmind had been searching for a long time for a new source of food -- it hadn't been joking when it asked her if she knew how hard it had been to 'find nourishment'.  Time and time again it had sent the creatures farther and farther away, deeper and deeper into space, returning empty each and every time.

Until the moment that it had received that signal, that briefest bit of connection from the one that was taken.  That connection that was so weak, so far away.

*Nourishment*.

It had barely the energy to send the others outward, it wouldn't be able to wait for their return.  It would have to go with them, it would have to risk the journey.

And, in sending the creatures back home, in setting those memories free, Kara had all but sealed its fate.

She could feel its mind thrumming in the background, scratching and clawing and fighting for control.  It could still call them back, it could still feed, it wasn't too late.

The gnawing pains of hunger were getting more intense and she could feel the straining, near-anguish of the Overmind, it didn't want to die.

There, in the moment, she felt a sting of pity for this lonely, pathetic thing growing within her - like one might feel for a dog that has gone feral or, no... that wasn't right.

This thing had never been tame.  

This creature was a rattlesnake, a scorpion, a lion on the Savannah - it was a predator acting in accordance with its nature.

It was starving, it had found food, it was eating.

But this time the food had fought back -- even if it wasn't quite aware that it'd had a champion.

For an honest second she considered that, if things were different, she could've destroyed the memories of this place, of her planet and sent it off elsewhere. 

But, even then, would she have dared to doom another planet, some other unsuspecting race?  Would she even chance such a thing?

No.

Slipping behind the scenes but keeping her 'hand on the wheel', so to speak, she looked back then stepped back into the mind of the creature. The architecture was different, undoubtedly alien, yet she knew what she was looking at the moment she saw it: The memories of the Overmind.  

All that it was, everything that had ever mattered, everything that it had collected and held dear over the eons and eons of its existence.

Kara stared at it, the collection that barely filled a corner of the room, and found herself oddly unimpressed; then she realized just how many of her own most treasured memories were caused by, or, at the very least, in the presence of those whom she loved or cared for or respected.

The first memory was easy to find, it was a simple thing that sent overwhelming, roaring pains of hunger through her the moment that she'd touched it. The second was just as powerful though some significant amount of time had passed between the two.  Kara reached down and, before she could even touch it she realized that this memory, whatever it was, was something special.  There was almost an 'aura' around it.  

She held it close and though incredibly fleeting, she found herself feeling, as if for the first time ever, sated.  

Not 'full', not 'bursting at the seams', merely 'not hungry'.

Looking through the rest of the memories she quickly realized why that memory was so prized: it was the only one of its kind.

Before she left the creature behind, Kara took the time to bear witness to each of the other memories.  She figured that it was the very least that she could do: to not let them just disappear, forever, into oblivion. 

The second most-prized memory was the moment that it had felt welcomed by the green-grey skinned creatures -- in fact, a vast majority of those memories were collected while 'living' amongst them.  There were stories that played out in shared psychic flashes - images of terrible six-winged creatures that dive-bombed from the layer of clouds to snatch and grab at their prey.  

Moments of almost-joy in watching the sun peak through the haze across the alien landscape, the creatures whooping and dancing with joy as the light hit their skin directly, as they crowded together to feed.

Shared flashes of sorrow as the creatures lost one of their own, one of the young ones, to the snarling vines.  It had happened so fast that it had barely been noticed - a flash of movement, a tiny psychic scream... and then silence.

Yet through them all, underneath each and every memory, was an ever-increasing sense of that growing hunger.  How long had it managed to live amongst them against its nature?  How long had it watched them play and frolic as the pains grew within it?

The 'most used' memory, the one that had clearly been played over and over and over in the days since its inception, was a long string of psychic humming.  It was a sound that the Overmind had found soothing and calming - a needed distraction from the pains of its own existence.

The last memory was one that would've felt almost 'sorrowful', if it had ever been capable of feeling such an emotion.  In this memory, driven to near-madness by hunger, it had tried to survive the long sleep with its companions but the sleep had opened its mind to them, had revealed the great yawning chasm of its hunger to them.  And they were terrified.  It had tried to reach out to them, but they cowered in fear and would no longer talk.

There it found itself alone again, alone and beyond hungry and surrounded by food.  So it had eaten.  Only enough, only just enough.  And then it had remembered its thought.  Its first thought.  The idea of having food brought to it.  So it had set to work on the sleeping creatures, those who had once welcomed it so warmly, determined to never be hungry again.

As that last memory played itself out, Kara stood there in the darkness, felt the long, sickening shudders that were wracking the Overmind's body and knew that the entity was, indeed, nearing its end.

Carefully she pulled two memories from their home and left them playing on a loop, using one last burst of its psychic energy to boost her away, to send her back.

And there it was, on the edge of oblivion, that the Overmind drifted from existence to the hums of its friends, feeling warm and sated for the last time.

personalfinance,What is the best way to handle my student loan disbursement?,"I am currently taking out more loans to attend graduate school and I am also receiving assistance from my employer.
My undergraduate loans are currently in deferment.  

I have a $5,000 credit on my account because of the disbursement from my loan provider and my employer sponsored payment.

I have a few options:

- Receive the loan refund of $5,000 and hold it to pay for my summer courses. (Financial aid office recommended this option since I could keep the $5,000 in the bank and accrue a ""interest"" on my account... With less than 1% interest in a savings account this is a laughable scenario)
- Receive the loan refund of $5,000 and put it towards a undergrad student loan with a higher interest rate (the grad school loan is a direct unsubsidized Stafford at 5.84% and I have some undergrad loans of 6-6.8%).
- Return the loan disbursement back to the loan provider and reduce the amount of my loan, then request for more funds for my summer course work.

I don't really see any downsides to it other than having two banks now instead of just one. I will probably keep my account with my original bank (BoA) for a while because I have some automated deposits and withdrawals that would be a pain to switch around.",finance,1452262896
personalfinance,"I goofed, missed the deadline for an inherited 401k, and now I've got a big check coming. Put it back in the IRA?","So as the title, and my username suggests, I inherited portions of two accounts from my late grandfather, and screwed up. The smaller bank inherited IRA is fine, around $10k just hanging out. The other account, a 401k, had a 65 day time limit which was up yesterday I guess, meaning they took out the taxes, and I'm now being sent a check of around $35k. I took the required distribution, not realizing that I still had to call again to get the two accounts merged, and then I got really sick, and only recently started getting healthy again to focus on everything else. After an hour on the phone with the investment company, I'm told that when the check arrives, I have 60 days to cash it, and then send them out a check to get it deposited into the IRA account, since the whole plan was to have the two merged into one account anyways.

I don't have an emergency fund set up, I've got smaller debts (under $15k), and I owe the state about $2k in taxes from mistakes made last year (left a job, took the 401k, didn't take out enough taxes), and make about $2200 a month. Let's just say grandpa was smart about money, I've never been given the tools to be as wise (mother was no where near financially stable--cars repossessed, bad credit, etc.), and I've never seen this much money at once. I'm working on getting better with money, even before his death I had set up an account with Simple as it's gotten good reviews about setting saving goals and making it easier to do so, and then all of this happened so I haven't made much progress with that account.

My question is this: Do I do exactly as they say and route it right back into the IRA, or do I have it sit, minus ALL of the tax penalties, in my checking account? I have absolutely no experience with financial planning outside of a small contribution to my current employer's 401k, and to be honest the thought of investing money and risking loss when I could just have it sit in a savings account instead is making me question my next move.

Thanks for taking the time to read, and I know a lot of you will be shaking your head as you read this, so I appreciate any advice or commentary you might have, even if it's to tell me what a dummy I am. In the meantime I'll keep reading through the wikis to further understand what all these accounts mean.

EDIT: I'm overwhelmed by the highly informative and helpful responses, and can't thank you all enough for not making me feel like more of an idiot than I already did this morning. I definitely got the message loud and clear, I discovered that we get a referral service for financial planners through work, so I reached out to them and will hopefully hear by Monday, and in the meantime I'm going to look into CPAs myself to see who's around me and can take a look at this mess. When the check comes, depending on what the planner says, I'm going to route it right back into whatever ""untouchable"" account it qualifies for, and then focus on bringing down my debt with my tangible funds. I know I'll also be receiving a portion of the proceeds of the estate sale in the next few months, and I'll utilize that as my savings/pay off a chunk of debt/emergency fund, and just focus on getting a better budget in the meantime. Thank you all so much for your advice again, I definitely feel more confident in what questions I need to be asking whatever planner I speak to.",finance,1452263565

stocks,The implications of the Chinese stock market tumble are exaggerated.,"I wrote most of this as a reply deep in a thread, but I'm interested in a discussion.

The fall in Chinese stock prices is being thought of as damaging to the Chinese economy, and taken as a sign of the economy's fundamental weakness in general. But the fall in prices is not nearly as damaging as a similar fall would be in the West, and its implications are being exaggerated. Firstly, stocks (only account for 15% of household financial assets in China)[http://uk.businessinsider.com/chinese-households-invest-little-in-stocks-2015-7?r=US&amp;IR=T], and have not decreased significantly over a year ago. Second, the Chinese economy is not as organized around finance as Western economies. I'll explain what I mean by that below. So whereas in the West, stock prices tend to measure people's general willingness to invest, Chinese stock prices measure no more than people's willingness to invest in stocks. People could be turned off of stocks in China, but investment would still continue, because of differences in the structure of the economy.

The total value of the Chinese stock market has not changed since a year ago. The Shanghai Composite Index is [down only 3% over 9 Jan 2015, despite a huge bubble in the middle](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/.SSEC).

So, investment in stocks has been virtually zero-sum in China. Money has moved around, but there is not less than before.

An important thing to understand about China is that the Chinese economy is not as overwhelmingly financial as Western economies. That is, in the West, organization and innovation leading to growth occur when money can accumulate in public companies by investment, or in private hands by lending. This is dictated by stock investors' and banks' willingness to invest or lend, respectively, which is largely a function of financial mood, measured by stock prices and interest rates.

In China, contrarily, most organization and investment is either state-financed or privately-financed. That is, the willingness to invest is not dictated by people's expectation that stock prices will rise or banks' expected return. Rather, it is dictated mostly either by the extremely long-termist state economic planners, building infrastructure, etc., in order to produce a more organized and productive society/economy; or by the already rich elites, who invest in order to recover future profits. Their long-termism is evidenced by their preemptive construction of ""ghost cities"", much maligned in the West, which [Forbes predicts will eventually be ""filled"" as China's urban population grows as expected.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2015/07/20/what-will-become-of-chinas-ghost-cities/)",finance,1452267914
personalfinance,Using My Credit Card Balance,"I have read using your full credit balance can be bad for my credit score, just a little background I am 21 with a decent job and I go to university.

It is no interest rate for twelve months. If I pay this in full before twelve months will this have a bad impact on my credit score?",finance,1452268591
investing,Does this not worry anyone else?,"I posted this as a response in another topic but figured more people would see it this way.

There's a stone cold assumption that the stock market is fairly priced now but what data are you guys look at to support that?

The market expansion in recent years was due to the expansion of P/E ratios and not earnings. Now that free money(QE) has stopped these ratios will contract to more reasonable values.

Look at a company like PG as a perfect example because it's a stock that will generally be a steady eddy during downturns. In 2007 it sold at a P/E of 22.6, a bit high for a mature company. It fell down to 16.8 with the market crash in 2008 - a reasonable P/E for a mature company if a bit high. Then it rose and rose and it's now at a 26.5 as of 2015. How is that reasonable for a mature company that's growing their earnings in the single digits. Analysts expect a 6% earnings contraction in 2016 and then 5yr growth in the 7% range. That seems like a steep price to pay for that type of growth. 
This stock market has a ways to go before the fundamentals no longer support a big reduction.

People flocked to stocks because there's no alternative investments due to low interest rate and cheap debt. Companies leveraged up on cheap debt and will likely tank hard when and if the economy starts to contract. A 26 P/E for a company like PG(a great company no doubt) is freaking steep by any sort of historical measure. Sure you can say that historical measures no longer apply because of current economic conditions but I totally don't agree.",finance,1452268665
personalfinance,Does it ever make sense to buy a house without 20% down,"Hi,

I'm a 24 year old male with a decent job (~$62K/year, that is consistently increasing) and a long term SO that is about to be my fiancee.

My thinking is we will both a solid jobs and would buy something we can afford but also trying to take advantage of historically low interest rates. I know rates my change by that time but I doubt by much.

personalfinance,Diverting 401k contributions towards eliminating PMI,"Hi all, I'm considering reducing my 401k contributions in order to make extra principal payments on my new mortgage to get to 80% LTV more quickly. I do not want to take out a loan against the 401k. I'm already making extra payments of $140 per month towards this goal, but could raise that amount if I reduced my other savings goals. I had some extra cash after renovations and moving in so I made an extra payment in December. At my current rate, I'd reach 80% somewhere around 10/2019.

I'm 27 and in addition to the 401k I am also maxing out my Roth IRA contributions. If it matters, I have a 60:40 split in the 401k traditional:roth contributions. I wouldn't reduce my contribution by a huge amount, probably 5-7k per year. This would move the PMI drop to around 9/2017.

personalfinance,UK - Sell or remortgage current houses to buy a new one?,"My partner and I each own properties which we rent out, we currently live in rented accommodation ourselves as the properties we own aren’t suitable for our needs. 

My property is worth around £170k and yields a rent of £675 pcm, I owe £38k on the mortgage. My partner’s property is worth around £140k, yields a rent of £650 pcm and she owes £80k on the mortgage.

We are now in a position where we would like to move out of rented accommodation and purchase another property, this is because neither of us have a pension and feel that buying another property, whilst keeping the two we currently have will result in having two properties to sell come retirement, I am 42 and she is 41.

We have seen another house we would like to purchase at £270k, neither of us have any savings to speak of for a deposit. I am employed and earn £34k, she is self-employed and has an income of around £5k but has only been running her business for just over a year. 

We have seen a mortgage adviser who confirmed we can re-mortgage our current properties releasing equity from them to raise a sizeable deposit (£104k) and get a mortgage for the remaining up to the £270k.

My question is, is this the right thing to do or should we consider selling our rental properties to release capital and pay it all off the new property? We would only need a mortgage for £87k in that case so could pay that off quickly and then consider another investment for retirement. The re-mortgages and new mortgage are affordable even with the expected imminent (and some future) hikes in interest rates.

personalfinance,I have no emergency fund. My company got bought out - option to close 401k.,"Let me start by saying I'm semi active in the PF community. Throwaway username because I forgot my other one. My company was just bought out by a big corporation (boo) and everything's changing. Including my nice 401k match of 4% (down to 1% now). 



Anyways, upon switching over to new company ownership, employees have the option to rollover 401k to new account, roll to IRA, or close out. I'm 24, live in CA. Federal tax bracket 25%. 



Current 401k balance $1650 (I stopped contributing for a while because of money issues. Yes I know this is dumb, considering I was leaving free money on the table with my 4% match). 




I have a 401k loan balance of $440 right now (more than half paid off). About $40 from each pay check goes toward that. **I have no emergency fund.**  I'm using YNAB with a focus on simply staying in the green each month. Obviously I'm working toward an emergency fund of at least a month's income then up to 3...but I'm a ways away. Sticking to my budget for a whole month has been a victory this far. 



I have a few questions after Googling stuff I would really appreciate your guys help on!

• if I were to cash out, I'd stuff it all in savings account to act as my emergency fund. (I'd contribute more to it until I reach 3 months income). How much money would I get after the early close out penalty and paying taxes on it twice (I think?) forgive me I'm terrible with math :( 

• I read that the loan balance will be treated as income and I will have to pay income tax on it this year. If I were to withdrawal now, would I pay income tax on it in 2017? It would count toward 2016 income I'm assuming...since I'd be withdrawling this year. 

• if the loan balance is dispersed to me as income, the total in the account is: $2090 so again the question is how much would I actually get back?

personalfinance,What to do about Verizon Wireless (and other carrier) shady business practices?,"My son has graduated from college and to help him get going we split him off our family wireless plan and set him up on Verizon Wireless (where he's moving, he says Verizon has the best reception).  So to help him out, before heading to our local Verizon Wireless store to sign up for a plan and pick up a phone, I got on a chat on the Verizon site and asked exactly what the monthly bill would be.  $20/mo for the line.  $45/mo for 3G data per month.  I said good, good.  But what will the exact monthly bill be, including all taxes and fees and surcharges?  He (Blake, you can see in the chat string) said ""just local and state taxes"".  I said our local county tax is 1.0% and state taxes are 6.0%.  So you're saying my bill will be exactly $65/mo plus 7.0% (which is $69.55/mo).  He replied ""That is correct"".  When I pointed out that Verizon charged egregious pass-thru fees around 2000 when I last had a phone on Verizon he said ""You will not find anything like that I can guarantee it.""  See the [pre-sale chat discussion](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s263/sh/ea85e030-635c-4eb4-b4be-958ba8dd46a3/02fc93dfc97b5060) for exactly what was said.

And then we get the first monthly bill.  And in addition to the expected $4.55/mo of state and local taxes there's a plethora of other surcharges and fees tacked on by Verizon Wireless:  Fed Universal Service Charge $1.63 Regulatory Charge $0.42 Administrative Charge $2.46 PA Gross Receipt Surchg $2.53 PA State Wireless E911 Surchg $3.30.  These are exactly what Verizon rep ""Blake"" ""guaranteed"" would not be be on my bill in the online chat...  Read for yourself.

I'm upset, so I open another chat window with Verizon after I see my bill.  I object to all of the fees being tacked on after Verizon specifically said it'd just be plan costs plus 7.0% state and local taxes.  And I do get a one-time rebate of both the activation fee ($20) and $11.51 of these excess charges.  That made my first bill the exact $69.55/mo that I expected.  (Hooray!  Thank you Verizon for some justice!)  However, the Verizon Wireless rep refused to remove the excess fees in following months.  So at this point, if I don't keep pursuing, we'll be paying closer to $80/mo when we expected to pay exactly $69.55/mo.  Here's the [follow-up chat session](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s263/sh/efcf990d-dc29-4829-ac36-633fd04bbc38/f6a62788ba1b5795) I had.

Here's where things stand.  Verizon Wireless misled me on exact monthly total bill.  Unless I keep fighting (I've spent a day on this already), I'm out about an extra $9/mo in fees I was told would not be on my monthly bill but Verizon rep now says (paraphrasing) ""sorry, our systems cannot remove all of these things from future bills.""  Should I keep fighting this?  Are others experiencing the same issues?  Did anyone else try to (pre-purchase) get an exact monthly bill amount out of Verizon Wireless or other wireless carrier so they could know what to budget?  Shouldn't the FCC ban these practices whereby wireless carriers can dream up and add whatever surcharges and fees they want when they want and have falsely-advertised pricing like $20/mo per line and $45/mo for data (leaving all of the actual surcharges and fees and taxes you're going to get hit with out of that).  ""Administrative Charge""?  They can make up whatever charges they want!  That could be anything.  When I buy a car, if I'm presented a bill for $20,000 plus 7% local/state taxes, if I saw $3,500 tacked on for ""Administrative Charge"" (to handle shipment from Japan or whatever), I'd be ticked.  I'd say ""wait, your shipping costs and manufacturing and administrative costs, etc., should be part of the base car price!""  But wireless carriers seem to get away with these shady add-on cost practices.

So what should I do?

*Details:*

**Salary:** $75,684, which corresponds to $6,307 monthly

The company offers what appear to be two separate retirement packages, one is a 401k with a 50% company match on the first 6% of my contributions. I am not certain as to whether the 6% refers to the max possible contributions to a 401k, which I believe is $18,000, 6% of which would be $1080, or to 6% of my salary which would be ~$4500?

They also offer something similar to a pension plan but is also structured in their 401k, which the company will contribute 5% annually to a retirement plan in which I will be fully vested in 5 years. Not sure how this would be handled as far as taxable income. Does this 5% refer to 5% of my salary, ~$3800?

These appear to be separate retirement plans, in which case I plan on taking advantage of both of them. 

I also have a Roth IRA that I started when I was an intern and I plan to continue to invest in that as well but I think I am correct in thinking that that is post-tax, so contributions shouldn't affect my taxable income.

My only outstanding debt is a single federal student loan, I believe the value of the loan is $6500 and I'm not certain what the interest rate is, but I know it is relatively low. I intend to pay this off rather quickly once the grace period ends, but I believe I'll be able to deduct the interest.

Anyway, the reason I'm here is because I desperately need a car.

I tried to take out a private loan and was approved by Sallie Mae, but my university later denied my request because they said I didn't need the money, but they did tell me to try again around February and request the money for summer of 2016.

I'm living off campus beginning in May, and at this point I think it is unrealistic for me not to have one.

Backstory: Graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering after 8 years of trying to get through. I went to a large highly ranked College initially that was out of state and expensive. after 4.5 years and constantly being on the border of passing and failing out I got dropped 17 credits from graduating. I went to a community college and fixed my grades and transferred to a smaller college and got my degree and paid for that college through selling a vehicle and other means. But from that first college I have $197k in debt.

I graduated in May 2015, finally, and got my Engineer in training license, I had an internship with the Army Corps of engineers my last year in school which transitioned into a full time job which I really enjoy and enjoy the people I work with. I am in a program that steps up salary, right now it is about $38k before taxes and other deductions and I usually end up taking home $806 biweekly (health insurance is stupid expensive and it is for my wife and I so it is almost $200 biweekly that's just gone) but for the next few years I will get step increases for the next few years topping off at a GS-11 which is $55k or so. positives are that in the summer opportunities for overtime can arise with need and I have to travel a lot which gets me a per diem of about $51 a day which I don't use all of and is paid tax free. My wife is an advisor for the local state university but only making about $36,700 and takes home about $2300 a month. My state is having issues to instead of laying people off, her department just froze wages for the unforseeable future. But She is working on getting certified to be a real estate agent, but we aren't counting on that till it starts bringing in money, but has options. Also, we have about $7k in savings for emergency funds if anything happens, both have crappy paid off cars, hers might die soon though, mine is in better working condition but high miles.

Ok, here is the important part.

I have 65,596.22 in federal consolidated loans. We have them on an Income based repayment and got them to $86.53 a month but the good thing is with the corps I get loan forgiveness after 120 payments. Decently set there.

[here is the list for all my loans](http://i.imgur.com/vDegVVX.jpg)

Also, want to note that the Navient Parent loans are taken out in my parents name and they don't have much so they expect me to pay for them, which, they have sacrificed a lot to help me get through college. My dad is a truck driver and makes about what I do now, and my mom has always been a stay at home mom and is in poor health, which most of their money goes to keeping them healthy.

So advice I need from you guys is pretty much should I consolidate the discover, wells fargo, sallie mae, and citibank loans? I am not sure how to with that amount as a few local banks I have looked into will only consolidate up to $80k. I can currently make minimum payments on all loans but doesn't leave me with much and I need to get ahead of these loans.

I need some solid advice on where and how to consolidate if that is a good course of action. I don't need judgement, I realized I have a lot do dig my self out of, not much to work with, and I made some mistakes in choosing colleges. I plan to pay all my salary to get out from this burden as my wife's salary generally goes towards living expenses maybe a few hundred able to help on payments.

Part of my loans are federal loans, which have a grace period. However, I'm estimating I'll have some private loans as well, which usually don't have a grace period. 


My question/discussion is this: If you have had to make a similar choice, what did you do? 

If you went: how did you manage these debts along with traveling, and was it worth it? Did you save enough money to make payments on your debt while saving money for the trip as well? Or did you refinance your loans? 

If you didn't: do you regret not going, and did more opportunities to travel come up later in life? Did not going and saving really make a difference in the long run for you? 



I can't think of a better chance for me to travel because: 

A) I know employers don't particularly enjoy seeing a potential employee with frequent gaps in their resume filled with 'travel experience' 

B) Eventually I'll have a family, which means more money not invested towards traveling 

C) I'm young and have the will/health to do so

However, I can't help but think that a long term trip like what I'm thinking about is going to strain me financially (obviously).

I am currently in credit card debt with two cards. My Discover card has ~$2,000 in debt, and my Chase Slate card has ~$3,000 in debt. I am having trouble paying off these cards each month. The Discover is not so bad, as the minimum payment is $50 monthly. However, the Chase card minimum is over $150.

Are there any dangers associated with this? A couple points to note:

I've paid off my student loans, and aside from a couple credit cards that I pay off every month, I don't really have any other debt.
  

My credit score is in the mid 700s.

  
My parents are financially stable, with no foreseeable danger of defaulting on the loan. The only reason I get a better interest rate, is because of a discount through my job.
  

I make ~100K, so if my parents suddenly found religion, gave away all their belongings, and moved to Morocco, I could still pay off the loan (though it would hurt).

personalfinance,Should I get my Master’s in Computer Science?,"First off, I want to say how much I *love* this sub for existing and being there to help out lost people like me.  I'm at a crossroads in my life and need your help.

A little background on myself:  I’m a 27-year-old American male, based in New York City.  I received my Bachelor’s in Graphic Design in 2011 but couldn’t find a job in the graphic design field.  I then went on to teach ESL in South Korea, coming back to the States in 2014.  As fun as the experience was, it didn’t do a whole lot to strengthen my career back home.  Plus, my graphic design portfolio and skills had been outdated, so I was looking for a different career path.  I was unemployed and living with family in the quiet suburbs of Dallas (where I grew up) for six months following my return to the States, an experience that was quite depressing.

Luckily, a relative of mine helped me land a job as an entry-level Technical Writer for a big tech company in Dallas.  It was a contract gig, and the starting salary was $18/hour, which isn’t bad for someone who had *zero* experience in technical writing.  Also, the cost of living in Texas is cheaper, and there’s no income tax.  Since last year, I’ve learned HTML, CSS, XML, and currently learning JavaScript.  I also have samples of my technical writing work published on the web and positive references from my manager and co-workers.  It was a good job, and I enjoyed working as a Technical Writer.

However, for *personal* reasons, I decided to leave Dallas forever and move to the city where I always wanted to live, and that city is NYC.  It’s been two months since I quit my job and moved out here to the Big Apple on a whim, but no job prospects have materialized since then.  The pain of unemployment is starting to hit me again like it did those six months coming back from Korea.
This is where I’m stuck.  There are a couple options I’m considering, and this is where I need your help.

1.	**Should I go back to school and get my Master’s in Computer Science?**  I’ve read about the high value of earning a STEM degree, and I think this would open up a lot of doors for me.  I’m so fed up of being unemployed and undesirable.  Since I enjoyed working in the tech industry, I’d like to think that I’d enjoy engineering as well.  My only caveat is that I really don’t know where to start looking into this career path, or if it’s even worth investing the time and money.

2.	**Should I go freelance?**  A big dream of mine is to establish a freelance career, work from my laptop, and live anywhere I want in the world.  I would absolutely love to live remotely in a third-world country like Columbia, Thailand, or Philippines and earn a U.S. salary.  This may not be something I’d do forever, but it’d be cool for a couple years.  I've even met a few freelancers and entrepreneurs who do this.  My U.S. salary would go much farther out there than in NYC.  I’m not sure exactly what I’d be freelancing in, but possibly Web Development or Technical Writing.  Like the first option, I don’t know where to start, but I do know that establishing a freelance career takes time.  I’d still need a job in the meantime to pay rent.

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, please let me know.  Thank you so much in advance!

personalfinance,[Debt][Austria] €4000 in debt on my bank account - pretty high interest rate! Should i take a loan?,"Hi Guys, i hope you can help me with my situation.

I am not very good with money and i want to start following the wiki / rules of PF to save some money.

I did spend money that i dont have. From my normal bank account. I pay everything with my ATM-Card, all my finances go through this account. I am currently €4000 in debt on my bank account and the interest rate is pretty high. I am making ~€1500 per month so every month my paycheck disappears in my debt and it makes me feel pretty bad. Because of this i also have the feeling that its impossible for me to save anything because the money just disappears.

My question would be the following: Would it be a good idea to take a loan so the interest rate is smaller? Should i take the loan at the same credit institute / bank where i have my account?

I hope you guys can give me some advice and help me a little bit. 

Thanks in advance!",finance,1452301728
personalfinance,"30yr Male Married w/ Career, How should I pay off my student loans?","tldr: need to pay off student loans. should we keep paying with a higher monthly payment, use 401k loan, sell stocks off, or other ideas? 

I'm a 30yr old, married man with a decade long career in IT. Started with customer support, went to sales, and now back into systems support. I work for one of the top 25 largest companies in the US Fortune 500 for about 5yrs now and I feel that my position is pretty secure. My wife is a few years younger and has been working for the same small company for over 10yrs. She started during college part time and is now part of upper management.

Together we bring in about 140k/year before bonuses and not including a full health care package valued at approx 15k that my wife receives as part of unionized benefits because of her position. I put 10% into my stock purchase plan (maxed out) and we both put about 10-13% each into our 401k/IRA plans which get matched to a certain point. I've got about 40k in stocks and 40k in 401k, she has about 30k in her IRA. Additionally we put away about 10% of our income into savings for ""rainy days"" and we sometimes dip into it for vacations and what not.

We live in a large city in the midwest, bought a house in 2010 in the burbs for $195k after we got married, so we could get out of a shitty rental situation. The house is now valued approx $240k. The house is kept up and there are no major repairs needed. We just refinanced it, the interest rate went up 1/4 percent to 4.25% but we got rid of the PMI payments and escrow. We're saving about $300-350/mo in payments which we're planning to use for year end taxes. 

We now have 2 kids, 3yrs and 18mo old. We try to live a modest lifestyle. Our cars are almost 10yrs old - two Toyotas with approx 100k miles on each and we're hoping they go for another 100k at least. We owe about $20k left on the two combined with a monthly payment of approx $300/mo. The cars are worth about $30k in the private market. We don't really have any credit cards other than the occasional charges here and there. We try our best to take advantage of low interest or no interest deals and typically pay off high interest balances within a few months. 

We really tried to get our shit together financially because neither of us came from well-off families. We're hoping to start a business or buy rental property in the next couple of years. Something that will generate some steady cash flow immediately. 

Now that I've painted our financial picture... that brings us to our dilemma - the largest amount of debt we have, other than the cars and mortgage is my student loans. We paid my wife's student loans, approx. 10k off a few years ago after we bought our house and saved up some money. There's approx 15k left on my student loans that I consolidated when the interest rates were low. We currently pay about $200/mo at ~6-7% interest. We've been telling ourselves for the last few years that this needs to be paid off, but we just haven't made it a priority.

We're at odds on how to pay it off quickly so we can start a business or buy some property. These are a couple options we came up with:

1. use my upcoming bonus which i'm anticipating $4k to $8k worth post taxes. then just make the same monthly payments to pay the rest off 
2. use my upcoming bonus plus cash some stocks out. we don't really like this idea because we'll get taxed on the gains plus we've been making more gains than interest on the student loans.
3. use my upcoming bonus plus take a loan against my 401k. it'll have interest payments but it'll go back into my 401k account. 
4. any other options we haven't thought of? is this enough of a dilemma that we need to talk to a financial advisor? ideas welcome. Thanks.",finance,1452309881

personalfinance,Need advice about where my money should be right now. 22 years old with a million different directions I could take.,"Hi! I've been lurking for a while, but now that it's a fresh year, I've taken a closer look at my finances and want to ask for advice/feedback about where I'm at or if I could be doing something better.


here's some info:

- 22 years old, 6 months out of college with no debt (student loans or otherwise). 
- Make about $20,000 a year in my current job, but I just got a $2.00/hr raise because of minimum wage bumping where I'm at. I LOVE my job, even though it's not in the field I studied. 
- putting about 15% of my paycheck into short term savings a month 
- $4,000 in my standard checking/savings account 
- $7,000 from a small inheritance I got. In an account of my parents' I can't touch unless I give them a damn good reason why. 
- about $4,000 in my Roth IRA 
- just got the possibility of opening a 401k at the company I work for. Matching is *not* currently happening, and I have no reason to believe it will be soon. I realistically will likely only be in this company for another 6 months to a year. 
- Have a little over $1,000 in savings bonds. [ current interest rates here ] ( http://imgur.com/TLXI6Gr )
- anticipating but not counting on at least ~$500 on my tax return (income/withholding from my jobs was very similar to last year's, so I did some very rough math).


I realize I'm very, very fortunate to be where I am right now, but some things will likely be changing in the next 6 months - year that might be a little more challenging:


- In July, my current lease ends and moving might pretty much double my living expenses. It's not totally undoable, but it'll change a lot of other things I'm able to do. 
- My car will probably become too expensive to maintain (even with me and my dad doing the repairs), so I'm anticipating needing a new (to me) car. Hopefully not for another year. My current car is a total beater so I'm not counting on much, if any, income from that. 
- Ideally getting a cat. Suffer from anxiety and my therapist wants me to get a companion animal. Obviously won't if I totally can't afford it but it's still a goal of mine. 
- Trying to travel in Europe again for about a month and a half or two months. As cheaply as possible.


So here's where questions come in, given the above. Basically these are all options I've been entertaining lately, so I apologize if this is a little rambly.


1. Should I open my 401k through my company or contribute an equal amount to my Roth IRA? Or do smaller, but equal contributions to both?
2. Should the money from the savings bonds (some or all) be moved to my Roth IRA? Not positive on my current/average rate of return. I know I'd be paying taxes in 2016 on the interest earned but I've already factored that into my guesses for next year. Or should I cash any of them out for travelling? (see 3)
3. Traveling this spring with the short term savings I have? Take an unpaid leave of absence from work (which I have already been given permission for). Essentially coming back broke, but still with a job guaranteed. Have started discussing this with my parents, they've mentioned that some of the inheritance money could be used when I get back (but not for travel – they want me to come home after all).
4. Just make a larger contribution into my Roth IRA for 2015 while putting more money into savings to anticipate the increase of bills/living costs and then saving for travel later? Concerned that I'll be in a job that'll be much harder to leave in the next year or two.


Basically, I just am *terrified* I'll be screwing myself over in some way by traveling instead of really putting money into savings for the next six months while my rent is as cheap as it is for where I live, and when I know I won't have a car payment or a couple other bills. I'm young and I'm afraid to not take all the travel and life opportunities while I'm not tied down to anything (especially my career), but **I also know I don't make much, and don't really foresee that changing immensely in the next couple years** – and don't want to be setting myself up for longer term problems.

Any advice is appreciated. I know this is SO long, but my head is all over the place right now.",finance,1452318642
personalfinance,"All my years of planning might be over, and I am not sure what I should do. What should I do?","Hello /r/personalfinance.  I could use some help with my...situation.

&amp;nbsp;

**Background:**

&amp;nbsp;

I was financially stable until October 4 of last year.

I was living with my girlfriend with whom I was splitting all of my expenses with.  She cheated, broke up, left, and immediately stopped splitting rent.  I have since broken my lease, and moved in with a friend.  Because my ex never signed the lease (I'm stupid I know) she has said she will not help split the old lease until it gets rented out.

We were planning a future.  My investments were going to go to a downpayment on a future house.

Before you ask, I have consulted an attorney, and because she never signed anything, there's little to no chance of compelling her to pay her share until it get released.  I will have to eat the costs.

&amp;nbsp;

**Current Expenses:**

&amp;nbsp;

My current roommate/landlord has said I will simply have to pay **$4,500.00** to stay here for the next 6 months.  This includes all rent and expenses.

Meanwhile, I am still paying **$650 per month** on my old apartment until it is rented out.  As I said, the ex will not be paying anything.

I have **$2,264.05** in credit card debt.

I am a 4th year pharmacy student, and over the next semester, I will be traveling across the US to interview for various residency programs.  Flights/hotels/uber will be expensive, and I have no idea how much that will be.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Account Balances:**

&amp;nbsp;

Account Type|Balance|

Total Gains/losses||||+$7.98|

&amp;nbsp;

For some reason the cost basis of the VOO fund isn't showing.  My guess is that it's lower because of yesterday's slip in the market.  So my investments are probably in the negative now.

I originally designed my investments based off of one of the ""lazy"" portfolios.  Although I haven't rebalanced it since I originally created it.

I also have some money in a roth IRA in one of vanguard's target retirement funds.

&amp;nbsp;

**Plans:**

&amp;nbsp;

The way I see it, I have a few options:

1. I have $12,950.00 in grad plus loans I haven't accepted.  The down side is that it has a 6.8% interest rate and it will add to my already substantial student loan debt.
2. I can liquidate my investments (I'm not going to be using it for our future house anymore, she's not with me anymore).  The downside is that this will make me loose money.
3. Skip out on the pharmacy board exams, join the circus

Bitcoin,Why do we not use shells as money any more? Why we should not use FIAT as money any more.,"Bear with me, I've had a beer or 2.

I watched one of Andreas' talks a while ago, and he reminds us that a long time ago, we used shells as money. 

He goes onto explain that it only works for inland communities. You can imagine that one day some partaker in the shell-money system went to the coast and was able to collect large amounts of shells, and then suddenly they are not as scarce as they used to be, in fact, they are everywhere.

Just as that enterprising coastal traveler is about to print a ""Trillion Shell"" Note, no one is using shells any more.

So this brings me to today, here we stand, using this FIAT ""money"" which works well, as long as no one is able to ""find"" lots of it very easily.

Turns out, this guy called the FED found trillions of FIATs on the shores of their computer systems over the last 6-7 years.

I picked up a cheap 120gb SSD just to essentially use as a system drive as most of the reports i read people were having issues even installing windows updates due to the lack of free space on the ""system drive"" (the eMMC).

However, i have tried a couple different drive cloning tools, and i can't seem to get it to want to boot.  I was curious if anyone had any particular luck or suggestions because the ""normal"" methods aren't seeming to work.

Either way was hoping for some suggestions, i've tried clonezilla, and EaseUS Todo and neither worked.

personalfinance,Considering a personal loan to pay off cc debt for college.,"Hello, all! 

Ok, I've read many posts with a similar title to mine but of course, every situation is different and I would appreciate some advice. 

I am 25, currently have a little over $5K in CC debt and am considering a personal loan to pay that debt off. I understand that this is simply replacing debt with another form of debt but I want to start going to college and would like a fresh start, of sorts, before going. I work full time and my yearly salary is about $22K. After taxes, insurance and savings, I take home about $14K a year. 

My theory is that a personal loan will enhance my credit report as it's another form of credit compared to the 8 credit cards and few utility accounts. It will also give me peace of mind of having a single payment to make monthly as opposed to 5-8 every month. 

My FICO credit score is 632, according to Discover. Transunion and Equifax report 640 and 628, respectively. 

The 5K debt is distributed like so:

* $1800.00 at no interest for another 10 months
* $1300.00 at 22.99%
* $880.00 at 24.99%
* $550.00 at 0% 
* $500.00 at 24.75%
* $450.00 at 26.99%

The loan I am considering has an interest rate of 9.99% and will take 4 years to pay off. There is no prepayment penalty and each monthly payment will go towards the interest as well as the loan itself. 

Does this seem like a good idea? Thank you in advance.",finance,1452335069

I don't understand how and why bitcoin works. That's why I want bussiness people to be in control. People who know how to speed up economic growth faster. 

Programmers don't care about price speculation. They are nerds. They love the technology. They want to scale the security to keep bitcoin functioning even with higher transaction volumes. They want the network to be robust and resilient against unexpected attacks. They want to increase its odds of longterm survival.

But bitcoin is a high risk investment anyway, so why not increase blocks now? If only a few companies control the network, it will be much more easy to make changes. Law and order can simply be enforced, so there is actually not that much of a need for the network to stay resilient at all. Trustless security is expensive and slow. With a federated p2p blockchain we can never be as efficient as paypal. Let's make bitcoin function more like the visa network.

Let's distract and annoy developers to prevent them from getting meaningful work done. This way less trusted programmers can make the changes we believe to be in the best shortterm interest of us bitcoin investors, no matter if that corrupts the underlying security mechanism that makes bitcoin work.

I do not understand irrelevant technical details like SEGWIT, IBLT, LN or malleability, but I do understand the concept of 1MB and transactions per second. Hence I demand equal voice in difficult technical decisions. After all open source development must be democratic. Whoever is loudest to influence public opinion ought to win the discussion.

personalfinance,"Private student loan just increased monthly payment cost, can't successfully refinance. What options are left to me?","I graduated back in 2009 and, frankly, have yet to hold a job in my field. At least, one that pays a reasonable monthly salary (most I've pulled in in any one month was around $1600 pre-tax, and that was while working two disparate jobs). That said, for the past year or so, I've been consistent about making full payments on my student loans, which are currently not under any special progams.

They total over $66,000, with one around $40,000 at 7.5% interest and the other at about $26,000 at 10.75% interest. Oddly, I remember those interest rates being different, but I don't have any direct proof thereof on hand and Navient's new website seems to provide less information than ever in this regard.

Loan payments *were* about $530 a month, but they're asking for $541 next month, which fits with my suspicion that something in the interest rates changed. I'm not sure what I can do about that, if anything, but I don't recall agreeing to any such terms, and I'm pretty sure the original terms of the loan, as set with Sallie Mae over six years ago, were pretty ironclad in that regard.

Additionally, attempts to refinance have been met with the assertion that my income is insufficient to justify refinancing; I understand the fairly linear risk/reward metric banks use when taking on debt, but if I've been making consistent payments at a high interest rate for a year and have consistent, stable employment (which I have had for the past year, despite it being $10/hr retail), you'd think that would factor in. Would talking to someone at one of these banks be beneficial or am I just going to get the same runaround?

I also tried with a cosigner. The same individual who cosigned my original student loan. They claimed she has too high a debt-to-income ratio, though her income has increase and, since my dad passed, a significant portion of the debt she was helping him pay (yes, it's my mom) has been wiped.

I'm confused, frustrated, and don't know where to turn. I just want to grab someone important by the shoulders, shake them and say, ""look at this shit.

personalfinance,Student loan debt consolidation.. help! Please!,"So my husband graduated from pharmacy school 3 years ago. During that time we racked up 157K in student loan debt.  The loans are broken down into several ""groups"". A few of them are at 7.9% and the others are at 6.8%. Two of them have cosigners because we were in a bad place, hence the career change and going back to school. I believe we need to have the two with cosigners paid off, in order to be able to refinance. Both of those are at 7.9% and we've been putting a bit extra towards them, but plan on just taking a huge chunk from our savings to knock them out. 


 My husband's gross income is about $8,000/month. Right now we pay about $1500 a month towards the student loans, but because of the high interest rates it feels like we haven't even made a dent in it. We also have 4 kids with 1 on the way, and we've gone back and forth about down sizing and scaling back our life and just throwing as much as we can at the student loans. But then again we really like our lifestyle, we don't spend elaborately at all, and it feels like the sacrifice of going to pharmacy school is worth it. 


I'm sure I'm not giving enough info. Please ask for any more details you need and I'll be happy to try to answer. 


I guess my question is - what is the best way to consolidate student loans? Will we be able to get a better interest rate? We haven't tried to do anything besides make payments since graduation. Thanks so much!",finance,1452365150

btc,At what level do you need 100% trust-less,"Trust is not always a bad thing, it increases the efficiency and reduce the cost

For example, when you purchase a cup of coffee, you would simply trust the organization that handles the transaction, since they have no reason to fool you and destroy their reputation just for a cup of coffee. It will be absurd to write a contract for each coffee purchase

However, when you purchase a house, the trust of the dealer must be ensured and there must be a legal document behind that purchase. So the required trust raises when the transaction value increases. But still, you don't need all the people from the world to make sure your purchase is valid, a signed contract that have legal status is enough

However, when it comes to money creation, you need all the people from the world to make sure the money creation is honest. If you rely on any single entity, and this entity go rougue, you will have no way to avoid a loss, and that loss is imposed on every user of that money

The genesis block indicated that bitcoin is created to solve the problem at the money creation level, e.g. central banks bailing out commercial banks using money out of thin air. There is a built in payment mechanism in bitcoin to do the initial coin distribution, but user level traffic is not typically a monetary system's task. In above examples, you just need a little bit regulation/insurance on those institutions so that they can be trusted by average consumer

Bitcoin is first a monetary system, then a settlement system, and last a payment system. The amount of trust involved at all these different levels are different, and should be treated differently. Trying to apply the same trust-less model on all these different transactions would result in large waste of resource and extremely low efficiency



At money creation and initial distribution level, 100% trust-less model is a must. e.g. decentralized hash power handles coins generation and payout to pooled miners

At settlement level, large institutions can also use bitcoin blockchain to make sure the settlement is risk free, similar to banks using Fedwire system to do large settlements. But this is not top priority. If there are millions of miners out there constantly asking for mining payout, then the system should prioritize the money distribution over settlement. In reality, mining nodes can prioritize their own transactions towards pooled miners, this is already a fact. Mining nodes are decentralized central banks, their major task is money creation and initial distribution

At payment level between institutions and companies/private consumers, there are huge amount of small transactions. These transactions do not require same amount of trust as money creation or settlement. People in fact simply trust the institutions like web wallets and exchanges to handle their bitcoins

Currently the biggest problem is that those institutions have not established their own clearing and settlement channel, thus they bypass all the consumer level traffic on to the blockchain, make the blockchain much less efficient. This is similar to paypal trying to use the Fedwire system for their millions of transactions daily, sounds very strange",cryptocurrency,1452366170

personalfinance,To sell at a loss or refinance?,"Bought my first home for $130k in Georgia in 2006, had poor credit combined with the housing market at the time led to a high interest rate (6.375%).  Have since moved cross-country where I own my home here as well.  Market assessments suggest that selling my home in Georgia would result in a loss of $5-$10k.  The property is currently rented out at a loss of ~$200 per month.  The house is older and as a result upkeep costs have been relatively high over the past two years.  While helpful on my tax returns each year this makes for months that are very tight when the costs meet or exceed the income (3x in past year).  

As I see it there are two options.  
1) Sell the house at a loss when the current lease is up.  Eat the capitol loss and spread it out over multiple tax years.  This has serious near term financial consequences but the elimination of a second mortgage payment every month is a big plus.
2) Refinance the house, improved credit and lower interest rates result in shifting the current losses into ~$200/month earnings. It means hanging onto it for years to even out the cost of refinancing and dealing with the fluctuating costs of repairs.  

I am hopeful I am missing something that makes the decision an easier one.  What am I missing or is the answer staring me in the face and I am just too blind to see?",finance,1452367837

personalfinance,A debt confession and a question.,"Okay r/personalfinance. I'm a 21 year old college student and I've made some mistakes. I've got a long confession to make here and I really don't know where to look online for straightforward answers to my questions. 
At 18 I opened up a Paypal account and got BillMeLater. Finally, a way to shop online. I wasn't allowed to have a debit card per my parents so I had to use a checkbook. But BillMeLater wasn't available on every site I wanted to spend money on,(I'm looking at you, Amazon) so I got my first real credit card. My parents never gave me advice on how to spend with it, they just said that I needed to build my credit and to be careful. I started out paying off the balance as soon as I spent it. I started wanting more, I got addicted to spending money. After a while my credit score started going up, so I got a new credit card with a better interest rate and a better cash back percentage at more places. I originally intended to stop using the old one.... but I didn't. I don't know why. Then I stumbled upon Amazon's credit card. ""$40 off when you apply for Amazon Credit!"" 
$40 off? That's amazing! So young, naive, stupid Sierrah applied for it. Got $40 off. In my head, I only intended to use it on Amazon purchases. That makes four, FOUR credit accounts I have open, fast forward 5 years later. All four are maxed out because I got my first apartment with my boyfriend. 
I have a $25 a month payment plan going on a $600 medical bill I received a month ago. I have $10,000 in student loans I've made two payments on, nothing is due per month right now. I'm taking a semester off to work on my debt I owe. My half of the rent is $300 a month, plus $200 in other monthly bills, i.e. AT&amp;T, electric.
I make around $1,200 a month at my part-time job.

What can I do at this point? I don't know how to even begin. My interest rates are only making the balances higher, and my minimum payments are only going up and that's all I've been paying for the last seven months. I've stopped spending almost completely outside of bills. I have $50 to my name right now and I'm just reaching out for any kind of advice.  My boyfriend and I are thinking we're going to have to break our lease so I can move back in with my parents, which I guess has to happen.
I feel beyond ashamed every time I think about my debt and I needed to get this all off my chest.

personalfinance,Should I pay off all of my debt?,"Hey PF,

I'm in my early 20s and clueless when it comes to finances. I will give you a summary of what I'm looking at.

Take home after taxes - $2,700 a month


Bank- $27,000

Car Lease (Ends 3/1/17)- $160 a month

Car Insurance - $140 a month

Phone- $80 a month

Gym- $30 a month

Rent/Power/Internet/Water - $620


Student Loans - Here is where things get tricky. I have 5 loans through two providers. Four with one and then one with the other. I usually pay $100 to each provider a month. 

First Provider

Loan A (4.5% Interest Rate) - $1,500 left 



Loan B (4.5% Interest Rate) - $1,500 left



Loan C (3.4% Interest Rate) - $2,500 left



Loan D (3.8% Interest Rate) - $2,000 left

I have been paying by account so the $100 a month is being split between all four loans. Should I have been paying just the interest on 3 loans off and then putting the rest towards the loan with the highest interest rate? Each loan is accruing about $6 a month in interest. 

Loan Provider Two

Loan A (5% Interest) - $3,100 left

So right now I put in $100 a month for this loan and $15 goes to interest.


You're probably wondering why I don't pay all of my debt off right now? Well, I grew up in a family where one day we were financially secure and the next we had nothing (father did some stuff in the stock market). This definitely has left a scar on me. In the next few years my mother is also going to probably need financial help from my sibling and I. She owns her home (filed homestead act) and car (poor condition) but has high medical insurance costs and works a low income job (uneducated and 60 years old). I'm afraid to pay off my loans in case I need that money to help her with bills. I'm in my first job after college and might want to start looking for something thats more enjoyable (and gives me enough money to live and put some away each month). I try to save $1,000 a month. I don't participate in my companies matching 401k or invest in anything else because like I said above I'm worried I might need the money all of a sudden. Any advice on what to do would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1452378058
personalfinance,"I'm 25, my gross pay is $43k/year and I want to buy a &lt;=$100k house this year. Is this a pipe dream or is it possible?","First of all, I'm posting this from a throw away account because I don't want any of my financial or location information connected to my normal account. I hope that's okay. 

I'm not happy with my current living arrangements. My son is 3 years old and we live in two story townhouse. The backyard is extremely small and shared with the neighbors. The front yard is about the same size as my parking space. I've looked for other rentals with larger yards but the rent for those kinds of houses in my area (rural Missouri) seems to start around $850/month. 

If I can find a house for $100,000 and get a mortgage at a 4% interest rate, I think I'd be paying less than $600 per month. In my area that would be a good size 3 bedroom house or a 4 bedroom house with small rooms.  I'd get my yard, I'd get some privacy, and I'd have the freedom to paint, landscape, and remodel as I see fit. Yes, I have to deal with things that break but I'm willing to take that risk. I will be happier and I think my son will have a better childhood. I would like to buy a house before the end of 2016. Or at least have the financial aspect figured out (pre-approved for a loan, etc). 

I am considering buying a few acres of land outside of town and purchasing a mobile home or manufactured home. This way I get a new home and have more flexibility in deciding the location. I think it'd be substantially less than $100k too. I want something big enough that a family of 5 could comfortably live in since I would eventually like to have more kids. 

I will also keep looking for traditional homes that fit my requirements though.

Once I have a financial plan figured out and determine this is indeed possible for me to do, what are my next steps? I am a first time homebuyer and I'm purchasing a home in a rural area. What are my loan options? There's FHA and Rural Development loans that I know of - anything else?  How likely is a 100% financed loan where I don't need a down payment? What other fees will I run into purchasing a home? Can the additional fees be factored into the mortgage?

What is the best way to get a loan? I went to my bank about 11 months ago to apply for a loan and I was denied. A co-worker told me after the fact that I should find a mortgage broker instead. Is this better advice? What kind of credit score is expected if I want 100% financing?

Here's my financial situation: 

* I bring home $1,118 every other week so I usually figure $2,236 for my monthly income. My gross annual income is around $43,000 and I usually get a 1-2% raise every year. I have zero concerns about losing my job. I'll probably work for this company until I retire. 
* My rent is currently $650/month. Anything comparable to what I have now will rent for at least $700 but probably more along the lines of $850-900/month. I got lucky with this place. 
* My car payment is around $263/month but I usually pay $270 or $280. The original note was for $17,051.45. Bought the car in June 2014 with a 75 month term at 5.040% interest. Maturity date is September 27, 2020. Current remaining balance is  $13,283.13. 
* Auto insurance is $80/month.
* I have a Visa credit card through my bank with a balance of $278. I'm not sure what the interest rate is on this card but I'm trying to get it paid off ASAP. It has a $6,000 credit limit. 
* I have an Amex Blue Cash Everyday card with a $6,500 credit limit. Current balance on this card is $4,847.66, most of which was a balance transfer from the Visa to take advantage of the introductory 0% interest rate. I plan on paying this card off before that introductory rate expires in December. After that, my APR will be 17.24%. Once both cards are fully paid off, they will only be used on purchases that I know can be paid in full each month. 
* I'll receive around $1000 sometime in February - I plan to use that to either pay down the car loan or the credit card. 
* My electric bill fluctuates between $150-$220 usually. My townhouse is not winterized so the really cold months make the electric bill go up more than usual. 
* I spend $60 on internet, $8 on Netflix, and $8 on Hulu. No cable/satellite TV. 
* Cell phone bill is $60
* Childcare is $75/week so I figure $300/month
* I get good gas mileage and live 2 miles away from work and about 2 miles away from daycare (in the opposite direction). I really don't keep track of what I spend on gas. I probably fill up once every 3 weeks or so. Last fill up was $25... I think my budget allows for $40/month to be spent on gas. 
* I probably spend $200/month on groceries. I don't budget or keep track of this well and could probably tighten it up if I try. I typically only go out to eat once or twice a month (and usually spend less than $20 if my son is with me - $10-15 if I'm alone). 
* Credit Karma says my credit score is around 700. I still need to order my credit report just to make sure everything looks okay.
* I have something like $200 in savings. I've been focused on the credit card debt more than saving. 



So, I need a reality check. Is this doable for me with my income and debt? Or do I need to keep saving? I know a lot of people here would say keep saving until I can make a 20% down payment but that's $20,000 on a $100,000 loan... I don't see that happening, especially if my rent increases (which it will - if I don't buy I'm moving to a different place and will end up paying a lot more in rent).",finance,1452378312

Bitcoin,Ideal Money is (possibly) money that doesn't lose its purchasing power over time.,"Money with an unstable purchasing power (over time) cannot be said to be ideal, especially if the purchasing power is expected to decline.

Central Banks use monetary policy to target inflation for economic growth. There is an accepted “slight” devaluation of our currencies over time.

But leaving these governing systems to create their own index for “stability” creates a centralization of power, a(n unnecessarily) security leak in regard to stability of purchasing power.

National fiats also get into a position of wanting to devalue to encourage export.

The US can't necessarily devalue without changing its role as the (de facto?) world reserve currency.

Our Keynesian attempts at stabilizing currencies and growth are doomed to failure, built on naturally corruptible metrics that cannot possibly hope to be forward thinking enough to achieve the intended goal of stability.

Hayek teaches us ONLY the totality of the markets could have such precision, information, intuition etc.

So “Asymptotically Ideal Money” is this:

“Good money” is to be favoured by the markets and this would show up in price, provided we have a universal exchange for getting in or out of each national fiat.

Today because of bitcoin, and as adoption grows, citizens of each respective nation has the choice of either their nations fiat, or bitcoin (or any other option available in the future).

So even a self interested government, trying to manipulate currency for their own gain (taxation, capital gains etc.) still must respond to the new game this option creates.

There is then an asymptotic evolution, where the markets lead the Keynesian/central banking policies in the direction of stability of purchasing power.

Ideal Money essentially achieved through either adoption of bitcoin AND/OR national fiats of increasingly better quality in the gresham/nashian sense.",cryptocurrency,1452410520

Ok that *last* one was a snarky remark =)

Luke-Jr may be fine being spoon-fed his news pre-screened and pre-filtered by his censoring buddy Theymos, but the rest of us are grownups who want to have real, open, transparent, uncensored debate about what's really going on.

Luke-Jr seems to have a real chip on his shoulder:

- He feels entitled to mod people's Bitcoin code to [quietly delete what *he* considers to be spam](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc/search?q=luke-jr+spam&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

- He supports [censorship by Theymos and the other mods](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc/search?q=luke-jr+censorship&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) on /r/bitcoin who unilaterally and secretly delete people's well-thought-out comments

- He proposes nutball theories claiming that [base-16 is better than base-10](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc/search?q=luke-jr+tonal&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)

- He selfishly [wants blocks to be *smaller*](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc/search?q=luke-jr+slow+internet&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) because [he can no longer run a node on his crappy internet connection](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3yeqpq/lukejr_due_to_the_block_size_increases_over_the/) - forgetting the fact that [if blocks were any smaller now, Bitcoin would no longer be usable](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3ynswc/just_click_on_these_historical_blocksize_graphs/)

- He even believes the Pope isn't Catholic or isn't legitimate or something:

https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/37arqu/tensions_abound_in_a_small_catholicleaning_sub/

- And he apparently enjoys debating weird issues on other subs, along the lines of the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin:

https://np.reddit.com/r/TraditionalCatholics/comments/3vmcs9/the_socalled_catechism_of_the_catholic_church_and/

(I actually have no idea what the above two threads are about, but Luke-Jr apparently does, and he thinks he's making some kind of important ""point"" with his deluded ""arguments"" about the Pope being illegitimate or whatever. More power to him - I'm more worried about making sure that Bitcoin succeeds.)

The point being: Luke-Jr seems to have a tendency towards obscurantism and absolutism arguing arcane points of doctrine, so maybe he isn't the best person to be:

- ""deciding"" what is and isn't ""spam"" on the blockchain, or 

- ""deciding"" which people's comments are or aren't ""spam"" or ""trolling"" which his censoring buddy Theymos can arbitrarily delete on Reddit.

All of these examples show a disturbing tendency. He is apparently obsessed with imposing his hair-splitting doctrinaire notions of ""legitimacy"" on other people - arguing that:

- certain transactions on the blockchain aren't ""legitimate""

- people's carefully written and well-thought-out ideas and proposals for Bitcoin also aren't ""legitimate"" - they just ""trolling"" and ""spam"" 

- even the Pope himself isn't ""legitimate""

Is anyone noticing a pattern here? 

**Luke-Jr thinks Satoshi dice dust and Starbucks lattes on the blockchain aren't ""legitimate"", he thinks your comments on Reddit aren't ""legitimate"" - heck, he even thinks [the Pope himself isn't ""legitimate"".](https://np.reddit.com/r/TraditionalCatholics/comments/3vmcs9/the_socalled_catechism_of_the_catholic_church_and/)**

Whatever. 

At some point we have to simply throw up our hands and realize that there's clearly no point in trying to ""reason"" with someone this delusional. 

He'll always be able to justify, in *his* deluded mind, the twisted notion that kids like Theymos are somehow entitled to simply *delete* other people's comments. (Plus of course it supposedly helps Luke-Jr, since his comments *don't* get deleted.)

This is all part of some overall unhealthy deluded tendencies / obsessions on the part of Luke-Jr, who thinks he knows better than everyone else, even though pretty much everyone else thinks he's seriously deluded and we pretty much ignore his crackpot theories.

He knows that the only place he can survive is on censored forums. He's selfish and delusional - thinking that the important thing is that *he* should be able to run a full node on a 1990s internet connection (even though this would cripple Bitcoin), and that *he* should be able to decide what is spam on the blockchain (even though this would delete some people's transctions), and that *he* should be able to speak freely and uncensored (even though censorship makes Bitcoin fragile).

Anyplace else, on a level playing field, where his delusional stark-raving-mad ideas weren't protected by his censoring buddies like Theymos, he'd be laughed into oblivion and totally forgotten by now.",cryptocurrency,1452448520

personalfinance,"How (exactly) to take care of self-employed quarterly estimate payments for taxes, and how this works with Turbotax","I sincerely apologize if this has been addressed before. I have been trying to do my own research both in this sub and elsewhere online to answer my question(s) but with no luck.

I am 100% self-employed, I use Turbotax to file my taxes, and only this year did I learn about quarterly estimates. I think I had heard of them before but I didn't know  that they are mandatory and can result in fines for being ignored.

Last tax season, paying for the 2014 tax year, my final taxes came to just over $1,100 federal and $260 state (Michigan). My understanding is that $1,000 is the magic line over which you could be fined for not making estimated payments. I haven't heard anything... does this mean nothing will happen ever? Or they might notice sometime in the future and issue a fine for it?

This tax season, since I only just learned about it I did not make payments throughout 2015. I'm still finishing up my taxes but it looks like I will owe $3,600 federal plus $800 for state so I think I definitely SHOULD have been making payments. I suppose there's nothing I can do about that either but am I likely to have it come back and bite me? Is there anything I can do about it?

------

Now, looking forward, my more important questions. What exactly does the government want from me in order for me to be safe? I'm not interested in receiving a return at the end of the year so I don't want to overpay, but I'm assuming I don't have to literally pay every cent that will be owed. So what do they want? I can't seem to find a straight answer.

Then, perhaps more relevant to my situation, how does this integrate with Turbotax? Their own help sections don't seem to clarify this. If I'm sending checks to the IRS throughout 2016, and then in April of 2017 I log into Turbotax and fill out all my stuff, does Turbotax have access to a database or something telling them that I've already sent money to the IRS? Or is it going to tell me to pay just as much as it would have anyway, and then the IRS will receive all the extra money and be like ""we don't need most of this"" and then send it back? How exactly is it balanced out?

I would really appreciate any clarification anyone can provide. I've been reading so many things and nothing has cleared it up for me yet.

I was just thinking would it be pragmatic to pay off the higher interest loan (6.55%) with case to avoid paying to much in the future ??  

1. The high interest loan amount to about 11k out of the 37k current debt.

2. I have an annual income of 60k after-tax

personalfinance,[Taxes] I changed my tax withholding allowances this year and I still owe?,"Hi Everyone,

I've been trying to learn about federal tax withholding and no matter how much I read I still can't understand for the life of me how it works and why I find myself still owing even after changing my withholding.

I haven't received my W2 or 1099s yet, but here's the gist as of my last paystub:  
* Gross - $36122.00  
* 401k contribution - $2850.00  
* Federal Tax Withheld - $3345.00  
* Dental (I am on my father's medical) - $130.00  
* Additional Income (interest, dividends, and side job as independent contractor): not greater than $1000.00  

I am single with no legal dependents. For the first five months or so of 2015 I was filing S-2. I owed last year and figured I wasn't withholding enough tax, because I didn't account for my income as an independent contractor. So I switched to S-1 in the hopes that that would resolve it. I definitely saw a difference - my net take home pay was about $1000 more than last year, even though I made over $6000 more. Last year I didn't contribute to my 401k, but I've been contributing to that since the very beginning of the year, so that didn't seem to be it.

I take a standard deduction, have no student loans, don't own my own home, and did not contribute to a Traditional IRA (only Roth). I'm trying to keep things simple without having to owe. But I used a couple calculators online and it seems I'm going to end up owing a small amount (a few hundred) after all...same as I did last year.

My question is this - why didn't changing my withholding have the effect I'd hoped for? Is there away I can change this for next year? I know I came close to breaking even as is generally advised on here, but it would be my personal preference to receive a refund, even if the amount is negligible. How big of a difference does S-2 vs S-1 make in my case?

I am on track to be making over 40k next year, and I know with that latter few thousand will be taxed at a higher rate...I really do not want to have to put another one of my paychecks toward taxes - I would rather they be taken in advance and live off the rest.

personalfinance,"I just started to repay my student loans, I think I'm misunderstanding something","So last month was the first month I needed to start paying back the student loans I had through Navient. Naturally, I have some loans with a higher interest rate and some with a lower one. So I decided to put extra money above the minimum payment in every loan towards my high interest loans (about 7%).

I had assumed that this extra money would go towards the principal, thereby lowing the amount of interest I would pay over the life of the loan. But yesterday when I went on Navient's website, it showed me that I have no payment due on that loan for this upcoming month. This leads me to believe that instead of the extra I put towards paying off the principal, it just 'banked' that money for future months payments. This is obviously not what I want. Is there a way to pay off principal instead of this happening?",finance,1452465325

personalfinance,"Invest more in TSP retirement account, or payoff student loan?","I am currently putting 10% of my pay into my TSP retirement account at work with 5% matching. This amounts to $417 pretax each paycheck.  My student loan currently has a principal balance of $76,768 and with my current $700 a month payment (minimum is $469), it will be paid off in 11 years and 4 months.  It has an interest rate of 4.0%.

I would love to pay off the loan sooner than that though, so I am playing with the idea of reducing my TSP contributions to 5% so that I at least get the matching amount.  This would reduce the total TSP contribution to $278 pretax each paycheck.  I estimate after taxes that would net me roughly $200 extra per month.  Paying this extra $200 a month would reduce the length of my loan by 3 years and save me $5224 in interest.  Though, at the same time that could have been $13344 extra I could have put into my TSP account (before interest) over the course of 8 years.

The way I see it the market isn't doing too well right now, so I feel my money better serves me to pay off my student loan.  However,  I'm aware the market will probably turn around at some point (after a significant drop I imagine) and I'm worried I would miss a significant return which would outweigh the 4% interest on my student loan.

I feel that I might not be considering some important factors.  Please help me decide the best course of action.  Thanks!",finance,1452469224

personalfinance,How to budget 55k gross in Silicon Valley?,"I am graduating in June with a B.S. in general biology, so not a hugely marketable degree. I have about 10k in back taxes (significant scholarship income I - and my tax preparer - didn't know was taxed) and 2.5k in a federal Perkins loan (no interest until February 2017). I have 3k in liquid savings and 1.5k in a Roth IRA.

I have a research offer in Palo Alto for 55k/year gross with great benefits (employer health &amp; dental, employer 401k match and ""free"" contribution total up to 10% of gross income after 5 years, gym membership etc.). I know the employer very well and love the boss and coworkers, and would probably be stupid not to accept this offer given my degree. I can always leave after a couple of years if housing prices increase, but I anticipate that the experience I get here would increase my earning potential quite a bit (I will obtain programming experience and should be able to transition from lab tech to lab manager fairly quickly).

I expect about 37k take home. In this area I would be looking at 30k+/yr for solo rental housing (a tiny studio), which I obviously can't afford. I'm young and don't mind roommates for a few years so can probably find housing within public transit/biking distance for ~18k/yr.

I have a basic (year one) monthly budget outlined but would really appreciate feedback on whether things need to be prioritized differently, or if I'm missing any notable expenses:

* Rent, utilities &amp; wifi: ~$1,600
* Groceries, eating out &amp; incidentals: $300 
* 401K (4% pre-tax contribution for 5% employer match): $185 
* Roth IRA: $150
* Netflix: $8
* Cats (living with my partner out of state): $50
* Transportation (bike maintenance): $10
* Debt payments (back taxes first): $500
* Phone: $55
* Tax prep budget (avg. monthly expense to hire CPA at end of year): $35

This would leave me with ~$200/mo left over for emergency savings/travel to see partner/entertainment. Not much.

The tax prep cost is high because my previous (non-certified) tax preparer landed me 8k in debt to the IRS. The peace of mind of having a CPA is worth the extra $300/yr after that ordeal.
The cat cost includes the avg. monthly amount of their annual exams.
I might be able to get a cheaper phone plan by using VOIP, since there is wifi nearly everywhere in the area I'll be working, but I don't want to count on that.

I want to max out my employer 401k match, but I could forego the IRA contributions until my debt is paid off. The debt payment factored into my budget is well above the minimum payment, so I could also reduce debt/IRA payments until I have built up a more substantial emergency fund (~9k for a 3-month fund?). Although, if I lost my job I would probably not stay in the area. I'd try to break my lease and move home for a bit where my monthly expenses would be about 1.5k. 

I should have all of my debt paid off inside 2 years, and then I would start saving for a down payment on a home outside of California. The plan is eventually to move somewhere with a lower cost of living.

* I have a credit card but pay it off in full every month and never carry a balance. This is where I need to be better about understanding how much I'm spending---my credit card statement is anywhere from $1,000-$2,000 per month.

##If you get called by a scammer, consider collecting their stated name, phone number they are calling from, and number you are directed to call and reporting it to [TIGTA](https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/contact_report_scam.shtml) and/or the [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/GettingStarted?NextQID=216&amp;Selected=t%20-%20crnt#crnt) (with ""IRS Telephone Scam"" in the notes).  DO NOT GIVE OUT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.

I highly recommend that those of us with elderly parents or family members share the word.  The elderly are some of the most vulnerable when it comes to online or telephone scams.

As a humorous anecdote, last night I received a call from an attempted phone scammer.  Blah blah blah a recent judgment in a tax court means I owe $8,152.91 in back taxes that was due last year.  As a favor to me, they were willing to settle for $6,000.  What a bargain.",finance,1452516336

investing,"David Bowie was a financial innovator, too","In 1997 he introduced an unusual marriage between the rock scene and Wall Street: He issued bonds backed by future revenue of the 25 albums he had recorded before 1990, paying a generous 7.9% interest rate over 10 years. The bond issue earned Bowie $55 million, which he reportedly used to buy back songs from his catalog owned by his former manager.


It may have sounded like a good idea on paper, but in March 2004, Moody’s Investors Service cut the Bowie Bonds to just one notch above junk. A spokesperson from the ratings agency said the downgrade “was prompted by lower than expected revenues generated by the assets due to weakness in sales for recorded music,” according to The Telegraph.

The Bowie bond was the first of several so-called celebrity bonds, pioneered by investment banker David Pullman. Celebrity bonds from other artists, including James Brown and the Isley Brothers followed.",finance,1452519205

personalfinance,Paying Student Loan with CC,"Hi everyone. Last Friday there was a post about MyGreatLakes accepting credit card payments to tackle federal loan debt. I called Friday and paid off my outstanding interest ($4000) with one of my credit cards. This card, and one other, are both interest-free until August. My plan is to move as much as I can onto these two cards (roughly $7000) and chip away at those debts interest-free until August. I will continue to make $375 monthly loan payments, which will cover all of my monthly interest accrual and a small amount of principal. I also have enough money saved (in emergency and a house fund) to back up all the money I move to my CCs in case I can't pay them off by August. 

My question now is, which loans do I tackle first? I have about ~$7000 to pay with CCs. Is it better to make a dent in loans that have a high interest rate, or should I eliminate some of the smaller loans? Here is a a screenshot of my loans (I don't mind sharing): http://imgur.com/WNz10hL

personalfinance,Can the car dealership withdraw incentives if the financing is paid off prior to 90 days?,"Yesterday my mother started the first step in erasing her student loan debt by turning in her lease and buying a car in cash to use the extra payments in a snowball at the loan. Or at least, that's how we had planned it. The dealership offered a $1000 incentive to finance the car, which we had made it clear we were willing to do to get a better deal and just pay it off. 

Some info: The car is a 2012 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid with 40k miles on it for $14,000, $13,000 after $1000 incentive. We chose it because mom drives a lot (always over lease miles) and she couldn't stand to give up leather seats, which this car was one of the few that had it and great gas mileage without tons of miles. Her credit with Experian reported by her discover card is 840.

Now I made it clear at the dealership, before they said anything, that I understood they would want her to make the first 3 months payments so they can get their kickback. But they really stiffed her on interest rate. Tried offering a 5.9% and I immediately told him, ""don't sit back down, go to your manager and do better because that's insulting."" The guy sits anyways and spews a bunch of crap about how interest rates have gone up and her ""car credit score was only a 770."" I still raised protest, telling him I was both a Realtor and a finance major, so I know rates haven't climbed that severely and he was acting as if a 770 was subprime anyways, also calling that score calculation a load of crap. My mom has only ever leased vehicles since she was in her 20's, but that shouldn't amount to a lower score. 

Sorry if I overdid the details. We took 4.29% because they would go no lower and wouldn't give the financing incentive if we went elsewhere, say a credit union. They would only let us put a small 20% down of $2600 and I told her to take a 72 month term because in planning to pay it off after the 3rd payment it was cheaper and pays less interest to amortization. Payment is $199/month. In total, the financing saves us about $300 if we make all the payments. Come to find out it was spot delivery and we'll find out our finance company soon. When that happens, can the dealership try to revoke our $1k if we just go ahead and pay it off in the first payment? 

I looked pretty closely at the paperwork and there is nothing about a pre-payment penalty or 90 days in it. I don't feel like doing the slime balls any favors and the goal of this was to save money, not pay a pretty decent interest rate for the borrower's credit. I'm in AZ and I say this because more then one dealer has told me we don't have a cooling off period and we can't just return the car, so there's that to consider. PF what makes the most financial sense here? Sticking to our word to liars and making the 3 payments or Paying it off (assuming no penalty would be levied)? Thanks in advance.",finance,1452533931

I am $96,000 in student loan debt from undergrad and law school, with interest rates between 5.4% and 6.1%. I currently make $60,000 a year. 

At my new job, I will make $115,000 a year (including a $5,000 signing bonus). I expect that moving expenses will range around the $5,000 mark (for PODs, help moving, new security deposit, etc.), so my emergency fund will stay about the same once I replenish it with my signing bonus. 

After taxes (37% federal and state - Oregon has a high income tax of 9%) and contributing 7.5% to my 401(k), I expect to take home $5341.45 a month. Here is how I have budgeted: 

Rent: $1500
 Student Loans: $1500 (overpaying and using avalanche method)
 Gas/Electric: $100
 Car/Rental Insurance: $75
 Car Maintenance: $0? (I own my car, but it has about 110,000 miles and after the drive to Portland I'm concerned about how it'll hold up)

- Type: Direct Consol

Loan 4: 

- Outstanding Balance: 1,977.58
- Interest Rate: 6.550%
- Lender: Direct Special Consolidation Loans
- Type: Direct Consol

Monthly Expenses: The numbers reported here are an average over the last 12 months. We are very consistent about staying within the boundaries of the budget. 

- Rent: $1,537/month (unfortunately there is nothing cheaper where I live, it's insane). 
- Phone: $42/mo
- Electricity: $90/mo
- Netflix/Hulu: $18/mo
- Internet: $57/mo

- Car insurance: $136/mo
- Fuel: $200/mo

- Student loan payment: $206/mo
- Family loan repayment: $100/mo
- Household goods: $150/mo
- Yoga: $25/mo
- Misc: $200/mo

Average monthly expenses: $3,700

I'm considering a new vehicle and would like to hear your advice!

I currently drive a 2005 mid-size pickup with just over 102K miles. I am a gearhead and honestly look at my truck as both a source of transportation as well as an avenue for fun. I enjoy off-roading as well as boating/fishing/hunting and other activities that often require an off-road capable vehicle. I've meticulously maintained every aspect of this vehicle - it is mechanically and cosmetically without issue. Paint looks great, all maintenance done on-time and complete records kept in a three-ring binder (some laminated). 

Recently, I've come across an older individual selling his 2013 Silverado 1500 LT 5.3L V8 with the Z71 4x4 package, 60K miles. Similarly, his vehicle is also immaculate inside and outside and thoroughly maintained. 

We've come to an agreement to trade my mid-size and some cash on my end for his newer and less-used truck. I have been looking for a few months now to trade up for a newer (to avoid repair/maintenance costs) and larger (more suitable to tow my boat) truck and see this as a very good opportunity to upgrade. The deal is in my favor and would negate the hassle of needing to sell my vehicle first and be under pressure to buy a new one quickly. 

This is not an impulse decision and the rest of my finances and well in order (as far as I understand for a 21yo recent college grad): great engineering salary, maxing 401k/IRA annually, established 6-month e-fund and surplus funds in the tune of a few hundred dollars each month AFTER living expenses/food/20% income to long term savings.

This vehicle purchase will cost me approximately $6500-8000 to purchase the Silverado and $300/yr extra to insure (comprehensive/collision coverage). I CAN afford to pay this in cash but have questions as to financing.

Questions:

* Should I consider financing the $8K? The interest rate I would qualify for at my bank (with ~790 credit score) is less than my return has been for the last year in my taxable investment accounts.
* Would a bank allow me to finance something as low as $3-4k for a $25K vehicle?
* Anyone with personal experience with late model year Silverado/Sierra 1500s and the 5.3L V8: are there any major issues or common failures that I should be aware of?
* This is more of a ""want"" than a real ""need"", but I believe I can afford it. Would you stick it out with my current truck and drive it into the ground or upgrade to the newer vehicle?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1452544250
personalfinance,Guidance needed- Purchase the house or walk away and fight for earnest money deposit,"In the process of purchasing my first home. The numbers are- Purchase price $263,900, house appraised for $271k. They are giving a $3900 credit towards closing costs, and a $3000 credit for repairs. My SO and I fell in love with the house but we didn't really check the surrounding area as much (stupid, 1st time home buying lesson learned). We checked it on the Trulia crime map and it's ""green"" which means no criminal activity on our specific street, but there are some streets several blocks away that are in the ""red"" areas. When I drove to the home inspection and met the inspector, girlfriend, realtor at the house, I took a back way through the neighborhood. It really took me back a bit because it was my first time driving through there during the day, and while I love the house, the neighborhood does not make me proud to live in. I think the age old saying of, ""I'd rather be the crappy house in a good neighborhood than the best house in a crappy neighborhood"" is starting to play in my mind. After the home inspection, my girlfriend's car died outside the house and we had to go to the local grocery store for some car stuff and it was sketchy. Not super sketchy, but enough to feel a little wary/uncomfortable. So I am walking in some pretty good equity, $7k-14k depending on how you look at it with closing costs and repairs, but I'm really going back and forth if it's worth it to buy the house that we may like but hate the neighborhood/area we live in? Or walk away and have to fight for our $3000 earnest money deposit back. The listing agent/sellers have already made it clear that if we want the money back, we'll have to take them to small claims court which may be a bluff, but I really don't know if it's worth my time/effort to go through with. The house is in my name, and my girlfriend is getting such strong feelings about not going through with the house now that she is offering to pay back a portion of the earnest money I might walk away from. Sorry if I'm rambling a bit, I guess this makes sense to get cold feet with such a big commitment but I'm not sure what to do here and appreciate any insight/advice.     

**TL;DR:** Cold feet about buying a house. House itself is nice and we are walking in to $7-14k equity and a good interest rate, but the neighborhood is not so great and worried about longevity of living there. Also, I can either walk away from my earnest money deposit of $3k, or have to fight to get it back in court.",finance,1452547446

personalfinance,Some advice on helping my girlfriend consolidate &amp; pay off her debt,"I have a serious girlfriend who is struggling with an average amount of debt and it's negatively affecting our relationship. I think I posted out this issue in the past (like a 10 months ago), but it's not going away, so I'd appreciate some help PF!

My gf (26/f) and I (26/m) make similar amounts of money, but she's living paycheck to paycheck and I'm not. Her debt profile is approximately:

* $4200 on a CC @ 25% APR
* $1200 personal loan @ 24% APR
* $2000-4000 in several other small student loans @ 5%-15% APR
* And $40k in student loans @ &lt;5%

I know she's paying at least $250/mo on the two highest interest debts and pretty minimal on the others. She makes roughly $32k/yr and takes home something like $900 after taxes and benefits are taken out of her paycheck, which includes health care and an employer matching retirement which has probably $1300 of her own money in.

I've tried to argue austerity, not taking vacations, etc, but that's a hard line to argue. But she needs to pay these debts off because it's a constant source of arguments and really they're not ridiculously large amounts. We live in a poor area and make about $70k/yr as a couple which more than enough. But we're not married and she incurred all of these debts before we met, so it's not like I can pay them off. She needs to be a big girl and do this for herself. I'm trying help her for obvious reasons, but that is pretty limited to doing research. Her student loans can wait as far as I'm concerned, but $250 (more like $300-400, i'm not exactly sure) out of $900 take home EVERY MONTH is an issues we need to resolve ASAP.

Again,the austerity line is tough (she has about $100 every two weeks for food and luxuries, I pay for most outings, etc), so my other ideas are:

* Debt consolidation, but she has terrible credit and claims she cant get a loan at a lower rate. I have good credit and would consider cosigning a small loan. Probably a bad idea, but I love her, we've been dating for 3 years, and I would like to marry her, but we gotta tackle at least this consumer debt beforehand. Also, worse comes to worse, I make enough money that I could pay off a $5000~ loan instantly, though it depends on the time of year (I work seasonally).
* Liquidating assets, i.e. 1) selling her car (we have 3 vehicles) which we could get $2500 for, but not til the warm months because where we live 2wd vehicles dont sell in the winter. 2) Cashing out her employer matching retirement. Not ideal, but she's has a contract with her employer that ends in a few months and she'll be moving on. Plus, she has NO emergency fund so to speak of, though she tries to accumulate one.

Soo the logical game plan, if I'm seeing this right, is to:

* Cash out her retirement and schwack the $1200 @ 24% loan ASAP, freeing up $50/mo (not exactly sure on her loan % rates, but she says that one's minimum payment is $50/mo).
* try to consolidate or rollover her CC to something with a much lower interest rate OR 0% APR for X months, especially if X months can get us into the time of year her car will sell.
* Sell her car, put that $ towards her CC
* Focus all extra $, money saved from not having car insurance, money saved from eliminating the $1200 loan, and money saved on paying down the CC towards eliminating the CC once and for all.
* Stop, re-evaluate, and come up with a new plan for the remaining debt.

Back in August I refinanced my auto loan threw my credit union and got a much better rate. It was a fairly simple process. I came in and applied for the loan, emailed in proof of income etc., then came back a few days later to sign some paperwork.
 
I noticed later a line on my online statement for ""credit insurance"". At the time I had just sent in proof of insurance (with the credit union as the leinholder) as they had requested. I figured this had something to do with that and didn't look into it any further. I didn't notice that it was a charge not a credit. 

Now I only ever check this account to see that my auto loan payment has posted and didn't realize it was charging me every month, until about a week ago. After some googling I found out what credit life insurance was and went straight to my loan document, which mentioned nothing about it. When I went to the bank they explained that I signed up for credit life and disability insurance and showed me the document I signed.  Now I have been wracking my brain about this. I'm not sure if I signed electronically or the on paper. But I know for a fact that I was never told I was signing up for insurance, nor that there would be an additional monthly charge on my account. 

I was able to get the insurance removed, but I am being told that I cannot get a refund for the months charged. Although it is only about $130 I feel the banker was deliberately misleading, especially since she didn't give me a copy of the insurance paperwork (she only gave me a copy of the loan paperwork which mentions nothing about insurance). 

Another thing is on my most recent my phone call with another banker/supervisor I was told that my interest rate was going to go up by .5% because I cancelled the insurance. She said that it should have explained to me that the reason why I got such a low rate was because I got the insurance. But none of that was ever told to me at all. Actually they never even told me my rate would go up when I cancelled the insurance.

The last phone call I was given a number to the bank manager, who I will have to call in the morning. But at this point I'm pretty sure the answer will still be the same: no refunds.

Is there anything I can do to convince them or should I just say bye-bye to my $130 and my lower interest rate and take it as a lesson learned?",finance,1452555049

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car loan?,"I am in the process of selling my house at a rather large profit.  If all goes to plan, I should be able to sell the current house for $400k and buy the next one for around $350.  With the equity in my current home and after all closing costs I should net about $164k.  I have about $20k in credit card debt and medical bills (I know, shame on me) and a $20k loan that my wife and I took out from my father in law to finish the basement in our current house. Paying these debts, that leaves $120 that we can put down on the next house.  

&amp;nbsp;

In addition to the above, I also have a car loan of $9,700 at 2.49% interest and a payment of $200/month.  Does it make more sense to keep this loan, or take money out of the down payment to clear it? The interest rate on the new mortgage should be around 4.375 for a 30 year fixed, and I am told by my lender to expect about $50-$60 off of my mortgage payment for every $10,000 I put down.",finance,1452555338
personalfinance,Contesting Erroneous Tax Fine from Abroad,"**tl;dr: IRS fines me for 2014 filing for missing a SSN/TIN that does not exist; my tax firm double checked. Everyone says eat it.  Should I take this garbage?**

I got mail (I live abroad, so weeks after sending in December) that I owe 50.00 USD on my 2014 federal income tax filing for failing to provide a TIN/SSN.  I have an ex-wife, who was added to my paperwork when we were married the years prior, but is not a US national and has **never** finished citizenship papers, or completed the green card process.  Our son is also there, but his SSN is definitely listed.  As for her, she never completed a citizenship application, and early enough I never have seen any mention of a SSN/TIN.  We do not even reach a US background check, and the attorney was instructed to cancel the application a few months after divorce.  She visited the US once like over ten years ago for a summer, unless she has hid something massive.

I called the tax accountant who prepped my paperwork (PwC), and they said the paperwork is correct, and she was filed ""NRA"" and never had any TIN/SSN to register.  They say pay the fine, because contesting will mean a larger fine and a waste of time on their end and my end too.  They want nothing to do with it.

Needless to say I am miffed.  I am not ok getting fined for their inability to read, unless I missed something very obvious.  My attorney father says ignore it and pay; I am a fool to waste my time.  Should I contest?  If I do, do I pay then contest to avoid interest?  (The fine says payment is required by 18 January 2016; I can pay online but it would take weeks to mail back via snail mail).

Has anyone dealt with this?  Is even calling them worth it?",finance,1452555507
personalfinance,I put withholding on my tax form and now I owe the IRS and cant pay.,"Hello everybody. First off I know i'm pretty dumb and I don't have parents or relatives that can help me with these kind of issues. I didn't even really understand how taxes worked until about 3 hours ago. 

So here is the situation...I started working on January of last year. My first job ever. I made $34110, and I paid $1400 in federal taxes so far. I also live in Kentucky which has a state income tax that I haven't been paying in. In total I owe around 1700 each for both federal and state taxes to a combined amount of around 3400. I currently only have about $600 to my name. I'm gonna be unable to pay the IRS. I have no clue what to do. 


I make around 460 gross per week. After I filled out the paperwork properly i'm currently making around 350 after all taxes. Also I know 460 a week is not nearly 34k a year. Most of that is from bonuses and overtime from the month of Oct-Dec.",finance,1452556512

personalfinance,Considering buying a house while still paying student debt off,"Hi /r/pf, I've been looking into the possibility of getting a house in the near future, and am concerned that financially I may not be in the right spot to be considering this.  I'd like to stop throwing money away renting, and maybe grab a house in the 150-200k price range, ideally one that I could fix up and then later move out of and potentially rent out.  My basic stats:


*Income* - 115k base, more with overtime - 2015 overall was 132k.  After taxes this is ~5200 take home monthly (more with overtime). I am single (so no partner income).

*Debt* - 175k from grad school.  This is down from the 240k I started with 2 years ago.  Monthly payments used to be 2600 a month (10 year repayment), however recently I've switched to IBR and that is now down to ~1000 monthly (I started targetting the remaining 1600 to the individual loans with the highest interest rates - 2014 I paid 30k in interest, now that is down to 22k for this year.  Hoping that this trend continues in the future)

*Expenses* - Rent is $450 a month (rather, 900 every other month - I live with my brother and we trade rent).  I pay for food while he pays for electric and internet - food usually translates to a couple hundred dollars a month, and I also have a recurring membership to a couple of extracurriculars that runs about 150 every month. 


I'm looking at trying to get a house in the next 5-6 months.  During that time I should be able to save up around 20k or so for a down payment, however I've also heard that it should be possible to have a bank loan to avoid a down payment.  I have not researched this appropriately, so I'm looking for advice.

Basically, given the above stats :

1) Would it be wiser to continue renting as cheap as possible for a while longer?

2) Am I crazy to even be considering this, given my debt situation?  

3) If this IS premature, when would it be wisest to start looking at this in the future?

4)If there are any resources (books, blogs, podcasts; anything) for first timers looking to buy a house that you feel would be helpful, I'd love to get a few recommendations.  I've already started browsing on my own, but any additional direction is definitely helpful.",finance,1452563775

personalfinance,Help me choose between mortgage quotes please,"I'll try to keep this concise. I am in the process of closing on a house. Got heads up from my realtor that it was time to choose a lender and apply for a loan. Today I called 6 different lenders and got a total of 12 different quotes. Most of them were easy to reject out of hand, and I've narrowed it down to 2, maybe 3 loans. I'd like to hear what the experts here have to say about them and what you'd recommend. Maybe you guys have some insight I may have missed. I asked each lender for the interest rate, points, and any lender's fees. I am only shopping for conventional fixed-rate 30 year loans. I am aware there will be thousands more in other closing costs associated with the transaction, but those will be the same regardless of the lender I chose, so for comparison's sake I am only considering the lender-specific ""closing"" fees. Here is the loan info:


**Loan #1 (no fees, ""high"" interest"")**

Interest rate: 3.99%

Fees: $0

Points: 0 ($0)


**Loan #2**

Interest Rate: 3.875%

Fees: $685

Points: 1 ($1,710)


**Loan #3 (Lowest Rate, Highest fees/points)**

Interest Rate: 3.75%

Fees: $685

Points: 1.5 ($2565)


By my calculations, over the life of the loan, Loan #3 will be the cheapest, saving $5,198.11 over 30 years, compared to Loan #1. However Loan #1 will cost me $3250 less at closing. This is significant as Loan #3 would tap out most (if not all) of my savings, leaving me temporarily with litte/no emergency fund (other than my credit line and my very supportive family, both of which I very much wish to avoid relying upon). Meanwhile, Loan #1, while costing marginally more over the life of the loan, would leave me with a decent cushion to cover unforeseen expenses that are almost assured to come along with moving into a new house.

As far as timelines, I have no reason to expect I will be moving in the next 10-15 years, if not longer. I have a stable job and many familial ties to the area, my best friend just bought a house a block away, and this house is big enough that I could find a girl, get married, and have a few kids with her and not need to upgrade (I'm single at the moment). So bottom line, odds are I will be in this house for awhile.

Like I said, any thoughts you guys have on which loan makes the most sense for me, I'd be glad to hear them. If you need any more info, just ask. Thanks so much!",finance,1452565229

personalfinance,Need advice on paying off $29k of debt. Personal Loan Advisable?,"I have close to $14,000 Credit Card debt spread over four credit cards and about $15,000 in student loans (one federal, one private). My credit score is at 670 and I'm currently employed part time, trying to get full time but just returned to the US from working abroad and starting over. I had some cushion from my savings from my job abroad to help make my monthly payments which is about $500/month between all of them, but that won't last long. I saved because I knew it'd be hard for me to land a job now that I'm back. 

In regards to the credit card debt, the tacked on monthly interest is just barely under what I'm paying towards the loans monthly. I want a different repayment plan where I can consolidate my debt (at least the credit card debt) and work at a lower interest rate, but I have no idea where to start or who to ask. I don't really trust banks or websites because I have previously been pushed into making a financial decision that was not good for me from bankers who knew I didn't understand what I was doing. So I turn to you, Reddit, some how I believe I will get better unbiased, non commissioned advice from you.

I did a 0% interest balance transfer a year ago on most of my CC debt, to which now the 0% is something like 22% as the promotion has expired. I considered applying for different cards and doing that again, but I am aware I won't have a high limit to accommodate my $14k, and every time you apply it hurts your credit score. So this is probably not a great option for me.

It was suggested to me to take out a personal loan, which I'm not sure if this is different than a regular loan or how to find one with low interest rates. But the idea of getting my debt into one place seems like a good idea. 

I will reapply for a income based repayment plan for the student loan (it lapsed because I was abroad when trying to reapply and I was blocked from the site because I couldn't remember the zip code I used for my 2014 taxes. Finally in the states and able to get a response from customer service and I can try again). But other than that I just have to chip away at it over time. 

I basically want help on my credit card debt, but felt it was worth noting the entirety of my as this all costs me monthly in payments. Some websites have loan suggestions but I don't entirely understand the terminology and want to understand what I'm applying fore before I start throwing around my personal information. Any advice would be great. I hope I provided the necessary information needed for guidance. Thank you in advance.",finance,1452566148
personalfinance,"Large increase in self-employment income at end of 2015, no quarterly taxes were paid during year","My spouse had a large boost in self-employment income in the last quarter of 2015 (September-December) that accounted for 80% of business income for the entire year.

personalfinance,Endless Struggle; Cannot Keep Up With Student Loans,"Hi r/personalfinance. I have been struggling with my student loans since day 1. I have one consolidated federal loan, and three private loans, accumulating to a total of somewhere between $80-90k total. I make about $30k right now. I am enrolled in income based repayment, however they do not take my private loans into account, so the payments are very high. I have been struggling pretty hard lately, as my monthly payments have increased however in the last 2 weeks I have hit two major problems:  

 - My mother was assisting me with a parent plus loan which is cosigned to her. It is my most expensive loan, and also has the greatest repercussion as nonpayment will effect her. She can no longer assist me with these payments.  

 - I have lost all my overtime at work because of policy changes, which I was very reliant on. I work full time and am currently looking for an additional part time job, but don't have anything right now.  
  
  
I was struggling financially the way things were (about $4-500 a month in loans) which has now escalated to about $6-700, and my weekly income has reduced by about $100 per week.  

What do I do? I can not afford this. I am terrified of crashing and burning. I have had a loan default on me once, and I am worried it will happen again. I have tried exploring lower repayment options but none exist. I have read some of the guides on this subreddit, but because of my small budget, I always end up having to dip from my savings. My only other choice is to use forbearance where available, but there is a limited amount of months I can use that for.  

Right now I have $300 available to make it through the next 2 weeks with, and a $200 loan payment that is about to go into collections. I had to put off most christmas gifts because I am paying off loans, and only bought for my young brothers. I sold my car to save money on gas, tolls, repairs, and insurance. Im 28. This is what my life is like just about every month. I try  to count how far I can make it on $120, how cheap can I eat...I'm kind of embarrassed to hang out with my girlfriend in these states because I can't eat like $4 meals with her...not that she judges me for that but..what do I do here.

personalfinance,"Due to my graduate tuition remission, I'm losing a third of my paycheck due to taxes. Can PF help me with withholding taxes?","Hello all, 

I am a single male in Boston working for a university full-time and one of my benefits, the university has a generous tuition remission program for graduate degrees. The degree isn't free as the cost of the tuition is reflected in my paycheck as additional income. This has brought me to the following scenario: 

I receive a monthly paycheck. 

- Annual Pay: $60K
- Annual Grad Cost: $35K
- Current Monthly Fed Tax: Approx $2100 
- Current Monthly State Tax: $400
- Annual Pre-Tax Expenditures (Healthcare, Dental, Public Transit): $2750  
- Monthly Take-Home Pay: $2100  

I used the latest IRS Calculator, in which I hopefully have inputted the information correct: 

&gt; Your Results

&gt; Based on your responses, your anticipated income tax for 2016 is $16,290. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $23,100 withheld for 2016 resulting in an overpayment of $6,810 when you file your return. If you want your withholding to more closely match your anticipated tax of $16,290 change your current withholding arrangement by claiming 0 allowances plus an additional amount of $7,521 for the balance of 2016. Here’s how:
Enter 0 on line 5 of your form W-4
Divide $7,521 by the number of paydays remaining in 2016 and enter the result on line 6 of your Form W-4. This is the extra amount you need to have withheld each payday to ensure that you do not have too little withheld. Assuming 11 paydays remain for a monthly pay frequency, this amount is $684
Check the “Single” box on your Form W-4
Assuming this recommendation is in effect for the rest of 2016 , your withholding will approximately equal your anticipated tax, and any refund or balance due should be less than $25. 

&gt; Tip Be sure to review your withholding at the beginning of 2017 (or any time there is a change in your tax situation). If you follow the above recommendation and do not check your withholding at the beginning of next year, your withholding for 2017 might be incorrect.

&gt; Following is a recap of information entered on the preceding pages on which the above advice is based. 
Prepared: January 11, 2016

- Someone else can claim you as a dependent: no
- Number of jobs: 1	
- Number of dependents: 0
- Will you be 65 or older 1/1/2017: no

- Total itemized deductions: $30
- Projected additional withholding if you do nothing: $23,100	

**Questions:** 

&gt;Divide $7,521 by the number of paydays remaining in 2016 and enter the result on line 6 of your Form W-4.

Does this mean they want me to calculate all of the business days left in 2016? 

&gt; Assuming 11 paydays remain for a monthly pay frequency, this amount is $684

So I'm getting overtaxed $684 a month? What specifically do I put in my W4 ""Additional Withholding""? Wouldn't it be (-$684) so they don't withhold that money?

investing,Strong growth outlook to attract foreign investments to India,"The strong economic growth outlook of India built on efficient fiscal and monetary management and a progressive reform agenda is expected to attract both foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investments (FPI) starting this year, Vikas Gautam, CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company Pte. Ltd told Gulf News in a recent interview.
“The government has been able to build a strong foundation for change which is quiet visible on the ground. Though a lot of reforms the government had envisaged have not gone through till now, but at the same time the foundation has been laid, and the result of that foundation will be visible in the next 12 to 18 months,” said Gautam. In its latest report, ‘Global Economic Prospects’, The World Bank has projected that India would remain comfortably the fastest growing large economy in 2016, at a rate more than a percentage point higher than China. The World Bank has projected the Indian economy to grow at 7.8 per cent in 2016 and China’s to grow at a more modest 6.7 per cent while the world economy as a whole would grow at 2.9 per cent.
Though the rupee depreciated last year compared to 2014, it largely managed to hold its ground compared to most other emerging market currencies. It is unlikely the rupee will face a massive depreciation as happened in 2013 when it slipped in excess of 20 per cent. Over the last two years, the RBI has been successful in curbing extreme speculative volatility out of the market.
“FDI and foreign portfolio allocations are expected to increase this year. There has been a lot of positive impact following the improved ratings as well as a number of countries from around the world are signing bilateral agreements with India to support infrastructure developments. Once infrastructure developments start, the ripple effects of that will get reflected on the capital markets for the simple reason the execution of infrastructure projects is going to be done by local companies,” said Gautam.
Unlike other emerging markets, the impact of future US interest rate hikes on capital flows out of India will be muted. The US is hiking rates because the economy is recovering. Historical data for the two decades show good growth in the US has meant strong growth prospects for India.
While future rate hikes are expected to have some immediate ripple effects, it is not likely to result in capital flight from India. On the contrary strong macroeconomic fundamentals are likely to attract more investors to India.
India is one of the few emerging markets where some of the largest pension funds either have allocated in the range of $5 billion (Dh18.36 billion) to $10 billion over the past 12 months.
“Looking from their perspective yields are negative or zero in most developed markets. They have to match liabilities for 30 to 40 years and there aren’t many markets that can give these funds yields in the range of 7 to 10 per cent for such longer period,” said Gautam.
In the past, India was part of tactical allocations for most institutional investors, but now it is increasingly becoming part of their core allocation strategies.

Middle East investments to surge
Dubai: India is expected to receive strong flow of investments from the Middle East as institutional investors, private offices and sovereign investors compare opportunities with other emerging markets said Vikas Gautam, CEO, Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management Company (ABSLAMC).
ABSLAMC has a 100 per cent wholly-owned subsidiary in Dubai called ABSLAMC Dubai that is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). ABSLAMC Dubai services clients across the Middle East through its Dubai office.
“We have a very strong investor base in the Middle East, especially in the GCC. Investors are aware of the opportunities and we intend to offer products and services that suit the requirements of regional investors,” Gautam said.
The company offers investment options on both public markets including equities, fixed income and opportunities in alternate space too. Keeping up with the growing demand for exposure to India investments from investors in the Middle East, Asia and Canada, the company is planning to launch a couple of new funds. First will be a fund focused on Middle East and Asia investors, a 100 per cent India dedicated high growth fund that will focus on small and mid-cap sectors. Additionally the company is also launching this month an open-ended balance fund for Canadian investors with 60:40 equity bond composition.
With the growing FDI inflow and infrastructure investments, the Indian corporate sector is expected to benefit in terms of earnings. “As a consequence of this, corporate earnings will get rerated in India which will reflect on valuations on the capital markets,” said Gautam.

I am not sure what the best strategy is to tackle my debt and I am wondering if I should speak with an expert. I feel the options are pretty simple... Get my loans to favorable interest rates and invest my current savings OR use a large chunk of my savings to pay off some of my highest interest debt.

personalfinance,Where should I allocate $1-2k per month across my financial landscape?,"32m, Married with a 6 week old son (yay!).  Wanted to get some advice on a few courses of action with regard to paying off some debt or just sitting on the cash--I got some good advice 6+ months ago and wanted to check in and make sure I'm still on the right track.  In other words, a quick sanity check on priorities.  I value this community's opinion!


**Our situation:**    
**Income** - ~$9000/month net combined (Wife will return to work in 6 weeks, thankfully!)  We are both in growing technology industries and with good, stable companies.  In the event one of us lost our jobs, we expect we could find similar work in a month or two.    
**Savings** - $42k cash (30k in 1% online account with Ally, 10k in a local brick and mortar bank that we also do our transactional banking with)    
**Investments** - ~$40k total    
*401k - $30k between both our accounts, we contribute up to company match.  Contributions are already reflected in the net takehome pay figure above, and it equates to about 10% gross/15% net of our income.    
*Roths - $5k for each of us in a Roth started in 2014, not planning to add any 2015 money (hence my questions below--would rather spend this money on debt payments)    
*529 - added $2k to 529 plan for our newborn as I live in GA and get a state tax break for the first $2k.  Yes, I know we should prioritize retirement savings, however as you'll soon see based on my own student loan debt, I really want to have a pot of money for my kids for college.    


**Debts/Expenses -**     
*$325k owed on a $390k house, refi'd into a 20 year mortgage last year at 3.75% and have 19 years remaining ($2450/mo payment)--did this intentionally hoping to have our first child and to time it so we'd have a paid off house when he/she starts college.    
*$38k @ 5% on Private Student Loan ($438/month payment)    
*$26k @ 3.625% on Federal Student Loan ($186/month payment)    
*$28k at 1.9%on a 2015 SUV (Wife's car, purchased with an employee/manufacturer program at about 20% off MSRP, otherwise we would have gone with a used vehicle)  $600/month payment     
*$350/month lease payment on the 2nd car, ends which ends in July 2017 (leased an electric car as I commute 60 miles daily and the lease incentives + gas savings equated to almost a free car for 3 years...haha, well at $3.50 a gallon it did.  Was able to use the cash from my old car to put towards wife's new SUV so we would not be upside down throughout the loan)    
*$1200/month for Daycare    
*$300/month for ""Once a Year"" expenses such as insurance premiums, car registrations, HOA dues, Alarm System Monitoring, Termite Bond, etc.--I have this transferred monthly to our Ally account and only take it back for those expenses if I can't cover them from our checking account.    

**Total - ~$5500/month in fixed expenses**    



So, we're left with about $3.5k/month for utilities/cable/internet (~$500/month), food and going out(~$1000/month), and misc. expenses (the rest).  Right now, we're spending most of that money as our priorities have been preparing for our first child and living pretty comfortably.  I think we can trim out about $1000/month from our normal expenses, especially as we're going out and entertaining less with a newborn.



**Upcoming Plans/Considerations:**    
*I am going to be purchasing term life insurance for my wife and I to cover us in the event of a tragedy--likely a ladder of 20/10/5 year policies with decreasing total value for me and a flat 20 year term policy for my wife.  I expect these premiums to be about $150/month.    
*I intend to use my work's FSA Dependent Care Account to pay for the first $5k of childcare this year--that seems like a no brainer.  So that's a $300/month hit to the net pay.    
*We will be purchasing a car in July 2017 when my lease ends.  I would like to pay cash for a $20-25k 3-4 year old car that I intend to drive for 8+ years.     
*Want to increase retirement savings and resume annual Roth contributions    
*Expecting modest increases in income this year (both wife and I are in line for promotions to the next stages in our respective careers).  This will likely be ~$1500/month net increase by end of 2016.    
*Child #2 in 2-3 years, at which point we would probably consider my wife staying at home.    


    
**So, given this picture, where would you allocate an extra $1000-2000/month?**    
*1. prioritize paying off the $29k@ 1.9% auto loan and then finance the next car at a low rate, using cash and surplus to pay it off faster?    
*2. build more savings so that when I purchase a new car, we're still sitting at 4+ months of emergency fund?    
*3. prioritize paying off the $38k @ 5% student loan?    
*4. Accept the low interest rates on all of the debt, and keep adding to Roth's for both Wife and me?    
*5. Something else entirely?",finance,1452608815

It's a 60 month loan at 5.74% simple interest, no prepay penalty, state title transfer fee and a new gap insurance policy rolled in. It would save me about $50/mo on my payment but a much larger amount in interest over the life of the loan. I would also get a prorated gap refund from the provider of the policy on the original loan. I've never refinanced a loan before and this all seems too easy.

personalfinance,"Unmarried couple, joint homeownership, with child and pell grants--tax questions","My girlfriend and I (35) bought a house ($136k, 4.25% fixed/30 year, 5% down) together in December 2014, and live there with our 10 yo child. She works full time (~$45k plus benefits). I was a part-time student at my local CC in 2015 receiving a Pell grant, with under $1000 in wage income, and ~$2500 in unemployment benefits in 2015. We also own both our vehicles jointly (one paid off, another ~$150 a month for 3 more years).

A recent post taught me to have my girlfriend take the deduction for the house. I usually file the taxes for our family, but have never itemized deductions. I would usually file one of us as HOH and claim our child, and the other as single, depending on our relative incomes (then $15-20k each). I usually file our federal taxes using the H&amp;R Block web application, and file our state taxes through the mail.

I didn't prepare properly through the year to itemize deductions. I know some things like the mortgage interest can be deducted, as can her work uniforms (no receipts kept, however). I'm not sure what other things can be deducted when I itemize (for when I file our 2016 taxes next year), but this I can learn. Will the mortgage interest deduction alone be more than the standard deduction for her?

I did not maintain health insurance this past year, as I was ineligible for the subsidy due to my reduced income (I fell in the ""gap""). This was before I was unable to work due to an injury. I anticipate getting employed full-time with health benefits this year. I understand that the maximum penalty is 2% of my annual income, which will not be a burden.

Receiving the Pell grant has been a huge boon for us, enabling me to continue my education (~$1300 per semester). I expect to graduate in May 2016 with an associates. In the past it was easy to swap who claimed HOH, and the child tax credit. This year I certainly can't argue that I provided ""more than half the support"" considering our incomes. What would be the best way to file our taxes this year to maintain my eligibility for my Pell grant?

I intend to return to the workforce in a different field in the next month, at a reduced wage (~$10/hr). I will probably work full-time for a portion of the year, and reduce that to part-time in the fall when my school schedule will be more demanding.

I'm a college graduate in Philadelphia and have been dealing with trying to pay of $120,000 of student debt over the last several years. I have never defaulted or anything like. 35 grand is federal and income based. As my income is less than $35,000 a year my payments are currently $0. However, my private debt is near $90,000 and offers no other options for me but to pay the full amount of $850 a month. This is roughly half my income and it barely touches the principal amounts.
I've wanted to consolidate for awhile. My lenders, The New Jersey Higher Education Student Assistant Authority (HESAA), provide few option. Consolidation with them is not an option unless your yearly income equal that of your loans...so no help there. I've looked into other companies like Lendkey, or Credit Unions...they seem more plausible for help, but I still don't make enough for them to consolidate.
I'm wondering if, rather than consolidating all $90,000 of my private debt into one..if I'd be able to consolidate 30 grand to one company, 30 to another, and 30 to a third. Theoretically, this would reduce my interest rates and monthly payments, and save me money in the long run.

personalfinance,Looking to buy a new home but leaving my current job to start my own business (w/ no expected yearly salary) in the next couple of months.,"Hello all,

I'm a longtime Reddit lurker, but this is my first time joining the party as a participant.  I've cruised /r/personalfinance a lot in the past &amp; gleaned personally helpful information from other people's posts, so I was hoping y'all could help me with something a little more specific to me.

I've been in the process of starting my own business for the past 3 years and we're currently about 3 months away from finally opening the doors.  As this is a startup, there is no line in the balance sheet for owner salaries.  We had hoped to investigate that option in our 2nd year (or beyond).  In order to continue to earn money while getting the business up and running, I had initially planned on keeping my current job through the 4th quarter of 2016.  Unfortunately, after sharing the news of the new business with my current employer, my boss decided it was in HIS best interest to hire a replacement for me immediately &amp; give me an end date of February 29th, 2016.  As I do have a fair amount of savings &amp; stock portfolios, this did not immediately worry me.  That is, until my wife got pregnant...

After having the baby in mid-2015, my wife's hour commute to work started to become much more burdensome.  She had to allow time to get the baby up, fed &amp; packed up, as well as time to transport her to our caretaker in the morning on the way to work.  We had planned on moving closer to her office (which is also minutes from my new business) sometime toward the end of 2016, but soon realized that we would have to do this much earlier in order to keep everyone in the household sane.

So, here's my problem: How do I get approved for a mortgage loan with only ~2 months left at my job?

Here's some other supporting information about our situation:

* Targeted price range for home = $350-$400k
* Cash available for downpayment = $80k
* Wife's current salary = $60k/yr
* Other assets = $150k in stock portfolio &amp; $100k in 401k
* Monthly debts = $1,100/mo
* Equity on current home = $120k (based on most recent appraisal &amp; neighborhood comps)

We had planned on holding onto our condo through the end of this year &amp; renting it in the meantime, but that was prior to finding out I would be leaving my job in February.  Would it be better to sell it prior to buying the new place (effectively giving me ~$200k to put down)?  Is it in my best interest to get approved for a mortgage &amp; buy a house in the next two months while I still have a provable yearly salary?  If I wait until later this year, will the bank recognize the monthly income of the business as future profits even though I'm not getting paid a salary?  I've also planned on getting a part-time job to supplement our income a little bit, but it probably wouldn't be a huge addition.  I don't know the metrics used in assessing mortgage loan risks.  Is leeway given on monthly income if you have a fair amount of assets?  In other words, if I got a low paying part time job, would that be enough for them after considering our current home equity + other assets?

Sorry if there is a lot of unnecessary personal information here, but I just wanted to illustrate the whole picture of where I'm at.  If I left anything important out, please let me know.

I really appreciate ANY help here.  Thanks!!",finance,1452621515

I have subsidized student loans that are down at 2.6 % but managing to produce $1,000 in interest a year (that I could pay off in 3 years) vs I can buy the house this season and lock in that sweet 3.7% mortgage (which is amazing to me, my parents pay 8% interest).",finance,1452624680
personalfinance,Paying Off Credit Cards With a 401(k) Loan,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm nervous, but really hoping you all can help. I should note that I'm very embarrassed about my financial situation; I've made a lot of good choices (especially of late), but that's come after a LOT of bad choices over the last ten years or so.  I'm looking for advice here and would appreciate as many honest, data driven opinions as you can provide.

I'm in my late 20's with over $13k in credit card debt as well as around $40k in student loans (down from $70k at graduation). I also hold a mortgage with my wife on our home. I have been working in a career position for around 6 years now and have a decent start on a 401(k). 

Currently, it looks like I can take out up to a little over $15,000 in the form of a loan from my 401(k). The interest rate is 3.5% (less than half of my lowest interest credit card) and there appear to be no fees when I model the loan through my 401(k) provider. I can pay the loan back over a maximum period of 60 months; if I stretched my repayment that long, it looks like it would cost me around $272.70/month ($136.35 per paycheck).

In contrast, I currently pay a little over $800/month on minimum payments for my revolving accounts.

Given all I have listed above, would this community endorse my taking the loan to pay off my credit card debt? If not, do you have any other suggestions? We're basically living paycheck to paycheck at this point and I'd like to change that. Living that way can lead to stress, and it also means that I can't really make any headway on my debt.

I could see myself taking the remaining difference of $500 or so and finally starting to build an emergency fund, investing or even saving it up to pay the loan off even faster (partial repayment isn't allowed, but early payoff is). I'd also like to increase my credit score so we can refinance our way out of an FHA loan and into a conventional loan before interest rates go too crazy.

Please feel free to be brutally honest; I may be embarrassed about where I am financially, but nothing is ever gained by ignoring reality.

Thank you all in advance.

personalfinance,21% Car Loan and Can't Refinance....,"So, I've really cracked down on my debts lately...but there is one issue that seems to rake me over the coals, my car loan which I owe about 12K on... the issue is the massive interest rate (21%) that I unfortunately took when I was desperate since my credit score was quite low (only just recovering now). Unfortunately I've put on a lot of miles due to work so no place will refinance the car, what are my best options? 

Should I sink all my extra money into it to pay it off asap instead of my other debts (one of which is smaller but just as high of a percent) or is there another avenue to reducing this rate?

personalfinance,Buying a House / Big Purchases / Can We Afford It?,"Throwaway for reasons. I know the answer to ""can i afford it"" is generally no, and being a financially savvy person I agree. However, my fiance and I have been looking at houses lately. In our area, 350K would buy what we are looking for. She has fallen in love with a house, I tried to put off looking seriously as long as possible so we could save more to put down. We are currently living in a relative's basement for about 1/2 of the market rate for rent.

Financial situation: we have about 10K in savings dedicated towards the down payment. We also have about 20K in stocks that were gifted to us and could sell. I have a Roth IRA with about 30K in it myself, but I'd prefer not to touch that. In personal savings, we each have about 4K. I can save about 1,000/mo on my own (as of now, new job), I budget meticulously with my own finances. Fiance pretty much breaks even due to medical bills, but once those are done in 3 months, she can save about 1,000/mo as well, she budgets but is probably a little more lax than myself about it.

We obviously don't have enough for 20%, but what would be the optimal solution here so that we can put in an offer? I would say sell the 20K in stocks, that would give us about 30K, plus a little of savings we could probably get to 35K for 10% down. I realize we would have to get PMI which I am not a big fan of. I have also heard about taking out a loan for the other 10%, but at a higher interest rate (say 8%) to avoid paying PMI, but I have not researched that option enough yet.

Other important life events/purchases to consider; we are also getting married in the summer and am worried about overspending/wedding budget as well. We also bought a new car last year, all in costs about $600/month. Both of our credit scores are near 800. I just don't foresee how we can manage all of these large items, house, car, wedding, in the next year without going into debt, which scares me. It is my opinion that we should wait until after we are married to buy a house, but marriage is a partnership and there is another's opinion to consider as well. It is also hard living in a relative's basement when we are both almost 30.

If anyone could provide any helpful advice on our situation, I would appreciate it. Thanks!",finance,1452625544

personalfinance,Options for paying off a credit card?,"First off, thanks in advance for yalls advice.

I have a credit card that ive had for 10 years (my longest line of credit). It started out at just a jc penney card, only accepted at jc penney.

Fast forward to last year, and i had kept it paid off every month. The card was then opened up to a universal-use credit card and my limit was almost quadrupled because of my increase in income. Over the year with various purchases, it went from having a 0 balance to a $3000 balance.

I called jc penney, and they said they cannot lower my 30% interest rate at all.

My question is this: is it more prudent to transfer the balance to another  (new) credit card with a lower interest rate and into 0% balance transfer APR, or will opening a new line of credit hurt my credit report too much by lowering my age of accounts and increasing my accounts open?

My credit score is excellent, and i dont want to ruin that, but this debt seems massive to me right now! Any advice is greatly appreciated!",finance,1452628442

investing,Comment on my analysis,"Somewhat new to investing. Have been lurking here for about a month just reading and trying to be able to follow the conversation. Anyway, back in 2009 a friend recommended I buy Citigroup cheap believing it would recover and I did purchase about $5K worth which has nicely appreciated since and just sits there.  Then a few days ago, some articles caught my eye stating Citigroup is perhaps very undervalued. I decided to not take the articles and face value and instead try to perform an analysis based on the things I have been learning here to try to apply it to real life, to see if I should buy even more. Here is my analysis, which seems to indicate that perhaps Citigroup is indeed undervalued. Please feel free to tell me what I did right and wrong. 

Citigroup’s P/E is around 10. This is roughly the same as JPMorgan, but lower than Bank of America, Wells Fargo and USB. Positive factor.

Dividend yield is about 0.43%, which means their dividends are only nominal. Negative factor (unless you like this for tax reasons). 

P/E/G/ ratio is 0.18. Since this is under 1, positive factor.

Book value is $59/share. Way higher than current prices. Positive factor.

CEO has recently said that China is not a material risk for C’s business. Also that market perception of Citi’s risk to emerging markets in general is exaggerated and not well understood by investors, who assume Citi has tons of EM risk. He explains in detail why, I cannot follow though. But assuming true, positive factor.

The recent interest rate increase will purportedly help Citi’s margins. Positive factor. 

According to Insider Monkey, 16 billionaire hedge funds are LONG on Citi (I do understand that because hedge funds are not required to disclose their shorts, this could be just a neutral factor).

Citigroup will at some point soon get the permission of the Fed to buy back a lot of stock.",finance,1452633992

Before CAD was totally in the dumps I had considered taking a personal loan to 'buy out' the US debt with CAD. Is there any scenario in which this makes sense?

personalfinance,"Student Loan advice regarding interest rates, math, repayment. Which is best?","Hi PF, first time posting here. Read the relevant links on the sidebar and still had some questions.

I am 29, self-employed freelance computer artist. Income is around 2,300/mo, before taxes of course, and student loans are by far the largest portion of my expenses each month. My biggest question is a multi-story question about which to pay off first, if paying the highest interest one first in this case is still best.

-

I have 2 loans with 'Company 1', private student loans. 

-Loan A is currently 17,600 @ 3% variable int, monthly payments are 188.

-Loan B is currently 10,200 @ 11.75% variable int, monthly payments are 157.

-

'Company 2' I have 1 loan with, let's call it Loan C, federal student loan, divided into 4 groups.

-Group A is 2,300 @ 5.75% , $60/mo

-Group C is 1,200 @ 1.89% , $22/mo

-Group D is 1,927 @ 6.3% , $38/mo

-Group E is 3,000 @ 6.3% , $60/mo

(Loan total is 8540, $179/mo)

-

So my questions here are these: 
1. Even though Loan B is by far the highest interest rate loan, is it still best to pay that one off first? The reason I ask is that, while high interest, the monthly payment amount is only 157, and the monthly payment amount for Loan C is 179. paying off Loan C would be cheaper, AND save me more per month, allowing me to save up quicker to pay off Loan B. I get that in the meantime it will accrue higher interest, but i'm just curious if the math is done, what the total cost would be to pay off C, then B, compared to the cost of paying them off the other way around.

2. What is the best method to pay these off? Save up a big chunk of money and do one large payment? double the monthly payments I make each month? I have no intention of paying the bare minimum when I am able to pay off more than that; especially when some of the loans, like Loan B, will triple the original loan amount over the course of repayment if I do.

3. As far as I'm aware, there's nothing more I can do in terms of consolidation, refinance, etc. But am I missing something? I've never missed a payment AFAIK, and have been in repayment for about 6 years now. If I need to call one of the companies to ask about refinance, consol, etc., what do I say exactly? What should I watch out for?

1) Can this money be deducted from my income on my 2015 taxes, or do I have to wait for next year since the repayment occurred after the close of the 2015 tax year?

I went to a four year University in the US getting a regrettable Political Science Degree. I decided to become a lawyer, and I went to law school in England. I ended up graduating, however couldn't ever secure employment. As a result, my visa ran out and I moved back to the US. For two years after that, I was unemployed, living with my mother. I finally snapped out of it and starting serving at a restaurant for two years, and I recently gained employment at a lawfirm as a paralegal. During all of this, I have gotten into default with all of my student loans. I have both federal and private with Sallie Mae. I recently got a letter of wage garnishment, it says the principle is 100k, but I'm sure I owe more somewhere out there.

I currently make just shy of $50k par annum. I live with my partner and her kid; my partner makes about half of what I do, therefore I'm responsible for 3/4 of the bills. We have a second joint account where I put in 1500 per month for bills and groceries.

In a few months I will be getting $45000 from a Settlement fund from a number years ago. Ideally, I would like to use that to get my Master's in Law in order to sit the bar in my state, to further my career.

* Personal Exemption: $4,050


It is my understanding that my TAXABLE INCOME is:


    Taxable Income = Gross Salary - 401K Contribution - Insurance Premiums - Itemized Deduction - Exemption


So I end up with a taxable income of $50,654.08


Plugging that into the 2016 tax brackets gives me an income tax liability of $8,434.77.


Dividing my tax liability into 26 even paychecks (I am payed bi-weekly) leaves me with an estimated $324.41 Federal Income Tax Withholding per pay check if I want to break even.


I have already claimed 2 allowances on my W-4 and they are still withholding $402.30. If my math is right then they are still over-withholding my income tax by $2025.14 for 2016. I don't think it makes sense for me to increase my allowances past 2 considering I am single with one job and no dependents. Is my math wrong? Is my tax liability higher than what I've come up with?

economy,"Help me understand the ""Economy""","So I've been wondering for a while(since childhood actually), how it all ""works"".  I've read quite a bit of economic theory, business cycles, etc.-but all of these ""models"" seem to be lacking something-otherwise they would predict the inevitable retracements that seem to occur.  It occurs to me that an economy's basis is really its ability to grow food and extract raw materials-in order to grow more food and extract/create more raw materials to continue expanding/enabling the population to sustain/grow.  Once this basic requirement is met, the next level of the economy is the development of technology/rendering of services that makes this process more efficient or causes the discovery of further pools of resources(whether they be renewable or not).  After a certain level of luxury is met, there appears a need to incentivize the workers(components of machine)to maintain their levels of output and reward work done(so they'll continue doing it).  At this point there is an expansion into goods/services that make human life fundamentally better, making the cogs work better.  A saturation point is reached when the limitations of a broad field of technology/expansion are reached within society.  Because the system is capitalist, and based on an exponential growth theory, it is already financially overleveraged at any point of its expansion(meaning that any information coming into it that does not meet the model causes price shocks as price reflects value of the anticipated future).  The system begins to break down and prices(anticipatory)plummet proportionately to participant bias weighted by financial capitalization of individuals.  This in itself is following a natural rhythm of the rise and decay of ecosystems, just as a forest follows development and burn cycles.  The process allows old, decaying institutions and structures to be razed/made anew so society can retool its approach to fundamental growth/development problems.  Life is in itself a process of expansion and development, a will to survive and thrive in whatever conditions it is AWARE of and finds itself in.  Stagnation only leads to extinction.  Thus I find that the actions of the Federal Reserve, and central banks in general, to be completely short sighted.  Since the 2008 financial crisis little has changed except for the growth of American shale oil.  The financial burden of an overleveraged housing market, and the resulting financial strain have been eaten by the American public in the form of more government debt(monthly interest paid by more over leveraging by the financial sector).  The leverage comes from anticipating further exponential growth in the energy sector(majority of new jobs/etc), which as it turns out-cannot payback its leverage due to global competition at providing cheap oil.  It is obvious that a major industry shift has been needed, as evidenced by growing statistical information on climate change/human health(energy production/healthier living), yet it seems likely that we are headed for another round of over leveraging to maintain ""status quo"", which only serves to further destabilize our technological transition to 21st century models/needs.  Add to this situation that the majority of the workers that make this system possible are chronically underpaid, that the efforts of many go to the few and the system gears itself to please only these few-and you have the recipe for the perfect storm.  That is if the Federal Reserve doesn't go for QE4, or hasn't been quietly injecting currency into equities via it's ""subsidiaries"".  What am I missing?",finance,1452702171

How can I tackle this, and is debt consolidation something to look into?","Over the course of a decade of poor choices &amp; planning, unexpected expenses and living beyond my means, I have accumulated a fairly large personal debt. I want to pay this off as quickly as reasonably possible, but I'm really overwhelmed with where I should start.

My debt is as follows:

$2000 on VISA @ 13% Interest

$5400 on Line of Credit @ 7% Interest

$14,000 on Mastercard @ 1% interest

$10,000 on car loan @ 5% interest


My salary is around $65k, so I pull in about $4k per month after taxes. After all my expenses, I have about $500 per month to put towards debt. I am in the process of budgeting and eliminating all unnecessary expenses, so I hope to get that number up to at least $1000. I require my vehicle for work, so selling it isn't an option at this point.

I own my home with around $50k put towards the principal, but no other assets or savings besides the $20k I have in my retirement savings.

I'm gathering up shit in my house that I can sell, and can probably get $1000 fairly quickly. I'm also going to talk to my employer about cashing out vacation days, so I can probably get another $2000 for that. As for the rest of my debt, I just don't know where to start. Should I just tackle things with the debt-snowball method? 

I've also heard ads from Moneymentors (in Canada), which offers debt consolidation at a 5% interest rate. This seems like it could be a good way to go, but what does this do to your credit / credit cards?

personalfinance,How do I choose a bank? (And other debt related questions),"Hello r/personalfinance. I have been lurking here for a long time, but I finally am determined to take some action into getting my finances in order. Here's what I've got:

I currently have a prepaid debit card through one of those check cashing places, not ideal but it was working for awhile. I am scared to put money into a real bank, as I have debts with Bank of America and AmEx, as well as federal student loan, so I am afraid of losing my money from a bank account. The BofA and Amex should fall off my credit report by the end of this year (at least that is my understanding) so I am planning on ignoring that for now.

 I want to start paying the federal student loan debt so that I can actually collect my tax return (It has been garnished for the last 2 years). The last time I spoke with them I was making $8/hr and didn't follow through with paying them, as I could barely feed myself and pay rent. The person I spoke with offered me a payment plan around $140/month to be taken directly from my bank account, which didn't exist at the time.

 I recently got a raise and I now make $17/hr and I am at the point where I am not completely broke at the end of the month. I want to set up a real bank account at a real bank where I just put in approximately the amount that they will automatically withdraw for my federal student loan debt every month. 

I would also like to start a savings account, as I have no emergency fund or savings to speak of. I have no clue how to choose a bank that won't charge me crazy fees and that will give me a relatively decent savings interest. (I am in California, if that helps) Also, can money be taken out of my bank account for past debts? Or is that not a real thing? I honestly am clueless about money. Neither of my parents are good with it either, and my dad calls me every time I get a paycheck to ask to ""borrow"" $20-40 for gas... That's a whole other problem though. I just want to figure out my own mess. 

I created a budget, and I am trying to stick to it. I just want to get this federal student loan ~$15,000 paid off so that I can stop worrying about it.

personalfinance,"Learn the rule of 72, when you start investing for the future","""What is the best security to invest in when saving for retirement?"" The best answer is a question: How much time do you have before you retire? Thanks to compound interest (Albert Einstein called it the 8th wonder of the world), you can determine how long it will take to double your investment. Divide the number 72 by the interest rate you expect to get from your chosen investment. For example, if you own a mutual fund paying 8%, you would divide 72 by 8 = 9. So it would take you 9 years to double your money with an 8% compounded return. If you make 3%. 72/3 = 24. It would take 24 years for you to double your money at 3% per year. This is why you should not use a bank savings account to save for retirement. You won't live long enough to see your money double.
The younger you are, the more risk you should be able to take, so that you can potentially double your investment more quickly. By risk, I mean investing in inexpensive securities like small-cap growth ETFs, and emerging market international ETFs, and so on.",finance,1452712396

I assume they should pay the delinquency (only line of credit) in full, then open a credit card to build credit the right way.

- Should they pay off the 900 in full or pay it off monthly? 
- Should they still bother with trying to get a pre approval from their CU?
- What's the probable down payment? What's the ideal (in your opinion).
- Is paying down a feasible option? I assume the interest rate would be shit high, but if they pay more than required a month, will the hit be less?

investing,Let Uncle Pegasus explain to you what's happening here in very simple terms.,"The world is massively in debt.... To itself.  Many times over, like a car full of stoners who all jokingly said, ""Yeah man, I'll totally owe you $100k if you do that.""  
  
It's all cute until they start making actual contracts and agreements based on how much debt their owed by all the rest.  Finally, when this bullshit has gone on so long it has become a way of life, one of the stoners tries to cash in a debt.  ""Hey man, can I get a little of that $2 million you owe me.  I want to show this other guy I'm good for it so I can get some of his Doritos.""  
  
And he says, ""Well, hold on man.  I don't actually have that money.  Let me see what I can do.  Hey man, can I get some of that $4 million you owe me?  This other guy wants to see some of the money.""  
  
And soon the whole car degenerates into bickering and bullshit as they all realize each one is full of shit and no one actually has any money at all.  
  
After a calamitous argument, the car finally resets down to what hard assets they each actually own: a used pipe and half a bag of Doritos.  What so many highly paid professionals fail to realize is this: money is imaginary, and only useful as a fluid for debts and accomplishments to flow through society - if the money isn't being used to lubricate the machinery of society, it (and the host) dies just like a body in shock.  
  
-------  
  
As well, the biggest economic experiment of our entire civilization is ending cataclysmically: zero percent interest (soon to be negative percent interest).  
  
Our global economy got its bullshit called back in 2008, and the band-aid: to print free QE money, has propped up the stock market but not solved the underlying problems.  
  
The increasing wealth inequality is creating an unsustainable situation where a tiny tiny few own all the wealth and are the noble class to the other 6.999 billion... But what incentive do the rest have to work hard if they can't afford anything?  
  
And thus, the global economy is finally collapsing... Back down to the half bag of Doritos it came from.  
  
There will be a temporary flight into the US Dollar in coming months (possibly years) which will mean the US stock market won't totally crumble, but it will still be bad.  Ultimately hard assets are going to rule the day as the silly Keynesian make believe game crumbles around us all and we realize we can't actually make up exponential amounts of money from nothing.... When there are superior alternatives available.  
  
So enjoy the end result of your Wall Street Martingale strategy where you assume you can acquire tiny gains forever, while ignoring the increasing potential for total ruin.  The stock market has always gone up, right?  And we all know past performance guarantees future return.

personalfinance,P2P Loan to Pay Off CC Debt - What am I missing?,"Been lurking /personalfinance ever since I became motivated to get my finances back in order. I'm almost always able to find an applicable thread for my questions but didn't see much on this...

Background (Can be skipped, but I think it explains why I'm not looking for other methods to reduce debt): 
About 9 months ago it really hit me how irresponsible I was being financially. 26 years old, 4 years into a career after graduating college, making an above average salary, but still living mostly paycheck to paycheck. After further review, it was worse. I was living beyond my means, racking up credit card debt. In summary, here's where I was:
Living Expenses (Rent/Food/Utility+Phone Bills/etc.) - All being paid for on time but without much breathing room. 
Student Loans - Being paid for on time bit without much breather room.
Car Loan - Being paid for on time (3 months left)
Savings: +$500
CC Debt: -$10,000 (yikes!)
401k: +$25,000 (finally some good news!)

Probably not the worst /personalfinance has ever seen but still nothing to be proud of. 

First things first, make a budget, obey the budget. Happy to say that 9 months later I'm doing this. Budget includes contributions to savings (my emergency fund) and paying down CC debt (after paying off car loan, that former monthly expense always goes to CC debt). 

Next thing I checked was early withdraw from or loan against my 401k. No-go per the plan policy. I wasn't for sure going to do this, but at least wanted to check my options.

Current Status:
Living Expenses, Student Loans - All being paid for on time. Not a major concern when net paycheck is coming.
Car Loan - DONE
Savings: +$1000
CC Debt: -$9,000
401k: +$25,000

The Actual Question:
Currently have $9,000 in credit card debt at 22.9% variable APR. Paying off as much as I can every month (about $350/mo, some months more when other expenses are under budget). Continuing at this pace I'll be done in about 3 years. I started looking around at P2P loans to refinance the debt. Prosper and Lending Club were the ones I looked at because they made it very clear that they could quote me a rate based off a soft pull off my credit history. Prosper was better and this is what they were offering. 36 month term, 15.6% APR FIXED, $300/month, no-prepayment penalties. 

My Credit History: No late payments, 10 year oldest credit line, many other lines just short of 10 years (thanks student loans), minimal recent activity, but a VERY high 86% debt/credit ratio. 

So my question is: What am I not seeing as cons to not do this?
Pros: 
I'm being offered a lower interest rate via Prosper vs. credit card company so I'll end up saving about $1500 over next 3 years. (assumes the standard origination/closing fee to Prosper, they haven't disclosed that yet).
Still have early payment options without penalty. 
I don't think my credit score will be hurt much, maybe even improved by lowering debt/credit.

Cons:
Agreeing to pay $300/mo instead of CC minimum of about $170/mo.

Thousands of people queued up outside shops across the US on Wednesday, hoping to defy the odds of 292.2 million to one.
California Lottery tweeted that the winning ticket in the state was sold at a 7-Eleven store in Chino Hills, a suburb east of Los Angeles.
Television pictures showed a cheering crowd gathering at the shop after the result was announced.
The winners will share a prize of $1.586bn. They can collect their winnings in annual payments over 29 years, or opt to share a lump-sum payment of $930m.
The government will also share in the big prize, however, levying a 39.6% federal income tax on the winners - and the payout will also be subject any taxes that the winners' home states may impose.

personalfinance,Been making payments for almost a year but the vehicle's payoff is only $600 lower than signing.,"Background:
I'm new to being financially responsible and I've been late on some payments. I recently switched to a job that pays me ~10k more a year that allows me to better cover expenses in my one-income household. My SO is working on getting disability for reasons I won't disclose. I'm in the midst of learning proper financial planning and implementing a plan.

My long term goal is to improve my credit score enough to qualify for a FHA loan (660 from 560) in approx. 18 months. At or around that time I'm trading the vehicle in, anyway, because it no longer fits the needs of my family. That endeavor is for another /r/personalfinance thread. 

The deal:
I bought a Nissan and financed through NMAC in April 2015 with an original amount financed of $14,700 and interest rate of 12.63% with a payment of $291. I've been making my payments, sometimes up to 30 days late, with one instance of missing a second payment. I've always paid them and never asked for a deferment for a payment. 

On NMAC's site it says I've paid $977 in principal and $1100 in interest. My payoff amount is just under $14,000. I'm having a hard time understanding how I paid $2000 worth of payments but only dropped the payoff by $600.

I've only just learned today that I can split my payments between principal and interest in order to avoid high interest charges later on. I have finally budgeted for a payment higher than the actual amount due every month and I have a few questions for you, /r/personalfinance.

1. With my interest rate should I be paying all of my payment towards to principal or splitting it?

2. Can anyone explain why, if it isn't due to interest, my payoff amount hasn't decreased?

3. I have GAP and an extended service contract. I'm considering canceling those and refinancing now in an attempt to lower the rate. I'll be discussing that with the finance manager tomorrow. Would it be a smart idea to refinance now for a better rate even though I plan on trading it in in the next 1-2 years (once I'm no longer upside down or barely upside down)?",finance,1452798354

###Questions
1. Bonds Allocation Questions
 * What’s up with the “coming bond crash?” Should the Fed “likely” hiking interest rates scare me out of my 10% bond allocation?  
 * Is my 70%/30% Intermediate-Term to Aggregate Bond split worth the extra incurred ER? My thoughts were to weigh heavier the Intermediate-Term bonds to decrease the allocation’s sensitivity to interest rate changes while including the Aggregate bonds to increase allocation diversification.
2.	International Stocks Allocation Questions
 * I included SCZ (with a 0.4 ER) in order to better approximate VGTSX. Should I forgo the smaller-cap exposure this nets me to decrease my fund’s overall ER (0.07 with vs. 0.06 without)?
3. General Questions

personalfinance,How I paid off $10k in CC debt in one year ($55k - no windfalls),"**How I paid off $10k in CC debt in one year ($55k, SoCal, NO WINDFALLS)**

I wanted to do a write up in how I paid off my CC debt in a year, because every post I see about people paying down large portions of debt after a major job promotion or raise or change had no meaning to me.  I needed to find a way out of credit card debt that was accrued over a large period of time without having to depend on a windfall or major life change, and the majority of the success stories I found were from people already making 6 figures, or had changed jobs multiple times to triple their income.  Here's how I did it with a simple 2% cost-of-living raise and a low-mid income.

**Income/COL Stats (Begin January, 2015)**

**Beginning Cash:** ~$1,000 (Dec 31, 2014)

**Location:** Southern California, 45 min. North of Los Angeles

**Income:** $55,000 ($1,480 Take Home every 2 weeks)

**Raises:** 1x 2%, effective April

**Rent:** $775 (2 BR Apt, $1550 split with partner)

**Gas:** $3.15 - $3.85 / gal

**CC Available:** $12,400 (4 cards)

**CC Debt:** $10,000 (81% Used)

**Avg CC APR:** 22%

**Credit Score:** 630

**Car**: $455 ($250 car, $205 insurance)

**Phone:** $105

**Step 1 – IMMEDIATE Reduction in Monthly Costs**

**TV (Saved $130/month)**

I dropped my DirecTV bill ($150+ a month) at the end of 2014.  I had to pay a couple hundred bucks for the cancellation, which was fine, as I saved that much after a month and a half of no service.  With the internet a practical necessity, and Netflix/Amazon/Hulu, I substituted $150 in cable for what is relatively $18, since I consider the free Prime shipping to far outweigh what we pay (as a household) for the service.  We also barely watch Amazon streaming, so I don't consider this paid TV for this purpose.   I also found an antenna on sale for about $40 purely so I could watch some sports.

**Phone (saved $50/month)**

The first thing I did was call and change my phone plan.  I was grandfathered into unlimited data as long as I had stayed with the rate that I had been paying.  However, when I looked at my usage I found that, primarily because I'm usually connected to WiFi, I was using less than 3GB of data a month.  Switching from my old plan that was around 7 years old, I went from $105 a month to $54 a month.

**Insurance (saved $50/month)**

While I had various driving related issues on my record, my insurance for my leased civic started at around $205 a month for the year.  I was about to start shopping around, wherein I found that by switching companies I could save around $60-75 a month.  However, due to some bad history falling off, safe driver, etc, my insurance ended the year at about $154, and they've been great in helping me take care of some issues I had along the way, so I didn't feel the need to change.  I would say, though, that anyone looking to save money should shop around, as switching companies will result in a money savings the majority of the time.


**Step 2 – Planning and Preparation**

**YNAB – You Need a Budget ($65)**

I spent money to buy YNAB.  It's a tool that was highly touted, and since I didn't really need some of the features of Mint, and YNAB was so user friendly (the phone app is too easy), I figured the $65 would not be really frivolous, but instead would be a valuable asset on my road to recovery.  Being able to track every dollar I spent was not necessary sometimes, but having the underlying responsibility and commitment to myself in the background forced me to change the way I viewed my money.

Also, using the Reporting function on YNAB let me SEE my progress month after month...ok to be honest I checked it like every few days...but SEEING the progress helped keep me on track.  I watched the trend move month after month, and this is what I saw at the end: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png

**Excel – Short Term Predictions**

I created a spreadsheet in Excel that tracked all of my cards separately as well.  While YNAB does allow you to budget, it does not effectively help you plan down to the days of the month.  With payment due dates, bills, etc, I needed a way to not only TRACK my money, but to PREDICT where my accounts would be on any day.
This would prove absolutely crucial, as it let me make massive payments without fear of overdrafting or any other bad news pop ups.  There were times when my checking account was as low as $20.  This didn't really matter, though, because I knew where my money would be days and weeks later with no surprises.

**Come Up with a Payoff Plan – Snowball, Avalanche**

I needed to decide how I was going to tackle this debt first.  Through a series of taking care of partners, bad choices, and various life events, I went from having a 785 credit score and 9% APRs to about a 630 and maxed out 19%-25% APRs.  I messed around with unbury.me for a little bit, and determined that the course of action would be to tackle the highest APR first.  However, my plan wasn't all the way conventional.

Balance, APR - $2,000, 23.99%

Balance, APR - $2,200 22.90%

Balance, APR - $3,586 19.99%

Balance, APR - $2,200, 22.90% (Cash Rewards Card)

**Create TINY Emergency Fund - $1,000 Break Glass for Disaster**

First thing I did was change whatever money I had over to my checking account, and put $1,000 in a savings account.  This is something I did not touch for the entire year, thankfully, even after paying for car maintenance, fun times, or gift buying, or anything else that came my way.

**Zero out 401k Contributions – (Employer Profit Share, NO 401K match)**

Since my employer doesn't do 401K matching, I had no incentive to keep putting money into my 401K.  If this service is available from your employer, do not stop contributing to your retirement funds.  I did it solely because there was no extra money to be gained in the short term.  If I had matching, I would have saved money elsewhere (like food, see below) and still maintained retirement contribution funding.

**Create a Budget**

I used YNAB to set up a budget to TRY to stick to.  I set a lofty goal of paying off $1,000 in credit cards every month, and worked my budget DOWN from there.  I had the complete understanding that I would probably not hit this mark, but it forced me to find out where I didn't really need to waste money.  I would barely make this work by the end, through a series of monthly ebbs and flows, but only as an average.  I hardly ever hit the $1,000 mark.
This would entail paying off $1,000 across all cards.  Effectively this would be about $175-200 in minimum payments, and the rest of the $800 all to one card.  I often would miss this goal.


**Step 3 – ACTION**

**How to Control Spending – Using Cash Back Rewards Cards ONLY**

Even though I had the idea to pay down my highest interest first, the first thing I did was put my first big payment onto my cash rewards card to clear up room.  I opened a Capital One Quicksilver with a 1.5% cash back reward at the end of 2014, and made it an effort to use this card for 95% of my purchases.  I also have a Chase Freedom that has 5% cash back on rotating categories, which I would swap out to use during certain times of the year.  This was moreso a mental thing, as it let me feel like I was actually earning throughout the year, even though I was paying every dollar I had to my name to credit debt.  Additionally, I netted just around $450 in cash back rewards by Dec 2015.

**How to Control Mental Stability – Won't Always Hit the Goal**

As the months started to wear on, I had to change my budget little by little.  I knew by month 3 that paying $1,000 straight to credit cards every month wouldn't work.  Luckily by being paid every 2 weeks instead of twice a month, I knew that there would be a month in the middle and end of the year that I would be paid a third check.  I used the majority of these checks to ""catch up"" on payments.

**How to Control Emotional Stability – Allow yourself some joys in life**

VISUAL REPRESENTATION OF HOW I SPENT MY FUN MONEY: https://i.imgur.com/FddeIrY.gifv

Knowing that having a goal to pay this off in a single year was going to put me far away from some fun things, I focused on and took some liberties whenever something would come up.  I would do cheap happy hours with coworkers, I would still buy cheap fun things ($20-40 board games that I can play with my GF, a gadget here or there), and I would definitely allow myself to go out to dinner or go on date night with my GF a few times a month.
Using YNAB tracking, I realized that I STILL went to eat out to the tune of $300 a month.  This, for all intents and purposes, was frivolous fun money.  There was no need to spend this much if I had truly cared to reign it in, however food and service in Southern California is not cheap, and I was determined to enjoy myself and my friends and my GF throughout the year. 

If I had been in uncontrollable debt, or anything more than what I was, I would have cut out eating out to once a month.  Luckily my situation was controllable, and I allowed myself the flexibility and peace of mind to swap certain things for the possibility by a month or two.  Ultimately, I still paid off my cards in under a year.


**Step 4 – Watching the Weight Fall Off**

**The Beginning**

The first milestone was in March, when I was able to completely pay off my first credit card.  This was a major relief, and an acknowledgement that I may actually be able to pull this off.  After this first card was down, all I thought about was the next one biting the dust, and the next, and the next.

**The Middle**

My next payoff was in June.  Again, I wasn't hitting my $1,000 mark every month.  The realization of that in the beginning allowed me to maintain some sense of self, not feel 100% beholden to the debt schedule, and when the milestones hit, they felt FUN instead of RELIEVING.  Once I hit this point I really felt like I had it all in control.

**The End**

By November I made my last payment.  My last.  Payment.  $10,000 in UNDER a year.  I spent some money, I had some fun, I enjoyed myself and my friends, and I paid off the entirety of my credit debt.  Un.  Believable.


**Step 5 – The Aftermath**

2015 Chart: https://i.imgur.com/bLlQ1dK.png

At the end of the year as my debts started to become $0, I noticed a major influx of credit line increases and credit score increases.  In the span of that year my APRs dropped, my credit score rose by about 80 points, and my available credit was nearly doubled, all WITHOUT a phone call, an email, or any effort to do so.  The credit card companies are DIRELY missing the thousands of dollars I've been paying in interest, and they want me BACK.  They have repeatedly raised my credit limits and dropped my interest rates over the past couple of months.

Jan 2015 – 630

Oct 2015 – 705

**Cash Back Rewards**

**FINALE**

In short, I was able to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt with a $55,000 salary (2% raise) in SoCal in a year by immediately removing paid TV, changing my phone plan, and lowering car insurance.  I set aside a credit card to use for all purchases that had 1.5% cash back, which gave me some gift money for Christmas, and let me feel like I was earning throughout the year even though I was paying out every dollar I had.

Throughout the year I let myself understand that some months I would only be able to afford 60-70% of my goal, but that was ok.  In the end it all worked out.

I hope this helps someone who is on the fence or who often gets discouraged by stories of people with 6 figure incomes who can't control their wealth any more than we can.  IT CAN BE DONE.  And it might be easier…and ""funner""…than you think.

**EDIT**

Couple things.  First off, I would not always suggest that one should cut all retirement savings in the hunt for debt resolution.  There were a couple factors that went into me making this decision, one being that my APRs on my credit cards were astronomical.  I would suggest spending some time looking into your personal situation and what your company and/or personal gains/losses would be before forming your plan.

Secondly, thanks for all the positive responses!  As for the negative responses telling me ""oh yeah just pay off $10,000 in a year thaaanks""......I get it.  It's the internet.  Understood.  Please save your breath and your fingertip typing tire tread.  I simply made this post to give a take on an Average Joes mental and physical tackling of a very common problem, and honestly to call it what it is, lifestyle.  I'm just hoping to let people know who were in my situation or in my state of mind a year ago that it's possible to get it taken care of, even in an average situation.

Thirdly, LOL I am not a shill for YNAB.  It just seemed to be a better fit for me than Mint.  I spent some time on PF reading and looking at people's stories before I chose it.  The main point of this for me was that it held me accountable!  Having this little app on my phone requiring me to put all my expenses in, looking at charts and budget tables every week, and seeing negatives where I overspent was like having a little gremlin on my shoulder every time my wallet came out!  It was instrumental is changing my perception of money...MY money...the money I earn!  And deserve to keep.

**EDIT - Clarification on Take Home/Budgeting Clarity**

People seem to be asking about my take home a lot, and I think it's a very valid point to hammer home.  I was bringing home $1,480 * 26 = $38,480 / $55,000 = about a 30% withholdings (taxes, health, etc).  Again, this was at the beginning of the year, and I got a COL increase of 2% a little over quarter of the way through the year.

**As I mentioned in the OP, I get paid every two weeks, NOT twice a month.  This equates to 26 paychecks per year.  What I did was budget to the tune of two paychecks a month ($1,480 x 2  = $2,960) and not factor in the extra check that would come around in July and in December.**  The third paycheck on December 31 paycheck would end up not mattering in this instance, as I had already paid everything off by the beginning of December, however the third check I got in July went to car registration ($200), GF's birthday spending (Aug), some fun activities, and an extra payment dollars towards the card (I believe I put in an extra $500 out of this?  Along with the monthly.  Whatever was left over (wasn't a lot) I let sit in my account so it had more than $20 :).

Had I not gotten this extra payment, I still could have spent the same in August and finished the pay-off in December, however **this wasn't extra cash.  This was a budgeting decision.**.  I decided to budget only off of $35,520, not my annual take home of $38,480.  This was primarily an emotional facet, as the money was coming to me either way, but in an effort to reel in my spending habits, and to experience some joy over the Summer, I chose to not budget for that third check in July.

**EDIT - Excel Tracking Example**

http://i.imgur.com/wnpwfwX.png

**Excel File Dropbox Link**

https://www.dropbox.com/s/bv38oxylouziuap/Account%20Balance%20Forecast%20File.xlsx?dl=0

This is a portion of how I tracked my ACTUAL cash flow in/out, regardless of budgets/budgeting software.  **The budgeting software helped me allocate, while Excel helped me track.**  I hesitate to post the full document, as I'm not sure how useful it would be to anyone else's situations, but I'd be willing to help someone get one together for themselves if it would mean getting them on the right path to debt resolution TODAY.

I'll attach a screenshot of one of my Excel sections that I used to forecast my money.  I also did this in the same worksheet for all of my credit cards.

As it may be confusing to some, I'll break it down a little bit.  You'll see in it that I have a salary paid, rent and bills paid, and then future forecasted payments (in gray).  We'll have the Chase payment (this was minimum +~$5), the Cap One payment (this was THE card I was paying down at the time), plus a Quicksilver payment for a large amount.  This Quicksilver one was NOT paying down debt!  It was simply paying down the amount I had used during the month of March, as I used that card for 90%+ of my purchases to accumulate cash back rewards.  This is how I tracked not only where my money was going, but where it would be on a day-to-day basis.

**This also REALLY helped me see how much money I DIDN'T HAVE!**  By March 26 I would have $3,500+ in money in my account.  Normally this would be telling myself hey, I can definitely afford to buy something worth a couple hundred bucks!  But no.......now we see by April 3, literally a week afterwards, my account would only have $193 in it.

Again, this is just an example of how I did it.  I would set it up differently depending on needs, accompanying software, and personal setup.",finance,1452810649

Would love to get some insight and feedback on the best course of action for my student loans and how to wrangle them in. Been doing some research on refinancing and consolidating them, and not sure what the best course of action is.

Federal Loans:

$10,922 | 6.0% | $121/mo Payment | $30 Interest

$10,3944 | 6.0% | $115/mo Payment | $29 Interest

NJClass (Hesaa) Loans:

$17,754 | 7.62% | $184/mo Payment | $64 Interest

$16,739 | 7.35% | $192/mo Payment | $58 Interest

$8,998 | 7.62% | $90/mo Payment | $32 Interest

$7,100 | 7.59% | $70/mo Payment | $26 Interest

Total debt is $71.9K with $773/mo in payment. 

Little bit of info about me, 25yrs old, salary is 70k, 46k take-home, 5-10k bonus/side work a yr, Rent+Utilities is $1,700/mo (nyc), Phone 75$, I put $800/mo to loans, just finished paying off my credit card so I only have 2K in savings and 1K in a mutual fund that I contribute $50 a month to. Credit score is 750

I looked at Earnest for consolidating/refinancing, but was denied due to my low savings. I got pre-approved  at SoFi for the following interest rates
 
Fixed Rates: (Based on 72k loan)

5yr, 5.74%, $1,382.27/mo

7yr, 5.99%, $1,051.47/mo

10yr, 6.5%, $817.55/mo

15yr, 6.99%, $646.75/mo

20yr, 7.240%, $568.63/mo

Variable Rate: (Based on 72k loan)

5yr, 4.68%, $1,348.20/mo

7yr, 4.55%, $1,002.65/mo

10yr,  4.805%, $756.83/mo

15yr, 5.180%, $576.15/mo

20yr, 5.43% $492.44/mo


My plan is to get something with as low as a payment as possible for now to build up an emergency fund / savings for the next year or two... and then to put all available funds into paying off my loans. That's why I was thinking one of the variable rates for now, but I am not sure how 'stable' variable rates are. Would not like to consolidate and then in 3 months have my interest rates bumped to 9.9%(maximum for the variable rates at SoFi)

I was also thinking of only consolidating and refinancing the NJClass loans as they have the highest interest rate and no protection like the federal loans. My federal loans are much more manageable than the NJClass...

I guess what I'm asking is... what would be the best way to go about this? Are variable rates 'safe' enough? Should I just do all federal and private loans together? Does anyone have any recommendations for student loan banks, or any experience with SoFi? Are the rates I got pre-approved from decent, and would I be able to get better ones if I gave them a call? Would love some insight and feedback... These loans are a bit daunting. Thanks so much for taking the time to read this!",finance,1452815359

As the title states, I'm a college senior (graduating in August of 2016) and am looking for some advice as to what I should be doing as of right now, as far as my personal finance goes.

The main issue on my plate is, as most would guess, a ~$24,000 unsubsidized Stafford loan (principle, not counting interest). In addition to being a full time student, I work part time and make roughly $500/month (pre-tax), which is enough to cover my rent and some groceries. 

I've got roughly $9,000 in my savings (from prior jobs, internships, etc.), as well as a small amount of stock that was given to me, worth roughly $5,000 at the current price. 

Should I be doing anything with my savings and/or stock right now to help pay off my loan? Or would I be better suited to just focus on graduating and obtaining a decently paid job? I have pondered it for awhile, and can't quite decide which would be best. I thought about putting a few thousand of my savings toward the loan. Would this be pointless, given that my loan would still be over $20,000?

TL;DR: Senior in college, $24,000 unsubsidized Stafford loan, $500/month income, $9,000 savings, stock worth $5,000. What would be my best course of action at this point?

Thank you!

EDIT: Thanks again to everyone for all of the great advice. I think I've decided that I will begin to work on the 6.8% loan as soon as I'm able to, and will not consolidate that loan with the other loans (since it would increase the average of the interest rates).

One job was from April-Aug and I had around $16,200 in federal taxable wages. This job did withhold taxes.

I then moved to a different state to start a new job beginning in Sept. From Sept-Dec I made around $12,600 in income.  This second job doesn't withhold taxes, there is no W-2 or 1099 provided. I must do estimated taxes. 

However, I didn't have to do the estimated tax payment for 2015 because the calculated estimated tax amount was below the $1000 required level for IRS and below the state level as well.

So given my situation, I would complete two part-year state returns correct? One for each state.  

And that would also mean the income from both jobs is treated separately right? Because when I tried the taxcaster tool and combined the total amount from both jobs, it said I owed money.

It wasn't until very recently that I thought the philosophy behind this sub could apply to me.

**Some background**

First, my stats:

* Engaged w/wedding next year (fiancée doesn't make very much)
* 35-year-old male
* Live in the New York City metro area
* $100k in retirement savings (90-10 stocks-bonds and 50-50 dom-int'l)
* $80k salary
* $80k in student loan debt

That last line is where my story starts. Three years ago, after years spent working on a graduate degree, irresponsible spending, and not a lot of income, I had double that amount of debt -- most if it on credit cards with rates in excess of 20 percent.

I knew I had to get serious or else I'd never be free of that debt.

Yes, I had other money problems but it was impossible for me to see past my mountain of debt. To say that I was focused on debt would be an understatement; I frequently told people that my one goal in *life* was to be rid of debt. In other words, I wanted nothing more out of my time on this planet than for there to be one day between now and being buried in the ground where I didn't owe anybody money.

And so I made big changes -- got roommates, took a higher paying job outside of my field, stopped smoking, stopped going out, stopped eating out, went vegetarian, budgeted, begged for lower rates from my creditors, refinanced what I couldn't get lowered by asking. Maybe these sound normal to the group here, but I had never done much in the way of frugal living before so they *felt* big.

Yes, I also put money into an emergency fund, had the good sense to take my company's very generous retirement match, and read just enough to know I wanted to put my retirement funds in cheap mutual funds if only to never have to think about them, but just about every spare dollar I could squeeze out went straight to paying that debt.

After years of scrapping, late in 2015, I found someone willing to refinance my student loans a meaningful amount, which more than cut my rates in half to just over 3 percent.

I stopped for the first time in a long time to catch my breath and assess. I had paid off half of what had seemed an insurmountable mountain of debt, no longer had the feeling of swimming upstream against high interest rates, and not insignificantly, my debt was FINALLY lower than my assets for the first time in nearly two decades. I had a positive net worth!

The more I thought about my one life goal of getting out of debt, the sillier it seemed. Getting out of debt started to feel more like part of something more comprehensive along the path to something.

Maybe the mountain of debt was just a symptom. And maybe the actual disease was a lack of understanding and a lack of control over my situation. It's starting to become more clear that what I want out of life -- or at least the money part of my life -- is to not have to figure money into so much of my decision-making. I want to stop focusing on just one metric -- debt -- and start focusing on what it'll take to get to a point where the decision on how to spend my time is all mine, with enough put away to eat, live, travel a bit, read, exercise, work/produce if I feel like it, and enjoy more of these things with my wife. As good as those things sound, I'd like as much time as possible for them.

On the surface, the switch should be easy. I've picked up some pretty sweet frugality skills along the way to paying off debt, after all. But being hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt feels like you're on fire and it's easy to find the motivation to get out. Not to mention, when it comes down to it, with debt, all you do is make money, send that money to debtors by highest interest rate -- simple. There's a whole world out of there of tax-advantaged retirement, some stocks that make more than others, and other choices of places to send the money I'm saving toward financial independence..

Those of you who started deep in debt, what did it take for you to switch to a financial independence mentality? How tough was it? And where did you find the skills?

My dad is busy helping his new family of 4 children, and his wife and starting two companies, and my mother works retail and is in deep credit card debt. So am I basically unable to attend school for a few years even though everyone is pressuring me to start NOW and go insanely in debt?  

Honestly, I feel pretty suicidal. I feel like I'm going to be trapped into poverty/retail due to my parents financial decisions and planning, and it's also a bit on my shoulder's too due to me not getting a job until I finished High School, so I am at fault as well. But It just seems like this is impossible to afford by myself.  

TL;DR: early-life crisis. no money, random hours, but decent paying job for first time job, no college, high cost health insurance, car insurance, no vehicle yet, and it looks like I can't start school for YEARS, even though I'm already 20. What the fuck am I going to do with my life. I also live in Florida, so the cost of living here is fucking ridiculous(#17?). Sorry for the length. I'm gonna go lie down now.

Edit: Some good news, got exempt from paying healthcare in 2016 and have a code to put on my tax return- I still have no healthcare because the State of Florida decided to not give me it, but hey! No $3000 fine or $130+ monthly payments, right?",finance,1452828001

personalfinance,Need some advice how to juggle retirement and saving for a house (25 Y.O),"I am 25 years old, and relatively new to the workforce.  I looked at the ""waterfall"" picture and I feel I am following that for the most part.

I've saved 10k in checking so far (that is earning 3%); I meet my employer's match (6% from me, 5% from them); and I am hoping to get to $5500 per year for IRA (I did for 2014; I have some catching up to do for 2015, which I expect to hit with my tax return; and from now on I have auto-deposits to max it out from now on).. I have no real debt besides a 15k car loan at 1.5% (paid off my 30k student loan completely last year which greatly hampered my savings)

I am planning to get a house with my girlfriend (with a wedding most likely before that) within 2 or 3 years.  Optimistically speaking, I think I can expect about 1k extra per month on top of the retirement/loan/day-to-day obligations mentioned above.  

My main question is how should I be saving/investing that 1k per month?  My bank gives 3% on balances up to 10k which is why I've pretty much been nursing that balance until I got it there..  Now I have the option to get a credit card through them which will offer 4.5% on balances up to 20k (I need to spend 1k per month on it to get that rate, but this will far outweigh the credit card rewards I would otherwise be racking up-- this card provides additional rewards too anyways).  

Is my best bet to just save all my money in my checking (and pick up those modest gains) for the next two or so years?? If so, once I max out the balance that earns interest (which should be by the end of the year if I get their credit card; or now if I don't), is there another vehicle I should put additional money in?

Additionally, since I am so young, would it make more sense to put any of this money in my 401k?  I'm somewhat concerned with the state of the markets.. and due to the fed rate hike, I'm thinking that will impact less risky investment options as well and cause them to be more compelling options than index funds?",finance,1452830881
btc,We need to break up the unholy alliance between the Chinese miners and Core / Blockstream.,"We signed up for a grand experiment that would be controlled by math and not by men. 

Now we've had a year where the community is coming apart at the seams and today top dev Mike Hearn is selling his coins and abandoning the project.

Are we going to let Bitcoin be killed by 10 miners with cheap electricity &amp; cooling behind the Great Firewall of China and a private company which wants to cripple our code by limiting space on the blockchain and adding double-spends and high fees?

---

I'm really trying seriously here to put my finger on the *main* problems that are causing this whole Bitcoin thing to spin out of control.

I think the two biggest problems are:

(1) the concentration of most hashpower behind the Great Firewall of China,

(2) allowing Blockstream to hijack Satoshi's codebase, so that they could:

- artificially limit space on the blockchain (the 1 MB max blocksize), and 

- add support for double-spending unconfirmed transactions (RBF)

...*both of which are essential for their flagship vaporware product Lightning Network.*

---

Analyzing these two problems in more detail:

**(1)  Most hashpower is behind the Great Firewall of China**

Most hashpower is concentrated in China, behind what is essentially a network partition (or at least a major speed bump) on the global network topology: the Great Firewall of China. 

So if blocks got really big, the miners *outside* of China might actually suffer more, not the miners *inside* China (who have pretty decent bandwidth *amongst themselves*).

---

(If you've already heard a million times about US jobs being exported to China, you can skip down to the next section - the short section starting with a sentence in bold saying **""Wouldn't it be ironic...""**).

Now for a bit of economic background that most people know but I wanted to just review it here.

As we know, countries such as the USA *used to* have a solid domestic manufacturing base. But then the power elite in the USA discovered that it was easier to fire more-expensive US workers and let underpaid Chinese workers breathing smog produce cheaper (ie, lower-price and often lower-quality) versions of those same goods - and then the Fed could just print up unlimited little pieces of paper (fiat US Dollars) to import all that stuff to the USA. 

Paying workers decent wages and keeping the air breathable would have been *expensive,* but the Chinese have evidently shown they're fine with sacrificing those things.

So now:

- lots of what used to be made in the US is now made in China, 

- you can no longer breathe the air in Beijing, and 

- US manufacturing workers are out of jobs and [the shocking Deaton/Case study has shown that many middle-aged white Americans without college degrees are so depressed that they've started *killing themselves* (mainly using alcohol and Oxycontin/heroin) since the turn of the century](www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/health/death-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html).

Anyways, most people know about this outsourcing and money-printing situation I've just described, but I mentioned it here as a lead-in to suggest a weird ironic point about mining in China (in bold at the start of the next, short section below).

As we also know, the world finally has *real* money now: Bitcoin.

It's ""real"" because it's not infinitely printable by private central bankers who inject it into the economy as usurious debt, and because, like gold, its value doesn't depend on any ""counterparty"": you simply hold your value yourself, and verify it yourself - assuming you have enough bandwidth to run a full a/k/a verifying node.

So, I'll finally give the weird ironic point I've been building up to:

---

**Wouldn't it be ironic if - now that we finally have ""real"", quality money - we let its ""manufacturing"" (issuance, mining) be outsourced to China?**

Because that looks like what we've actually been doing here. 

---

Plus, maybe in some un-apparent, heretofore un-considered sense, **the Great Firewall of China really might be the ultimate form of ""capital control"".** 

Forget all those articles you read on ZeroHedge about billions about dollars being smuggled out of China via Macau, with people strapping little bundles of cash to their bodies under their clothes: 

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-03-15/how-smuggle-money-out-china

What if the *real* massive hemorrhaging of capital which the Chinese authorities are worried about *is Bitcoin itself* - and what if *that's* the main reason why they're gonna make sure they keep the Great Firewall of China in place - to keep billions (and maybe someday trillions?) of dollars in Bitcoins *inside China*?

I don't think Satoshi took the Great Firewall of China into account in his planning. I think he just assumed there would be one globally connected internet, with no top-level partitions.

So here's some things to think about:

- From what I'm told, the Chinese work hard and they're wild about saving money - they have trillions of dollars in T-Bills, and a lot of them are into gold. In the aggregate, the country is swimming in various forms of wealth. 

- Also: their government has strict capital controls in place to try to prevent people from expatriating vast sums of wealth out of China.

- And finally: many Chinese want *real* money. They know the dollar or the yuan could crash, so they want something which has no counterparty risk (like gold or bitcoin).

So I'd be curious to know *who* the buyers really are for all the bitcoins currently being ""cheaply"" manufactured in China. 

Do bitcoins mined in China stay in China - or do they get sold to the rest of the world?

I would guess that most early Bitcoin adopters with large hodlings who got in when it was *really* cheap were probably Westerners (assuming that early news about Bitcoin was more available in the West). 

But now, while Bitcoin is ""still"" in the USD 400s (which could be cheap, if it *survives* long-term) - I wonder who the main buyers are these days? 

Is it people like Blythe Masters and other bankers who are sitting on billions of USD - or is it the Chinese who are also sitting on billions of USD as well? (Or: Why not both?)

One group I'm pretty sure *isn't* buying up lots of bitcoins: ""average Americans"". 

Why? Because they're too broke.

Since Nixon unlinked the USDollar from gold im 1971, Americans have been getting screwed by insidious inflation and all the debt bubbles which formed around all the essentials in life (the housing debt bubble, the student loan debt bubble, the healthcare and pharma debt bubble, and the credit bubble which fuels all the others). Most Americans don't have enough cash to survive for more than a few weeks, and most can't even afford to take sick days or parental leave from work. The only people who have money are the ones near the printing presses: the bankers and their buddies.

There's certainly massive volume on several of the Chinese exchanges - although most people over on /r/BitcoinMarkets claim that it's all ""faked"" (mainly because there's no fees on those exchanges, so a lot of those trades could be ""wash trades"").

So, maybe the Chinese themselves are actually buying up a lot of those freshly-mined bitcoins, in China, using the trillions of dollars of T-Bills sloshing around in their system over there?

(And remember where those T-Bills ultimately came from: US Dollars which the USA printed up to buy cheap goods produced by Chinese slaves breathing smog.)

So - and here's my point again:

**Wouldn't it be ironic - now that the world finally has real, quality money - if we were actually currently outsourcing all of its production to China - and they (plus a handful of scattered bankers) are the ones who all buying up the first real asset the world has ever known, during its current ""mid-priced"" phase?**

**(2) Core / Blockstream / Peter Todd / Theymos / max blocksize / RBF / LN**

Where to begin? I'm sure you all know the story. Just a few reminders about RBF terminology:

(a) There are two orthogonal ""axes"" or ""dimensions"" to the whole RBF terminology (but some people get this wrong - I have no idea if it's intentionally or accidentally):

- **""Opt-In"" vs ""On-By-Default"":** This means what it says: for each transaction, you either enable RBF, or you don't:

  - **""Opt-In""** means the sender has to *enable* RBF for a particular transaction (ie: it's off-by-default)
  
  - **""On-By-Default""** would mean that RBF is ""always on"" but the sender could *disable* it for a particular transaction.

- **""Full"" vs ""FSS"":** 

  - **""Full""** means the sender can change *everything* about the transaction: not only the fee but also *the amount and the recipient*. 
  
  - **""FSS""** stands for ""First Seen Safe"" (by the way, where do the pinheads over at Core even get this retarded non-descriptive terminology anyways: FSS, RBF??). FSS means that the sender can alter *only* the fee - the amount and the recipient *cannot* be changed.

So, which combo of the above is Peter Todd / Core currently trying to force on users?

*Opt-In Full RBF*

I reviewed the terminology here to pre-emptively shut up the liars who often pop into these threads spreading FUD like ""But it's only Opt-In so it's not really Full"". 

That is simply wrong and I'm tired of them conflating those two orthogonal (ie independent) dimensions of the terminology.

And oh yeah, another thing: I have heard *plenty* of rumors that the long-term plan (from the traitors at Core / Blockstream) is to eventually (stealthily) force the worst form of RBF on everyone: 

*On-By-Default Full RBF*

But that will come later - once the frogs being slowly boiled (us, the victims of Blockstream's hijacking of Satoshi's code) have gradually gotten acclimated to ""Opt-In Full RBF"".

---

Anyways, now that that's out of the way, let's talk about some other things regarding RBF:

Yes we know, we know: Peter is ""merely"" adding something *which any hacker or malicious user could have added anyways* (if they modded the code, or if they tried really hard to misuse it).

But there's *plenty* of stuff which anybody do by modding the code.

For example - anyone could **change the code so that it accepts a different block size**. (In fact, [BU is mainly about making *this* easy for users](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3zki3h/bitcoin_unlimited_makes_it_more_convenient_for/) - instead of making double-spending easy for users like RBF does.)

So the ""convenience barrier"" is an important factor helping shape what most users do with the code. If a feature isn't already in the code, most users don't bother modding the C/C++ code and recompiling it and adding it. (Which is one reason why zero-conf has worked pretty well for so long - another reason being that in face-to-face retail, the retailer kinda does KYC already - ie, they literally ""know their customer"" to a certain degree - so certain social pressures and norms such as reputation do come into play - but Peter Todd doesn't really believe in those things, as we know.)

Now, Theymos / Core / Blockstream keep screaming that it would be taboo to mod the code so that it would accept bigger blocks.

But when *Blockstream* wants mod the code so that it allows double-spending unconfirmed transactions - well, in it goes.

That's because the real reason they're so gung-ho to get Full RBF added is because **[LN needs Full RBF in order to be able to work.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3y8d61/reliable_optin_rbf_is_quite_necessary_for/)**

So... when certain people say ""we need to allow confused users to be able to unstuck their transactions"", **they're lying**.

The liars at Blockstream don't care about users, and they don't care about miners. They want to rip off users (making them pay massive fees for space on an artificially tiny blockchain) and then in a double-whammy they want to rip off miners as well (stealing fees from those miners, via LN).

**Attention Bitcoin users and miners: Core / Blockstream don't care about you, and they're willing to lie to you in order to rip you off.**

As Mike Hearn mentioned in his farewell essay today, Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell once ""mathematically proved"" that Bitcoin could not exist.

And Blockstream founder Adam Back missed the boat on being an early adopter of Bitcoin, because when he first heard about it years ago, he also didn't think it would work.

And the gullible Chinese miners are running software from these liars at Blockstream who don't believe in Bitcoin who are sabotaging Satoshi's code to *decrease user adoption* (and price)) and eventually *steal miners' fees*. If miners continue to blindly follow Core / Blockstream, it's going to hurt the miners themselves.

&gt; The Nine Miners of China: ""Core is a red herring. Miners have alternative code they can run today that will solve the problem. Choosing not to run it is their fault, and could leave them with warehouses full of expensive heating units and income paid in worthless coins."" – /u/tsontar 

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3xhejm/the_nine_miners_of_china_core_is_a_red_herring/

And users who are still gullible enough to adopt a decentralized currency and then read about it on centralized censored forums controlled by some dweeb named Theymos are also going along with this.

Anyways, that's my rant for today. 

---

**Summary / Conclusions - plus a possible ""nuclear"" option (see the bold part below!)**

The main obstacles which Bitcoin needs to get around now are:

- the concentration of hashpower behind the Great Firewall in China

- the adoption of Peter Todd's RBF which would provide a GUI telling users they can and should double-spend or reverse transactions which haven't been confirmed on the blockchain yet

- allowing Core / Blockstream to artificially limit space on the blockchain - which drives up user fees, clogs the network, and supports their LN vaporware (which would also steal fees from miners)

- if you signed up for a decentralized permissionless currency and you're happy to read about it on a centralized censored website owned by Theymos (/r/bitcoin, bitcointalk.org), then you're doing it wrong.

These things were *not* what Satoshi envisioned, and I suggest we focus on trying to figure out how to get around them.

Solutions which de-emphasize the importance of Chinese miners might be important. If their blind obedience to Core / Blockstream is one of the main factors killing Bitcoin, then why should we protect them?

**Maybe if we're going to hard-fork, we shouldn't just bump up the max blocksize - maybe we should also invoke the nuclear option and change the PoW algorithm to bump the Chinese miners off the network.**

Because, the whole story about needing small blocks ""so that Luke-Jr with his shitty internet can stay on the network"" is *another* lie being peddled by Blockstream.

The *real* reason was identified by Gavin:

&gt; **""The physical bottleneck on the network today is not bandwidth to people's homes, it is the Great Firewall of China.""**

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/40kmny/bitpays_adaptive_block_size_limit_is_my_favorite/

So, if the Chinese are willing to throw Bitcoin under the bus for their short-term profits (and Core / Blockstream currently helping them).. then **maybe we should be willing to throw the Chinese miners under the bus now for the long-term success of Bitcoin.**

And, regarding Core / Blockstream, I we're actually making good progress towards routing around their damage - because [if coders don't give users the code they want, those coders eventually get left by the wayside](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3xafbb/you_dont_need_they_core_blockstream_devs_they/) - and this is starting to happen now. 

We already have several repos, (Classic, BU, XT) all of which *will* add some form of ""max blocksize"" increase. I wouldn't be surprised if *some of those repos might also decide to omit RBF.*

The new Bitcoin repos can easily cherry-pick features from ""Core"" which they did and didn't like - and they're going to have to compete to gain users. 

So ""max blocksize"" is definitely going to increase.

And RBF could be abandoned in the garbage heap of history, another curious bit of vandalism which gave Peter Todd another 15 minutes of fame and drama, and then the rest of the world moved on and got back to business.

And finally, regarding Theymos: he's gonna lose his power eventually. He's already lost a lot. Plus he's sloppy and careless and one of his screw-ups will eventually be his undoing.

personalfinance,Today I learned the hard way that friends and money don't mix,"As someone who considers themselves pretty financially savvy, I'm extremely bummed and disappointed to find myself in a situation like this.  A little background:

College buddy and I have been friends for a couple years.  Not super tight or anything, but I know him well, he's in my major, hung out fairly often in school, etc.  One thing that has always bothered me about him though is how poorly he seems to manage his finances.  He's invited me to lunch without any money and I've had to cover him, same for beers and whatnot.  Usually don't think anything of it because he'd pick up a round on another night, but him putting me in awkward situations like that always irritated me.

Yesterday, out of the blue, he texts me asking for a ""small favor"".  He wants to ask it over the phone, but I was busy so I told him just to ask me through text.  The story he fed me was that a textbook he needs was on a ""special sale"" for $90, and he needed the money to cover it before it went up to $200.  He gave me some ""oath of honor"" that he'd pay me back *immediately* the following morning once he had the funds in his Chase account.  Red flags were already going off in my head, but the puzzling thing was I used my prior hunches about him being financially moronic to justify his story.  Stupid mistake by me #1.  On the condition he pay me back this morning, I Chase quick-paid him the $90.  

Then, a few minutes later, he texts this super long message explaining he needs the solutions manual for the textbook and it's another $50, so $140 total.  Another red flag went off, why wouldn't he have just told me he needs the $140 right off the bat?  Irritated but still keen on helping a friend, I quick-paid him the remainder of the money.

Fast-forward to this morning.  No messages from Chase.  I give it until around 3PM and text him.  Gives me this long story and says he's driving and he'll do it right when he gets back.  Says he wants to PayPal the money to me because Chase won't let him quick-pay more than like $150 at a time.  I tell him that's not true, the limit for transfers is $2000 per day, and amounts below $500 clear instantly.  I tell him I need the money through Quick-Pay tonight.  He didn't have problems receiving the money, but now all of a sudden he has problems sending it back.  He assures me he has the money in his account, so I send him a request on Quick Pay and tell him to just accept it and I'll get my money.  No response.  I text him around 10 pm angrily explaining that the reason I loaned him the money **yesterday** was because he assured me I'd have it back **today**.  I have not heard from him since. 

It's become increasingly evident to me that the money was probably not for a textbook, and that he never really planned on paying me back today in the first place.  Of course, I wouldn't have lent him the money if I couldn't afford to not get it back, and I'm confident I'll get it back one way or another, but an experience like this sucks.  I don't trust him anymore, and I don't know if I ever should have.  I've never been gullible with money, but I still feel like I've been conned.  I have no idea what his financial situation looks like or what he needed that money for, and I should have investigated further, but I didn't because he was my friend and I trusted him to pay me back.

I can't be friends with someone who I don't trust, and once I get the money back I probably will cut off ties with him.  It's a shitty experience all around.

I'm posting this here because maybe some Redditors can learn from my experience.  If you need money so badly that you have to turn to your friends to borrow it, pay them back when you tell them you're going to pay them back.  If your friend asks for money, it's totally OK to turn them down.  Don't lend money you can't afford to lose.  And if you can tell they **really** need money, give it to them as a gift, not a loan.  It will amaze you how quickly money can sour just about any relationship.

Hope some of you will find some value in my mistake.

**UPDATE:** Basically he gives me this elaborate story about how he needs to use PayPal because his parents switched banks or some shit.  He sends the money on PayPal and I have it available to me and switched it over to my bank.  Just sucks because now I won't have that money for 3-4 days and I needed it today.

btc,The /r/btc China Dispatch: Episode 1 - China Reacts to Hearn’s Rage Quit,"Hello, fellow /r/bitcoin refugees! The thought recently occurred to me that the transition from North Korea to our new uncensored home here might be helped if more original content was published to this sub. As I am a translator by trade, it seems like the best way for me to contribute on an individual level is to provide the English-speaking community here with a window into how the Chinese-speaking bitcoin community thinks about bitcoin and the issues facing bitcoin today. I believe that it is more important now than ever to bridge the cultural and linguistic gaps in this space so that more minds can have access to all available information and work on the most important problems facing the community together.

Therefore, I have decided to commit a small amount of time every day for the next week to translating a Chinese discussion thread or news article into English. My hope is that you guys will find these translations interesting and informative and if the response this week is generally positive, I may consider making this into a regular project.

So, without further ado: here is a thread from the Chinese bitcoin forum 8btc.com regarding Mike Hearn’s recent decision to throw in the towel on bitcoin. The original thread can be viewed here: http://8btc.com/thread-27998-1-1.html)

Title: The Bitcoin Experiment Has Failed: Time to Sell Your Holdings and Pack it in Folks

Posted by **英年早睡**
 
&gt;I’ve spent more than 5 years being a Bitcoin developer. The software I’ve written has been used by millions of users, hundreds of developers, and the talks I’ve given have led directly to the creation of several startups. I’ve talked about Bitcoin on Sky TV and BBC News. I have been repeatedly cited by the Economist as a Bitcoin expert and prominent developer. I have explained Bitcoin to the SEC, to bankers and to ordinary people I met at cafes.

&gt;From the start, I’ve always said the same thing: Bitcoin is an experiment and like all experiments, it can fail. So don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose. I’ve said this in interviews, on stage at conferences, and over email. So have other well known developers like Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik.

&gt;But despite knowing that Bitcoin could fail all along, the now inescapable conclusion that it has failed still saddens me greatly. The fundamentals are broken and whatever happens to the price in the short term, the long term trend should probably be downwards. I will no longer be taking part in Bitcoin development and have sold all my coins.

Well it looks like one of the big gods has spoken. What are you guys still holding out for?

Back in 2013 there was a developer who gave up on bitcoin, and what happened after that? This is nothing but a personal miscalculation. I don’t care whether it’s a developer or even Satoshi himself saying that a decentralized system like bitcoin has failed - it’s equally meaningless and doesn’t do anything to change the general trend of robust development.

The future success or failure of bitcoin is not something that can be decided by a single person. Even if the entire development team quit there will always be new people who will take the reigns and continue development.

&gt; This Mike Hearn is the guy who was promoting XT, right? Just because XT has failed doesn’t mean that bitcoin has failed.

His decision “not to continue participating in the development of bitcoin” may be due to the fact that the community saw that he put forward the radical proposal known as XT and expelled him since he was not suited to core development. In truth, he didn’t exit core development, but was kicked out. Now with this announcement he’s trying to make it out like he’s the one quitting as a way to save face.

Given that he tried to promote the 8MB solution in XT, it’s clear that he’s not a “big god,” but more like just a “big cow” [*translator’s note: in Chinese netspeak, “big cow” can be used to refer to someone of talent, but the word is a significant step below “big god”*]. There is a greater security risk with 8MB. The real big god is the guy who proposed the “segregated witness” soft fork.

[*Response 7*]

Posted by **大绅士奇奇怪**

I looks to me like he’s pissed off because of the lack of support for XT. At the current stage the vast majority of people who accept bitcoin are fairly radical. Yet this big god complains in his essay that other people are too conservative! He’s gotta be off his meds. Also, this big god seems to really like to talk smack about China’s internet, but he doesn’t do anything except complain. His attitude is really not what you would expect from someone of his caliber.

Any time that money is involved any kind of radical proposal is going to be rejected. It’s the same reason why the US Fed can only move interest rates 0.25% at a time.

btc,The demise of Cryptsy: Let's talk node security,"It seems the cows have come home for Cryptsy after [revealing a massive theft](http://blog.cryptsy.com/post/137323646202/announcement), and even more incredibly they had been effectively running a ponzi scheme since last year covering it up. The amoral and illegal ramifications of this is a post for another day. 

As stated here, the apparent culprit was a rouge altcoin daemon:

&gt;After a period of time of investigation it was found that the developer of Lucky7Coin had placed an IRC backdoor &gt;into the code of wallet, which allowed it to act as a sort of a Trojan, or command and control unit. This Trojan had likely been there for months before it was able to collect enough information to perform the attack. It does not appear that this was the original developer for LK7, as on 5/22/2014, we received this message from the new developer who wanted to maintain the codebase

What is disturbing is that somehow this trojan horse daemon somehow sniffed out the Bitcoin and Litecoin wallets and enabled the hacker to rob them blind. If anyone knows more about exactly how that could have been done, I would love to hear some theories. 

Now, it seems obvious their first mistake was putting a coin daemon on their server that likely had little to no peer review of the code being some necro'd altcoin from an unknown developer. If anyone had, including them, it would have been noticed most likely. This itself is a good lesson for multipool and exchange operators before just putting anything on your server. *Make sure someone trustworthy verifies the code, and always build from source*

It is also obvious this bad wallet had far more system access than it should have had. Running under root with the rest of them perhaps? Of course, there is simply no way 13,000 BTC should have been sitting in a wallet on the their servers which could not have been ""cold"" in any sense. Stating that it was in any way is simply a lie. 

Without making this post too long, **I would like to hear from our resident experts on security recommendations when it comes to running coin daemons in a multipool or exchange type environment to prevent such attacks**, even just good security recommendations for running a single Bitcoin node, preferably gravitating toward Ubuntu specifically as I would think is the most common platform. 

I myself have been building a UNOMP multipool test server (Ubuntu Server 14.04LTS) at home which I have running with Bitcoin and Litecoin, curious myself of the best way to secure it properly. I am not a total newbie to Ubuntu or running the daemons, but still inexperienced enough to be unsure I covered my bases. For the good of us all, I am hoping we can build some solid guidelines for the best operational security for our nodes. I know this is somewhat altcoin related, but in this case an altcoin managed to basically destroy a Bitcoin exchange.",cryptocurrency,1452856369
personalfinance,Recent graduate balancing emergency fund size with student loan payments while working in the layoff-prone oil &amp; gas industry,"Hello r/pf! I finished grad school last summer and re-entered the workforce, and I'm looking for some advice on my financial plan going forward. Overall I've got a pretty good situation going on, but there's a few peculiarities that I want to make sure I handle intelligently. I work abroad as an American expat in oil &amp; gas, which provides a lot of advantages but also a worrying dose of uncertainty right now due to the dismal price of oil.  
  
**Financial Summary:**  
Age: Single 30M  
Income (after tax): $125k (paid in US)  
Student Loans: $90k (at rates between 3.5-7.2%)  
Monthly food/bills/whatever spend: $1.5k approx  
No credit card debt or housing/car expenses  
$18k in checking account  
No dedicated emergency fund, but I've been keeping the checking account above $10k to act as an e-fund if necessary.  
  
**Financial Goals:**  
Pay off student loans  
Potential home purchase in 2-3 years if I'm no longer an expat  
Financial independence / early retirement  
  
**Additional Info:**  
My company offers a great 401(k) deal, where my 5% deposit is company-matched with 10% additional, so of course I'm doing that. If I get laid off the severance package would be about a $25k payout, but I'd get repatriated to the US and my cost of living would go up significantly (rent, bills, transportation, higher cost of living, etc).  
  
**Questions:**  
My question is how to balance attacking my student loans with funding IRAs and further investing, while also building an emergency fund that would prepare me for the possibility of layoffs due to the low oil price right now.  
  
Right now I'm putting $2k/mo towards the loans, using the avalanche method to attack the highest interest rates first, which will pay them off in 4.2 years. I can afford to pay more than this, but have been doing the $2k/mo for the last few months while I've had additional expenses of moving, medical bills, and other stuff. Going forward, I could triple my loan payment to $6k/mo and bring the payoff time down to 1.4 years, but this would leave me with very little cash on hand to tide me over if I got laid off. Alternatively, I could be less aggressive with the loans and pay some interest until (hopefully) the oil price recovers a bit and job stability gets a bit higher, leaving me with more cash in the bank if I need to weather months of unemployment. What do you think is the best strategy to tackle this debt while also trying to build some safety for potential unemployment?  
  
Beyond the question of what to do with loans, I'm wondering about further investment. The next step beyond my 401(k) that I know of would be an IRA. Is investing in an IRA while also paying down my student loans prudent, or should all available cash go to the loans? If an IRA is intelligent, should I max out my 2015 contributions before April by taking money from my checking/e-fund? I think I'll wait to do any other forms of investment until the loans are gone, but I'm wondering if the tax advantages of investing in an IRA would make it smart even while paying down the debt.  
  
That's about it for now, thanks in advance for your help!",finance,1452857837

It would be much less expensive than a 51% attack.

I know this sounds like a conspiracy theory but I feel it is plausible at this point.

It's been too well carried out and too organized.

The community discord directly parallels [this CIA handbook on how to sabatoge and destroy an organization](https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2012-featured-story-archive/CleanedUOSSSimpleSabotage_sm.pdf). ( [book summarized well here](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-12-08/declassified-cia-manual-shows-how-us-uses-bureaucracy-destabilize-governments) )

This user [summed up the similarities between what has been happening in Bitcoin with the methods stated as being effective in this handbook.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/411kyx/reading_mike_hearns_description_of_bitcoin_cores/cyyxmo7)

There *are* individuals and groups devoted to destroying Bitcoin. For example, [""Rand Corporation"" is researching how to destroy Bitcoin in this comprehensive research paper](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1200/RR1231/RAND_RR1231.pdf). It talks about the various methods that can be realistically used to terminate Bitcoin. It's quite amazing to see that level of professional effort and research being put forth. It shows *the demand is there*.

The bigger point is: the mode of operation of Core is the same mode used to destroy a business. It doesn't matter if they are doing it on purpose or not. How they are acting is optimal to destroy Bitcoin.

I personally believe it *is* intentional, however. This is not happening by accident.

The risk for having this viewpoint is that the carrier of it can be labelled a ""conspiracy theorist"". We know this happens.

We also know it's next-to-impossible to prove, other than by actions. Actions speak louder than words.

The fact that one would be called a ""conspiracy theorist"" is just confirmation that this needs further investigation. It would simply be dismissed otherwise, without the need to defend it.

**Update:** The reason why I feel it is a *government agency* or a *Federal agency* at the source of this (as opposed to the Core developers or Theymos or Blockstream, or sheer stupidity) is a matter of simple logic: Any Bitcoin company or individual using Bitcoin has a vested interest in Bitcoin becoming *more popular* and more widely used. They would not want to destroy its value. But what we are seeing is Bitcoin actually being destroyed. You must ask yourself, then: who does Bitcoin's very existence threaten? And to that I would point to the Federal Reserve, banks and/or governments.

This was his post today (edit: [link](http://avc.com/2016/01/bitcoin-is-dead-long-live-bitcoin/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AVc+%28A+VC%29)):

*Bitcoin is dead, long live bitcoin*

I’ve been writing about the Bitcoin blocksize debate here at AVC (the only place I write and I’m hard core about that) for the past year. It’s a big deal. At the core of the debate is whether the Bitcoin blockchain should be a settlement layer that supports a number of new blockchains that can be scaled to achieve various goals or whether the Bitcoin blockchain itself should evolve in a way that it can scale to achieve those various goals.

In my simple mind I liken it to this. Should Bitcoin be Gold or should Bitcoin be Visa. If it is Gold, it’s a store of wealth and something to peg value to. If it is Visa, then its a transactional network that can move wealth around the globe in a nanosecond.

Mike Hearn, one of the early members of the Bitcoin core developer team, published a blog post yesterday stating that “Bitcoin Has Failed” in which he explains that the block size stalemate plus a few other big issues have led him to believe that Bitcoin is now a failed experiment.

When one of the most important people in Bitcoin states something like that you have to listen. I read his entire post a couple times. And I generally agree with his description of what has happened and, more importantly, what has not happened. I’m not ready to declare that Bitcoin has failed. But I’ve always viewed Bitcoin as an experiment that could fail and I still do. I personally own a material amount of Bitcoin, but in our personal asset allocation it is at the very bottom, below our wine collection. And I’m not a wine collector.

In every Bitcoin investment we’ve made at USV, and we’ve made four with multiple rounds in one, we have identified the failure of Bitcoin as a core risk element. We haven’t stopped including that in our risk factors. So we have our eyes wide open about the fragility of Bitcoin. But we also have our eyes wide open about the potential and the importance of this technology.

I personally believe we will see a fork accepted by the mining community at some point this year. And that will come with a new set of core developers and some governance about how decisions are made among that core developer team. But it could well take a massive collapse in the price of Bitcoin, breakdowns in the Bitcoin network, or worse to get there. And all of that could cause the whole house of cards to come crashing down. Anything is possible. Even the return of Satoshi to fix things as an AVC regular suggested to me in an email this morning.

The Bitcoin experiment is six years old. There has been a significant amount of venture capital investment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. There are a number of well funded companies competing to build valuable businesses on top of this technology. We are invested in at least one of them. And the competition between these various companies and their visions has played a part in the stalemate. These companies have a lot to gain or lose if Bitcoin survives or fails. So I expect that there will be some rationality, brought on by capitalist behavior, that will emerge or maybe is already emerging.

Sometimes it takes a crisis to get everyone in a room. That’s how the federal budget has been settled for many years now. And that may be how the blocksize debate gets settled to. So if we are going to have a crisis, let’s get on with it. No better time than the present.",cryptocurrency,1452870468

personalfinance,How do I request credit score forgiveness?,"Long-time lurker; first time poster.

I know I've seen this suggested in the past for cases of identity theft and the like, that somehow, individuals can reach out to credit scorers and request forgiveness for issues that weren't our fault. I can't find the posts that made me think of this, but before I go to the bank a naive little idiot, I wanted some Reddit ammo. 

The backstory:

I used to have a 750, largely due to my student loans, inherited amex credit from a card joined to my parents' account, and a single Target card which I managed, as well as a joint bank account with my mom. When I left the state, I couldn't really use my joint account anymore, and I asked my mom to close it... but she didn't. I also requested that the bank send me personal electronic statements and notices, because my parents never sent me my mail, and my account went through some serious issues:

- my savings account was closed without my notice (because my parents never told me I was getting notices, and the bank never sent me electronic notices) due to too many withdrawals in a month, before I knew about the 6/mo limit (I was about 19)

- The checking account started charging me $1/mo for just having it open, so I put $25 in it, and told my mom to close it within the year... she didn't.

- Over the next year and a half, the checking account continued to charge itself fees without my notice (well... as above), and overdrew to an amount of about $50 before I caught it. 

- I put in another $250, and reminded my mom to close the account (I still wasn't able to return home, living far away). But with about 6 months, that was drained too, and I got a notice in the mail - to my parents' house, which they didn't tell me about for months - that my checking account was again overdrawn by about $200!

- I finally tried to contact the bank, chewed my mom a new one, and told her that she was ruining my credit by not closing the account (which the bank insisted could only be done in person, not over the phone or with any kind of other authorization) but couldn't find them anywhere. 

Apparently, at some point, the Feds shut down the bank agency for illegal practices, after it was bought and absolved by TD bank - my mom was only able to figure this out with explicit confirmation from TD Bank, with whom she has other cards. 

I'm in the process of cutting financial ties with my parents so I can take more responsibility for my own finances, with a lot of help from PF, and wanted to see if there was any way to get my credit score raised a bit, and be forgiven for the ""illegal practices"" that shut down the bank agency, and caused so many withdrawals/fees to my account without my consent/knowledge/notice, despite opting in multiple times to the electronic notices. I know there's a way to request forgiveness, but I don't know what that is... Can PF help me out? I tried to search for it, but maybe I'm not using the right terminology...

For the first year and a half out here, I didn't buy a car and relied on public transportation, walking, and generous friends to get places (which allowed me to have some social life) and put as much money as I could each month against paying off my student loans. Any bonus or additional money I got was split between my emergency fund and my student loan balance. I used a snowball strategy and targeted the highest interest rate loans first.

After a year and a half I was able to get my monthly student loan obligation down to a more manageable level (~$800 a month) and leased a car - I used a lot of the advice on PF and other tactics I had learned in negotiation class to negotiate a really good deal on a car lease (when I bought the car at the end of the lease in cash from my emergency fund/card fund, the market value of my car was $2.5k MORE than what I had negotiated the end of lease value to be).

In addition, in August 2014, I consolidated my remaining $50k in student loans and refinanced them with SoFi and got a 3.035% variable rate for a 10 year refi (discounted to 2.785% for automatic payments) which reduced my student payment loan to $475 a month. I still continued to pay over $1k a month and make balloon payments against the loan (it helped considerably that I had moved jobs and had gotten a 60% pay raise).

When I got married in May 2015, I still had approximately $30k in student loans remaining and I told my spouse that I wanted to pay them off completely myself since it was my debt. So for the past 7 months, we have lived primarily on my spouse's salary and have been using most of my monthly paycheck to pay off the balance. In October, I refinanced my remaining $15k of student loans again with SoFi to a 5-year variable with 2.15% interest (1.9% with the automatic payment set-up). I made the last payment yesterday and it feels amazing to have those loans gone!

I took a lot of advice from other Reddit posters and made sure to contribute as much as possible to my 401k, participate in the company's ESPP plan, have a six month emergency fund (which saved me when I got laid off as part of a reorg), and paid off my credit cards every month so I didn't have to worry about additional debt.

Since I have a lot of friends who are still struggling to finish paying off their loans from the same program, I didn't want to post on FB. But thank you for all of your advice on how to get out of debt.",finance,1452876804

personalfinance,145k in student loans. Am I using the right approach?,"Background: I graduated from a private university and dropped out of law school in my last semester. Not very wise, I know. What I'm left with is a mountain of debt. 145k = $16k fed loans @ 6.8%, $80k private loans @ 5%, 49k @ 2.3%

Today, I make 70k before taxes and am still trying to keep up with payments. I live in California and am lucky that my rent is only $400 per month. However, my minimum student loan payments are nearly $1300 per month. I try to pay extra towards my 6.8% loans as much as possible. My question is this - once I pay off the 6.8% loans, do you suggest I continue to throw as much money towards the 5% loans, or do I invest in retirement or something else?

Edit: Thank you, everyone, for your advice. My 80k private loans at 5% will shackle me for a bit, but throwing money at it seems to be the smartest thing to do. After that, I will look into my retirement savings.",finance,1452877136

My current balance is $165,304 and monthly payments are currently $1,586.

I make enough money with my base salary to pay living expenses and just barely cover the full monthly payment. My goal is to use my bi-annual and annual bonus to pay off a large chunk of the loans at a time.

I just received an annual bonus which will leave me with about $30K after taxes. My question is, should I use that to pay down one, or part of some of the loans below? Should I prioritize the private over federal loans? Should I just pay off whatever loan has the highest rate? Or should I hang onto some of it in case I am short on the monthly payment some months. Should I consolidate some of these? I have an emergency fund set up already of $10k and no cc debt. My bi-annual bonus is usually about $6k after taxes and I usually get that around August.

Basically my stepdad received a letter from

Department of The Treasury

Bureau of the Fiscal Service

P.O. BOX 830794

Birmingham, AL 35283-0794

The letter states that he has an unpaid delinquent debt owed to the Small Business Administration for over $200,000. 

He used to have debt with the IRS for a business that went bad and went through bankruptcy but had taken care of it through a compromise because of hard times etc. 

I'm not sure if it's legit because all of the paperwork from the IRS was originally addressed to both my stepdad and my mom and as far as I know he never took out a loan or did anything that did not have my mom's name on it. When the IRS sent mail they both received a copy but this time my mom didn't get anything. They assigned him a FedDebt Case Identification Number but there's no itemization for this. No year it's owed from, nothing.

I'd have him call but he doesn't speak English very well and is likely to give personal information to a scammer because he wouldn't recognize he's being scammed. The both of us also work during hours the offices would probably be open.

When I googled for information it seems to be legit but some people were saying it's a scam when others weren't.

When I looked up the address payments were supposed to be mailed to I get virtually no results.

personalfinance,Questions about paying off credit card debt and getting a car,"So background first:
I'm 23 with $6,600 in credit card debt at ~22% interest due poor choices in trying to maintain appearances and lifestyle through college that I was accustomed to when growing up, plus moving expenses in the last year. I recognize that I messed up and am trying to pay this down as quickly as possible.  

I started my career 7 months ago and have been making strides in paying off my debt (which was close to $9,000 this past summer) and have a credit score of about 690 (based on averages between free credit report tools through my bank, my credit card websites, and Mint.com)

I've been considering taking out a personal loan of $6,600 at a lower interest rate (seen offers for as low as 5-10% interest) than my current 22% interest rate to pay the remainder of the CC debt.  However, my current car is about to die (just shy of 200,000 miles!) and I need to replace it, likely in the next 1-3 months.  

I'm wondering if getting a loan to pay my credit card debt will ultimately hurt me when applying for an auto-loan, or will applying for an auto-loan hurt me in terms of getting a low rate on a personal loan.

Thanks in advance for any advice, and please feel free to correct my current plans if you think there is a better option for my current situation

personalfinance,Should I drop out? $50k in student loans to get a Supply Chain Management Degree?,"So I did 1 year of community college (free except cost of books). Then I decided to transfer to Rutgers NB Business school past fall (Fall 2015). This had always been my plan since senior year of high school when i realized that i couldn't go to my dream school. Plus I had and still have health problems caused by longterm Lyme disease which i'm currently in treatment for. 

Ok so i knew that i would have to take out loans. My parents are Jamaican immigrants who enforce the whole ""you need to go to college thing"", even though I was sick and barely truly thought about that i wanted to do. I wanted (and still do) to go into filmmaking. But i knew you didn't need to go to college to go into that field, and my parents wanted me to go to college. So I picked my second love which was business. Furthermore, I found out that the supply chain management major had good job prospects and good starting salary (around $50k). 

Problem, my parents make a lot of money BUT they suck at financial things. They did NOT save any money for me (besides like $4,000) and they are in hundreds of thousands of debt. For my current sophomore year I had to take out $16k in private loans (NJClass), and about $5k in federal loans. I'm at $22k in student loans if i complete this semester. We have like $6.5k in savings for next year and if i don't live on campus and i might only have to take out the cost of tuition in loans which would be $14k. Same i guess for next year. So that's $50k in student loans not including interest!!

I am not okay with this and i expressed my anger at them this past summer when i discovered that they barely saved any money for me and I would be in so much debt. I am considering withdrawing this semester so i don't rack up anymore debt because i am not comfortable taking out over $50k for a business degree.

Any suggestions? Rutgers gave me no financial aid, i get nothing from fasfa, and Rutgers scholarships for business school are usually only for incoming seniors (and the bus. school is huge, so no guarantee i would get it). If i don't go to school, what should I do to save money? I am a small female so please no suggestions to ""Join a trade and become a plumber"".

Bitcoin,The Mike Hearn Show: Season Finale (and Bitcoin Classic: Series Premiere),"**This post debunks Mike Hearn's conspiracy theories RE Blockstream in his farewell post and points out issues with the behavior of the Bitcoin Classic hard fork and sketchy tactics of its advocates**

I used to be torn on how to judge Mike Hearn. On the one hand he has done some good work with BitcoinJ,  Lighthouse etc. Certainly his choice of bloom filter has had a net negative effect on the privacy of SPV users, but all in all it works as advertised.* On the other hand, he has single handedly advocated for some of the most alarming behavior changes in the Bitcoin network (e.g. redlists, coinbase reallocation, BIP101 etc...) to date. Not to mention his advocacy in the past year has degraded from any semblance of professionalism into an adversarial us-vs-them propaganda train. I do not believe his long history with the Bitcoin community justifies this adversarial attitude. 

As a side note, this post should not be taken as unabated support for Bitcoin Core. Certainly the dev team is made of humans and like all humans mistakes can be made (e.g. March 2013 fork). Some have even engaged in arguably unprofessional behavior but I have not yet witnessed any explicitly malicious activity from their camp (q). If evidence to the contrary can be provided, please share it. Thankfully the development of Bitcoin Core happens more or less completely out in the open; anyone can audit and monitor the goings on. I personally check the repo at least once a day to see what work is being done. I believe that the regular committers are genuinely interested in the overall well being of the Bitcoin network and work towards the common goal of maintaining and improving Core and do their best to juggle the competing interests of the community that depends on them. That is not to say that they are The Only Ones; for the time being they have stepped up to the plate to do the heavy lifting. Until that changes in some way they have my support. 

The hard line that some of the developers have drawn in regards to the block size has caused a serious rift and this write up is a direct response to oft-repeated accusations made by Mike Hearn and his supporters about members of the core development team. I have no affiliations or connection with Blockstream, however I have met a handful of the core developers, both affiliated and unaffiliated with Blockstream. 

Mike opens his farewell address with his pedigree to prove his opinion's worth. He masterfully washes over the mountain of work put into improving Bitcoin Core over the years by the ""small blockians"" to paint the picture that Blockstream is stonewalling the development of Bitcoin. The folks who signed Greg's scalability road map have done some of the most important, unsung work in Bitcoin. Performance improvements, privacy enhancements, increased reliability, better sync times, mempool management, bandwidth reductions etc... all those things are thanks to the core devs and the research community (e.g. Christian Decker), many of which will lead to a smoother transition to larger blocks (e.g. libsecp256k1).(1) While ignoring previous work and harping on the block size exclusively, Mike accuses those same people who have spent countless hours working on the protocol of trying to turn Bitcoin into something useless because they remain conservative on a highly contentious issue that has tangible effects on network topology. 

The nature of this accusation is characteristic of Mike's attitude over the past year which marked a shift in the block size debate from a technical argument to a personal one (in tandem with DDoS and censorship in /r/Bitcoin and general toxicity from both sides). For example, Mike claimed that sidechains constitutes a conflict of interest, as Blockstream employees are ""strongly incentivized to ensure [bitcoin] works poorly and never improves"" despite thousands of commits to the contrary. Many of these commits are top down rewrites of low level Bitcoin functionality, not chump change by any means. I am not just ""counting commits"" here. Anyways, Blockstream's current client base consists of Bitcoin exchanges whose future hinges on the widespread adoption of Bitcoin. The more people that use Bitcoin the more demand there will be for sidechains to service the Bitcoin economy. Additionally, one could argue that if there was some sidechain that gained significant popularity (hundreds of thousands of users), larger blocks would be necessary to handle users depositing and withdrawing funds into/from the sidechain. Perhaps if they were miners and core devs at the same time then a conflict of interest on small blocks would be a more substantive accusation (create artificial scarcity to increase tx fees). The rational behind pricing out the Bitcoin ""base"" via capacity constraint to increase their business prospects as a sidechain consultancy is contrived and illogical. If you believe otherwise I implore you to share a detailed scenario in your reply so I can see if I am missing something.  

Okay, so back to it. Mike made the right move when Core would not change its position, he forked Core and gave the community XT. The choice was there, most miners took a pass. Clearly there was not consensus on Mike's proposed scaling road map or how big blocks should be rolled out. And even though XT was a failure (mainly because of massive untested capacity increases which were opposed by some of the larger pools whose support was required to activate the 75% fork), it has inspired a wave of implementation competition. It should be noted that the censorship and attacks by members of /r/Bitcoin is completely unacceptable, there is no excuse for such behavior. While theymos is entitled to run his subreddit as he sees fit, if he continues to alienate users there may be a point of mass exodus following some significant event in the community that he tries to censor. As for the DDoS attackers, they should be ashamed of themselves; it is recommended that alt. nodes mask their user agents. 

Although Mike has left the building, his alarmist mindset on the block size debate lives on through Bitcoin Classic, an implementation which is using a more subtle approach to inspire adoption, as jtoomim cozies up with miners to get their support while appealing to the masses with a call for an adherence to Satoshi's ""original vision for Bitcoin."" That said, it is not clear that he is competent enough to lead the charge on the maintenance/improvement of the Bitcoin protocol. That leaves most of the heavy lifting up to Gavin, as Jeff has historically done very little actual work for Core. We are thus in a potentially more precarious situation then when we were with XT, as some Chinese miners are apparently ""on board"" for a hard fork block size increase. Jtoomim has expressed a willingness to accept an exceptionally low (60 or 66%) consensus threshold to activate the hard fork if necessary. Why? Because of the lost ""opportunity cost"" of the threshold not being reached.(c) With variance my guess is that a lucky 55% could activate that 60% threshold. That's basically two Chinese miners. I don't mean to attack him personally, he is just willing to go down a path that requires the support of only two major Chinese mining pools to activate his hard fork. As a side effect of the latency issues of GFW, a block size increase might increase orphan rate outside of GFW, profiting the Chinese pools. With a 60% threshold there is no way for miners outside of China to block that hard fork. 

To compound the popularity of this implementation, the efforts of Mike, Gavin and Jeff have further blinded many within the community to the mountain of effort that core devs have put in. And it seems to be working, as they are beginning to successfully ostracize the core devs beyond the network of ""true big block-believers."" It appears that Chinese miners are getting tired of the debate (and with it Core) and may shift to another implementation over the issue.(d) Some are going around to mining pools and trying to undermine Core's position in the soft vs. hard fork debate. These private appeals to the miner community are a concern because there is no way to know if bad information is being passed on with the intent to disrupt Core's consensus based approach to development in favor of an alternative implementation controlled (i.e. benevolent dictator) by those appealing directly to miners. If the core team is reading this, you need to get out there and start pushing your agenda so the community has a better understanding of what you all do every day and how important the work is. Get some fancy videos up to show the effects of block size increase and work on reading materials that are easy for non technically minded folk to identify with and get behind.

The soft fork debate really highlights the disingenuity of some of these actors. Generally speaking, soft forks are easier on network participants who do not regularly keep up with the network's software updates or have forked the code for personal use and are unable to upgrade in time, while hard forks require timely software upgrades if the user hopes to maintain consensus after a hardfork. The merits of that argument come with heavy debate. However, more concerning is the fact that hard forks require central planning and arguably increase the power developers have over changes to the protocol.(2) In contrast, the 'signal of readiness' behavior of soft forks allows the network to update without any hardcoded flags and developer oversight. Issues with hard forks are further compounded by activation thresholds, as soft forks generally require 95% consensus while Bitcoin Classic only calls for 60-75% consensus, exposing network users to a greater risk of competing chains after the fork. Mike didn't want to give the Chinese any more power, but now the post XT fallout has pushed the Chinese miners right into the Bitcoin Classic drivers seat.

While a net split did happen briefly during the BIP66 soft fork, imagine that scenario amplified by miners who do not agree to hard fork changes while controlling 25-40% of the networks hashing power. Two actively mined chains with competing interests, the Doomsday Scenario. With a 5% miner hold out on a soft fork, the fork will constantly reorg and malicious transactions will rarely have more than one or two confirmations.(b) During a soft fork, nodes can protect themselves from double spends by waiting for extra confirmations when the node alerts the user that a ANYONECANSPEND transaction has been seen. Thus, soft forks give Bitcoin users more control over their software (they can choose to treat a softfork as a soft fork or a soft fork as a hardfork) which allows for greater flexibility on upgrade plans for those actively maintaining nodes and other network critical software. (2) Advocating for a low threshold hard forks is a step in the wrong direction if we are trying to limit the ""central planning"" of any particular implementation. However I do not believe that is the main concern of the Bitcoin Classic devs.

To switch gears a bit, Mike is ironically concerned China ""controls"" Bitcoin, but wanted to implement a block size increase that would only increase their relative control (via increased orphans). Until the p2p wire protocol is significantly improved (IBLT, etc...), there is very little room (if any at all) to raise the block size without significantly increasing orphan risk. This can be easily determined by looking at jtoomim's testnet network data that passed through normal p2p network, not the relay network.(3) In the mean time this will only get worse if no one picks up the slack on the relay network that Matt Corallo is no longer maintaining. (4)  

Centralization is bad regardless of the block size, but Mike tries to conflate the centralization issues with the Blockstream block size side show for dramatic effect. In retrospect, it would appear that the initial lack of cooperation on a block size increase actually staved off increases in orphan risk. Unfortunately, this centralization metric will likely increase with the cooperation of Chinese miners and Bitcoin Classic if major strides to reduce orphan rates are not made. 

Mike also manages to link to a post from the ProHashing guy RE forever-stuck transactions, which has been shown to generally be the result of poorly maintained/improperly implemented wallet software.(6) Ultimately Mike wants fees to be fixed despite the fact you can't enforce fixed fees in a system that is not centrally planned. Miners could decide to raise their minimum fees even when blocks are &gt;1mb, especially when blocks become too big to reliably propagate across the network without being orphaned. What is the marginal cost for a tx that increases orphan risk by some %? That is a question being explored with flexcaps. Even with larger blocks, if miners outside the GFW fear orphans they will not create the bigger blocks without a decent incentive; in other words, even with a larger block size you might still end up with variable fees. Regardless, it is generally understood that variable fees are not preferred from a UX standpoint, but developers of Bitcoin software do not have the luxury of enforcing specific fees beyond basic defaults hardcoded to prevent cheap DoS attacks. We must expose the user to just enough information so they can make an informed decision without being overwhelmed. Hard? Yes. Impossible. No. 

Shifting gears, Mike states that current development progress via segwit is an empty ploy, despite the fact that segwit comes with not only a marginal capacity increase, but it also plugs up major malleability vectors, allows pruning blocks for historical data and a bunch of other fun stuff. It's a huge win for unconfirmed transactions (which Mike should love). Even if segwit does require non-negligible changes to wallet software and Bitcoin Core (500 lines LoC), it allows us time to improve block relay (IBLT, weak blocks) so we can start raising the block size without fear of increased orphan rate. Certainly we can rush to increase the block size now and further exacerbate the China problem, or we can focus on the ""long play"" and limit negative externalities. 

And does segwit help the Lightning Network? Yes. Is that something that indicates a Blockstream conspiracy? No. Comically, the big blockians used to criticize Blockstream for advocating for LN when there was no one working on it, but now that it is actively being developed, the tune has changed and everything Blockstream does is a conspiracy to push for Bitcoin's future as a dystopic LN powered settlement network. Is LN ""the answer?"" Obviously not, most don't actually think that. How it actually works in practice is yet to be seen and there could be unforseen emergent characteristics that make it less useful for the average user than originally thought. But it's a tool that should be developed in unison with other scaling measures if only for its usefulness for instant txs and micropayments.

Regardless, the fundamental divide rests on ideological differences that we all know well. Mike is fine with the miner-only validation model for nodes and is willing to accept some miner centralization so long as he gets the necessary capacity increases to satisfy his personal expectations for the immediate future of Bitcoin. Greg and co believe that a distributed full node landscape helps maintain a balance of decentralization in the face of the miner centralization threat. For example, if you have 10 miners who are the only sources for blockchain data then you run the risk of undetectable censorship, prolific sybil attacks, and no mechanism for individuals to validate the network without trusting a third party. As an analogy, take the tor network: you use it with an expectation of privacy while understanding that the multi-hop nature of the routing will increase latency. Certainly you could improve latency by removing a hop or two, but with it you lose some privacy. Does tor's high latency make it useless? Maybe for watching Netflix, but not for submitting leaked documents to some newspaper. I believe this is the philosophy held by most of the core development team.
 
Mike does not believe that the Bitcoin network should cater to this philosophy and any activity which stunts the growth of on-chain transactions is a direct attack on the protocol. Ultimately however I believe Greg and co. also want Bitcoin to scale on-chain transactions as much as possible. They believe that in order for Bitcoin to increase its capacity while adhering to acceptable levels of decentralization, much work needs to be done. It's not a matter of if block size will be increased, but when. Mike has confused this adherence to strong principles of decentralization as disingenuous and a cover up for a dystopic future of Bitcoin where sidechains run wild with financial institutions paying $40 per transaction. Again, this does not make any sense to me. If banks are spending millions to co-op this network what advantage does a decentralized node landscape have to them?
  
There are a few roads that the community can take now: one where we delay a block size increase while improvements to the protocol are made (with the understanding that some users may have to wait a few blocks to have their transaction included, fees will be dependent on transaction volume, and transactions &lt;$1 may be temporarily cost ineffective) so that when we do increase the block size, orphan rate and node drop off are insignificant. Another is the immediate large block size increase which possibly leads to a future Bitcoin which looks nothing like it does today: low numbers of validating nodes, heavy trust in centralized network explorers and thus a more vulnerable network to government coercion/general attack. Certainly there are smaller steps for block size increases which might not be as immediately devastating, and perhaps that is the middle ground which needs to be trodden to appease those who are emotionally invested in a bigger block size. Combined with segwit however, max block sizes could reach unacceptable levels. There are other scenarios which might play out with competing chains etc..., but in that future Bitcoin has effectively failed. 

As any technology that requires maintenance and human interaction, Bitcoin will require politicking for decision making. Up until now that has occurred via the ""vote download"" for software which implements some change to the protocol. I believe this will continue to be the most robust of options available to us. Now that there is competition, the Bitcoin Core community can properly advocate for changes to the protocol that it sees fit without being accused of co-opting the development of Bitcoin. An ironic outcome to the situation at hand. If users want their Bitcoins to remain valuable, they must actively determine which developers are most competent and have their best interests at heart. So far the core dev community has years of substantial and successful contributions under its belt, while the alt implementations have a smattering of developers who have not yet publicly proven (besides perhaps Gavin--although his early mistakes with block size estimates is concerning) they have the skills and endurance necessary to maintain a full node implementation. Perhaps now it is time that we focus on the personalities who many want to trust Bitcoin's future. Let us see if they can improve the speed at which signatures are validated by 7x. Or if they can devise privacy preserving protocols like Confidential Transactions. Or can they figure out ways to improve traversal times across a merkle tree? Can they implement HD functionality into a wallet without any coin-crushing bugs? Can they successfully modularize their implementation without breaking everything? If so, let's welcome them with open arms.

But Mike is at R3 now, which seems like a better fit for him ideologically. He can govern the rules with relative impunity and there is not a huge community of open source developers, researchers and enthusiasts to disagree with. I will admit, his posts are very convincing at first blush, but ultimately they are nothing more than a one sided appeal to the those in the community who have unrealistic or incomplete understandings of the technical challenges faced by developers maintaining a consensus critical, validation-heavy, distributed system that operates within an adversarial environment. Mike always enjoyed attacking Blockstream, but when survey his past behavior it becomes clear that his motives were not always pure. Why else would you leave with such a nasty, public farewell? 

To all the XT'ers, btc'ers and so on, I only ask that you show some compassion when you critique the work of Bitcoin Core devs. We understand you have a competing vision for the scaling of Bitcoin over the next few years. They want Bitcoin to scale too, you just disagree on how and when it should be done. Vilifying and attacking the developers only further divides the community and scares away potential future talent who may want to further the Bitcoin cause. Unless you can replace the folks doing all this hard work on the protocol or can pay someone equally as competent, please think twice before you say something nasty. 
 
As for Mike, I wish you the best at R3 and hope that you can one day return to the Bitcoin community with a more open mind. It must hurt having your software out there being used by so many but your voice snuffed. Hopefully one day you can return when many of the hard problems are solved (e.g. reduced propagation delays, better access to cheap bandwidth) and the road to safe block size increases have been paved.

personalfinance,"General 401k consolidation questions, now that we've moved and started new jobs","Edit: Reddit formatting is hard.

My family has gone through a lot of recent change (cross country move, both got new jobs) and I'm wondering mostly about our savings and how we should be handling them. I attempted to follow the Retirement template from the sidebar, but I'm embarrassed to admit that I am not very knowledgeable about this stuff and I pulled most of the information from our Mint account overview. Please let me know if you require more detail and I can update this post with that.

Questions are at the end of the post.


**Background Information**

Emergency funds: Six months' worth
Debt: 

* Student loans: Interest rate 6%, this is almost completely paid off
* Car loan: Interest rate 3%, this has a chunk ($10k) left to pay off
* Mortgage (just bought a house Monday!!! Do you need any info about the down payment?): Interest rate 4.0%
* Note: we will be able to pay off the student and car loans once we close on our house, since we will have quite a bit of money left over from the sale of our previous property that we did not roll into the down payment. I'm assuming we SHOULD pay these off, right? 

Tax Filing Status: Married filing jointly with one dependent (one child)

Tax Rate: 33% Federal, 0% State

State of Residence: WA

Age: 31

Desired Asset allocation: No idea

Desired International allocation: No idea


**Current retirement assets**

* 0% cash 
* 5% Morgan Stanley AAA - Barrick Gold Corp (ABX)
* 3% Wells Fargo Brokerage, split evenly between Invesco Charter Fund CL A (CHTRX) and Federated Kauffman CL A (KAUAX)
 * 9% Neuberger Berman Mutual Fund - Guardian Fund Investor Class (NGUAX)


*Husband's current 401k*

* 0% - just started work at a new firm. I can't pull up the details, but Bright Scope rates it 86, if that helps?

* Company match? No


*His old 401k*

* 33% - I can't pull up the details, but Bright Scope also rates it 86...hm. He did stay in the same industry and is working at a relatively same sized firm.

**Available funds:** 
I don't have this information available yet, as I haven't started at my new job and I don't have my husband's information in front of me. My new employer does match at 5%.



**Questions:**

1. Should we roll any of our 401k accounts together? It seems crazy that we will now have 5 separate ones.

2. I'm considering consolidating the Neuberger and Morgan Stanley accounts. I don't actively manage them, and I couldn't even tell you who DOES. They don't seem to perform very well. I was going to put them into my Wells Fargo account, since there's this dude who manages the money for a bunch of my relatives and I have a feeling he would do a solid job. But maybe that's naive?

3. We need to start some sort of investment account for our daughter. We currently have a 529 plan for her, but haven't contributed to it ourselves - we just ask that our families do in lieu of gifts, since our kid is too young to really understand presents anyway.

4. Are we missing out on any obvious savings vehicles?",finance,1452891184
ethereum,Bitcoin Mini-Crisis And Flow To Ethereum May Be An Indication Of Ether's Viability As A Fuel Of A Functional Network,"[This is not a market trading idea or comment about speculation in ether]

In a period where we see projects like RootStock and sidechains and valid arguments as to Bitcoin's higher quality as a store of value, thus as a better GAS for a smart contracts network, I think that the latest arbitrage into ether with high volume may be indicating that ether is actually a very valid crypto-asset as well.

Note that ether and litecoin are trading similar volumes today (~$3.9 and ~$4.3 million respectively). In modern portfolio theory (the parts that are actually useful!) when an asset is a valid alternative (non-correlated) it is used by speculators and portfolio managers as a hedge and thus the asset becomes valuable with useful market applications: diversification and arbitrage.

If ether gains sustainable liquidity as a hedging and arbitrage crypto-asset, that in itself may enable it to be recognized as a high quality store of value IMHO.

Before this observation my opinion has always been that  RootStock and sidechains types of solutions potentially bring specific new risks e.g. the pegging mechanism, weird federations, etc. and that a single integrated network (consensus mechanism + blockchain + currency + mining + programmability + virtual machine + Turing complete language) like Ethereum should be more secure. If ether proves to be valid alternative to BTC (like in the past few days) I think that would a very good development.",cryptocurrency,1452893791

personalfinance,"Medical school grad, paying off loans vs IRA","Hello!

Just wanted some input into whether or not I'm doing the right thing. I'm single, in my late 20's in my first year of a 4-year residency program. Some details about my finances:

- Annual pre-tax income of roughly 52k, monthly gross of about $2,900
- I graduated with dual degrees with $42k in debt (17k at 6.8%, 25k at 6.1% federal student loans). 
- Currently 10-year standard repayment is about $480 a month
- My living expenses (rent, utilities, food, gas, etc) I'd conservatively estimate run me $1,800 - $2,000 a month. The rest of my income I've counted as discretionary. 
- I expect my income to increase to at least $250,000 - $300,000 once I graduate from residency/fellowship in 4-5 years. At that point I'd have the salary to pay off the remainder of my loans to cut down on interest. 

My financial advisor told me I should think about putting money towards a Roth IRA (my employer doesn't do matching) since my salary at this point is taxed at a low rate, once I'm an attending I will be in the 39.6% federal tax bracket. I don't think I can afford to put in $5,500 a year and make the minimum payments on my student loans. I've read that it makes sense to pay off loans with interest rates higher than 5% before investing, so as of now, I've been focusing on paying off my loans (I've thrown in extra on top of monthly payments when I get a chance), but should I start looking into making contributions to a Roth IRA? What happens when my income increases to the point where the Roth IRA wouldn't make sense for me anymore? Do I just not touch that money and open up a traditional IRA?

I made a dumb decision about 8 months ago and bought a used 2013 Toyota Corolla to replace my broken down 2005 Aveo. My payments are $228 a month at 3.5% interest in a 7 year loan. My mom is covering my insurance until I graduate from college, thankfully. 

College is of course my other debt. I've failed out three times because of anxiety issues and generally just being dumb about life.

I work in the oilfield and make a pretty good living and have always done a good job of living within my means, but that can change when you take a $35,000/ year pay cut. I went from a take home pay of about $5,000/ month to take home of around $3,300/ month. To top it off my wife and I are expecting a child in 7-8 months. We've already done the obvious things (dropped the unused gym memberships, cut out one of our Netflix accounts, negotiated with cable company) and I need some direction on what to do next.

I'll be getting around $12,000 back in income taxes. I have $47,000 left to pay on my house (Mortgage payment is $775/ Month 3.99%), $23,000 left on my car (Car note is $378 and we'll carry full coverage even if I pay it off 4.25%) and a few renovation items that still need to be taken care of (Kitchen and Bathroom floors ($5,500 ish), backsplash ($500), and fence ($7,000)).

I was hoping you guys have some uncommon ways of reducing expenses and to get an opinion on how we plan on spending our income tax windfall. My plan was to put $10k on the house and $2k into savings (we already have a $13k in savings). I know it's recommended to pay down the car first since it has a higher interest rate, but if push comes to shove I can sell the car and get into an older one, if I eliminate the mortgage I can drop the flood insurance (her grandmother sold it to us and it hasn't flooded in our area in over 80 years, I'm confident it won't backfire) which will save me another $250 a month of wasted money.

Several years ago I opened a line of credit with a 9.5% interest rate in order to consolidate some credit card debt my ex and I had accrued, ~14,000.  The balance is now down to ~$6,800 as I've been paying about $100 over the minimum payment each month while also building up my emergency fund.  I have $9K in my emergency fund, which covers at least 3 months of expenses and I'm now looking to aggressively pay off this line of credit.  I use my credit cards for all my expenses and pay the balance in full each month to get rewards, so I have not carried a balance in over a year and a half, so no worries about paying this off and building the credit card debt back up.

I paid $650 towards the line of credit this month and will be using my tax refund to pay off a big chunk as well, but I wanted to look at doing a balance transfer in order to reduce the interest I'm paying.  My job situation is fairly stable, so I should have no problem paying the balance off within 15 months.

-Too much debt to income ratio (I work in public health)
-past default on loan

Here is why I really need to consolidate at least one of my loans:
Unnamed loan company will not allow a co-signer release tied to my father and has no financial protections (deferment or forbearance). It also has a variable interest rate and absolutely horrible at resolving any issues (lie, untimely, must talk with supervisor).

Unnamed loan company has two loans:
Variable interest rate 3.5% (was 3.25%)
$15,530
$9,377

$22,279 all variable interest rates

Bitcoin,"The goal of [U.S.] banks seems clear: Put Bitcoin under one unified regulator, the Federal Reserve.","Firstly, consider The Praying Banker's (Charlie Cooper's) [statement here](https://youtu.be/R0iArSIU0Z8?t=12779):

&gt; The second thing the ***fractured*** regulatory environment does is because it takes longer to get to consensus, to the point made about protecting the dinosaurs, the startups will run out of runway; the companies that will remain standing 5 years from now are the big tech companies or the banks—you&amp;nbsp;know, whomever your villain is—who can *wait* until this has sorted itself out, and they have plenty of money, and then they decide what they want to do, and the real entrepreneurs, the people *now*—whether they're pro-bitcoin-the-currency or not is irrelevant for this conversation—those real entrepreneurs that are out there trying to make a go of it are going to suffer because they don't have enough money to make it 3 years.

 &gt; And, that's maybe just where we are—maybe a recognition.

&gt; But, there's a perception, I&amp;nbsp;think, outside of Washington that regulation itself harms industrial growth, entrepreneurship, etc. I'd make the counterargument: It's regulatory *uncertainty* that causes that harm; if we *knew* what the regs were, we could operate within them *today*, and build business models in that context today, but unfortunately because we don't know, and everyone is kind of looking at each other trying to figure it out... I&amp;nbsp;mean, this currency/commodity thing is fascinating; if I have it right—I could be wrong—I think the IRS has already called it a currency, and the CFTC might have called it a commodity... *All&amp;nbsp;right*... And, it's *property* in Japan—I didn't even know that! So, *wow*... *now* what do I do?

That seems like a legitimate concern.

However, I'll point you to the fact that he's highlighting the problems of a ""fractured"" regulatory situation (something that another guy jokingly calls a ""decentralized"" regulatory framework); indeed, one person laments that the U.S. cannot do what Great Britain does in providing one single regulatory agency to rule them all.

There seems to be a push to emphasize the virtues of centralized control; [this&amp;nbsp;guy](https://youtu.be/R0iArSIU0Z8?t=13269) (who is sitting next to The Praying Banker) suggests giving more control over the cryptocurrency industry to the Federal&amp;nbsp;Reserve:

&gt; Just to reiterate: We have a ***fractured*** regulatory system, but I do think that if the Federal government wanted to go in this direction, there are authorities under the Dodd&amp;ndash;Frank act that the FSOC (Financial Stability Oversight Council) could exercise to give the \[Federal Reserve\] enhanced authority over this area, and I think it's \[at least worth\] having the FSOC explore that *now*—not take a decision on it, necessarily, but have that integrated in the process, so that if they decide in a few *years* that the Fed is the right place to house an overview of this area and to develop new rules for it, that they could.

David Wessel, the moderator, at least sees through it:

&gt; I'm looking forward to the Industry going to the FSOC and saying ""*Please*, put us under the umbrella of the Fed—""

Then, some other guy jumps in and helps defend the position, speaking almost in lock-step with the last guy regarding various points, leading the moderator to refer to this outburst as a conspiracy against him.

It *is* a conspiracy, no doubt.

The Banks love the Fed, because it is from the Fed that they derive power; so, despite the truth behind Charlie's words regarding the harm of regulatory uncertainty, it looks like he and others are merely using that point to maneuver mind-share toward their goal of placing control under *one* regulatory agency: Their long-time friend and pal, the Federal Reserve.

You might say that the birth of bitcoin has changed the game for national finance / monetary policy at a fundamental level. Isn’t it kind of interesting that a currency that is not controlled by the government is able to stay in circulation?

Even the party oligarchs are now talking about governing the country under the rule of law. Under what law, exactly, would it be possible to ban bitcoin?

[*Response 3*]

Posted by **LaibitePool_Jiang_Zhuoer**

Because it’s legal in Beacon Country [*translator’s note: tounge-in-cheek slang for “the USA.” Here, the term “beacon” is sarcastically borrowed from a speech made by Bush Sr. who referred to the USA as a “beacon” for democracy in the early 90s*] and Europe. The party oligarchs won’t ban it because under the circumstances it would make them lose face.

Also, the experience of Hairy Bear Country [*translator’s note: humorous slang for “Russia.” Presumably originates from the fact that Russia is famous for polar bears.*] shows that a ban of bitcoin is completely ineffective:

Russia banned bitcoin trading in Feburary 2014 while the ruble was undergoing a period of severe inflation (Xinhua News: “Russia Joins the Ranks of Countries Banning Bitcoin”). However, it is obvious based on trading volume for LocalBitcoins.com (a local bitcoin matching and trading service) in Russia that the ban was for all intents and purposes completely meaningless.

[[Inline Image: LocalBitcoins Voulme Chart \(Russia\)](http://i.imgur.com/repHCyb.png)]

Therefore all things considered the party oligarchs have gone with a realtively smart strategy: nominal legality + de facto tight control, so bitcoin exists but only on a small scale. If bitcoin ever really started to take off they could at any time start strictly enforcing a “Five Ministries Notice” and directly cut bitcoin off from the financial system for a peridod of time. They would definitely be able to drag it out for a period of time and would only need to drag it out for the time the current administration is power.

You can refer to section 1.1 of https://www.zhihu.com/question/22076666/answer/69638270 to learn more about definitions of bitcoin under the law and understand how bitcoin is defined under the law in various countries.

Because:

\* Bitcoin is deflationary and is bad for economic development

\* There are too few bitcoins: only 21 million. They are nothing but a toy for geeks and cannot function as a serious currency

\* The price is super volatile. The price would have to be stable before it could become a currency

Therefore bitcoin is not a currency and has no chance of becoming a currency.

At most bitcoin is nothing more than a collectible item similar to stamps (according to Zhou Xiaochuan [*translator’s note: Zhou Xiaochuan is the Governor of the People’s Bank of China*])

Wouldn’t you all agree?

Nobody really gives a shit about bitcoin… in any case it’s just a small pipeline and some of the party oligarchs are able to use this small pipeline to move their wealth. If bitcoin were ever to seriously affect the interests of the party oligarchs then they could mount a 51% attack as easily as building a few kilometers of subway line. They’ve got the nukes and if they can set off one they can set off another one. Things like the project headed by Fang Binxing [translator’s note: Fang Binxing is the mastermind behind the Great Firewall of China] are what’s most important.

And that’s why the third big question we have to answer is how to keep America safe and strong **without** either isolating ourselves or **trying to nation-build everywhere there’s a problem.**

&gt;I told you earlier all the talk of America’s economic decline is **political hot air.** Well, **so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. It’s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined.** Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation dares to attack us or our allies because they know that’s the path to ruin. 


-Barack Obama

&gt;CLINTON: Obviously, in the first, we do have to have a -- an American-led air campaign, we have to have Arab and Kurdish troops on the ground. Secondly, **we've got to go after everything from North Africa to South Asia and beyond.**

-Hillary Clinton

#Clinton supports the same policies that led to the vacuums of power in the Middle East that led to the rise of ISIS and ENDLESS WAR. 

When Hillary Clinton says things like this and wants to focus on taking out Assad and creating a power vacuum in the middle east before taking out ISIS she sounds insane. These aren't liberal or progressive positions. When Clinton says these things she is disagreeing with nearly every democratic president before her. **Is it not clear that she is working for other interests?**

&gt;SANDERS: I have a difference of opinion with Secretary Clinton on this. Our differences are fairly deep on this issue. We disagreed on the war in Iraq. We both listened to the information from Bush and Cheney. I voted against the war.

&gt;But I think -- and I say this with due respect -**that I worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be.**

&gt;**Yes, we could get rid of Assad tomorrow, but that would create another political vacuum that would benefit ISIS. So I think, yeah, regime change is easy, getting rid of dictators is easy. But before you do that, you've got to think about what happens the day after.**

&gt;**But I think in Syria the primary focus now must be on destroying ISIS**

**Hillary Clinton also has no comprehensive tax plan and has no way to make her proposals fit into the budget anymore than Sanders does. Clinton's plan is to expand EVERYTHING and make cuts no where.** Sanders at least is realistic about his plans. We can eliminate medicare/medicaid/ss and replace them with universal healthcare and cut Military spending by 50% and still have the strongest military.

https://static.nationalpriorities.org/images/charts/2015-charts/total-desk.svg
 
Clintons ""tax plan"" consists of a few tax rates and proposals to ""close tax loop holes"" but she doesn't state which ones. She doesn't state how her tax plan will directly pay for her health plan or expansion of the military or any of her other proposals. **Hillary Clinton has no math that shows how her plan will fit into the budget.** Literally all she has is a few tax percentages. That's not a plan.

Now let's break down her ""college plan"" which is not a real plan either:

https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/08/10/college-compact-costs/

Where does it say how she'll pay for it? It's all non-speak. It's not a real plan because it's lacking details. Am I expected to go through every page on her site and add up every number?

&gt;Clinton's New College Compact plan costs in the range of $350 billion over 10 years and will be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes and expenditures for the most fortunate. 

What loopholes? What expenditures? There is no REAL information here, and this is exactly how Sanders wants to pay for his plan.  

&gt;We need to make ambitious investments so that cost is no longer a barrier to college education, and the burden of debt does not hold back everyday Americans.

This is meaningless drivel. Is she seriously talking about betting tax money on more ""investments""?

&gt;More than half of the total will go towards grants to states and colleges. 

Half of what??? Her ""investment"" This is scary! Her college plan is based on betting money.

&gt;These grants will ensure that students do not need to take out loans for tuition and that support will also help reduce the burden of living expenses at 4-year public colleges. 

How? she doesn't know what the number will be.

&gt;They will provide free tuition at community colleges, support private non-profit colleges that keep costs low and provide value, and relieve debt for students who commit to national service. 

Again: how? She's not really explaining where the money came from or how much it will be because she doesn't know.

&gt;These new grants will be paired with holding states and colleges accountable for bringing down costs.

Ah, so she will place some of the burden on the states and colleges themselves, another unpredictable variable in Clintons wild ride.

&gt;Around one-third of the funds will go toward relief on interest from student debt.

A third of what???!! This entirely depends on her ""investments"" paying off. Load of shit.

&gt;This includes allowing every American with outstanding public debt to refinance their student loans at today's low interest rates, cutting interest rates to reflect the government’s cost of debt,

Exactly what Sanders wants to do.

&gt;and making it far easier for students to enroll in income-based repayment that limits crushing debt.

Still don't know how, but okay...

&gt;The remaining funds will support innovative new investments to create a higher education system for the 21st Century. That means new funds to expand new models of life-long learning, rewarding college completion and enrollment, and broadening support for student parents.

This is my first post in /r/personalfinance and wanted to get some investing input. I am still currently living at home (yay!) but have managed to save up 30k since September as my freelance career has started to take off beyond expectations. My main expenses are healthcare coverage ($243 per month) and food/groceries (~$300). I have no credit card debt, car payments, or academic related debt (I went to a community college all four years).

I am extremely interested in investing and ways to grow my money overtime but do not know much in regards to that. My father told me to invest into CDs, once every month over the course of the year, so that I consistently get returns every month after the allocated time. The only thing that bothers me is the extremely low interest rates I've seen with my bank and would think the money being readily liquidated would make it far more valuable. I do plan on moving out with my buddy this summer (I'm not in any rush though) but can't see rent being more than $700. I live in Michigan if that helps provide further insight (I do really want to move out of state eventually).

As of right now, it is pretty difficult to project my yearly income, as I'm a contract worker just starting out a few months ago and monthly pay fluctuates. After a year in the field, I should get a better understanding. Monthly pay fluctuates anywhere from $2,000 (my lowest) to $15,000 (my highest). 

My main goal is to invest and save as much money as possible. Since I am a freelance worker, I have to provide myself with my only healthcare coverage and retirement. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!!",finance,1452960736
personalfinance,"Refinancing Student Loans, and the millions of questions associated with it.","Hi PF,

While I was reading PF, the current top thread mentioned refinancing student loans through SoFi.  I'd never heard of it before (not refinancing, but SoFi.  I consolidated my federal loans once several years ago when my income was much lower), so I tried it out.  

My current situation is this; I owe 23k at 8.5% through Wells Fargo, then 46k at 6.3% 6k at 6.8% and 4k at 2% all through Navient.  My income is now ~120k and my credit score is ~730.  I have been pretty aggressively paying off ~3k a month.

With this information, SoFi was willing to finance all of the 70k loans at 4.1% with a fixed interest or 2.1% at variable interest.

I have a slew of questions for anyone that's willing to help.

1)  Is there any downside to refinancing like this?  I understand that I'll lose government assistance stuff like deferments and IBR, but I don't think I'll need them.

2)  Is there an origination fee?  I didn't see one listed anywhere, and I'm always skeptical of free money.

3)  Would it be worthwhile to shop around and see if I can get a better rate through a different company?  Does anyone have any recommendations?

4)  I have the jist of an understanding of variable rate versus fixed rate.  Market performance affects the rate, essentially.  I've never used a variable rate before.  SoFi maxes out at 8.5% variable, but at that point I'm not saving anything and I'm actually worse.  Do you think I should I go for the fixed 4.1% or try the variable 2.1%

5)  Another goal is that if I get my interest down to ~4%, I wouldn't feel so bad about long-term savings.  Currently I invest the bare minimum into the 401k to get company matching, but at 6.8 and 8.5% it makes more sense to pay off the loans then to invest more.  If I got it to ~4.1% should I split my extra income among a retirement plan *and* a student loan?  At a minimum, I at least would feel better filling up an IRA if I had my loans below 5%.

personalfinance,How I graduated college loan free and I hope these personal experiences will help future college students,"College loans are a never ending topic here at PF and I just want to say that kudos to those who seek helps in dealing with these situations. For me, it's all about preventive action and I hope through my experience somehow will get the same result - graduate college debt free.


Start out in high school - it was 2006 when i graduated high school and got accepted into UCI (yup just UCI :( ) and few other Cal states. I was indecisive with my major and through the college workshop provided at school, i knew exactly how much it would cost me to attend these universities. At the same time, my parents whom worked minimum wages worked a ton of overtime in the past few years are getting ready to buy a house. After applying FAFSA, i did not qualified for any aid. So i decided to go with community colleges near my house and transfer after two years. I worked part times and grind it out.

Fast forward to 2 years, i was no where near transferring and STILL DON'T KNOW what i want to major in; however, although i'm not qualify for grants, i was qualified for California fee waiver in which I don't have to pay for any credits. only books and other materials.   I met my girlfriend which she is now my fiancee. We talked and somehow I was motivated to finish CC and transfer. It took me another 2 years to finally get all the credits to transfer. within that 2 years, I continued to work part time and I saved at least 4k getting ready for universities for engineering degree.

At the University:
I transferred to CSULB while all my friends went to Cal Poly Pomona and get to experienced dorming or sharing a SFR house. At this point you may know that i'm still staying with my parents paying $200 dollars a month everything included and this right here saved me a lot of money. yes I missed out all the partying and the private life with mom nagging at me for going out too late, or over little thing but i'm telling you. if you can suck it up everything will be worth it. The tuition for classes alone is approximately 7k annually at my first year and gradually increased up to 9k I believed. So with the money I saved I put it all in tuition and book and started with 12 units. I continued to work part time (20 hours /week; 10$/ hr), still have the same girlfriend with monthly anniversary dinner (yes we do it every month and we still do it now) and live with my parents.

During my stay at CSU, i met a bunch of friends and soon learn that in the engineering field, you don't have to buy books. there a PDF version available online for download or if you are nice enough, your friends whom are one or two semester ahead of you will let you borrow it. I also learned one thing, there is a flat tuition price after you registered a certain units in the semester. For example: if you take 12 units. it will cost you 3.5k/ semester, but if you take 15 units, it will be 4k, but any other units after that such as 21 units, will still be 4k that semester. 

Knowing that, i took advantaged of this and come my second semester, i took 18 units have all the books for classes without paying a single bucks. The next two semesters, I continued to take  21 units and 19 units respectively and had to pay for a few books here or there. but by doing that. I saved approximately 6-8k in tuition annually by cutting my time there shorter. 

Let me tell you this, it was not easy it was never easy and till this day I still don't know how I balanced everything out but I was pretty much at school M-Thurs from 7am - 10pm and then work on the weekend. All the part time money that I worked? went straight to tuition, I""m pretty much didn't have the college life that you see on the movie, but at this point i knew i was on the right track. At one point, i lost my job and that was my single source of income. my family and SO helped me out but i don't want to be their burden, so I was forced to take out a 5k subsidize loan. Soon, I got creative and start out a tutoring business at the library which I learned while I was studying at my local library. at first it was 1 kid for $10/hr. soon, I was managing 4 kids at the same time and we do this 2 hours a day, 3 days a week. 

I did this for a while but soon come the fafsa application for the last semester  (i took a total of 5 semesters, 2 years and a half and graduate in the fall instead of spring) of my college because i was working in cash, i actually qualified for grants for my last semester. With the grants, my last semester was free however, i was stuck in a 5k debt i took out last year for tuition. Taking experiences from my friends whom graduated one-two semester ahead of me, I started to apply for internship. I do this almost everyday and sent out roughly 10 applications a day. I am encouraging you to do this since starting out is always hard but it will get even harder once you graduated college without any skills in your field. 

I finally got an internship  with a big aerospace company right next to my engineering building. I sent out 100+ of application, so don't give up if you get rejected. LB affiliated with many aerospace companies and we do have a huge secret laboratory lab full of cool stuffs. It was my first internship and i learned a ton there, the skills that i acquired here in 1 day is worth all my time spent going through colleges. I was getting paid $16/ hour and working 30 hours a week while taking 19 units worth of classes. noted i'm still in my second to last semester. At that same time, my gf also got transfer to Fullerton major in accounting (after she dropped out of nursing school; yes she is super smart but it was not meant for her), we get smarter with budgeting our money...all of this before i learned bout PF on reddit. we decided to suck it up and continue to stay with our parents and use that money and save it to pay of my 5k debt when i graduated. 

Graduated: So that time came and i graduated, the loan is interest free for 6 months so instead of waiting for 6 months, the first that i did was making installments. there were actually two loan, 1 sub and one 1sub total of 5k with the interest rate averaging 4% for each loan. I paid off the interest loan first and did installments on the other.

back to my job, i got offer a full time position at the lab...but not here in California but in Seattle (by now you should know what company i was interning for), the dum me back then didn't want to leave my gf and my family so i declined their offers...but don't do this, never ever do it, i actually regret it because i love working with plane and yea i regret it everyday :(. that was my dream job, doing something i love, with great prospect and free tuitions. if i can turn back time i would, but hey we are human right?

so i'm gonna stop here because that is how i graduated debt free. it wasn't easy at all, taking a ton of classes while going to work, managing a girlfriend while living with your parents? yes i was pretty much gave up everything that a sub 24 years old guys would do, but I did it and to be honest, it is the best feeling in the world when you have no debt and your career is bright ahead of you. if you want to know what happened after i declined my very first engineer job i would love to update it but i'm gonna stick to the topic for now. 

This is my first time posting and I know there are probably a lot of errors on grammar as well missing a few things or there. So kindly forgive me. I hope this help after seeing so many posts struggling with loans. i'm no where near perfect and I was lucky to have a family that let me leech off of them and a gf that was very patience with me and understand me. 

TLDR: graduated high school, got accepted to UC but went to community colleges and did the transferring method to save money. Worked my ass off, studied my ass off, live with my parents until i'm 25. Graduated with no loan.",finance,1452968763

&gt;I'm being provocative. Maybe not by October, but certainly by the end of the year. If the Fed raises rates there are going to be systemic bankruptcies in the energy sector and other key industries. Corporate balance sheets will invert as they eat through their cash to stay alive. That means no more stock buy-backs, no more dividends to keep investors happy. This will lead to a market panic and a crash as liquidity finally drains out of the system.

&gt;Practically speaking, if the Fed goes ahead and raises rates in September, there will be plenty of signs by October pointing to a meltdown. In all likelihood, the Fed will respond by chickening out and lowering rates again, possibly introducing another round of QE. But if they stick with the increase in rates, yes there will be a global financial meltdown.

&gt;Only way to avoid this is to keep rates low and ride this out until 2016, where we will hopefully see some economic growth. But with oil at $38 a barrel, plus the manufacturing numbers coming out of China, I just don't see that happening.

&gt;The thing is I might be wrong about the timing of these events, but the fundamentals are obvious. You know what QE + low interest does to markets, right? It leads to moral hazards. It's like if I were to approach you and your group of friends and say, ""Hey, here's a lot of money at 0% interest rate. Go ahead and invest it. Oh, and here's $1,000,000 to get you started.

Bitcoin,"Mike Hearn's Boss (on Bitcoin) - ""I don't even know who to call!""","Relevant Footage, from the ""The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings"":
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNToS1xR8C4

What Charles Cooper (R3) has done here is strike the bedrock of what constitutes a decentralized protocol with the shovel of a stupid question (i.e. ""who do i call?"").  

Who does anyone call when they have an ""internet problem""?  

Answer: Typically third party services that *use* that protocol, and provide value add (like BitPay, etc.).  

It's irrational to conclude that a protocol is not useful (does not have utility) simply because it is not organized as a hierarchical institution with a call center.  It is, instead, placing the utility in the commons, where businesses and entrepreneurs can add value and provide risk mitigation.  This is similar to how your employer may use an email provider, instead of building and supporting it's own (though it likely could).  And, in exchange for that, it gets the benefits of leveraging the protocol while minimizing certain risks.

When one debates like this (as Charles Cooper has), he or she immediately exposes their ignorance.  It isn't that his other opinions on the topic can be immediately dismissed, but their due attention is certainly to the left of the mean.",cryptocurrency,1452984932
politics,Why I support Bernie Sanders and oppose Hillary Clinton,"**Here are the reasons that I support Bernie:**

Bernie wants to overhaul our corrupt political system.  Representatives and Senators are bought by corporate donors. Bernie wants to repeal the *Citizens United* Supreme Court decision that allows unlimited donations into campaign-supporting Super PACs and move instead into public funding of campaigns so that anyone can run for office.

Bernie wants to regulate corrupt corporations.  Corporations often pay no taxes either by qualifying for tax breaks for ""good behavior"" or by moving their profits overseas to tax havens, move jobs overseas to low paying countries and lobby Congress while paying into campaign-supporting Super PACs as a result of *Citizens United*. Bernie wants to close the corporate tax loopholes, raise corporate taxes and compel corporations to bring jobs back to the country by repealing free trade agreements that currently allow corporations to send jobs overseas.

Bernie wants to regulate our corrupt banking system.  Banks can gamble with money in risky investments and still come back to the Federal Reserve to bail them out. Bernie wants to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act which keeps banks from performing both commercial and investment services and break up the ""too big to fail"" banking institutions that grew so large that they required bailout in order to save the economy.

Bernie wants to regulate a corrupt Wall Street.  Powerful brokers gamble with the stock market by making thousands of micro-transactions an hour that increase speculative risk. Bernie wants to put a tax on these micro-transactions to put towards free public college education.

Bernie wants to regulate our corrupt law enforcement and judicial system.  People are being put in jail for marijuana possession and police are disproportionately targeting non-white people, especially black people. Bernie wants to make the police accountable for unjustifiable asset seizure, brutality and homicide, de-schedule marijuana from the federal illegal narcotics list and abolish the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment.

Bernie wants to improve the quality of life for struggling poor and low-income Americans.  The middle class is shrinking as a result of diminishing wages, expensive healthcare and education, too little family time and too little savings for retirement. Bernie wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, expand Medicare to all citizens, make public college tuition free, give three months paid maternal and paternal leave and lift the cap on Social Security so that wealthier people pay more into it than they currently do. The increased wages will also help the economy grow when more people have disposable income.

Bernie wants to give opportunities to struggling poor and low-income Americans.  The middle class needs work and this country needs an infrastructure overhaul. Bernie wants to add infrastructure rebuilding programs to fix up our roads, bridges, public transit and water systems, creating millions of jobs in the process for the middle class and getting this country back in good shape.

Bernie has been a passionate spokesman for the poor and middle class [since he was a mayor](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/10/bernie-sanders-mayor/407413/), to the point that [his mayoral exploits are still written about today](https://www.thenation.com/article/bernies-burlington-city-sustainable-future/) and since he began his [tenure in Congress.](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/inside-the-horror-show-that-is-congress-20050825)  Bernie [shouts himself hoarse advocating for the needs of the poor and middle class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxRCnwqUrc8), and I love him like my own grandfather for his dedication to the issues that matter in this country.

**Why I oppose Hillary Clinton:**

Hillary says that war should be the last resort, but voted for the second Iraq War and as Secretary of State pushed for NATO to bomb Libya, then gloated about the killing of an old, powerless former dictator. Now she supports a no-fly zone over Syria which could lead to a standoff with Russia.

Hillary says she'll take on the big banks but supported a bill that would reduce Chapter 7 protections for poor people with credit card debt and receives millions in speaking fees and donations from JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley employees yet acts like she doesn't owe them favors.

Hillary used to support single-payer healthcare as FLOTUS, even supporting Bernie in his fight for the same. However, Hillary now opposes it, using disingenuous attacks against Bernie to cast down his single-payer plan.  These attacks also suspiciously coincide with Hillary's receipt of donations from the health insurance industry, which has a lot to lose from single-payer healthcare.

Hillary says she wants to overturn *Citizens United*, but she herself has a Super PAC.

Hillary says she supports net neutrality but she's received million dollar donations into that Super PAC from pro-SOPA Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg.

Hillary supports an encryption ""back door"" to allow government access to our mobile devices in order to catch terrorists and she wants tech companies to cooperate with her to grant access to our mobile devices.

Hillary has campaign staffers that have previously been paid through the very suspicious Clinton Foundation, which receives massive donations from foreign countries with atrocious human rights records.

Hillary says that she supports gay rights but bluntly told Chris Matthews ""no"" when asked about gay marriage rights, supported DOMA and categorized marriage as ""a sacred bond between a man and a woman"" before the Senate.  Hillary is now making gay rights a large part of her campaign, but is clearly lying for votes.

Hillary says she's going to enact criminal justice reform to keep kids out of jail but she opposes marijuana reform, supports the death penalty and supported a tough anti-crime bill by saying that it would target young criminals who were remorseless ""super predators"".

Hillary plays dirty on the campaign trail.  In addition to her attacks on Obama in 2008, she is now attacking Bernie by calling him a [sexist](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/10/hillary_clinton_is_smearing_bernie_sanders_as_a_sexist_it_s_an_insult_to.html), a [racist](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/hillary_clinton_keeps_smearing_bernie_sanders_as_a_sexist_now_she_is_reaching.html) and an [advocate for the gun lobby](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/01/11/hillary-clinton-is-smacking-around-bernie-sanders-on-guns-heres-why/) and [claimed that he will repeal Obamacare without replacing it with superior single-payer Medicare for all](http://www.salon.com/2016/01/14/hillary_clintons_absurd_bernie_smear_why_attacking_him_from_the_right_on_healthcare_makes_literally_no_sense_at_all/).

I don't trust Hillary and I never will.  I think she might have been a worthy candidate, before she changed to take money from very wealthy interests while pretending to support the poor and middle class.  I think Hillary's efforts to present herself otherwise are beginning to fail.  I think she is lashing out in ways that make her seem increasingly spiteful and desperate.  I think Hillary's gender is becoming less relevant to informed feminist voters, and I think gay and non-white voters are beginning to see through the political history of the Clinton family for its harmful effects on gay and non-white Americans.

In my estimation, the only candidate running who can put us past the mistakes of the neo-liberal Clinton administration and the disastrous neo-con Bush administration is Bernie Sanders.

investing,Value of College,"Analysis of college and fore worth of academia: Intrinsic valuation of degree and education of college
Statements have to be made for the intrinsic value of a college education, since schooling in America, which will be focused on in this writing, almost chants the importance of the option, as if the option comes with no delay of thinking, currency, and wellbeing of the student’s future. This era of thinking is moronic and biased to the fullest regard. For, continuing much light will be focused on the quantitative data of average figures and calculation of valuation of degree: (a) Arts (b) Business (c) Law (d) Social Services (e) S.T.E.M.
We must first understand that intrinsic value is close to its real and tangible value, saying this means numbers may vary not to slight from its end result of cost in education. In wordy long and intensive form, would include the education’s total and all value forth the student. It would include and we exclude relationships, intelligence to a degree, race, gender etc. The only true important concept is the invasive feeling of debt and owes towards the issuer of such college. For proper intellect of investing in a college education is set by its debt, its earning power, its leveraged debt, and finally, its intrinsic value which may sum up both in a handful. For the following calculation these numbers occur:
·         Inflation on current US on goings=0.5%

·         Debt accumulated by per capita basis

·         Par value of end of education cost set with year multiplier=$31,231

·         Interest paid only by holder of education=5.84%

·         Tax’s remaining on vary of fields so in general on averaged per value of current year of January 1,2016 through and end to January 1,2017 equals on mean figure=31.5%

·         Leveraged aid and retirement plan of 401k and other accounts=14%

·         Years equal on mean figure of pay off payment=10 to 25 years

·         Base Salary of earning power is going to be sought out on first salary discounted on all percent and added back as a multiple of years lived in career.

These numbers give intense care and net of the value of education, by Benjamin Graham’s terms this intense care of value shouldn’t go into an analysis of securities for it bares stress on the investor but it will nevertheless show its even closer safety and soundness of investment on education and college degree.  The numbers above are here to supply what I’ll call “armor” on the young student before purchasing of education and to protect their principal from the expense of continuing payment of debt.
General calculation of intrinsic value of education from only numbers and logical approach would be first to find the students field, and career pass college and take the first year earning and discounted on all percent excluding leveraged aid and debt of buyer, for example we would say the average first year earnings of business degree based on average of $56,000 discounted by added up inflation and tax on 31.5%=32% giving the value of $17,920 times average work life of 65 giving us $1,164,800, this earning figure is the rough amount or what we’ll call the ware on “amour” amount. Then we must take the cost of education and time paid off, discounted by same rates by including leveraged aid and retirement plan of 14% accumulated to 46% taking cost of tuition of $31,231 discounted by 46% gives us $14,366 and x4 rounds out $57,464. Now we take the interest rate and discounted again to its earning figure of $1,164,800 equaling to $680,243 now divide by 65 equal to par of $10,465 and compare tuitions to all earning figure. Earning figure $10,465 to the price of average $57,464 overall expense paid on x4, give us the truth on the value of earning to expense and protection (which failed) of principal. Seeing the differences of both numbers would be a term used by Benjamin Graham as the margin of safety, equaling $-46999, and the positive number if used still is less than first year and continuing year of earnings. The truth is the too much emphasis on college and field should be thought with logical approach, for the students family and his or hers wellbeing, but this differs also for people who understand capital allocation, and for that earning figure far passes any education, so with that why to pay $30-50k on any case unless factor of earnings and amortization is taken for thought?

Please contact us at support@bitstamp.net
We suspect that the ban is related to legislation pending in the Duma of the Russian Federation. For more background, see: http://www.coindesk.com/bill-bitcoin-ban-russian-legislature/
The proposed legislation would broadly ban the domestic use of BTC, and appears to criminalize use of an international exchange such as Bitstamp.

Best regards,

I am a bit surprised Bitstamp (with its Slovenia/UK jurisdiction) is so concerned about Russian laws, but it’s up to them, they may be paranoid. OK.
But even so, their arguments are not valid. If Bitstamp is lost here I will try to clarify some things for them:

* Bitcoin is NOT banned/prohibited is Russia.
* Access to Bitstamp's website is NOT prohibited by Russian Roskomnadzor (Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications), check here http://blocklist.rkn.gov.ru/ 
* New Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offenses is being discussed now. There is a draft which is far from being finalized and accepted. The implementation of the new Code is planned for 2017.
* The Code draft contains new articles about “money surrogates”. Bitcoin is not mentioned there and by many interpretations it is an exempt from “money surrogates” because currency legally regulated in EU or UK is not considered as “money surrogate” (this article in Russian explains this in more details http://bitcoininfo.ru/news/novyy-proekt-koap-mozhet-legalizovat-bitkoin-v-rossii)

There is absolutely no reason to ban Russian customers from accessing the site. WTF Bitstamp?

I left it alone until this year, when I saw a bit of global financial instability and put a stop-loss order in, which activated about a month ago. 

I made a decent amount of money on it, more than enough to cover what remains of my student loans, $15,000. I have an emergency fund and about $20k in retirement.

The complicating bits: I've moved to the UK and I'm planning to stay here a while. I bought a house a month ago (not in London) and we are doing okay--not quite hitting the amount that would require me to still pay tax in the USA. Seriously, I'm small potatoes.

worldpolitics,Global stocks plunge amid fears of a new financial crisis,"Barry Grey
16 January 2016

Stock markets in the US and around the world ended the week with massive selloffs, rocked by fears that the slowdown in China and plunging oil and commodity prices will trigger a new financial crisis on the order of the 2007-2008 disaster.

Another sharp fall on Chinese markets, with the Shanghai Composite Index dropping 3.55 percent, followed by a 6 percent fall in oil prices to $29 a barrel, set off a wave of panic selling. The mood was summed up by the chief strategist at Federated Investors, who said, “Investors are scared to death, and the fact that it’s happening at the beginning of the year has some historical significance.”

A major factor in the Chinese selloff was concern that Beijing will report its weakest full-year growth figure in 25 years on Tuesday.

On Friday, Walmart announced that it will close 269 stores, 154 of them in the US, and eliminate 16,000 jobs. The Walmart statement, coming on the heels of multi-store closure announcements by Macy’s and Sears-Kmart, highlighted the worsening slowdown in the real economy globally and in the US that underlies the turbulence on stock and bond markets. It also reflected the reality of falling wages and mounting income insecurity affecting broad layers of the US population.

Also this week, BP announced 4,000 layoffs, pointing to the increasingly depressed state of the energy sector.

Friday’s selloff, with the EURO STOXX/50 index down 2.37 percent and all of the major US indexes lower by well over 2 percent, caps off the worst-ever yearly opening for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which lost 391 points on Friday to crash through the 16,000-point level, has fallen by 8.24 percent so far this year. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index has fallen by more than 8 percent and the Nasdaq has lost more than 10 percent.

All three US indexes are officially in correction, having lost more than 10 percent from their recent highs. The Chinese stock indexes are officially in bear market territory, having shed more than 20 percent of their value. In just the first two weeks of the new year, global stock markets have lost $5.7 trillion in value.

The price of oil, a barometer of global economic activity, is down 20 percent so far this year. The first two weeks of 2016 have seen the steepest two-week decline for oil since the 2008 financial crisis.

Going into a three-day weekend, with the markets closed Monday for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, there will be intensive behind-the-scenes discussions between Treasury and Federal Reserve officials and the major Wall Street banks and hedge funds over the spiraling crisis. The White House on Friday took the unusual step of commenting on market movements in an attempt to reassure investors. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said officials were closely watching market movements and their potential impact on the economy.

Since the financial crash of 2008, the world capitalist economy has been propped up by rapid growth in China and a number of emerging market countries and a huge run-up in stock prices, all of which has been engineered on the basis of an immense growth of debt. The Federal Reserve and the central banks of Europe and Asia have pumped trillions of dollars into the financial markets, fueling a further increase in financial parasitism and speculation. This, combined with ruthless austerity against the working class, has formed the basis for an unprecedented enrichment of the world’s rich and super-rich and a further transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top.

But in the US and the other older industrialized countries, there has been a sharp decline in business investment in the productive forces. Instead, the vast profits of banks and corporations have gone largely to parasitic activities such as stock buybacks, dividend increases and mergers and acquisitions.

Earlier this week, Albert Edwards, a strategist at Societe Generale, told an investment conference in London that global economic developments would “push the US back into recession.” Predicting that there will be a new financial crisis “every bit as bad as 2008-2009,” he noted, “We have seen massive credit expansion in the US. This is not for real economic activity; it is borrowing to finance share buybacks.”

Now, with China slowing rapidly, Brazil and Russia in deep recessions, and the other emerging market economies sinking under the impact of falling commodity prices and rising debt, the inherently unstable financial house of cards is beginning to collapse.

A measure of the growth of speculation is the fact that since 2009, the US junk bond market has increased by some 80 percent, to $1.3 trillion. The market for energy junk bonds has increased even faster, up 180 percent to more than $200 billion. In recent weeks, as oil and other commodities have continued to fall and China has continued to slow, the junk bond market has shown signs of imploding, with prices dropping sharply and a number of energy junk bond mutual funds collapsing.

Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, the world’s biggest private investment fund, told the US cable channel CNBC Friday that the market crisis was likely to worsen. “I actually believe there’s not enough blood in the streets,” he said, adding that “you’re going to start seeing more layoffs in the middle part of the first quarter, definitely the second quarter…”

A battery of economic data released Friday indicated that the US economy is sharply decelerating. The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production fell 0.4 percent in December, primarily as a result of cutbacks in utilities and mining output, after declining 0.9 percent in November. Industrial production fell at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Last week, the Institute for Supply Management released its manufacturing index, showing a decline to 48.2 in December, the lowest reading since December 2009. Any number below 50 signals a contraction.

The New York Fed this week released its Empire State Manufacturing Survey index, showing a decline to minus 19.37 in January from minus 6.21 in December. “Business activity declined for New York manufacturing firms more sharply than at any time since the 2007-2009 recession, according to the January 2016 survey,” the New York Fed said.

These reports confirm the existence of an industrial recession in the US. And this week, Michael Ward, chief executive of the CSX railway, said in a television interview that the country was in the grips of a “freight recession,” with coal and other commodity shipments falling precipitously.

The Commerce Department reported on Friday that US retail sales fell 0.1 percent in December from the previous month. For all of 2015, retail sales rose just 2.1 percent, the weakest reading since 2009, after advancing 3.9 percent in 2014. The National Retail Federation separately estimated that holiday sales rose just 3 percent from the previous year, far below its projection of 3.7 percent growth.

The Commerce Department also reported that business inventories fell 0.2 percent in November, the biggest drop since September 2011.

The Labor Department released its Producer Price Index, showing a decline of 0.2 percent last month. Pointing to deflationary forces in the US economy, producer prices fell 1.0 percent in 2015, the weakest figure since the series began in 2010.

As a result of the weak data on the US economy, JPMorgan Chase cut its fourth quarter 2015 estimate for growth of the gross domestic product from a 1.0 percent annual rate to a mere 0.1 percent pace. Barclays trimmed its forecast by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 0.3 percent rate.

The sharp intensification of the economic crisis will further inflame geopolitical tensions and the drive of the US and other imperialist powers to war. At the same time, it will stoke internal social tensions that are already driving the working class into struggle in the US and internationally against austerity and social inequality.

The emergence of a major economic crisis takes place against the backdrop of a critical presidential election in the US, which has already revealed the growing alienation of the working population from the entire political system and the further lurch of the two big-business parties to the right.

My plan was to keep my checking, credit card, and savings account was BoA, but move nearly all in my savings account to a higher interest rate savings account. I was going to open an account at Ally, but noticed Radius Bank on nerdwallet with a higher interest savings account 1.10%. I was curious if there is anyone in r/personalfinance that has banked with them before.

Concerns for me:

 * Is it easy to transfer in funds from BoA or another bank into the Radius savings account? Moving out into another bank?

* How is their customer service and online support? 

* How well does their app perform compared to Ally, BoA, and other banks that have good reviews on their apps? 

* Have you had any major issues with them? 

* Are there any unfortunate surprises that you might not have been aware of when initially joining (hidden bank fees, issues with transfers, meeting a target amount of deposits/transactions a month, etc.)?

investing,ECB and Raising Interest Rates (Europe),"After the FED's move in December, some people call for the ECB to follow soon. However, it appears to me that the US and the EU are in very different situations. While the US' economy is growing, several EU member states are still (or again) struggling. In addition, the EU has severe political problems that introduce further uncertainty and likely pressure on the joint currency.

For these reasons, I don't expect the ECB to raise rate in the next 3-5 years. Much to the contrary, I expect even lower interest (more QE) in an attempt to soften the current economic and political turbulences.

So, are the calls for the ECB to raise rates more ""wishful thinking"" than reality, or am I missing something here?",finance,1453045992

I may have the opportunity to pay a large lump sum of it in the coming week (getting another windfall, but I *am* managing it and it's expected taxes).

I know the interest rate is like 6.5% on this debt.  It's also not reported on my credit report, so it hasn't dinged me there.  I'm not in danger of missing any payments (it's automatically debited from my bank account).  I also have the option of using this large sum for a different investment, such as a down payment on a home.  I don't think; however, there's any investment that would beat the 6.5% interest rate on this debt.

personalfinance,"FAQ: Why is my refund so small? (Or, taxes withheld versus actual tax burden...again)","Refund questions pop up like mushrooms on rotten logs this time of year, most of them asking why their refund is so small, why adding their second job resulted in a smaller refund, or why they owe more tax than one thought they would owe.

**Please take a moment to understand the basics of tax withholding.**

Throughout the year, your employer withholds a certain amount from your paychecks for federal and state (if applicable) taxes.  The amount withheld is typically calculated automatically according to IRS tables that you can find in Publication 15.  After you get all your tax forms and put it into whatever software suite you're using to file, the software compares your calculated tax burden with how much your employer(s) withheld throughout the year.

##Tax burden minus withholdings equals refund *or* tax owed

Even if you only had one employer, it is possible that you withheld more or less in proportion to your actual tax burden for a variety of reasons (bonuses, overtime, etc).  Same for multiple employers - different withholdings affect how large your refund is or how much you owe.

**In conclusion**

You are not necessarily doing anything wrong if you get a lower refund than you are expecting.  If you have multiple jobs and inputting the second job decreases your refund, that likely means your second job didn't withhold enough.  The IRS is not cheating you if you get a smaller refund.

Finally, remember that tax refunds are not a good thing.  By having thousands of dollars returned to you after you file your taxes that really just means you've held it in the magical 0% savings account at the U.S. Treasury when it could have been working for you instead.  You can adjust how much you have withheld throughout the year by using the [IRS Withholding Calculator](http://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/) and submitting new W-4s as appropriate.  Note that purposely underwithholding may result in the [underwithholding penalty](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306.html), so that's not a good idea either.",finance,1453052179

personalfinance,Opening My First Roth IRA Questions,"Hello personal finance.  I’ve been learning a lot from reading everyone’s helpful advice, so I’m hoping y’all can help me now.

I decided last year to be more actively involved in my retirement.  I am a U.S. federal employee, and I plan to max my TSP this year ($18K).  I have the contributions split between the max $5,500 to Roth TSP and the remaining $12,500 to my Traditional TSP.

I currently do not have another retirement account outside of work.  I am thinking of opening a Roth IRA and using 2015 funds (to maximize how much I can contribute this year until 15 April).  I’m leaning towards a Vanguard Target Date retirement account.  With that in mind, I was thinking of donating the maximum of $5,500 for 2015 and 2016 that way I can immediately be eligible for the “Admiral” program/shares that offer a much lower expense ratio.  I’m not crazy about the idea of putting that money in (although I have enough in savings to cover this and still have a solid emergency fund), but I think it may be worth it to get the low expense ratio.

I currently make $91K a year (and that number could go up depending on some part time work I do as well…shouldn’t be more than $5,400 this year).  I recently paid off my car, so I have no outstanding debt.

My main questions are:

1.	Are there any tax implications for opening a Roth IRA this year but with 2015 funds?
2.	What Vanguard accounts do you recommend?  If not Vanguard, then what company?

personalfinance,(UK) What to do with a small amount of savings?,"For the past year, I have been living 30+ miles from my university to keep my job and cheap rent (£30 a week inc all bills!) and have saved a few thousand pounds in the process. At the minute I'm getting pretty fed up of commuting so far and having no spare time, so am considering moving back into the city and paying 3x the amount on rent using some of these savings. In the beginning, everyone thought I was insane for doing this just to save money, but now i've suggested that I may move back, people also think i'm being silly... While I don't necessarily care about people's opinion on the matter, it is definitely making me second guess my choice on apparently wasting all that money for the sake of living closer to my university (I would also have to find a new job but can't see that being a problem).

So, my questions... Is there any point continuing to try to save for the next few months for the sake of around £7000 and invest in something? If so, what could I invest such a small amount of money into?

personalfinance,(?) I'm living at home and taking a 6-8 month break from college to pay off money I owe my university. What do you think of my plan?,"I'm a 21-year-old college student in San Francisco who is taking the next 6-12 months off from school, living at home, and working full-time to pay off $9,000 in unpaid tuition that I owe my university. 

In short, I was burned out last semester due to personal issues and decided to take a leave of absence from school--i.e. a sabbatical of sorts. What I didn't carefully consider at the time was that I would end up owing my school more than my original balance for the term. I originally owed my school ~$5,000 but I now owe a total of $9,000 because of financial aid I'm responsible for paying back too. In retrospect, I screwed myself over twice with this shortsighted decision but now I'm dealing with consequences head-on.

Here's my plan: I'm currently living in Southern California rent free for the next 6-8 months to work full-time to payoff the debt I owe my school. I'm currently looking for a job, or jobs, and have had a bunch of interviews thus far so I'm hopeful I'll be working within a week. Every position I've applied for pays at least $15 an hour so I should be able to pay it off within the aforementioned time frame and possibly even save a little in the process if I'm extremely frugal.

Here's where I'm a bit uncertain. I'm a junior at an expensive private university that costs ~$40,000, but because of financial aid end up paying between $7,000-$9,000 per year out of pocket. On top of that, I end up taking out roughly $10,000 per year in federal student loans (no private loans or co-signed loans). Thus far, I have $26,000 in student loan debt and I anticipate ending up with about $40,000 by the time I graduate with my BA if I continue going to my current school. I have three or four semesters left to graduate depending on how things work out.

One of the reasons I decided to take a break from school was to carefully consider transferring to a public university that costs ~$7,000 per year instead. This would likely require me to take an extra semester to graduate, meaning 4 instead of three semesters. The upshot is that I would likely take out far less, if anymore, student loans by transferring.

Career wise, I'm a freelance journalist majoring in International Studies with a minor in Middle Eastern Studies. I have quite a bit of professional experience--i.e. internships and freelance experience--already. My goal is to cover conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa. I know that realistically I will only earn $20,000-$40,000 annually, if that. I have no illusions that I'll be ""suffering"" for a while given what I want to do with my life.

I'm not certain which option I'll choose since my main concern right now is paying off the $9,000 I currently owe my school so I have the option of going back to school. 

Given all this, what do you all think makes the most sense, transfer to a cheaper school or stay the course at my current college?

The question mark is for 2016, I've tried the IRS online calculator to estimate our tax burden and it recommends withholding an additional $6k+.  Which would mean both selecting married on our tax filings with zero allowances and withholding a combined $500+ from our pay checks each month.

They just don't get Bitcoin is supposed to emulate Tor, not Paypal. The Paypal part is done through a layer, so if it layer (LN) f*cks up someday, we still have the super decentralized core where 1 person can still be 1 node, so Blythe Masters and their friends can't coerce it and bribe the datacenter-running nodes into doing whatever it's on their agendas. 

**We are going towards a cashless society, and their nightmare is that a decentralized alternative to move money exists. The further we go from the 1 person = 1 node scheme, the nearer they are from reaching their goal.**

This is something casuals tend not to understand, for some reason. I guess they can't cope with the fact Bitcoin can't scale globally without an additional layer (LN), so they think ""well f*ck it, I want my coffee in the blockchain without fees, I don't care about the consequences, it's all FUD!!""

Anyway, as we know, SegWit would be enough to keep progressing without the necessity of the absurd risk of raising the block size which requires a hardfork (inb4 Erik Voorhees lecturing us into how it's better to hard fork even if it's riskier because ""SegWit is too complex"" -this is exactly how a bro-coder looks like), until we have LN and sidechains deployed, which is what they absolutely FEAR the most, since when this happens, it's pretty much game over for them, that's why they are pulling desperate moves such as the Mike Hearn's ragequit on one of the biggest newspapers in the world (not before he and his friends sold their coins), then right on time, they offer Classic as a savior, it's XTrojan horse all over again, but more subtle.

Here's my question: There's not even code released for Classic yet, but it's clear they are going to copy-paste Core and raise the block size while claiming they are better. 
As we also know, the raw talent is all on Core's dev team, as demonstrated by 7+ years and endless BIPs. 
How are they going to keep copy-pasting further updates if Core devs give up at some point? We would have a bunch of amateurs trying to run Bitcoin by themselves, since I assume most Core devs would give up on the idea of an increasingly node-centralized Bitcoin which is the ultimate goal of those that are trying to derail Core's roadmap. There would be no more Peter Wuilles and Greg Maxwells doing miracles to keep nodes decentralized while increasing privacy. It would be as if Litecoin didn't had Bitcoin to copy-paste from.

Let's just hope the disaster doesn't happen but if it happens, I wonder how the Core dev team will deal with. I just can't imagine how frustrating it is to spend so much time on this, to get some idiots copy-pasting your stuff and changing a node-centralizing variable and then call it a better software, then keep developing Core as they routinely copy-paste every update you release on their agenda-driven fork.

My question: Which state should I declare as my domicile for tax purposes? Do I have a choice in the matter?

My understanding is that in the military, there is a home of record and there is a state of legal residency. My HoR will be Ohio because that is where I am commissioning in.

But in the case of my domicile and SLR for tax purposes, I am at lost. Because I am only away for school and I still hold a california driver license, does that mean california is still my domicile? On the other hand, can I change my california license to an Ohio and thereby declaring Ohio as my domicile (I have a lease and pay utilities under my name too)? 


However, if I do have a choice in the matter, I am not sure which whether or not California/Ohio have state income tax for Active Duty members. I found some sources, but I am not well-versed in all the lingo and I hope someone can help me interpret

From the wording, I am confused what ""become nonresident of California for income tax purposes"".

 My best interpretation is that I won't be paying California's state income tax while I am on active duty. Is that correct?


Ohio: http://www.tax.ohio.gov/ohio_individual/individual/military_tax_provisions.aspx

personalfinance,(UK) Interest free overdraft is about to start being charged. Please can i have advice for a financially immature young man...,"Hi. In 2008 i went to University and i had a student account with NatWest. This account had a £1500 interest free overdraft facility. I finished this course in Summer 2011. I worked for a few months before i was fired. and eventually fell into a deep depression and didn't spend, or even earn anything (or even go outside, but thats a different story)...

In September 2013 i finally managed to gather enough sense and went back to university to study a masters degree. All finances were either spent using the little money i had saved or borrowed from family. Towards the end i opened a HSBC student account. This account also had a £1000 interest free overdraft. After graduating i needed money for travel to interviews etc. So i extended my overdraft facility with NatWest to £2000.

Now this account with NatWest is set to convert to a Select account (i think its called). I am working nowadays, but the money i do earn takes my NatWest account to just about above £0. But by the end of the month i will always end up in an overdraft of more than -£1000 at least.

My NatWest account is set to switch very soon. I thought i could save a lot the last two months and perhaps find another source of income, but alas i will still be in a big overdraft - with interest fees of 20% a month i think on the NatWest one.

Does anyone have any advice please? This is very depressing and stressful for me. I have tried applying for a Zopa loan, but unfortunately i was rejected. I am also in the process of arranging a debt management service, but this may impact my credit score later.

I have a few questions also: Is interest only charged on the account balance at the end of the month? Since i am paid my salary near the end of the month, my account will never be in overdraft at the end of the month. But it will be for a lot of the month in between. Same question for overdraft fees.

Anybody know of any sources for loans (at flexible rates) i can take to help me with these payments. And then i pay the loan off later when my finances are settled?

**TLDR: So to sum up here quickly, i have this NatWest overdraft of at least -£1300, a HSBC overdraft at -£800 and also i still owe my masters university more than £2000 otherwise i cannot get my graduation certificate. My NatWest account is currently interest free but will start charging in the very near future. Advice very much needed.**

Sorry I have another question - if i am quoted a monthly nominal interest rate of 1.52%, a nominal annual 18.28% interest rate, and a EAR of 19.89% - what interest rate am i actually charged and how often please?",finance,1453075265

personalfinance,28 year old married man with questions about claims on credit.,"When I was in college, I had nobody advise me on the use (or dangers) of student loans. I knew what they were, and that I had to pay them back, but I was young, dumb, and money hungry. I didn't borrow a lot of money (5k in all) but I also never paid it back in ample time. (The worse part is that I had a full ride scholarship. No loan needed, but hey! free money, right?)

Fast forward to real job time. Part of my loan stipulation was that I didn't have to start paying on them until 6 months after I stopped attending school. Again, I didn't. I know... I'm an idiot. But there was other fun things going on that seemed more appealing. 

Fast forward a bit further, and one of the two loans has defaulted. They start garnishing my tax return. This is terrifying for me, so I contacted the company holding the un-defaulted loan and filled out a forbearance (correct me if i'm wrong here) and they explained that this was taking the amount that I am behind, and tacking it on to the end. So, I can essentially start fresh on paying, I started making payments, my credit score jumped like 80 points. Awesome, right?!

Then, as I've gotten loads more responsible, married, thinking about the future, and wanting a solid financial life, I start going back through everything, and realized that I'm getting between $800 and $1500 back per year Federal, and that should have more than covered my $5k loans plus interest. Why do I still owe $3k and where did my tax returns go?
Is there a organization or a professional who can find everything on my credit that is dragging it down, as well as find out where all of my returns have gone?

During the housing bubble build up the banks were giving out so many new cards that I have quite a few. 

Eventually my credit got good enough that I could get an Amex.  I carried some debt on my others cards (visa &amp; mastercards) and paid it off after college.  I think it was about $10k.  

Since then I have just used the same amex blue account because why not. The other cards have just sat there. I do try to use them once a year at the least. I suppose last year in 2015 I forgot and two of my oldest cards were closed without notice by Citi. 

I have a decent fico score (820 I think) and want to keep it. I know to keep it I need to have long held accounts and a fairly good credit utilization ration.  Closing accounts hurts both of these.


Does anybody have any tips, advice or tricks in keeping accounts open?

To answer why I don't use the visa or mastercard cards.  Well Amex for me is just better due to their customer service. Lose my wallet. Amex will fedex me a new card overnight.  Chase has no issue letting me wait 2 weeks while it comes via the post office.",finance,1453088742
personalfinance,Cc debt for mom hopefully simple question,"My dad passed away this week unexpectedly. He handled all finances, my mom has no idea what is going on. I'm trying to help but I also have no real experience handling money.

Here is her current situation:

About $40k in CC debt spread across three cards at 17% APR

$50k in the bank, I assume this was my dad's emergency fund

$300k in a Roth IRA, not currently invested in anything!

$50k in a 400k for her current job

She will continue her current job ($100k annual salary) for only 5 more months, until July 1st. She's almost 59.5 and would qualify for the following income:

$600/week unemployment for July-Dec 2016

$1000/month pension at 65 years old

$2200/month from SS if she withdraws at 65.5

She is extremely frugal with money (I just found out that my dad took heavy losses in 2008 in the market which is the main reason why she can't just retire comfortably). I'm confident that she can maintain her monthly expenses to less than $2000 per month.

I have a few questions:

1. How bad of a situation is she in? I have a PhD in Engineering from a top 5 US school and could easily get a job bringing in &gt;$120k. But I am taking serious personal risks by trying to get a start up company off the ground. Should I consider a shift to a more stable income to make sure she's ok?

2. Should we just zap the CC debt right now? I can't understand why my dad kept this debt with such high interest rates when we have the cash to pay it off tomorrow if we want.

3. Any advice on how to safely invest the $350k in retirement she has now? She is very wary about any investments because they lost so much money in the stock market. But it seems really stupid to me to not have any of her Roth IRA or 401k growing.

&gt;Dear prudgin,
Bitstamp has been informed that the Russian government is prohibiting access to Bitstamp's website for all of our Russian customers. We deeply regret this inconvenience, and will attempt to resolve this situation as soon as possible.
All Bitstamp accounts remain safe and secure.
We have not been officially notified of the reason for this action, which we view as unjustified. We are not aware of any misuse of our services involving any Russian customer. Bitstamp poses no threat to the security of Russia or its economy. Bitstamp is a recognized leader in operating a safe, fully compliant exchange. We are attempting to contact officials in Russia to determine why they have taken this unfortunate action.
We invite Bitstamp customers - and especially our Russian customers - to let us know if you learn anything more about this action, or have specific questions. We do not know much, but we will let you know what we lea rn, as we learn it.
Please contact us at support@bitstamp.net
We suspect that the ban is related to legislation pending in the Duma of the Russian Federation. For more background, see: http://www.coindesk.com/bill-bitcoin-ban-russian-legislature/
The proposed legislation would broadly ban the domestic use of BTC, and appears to criminalize use of an international exchange such as Bitstamp.
To ensure compliance with the new regulatory regime, protect affiliate service providers, and most importantly - protect our valued customers in Russia - Bitstamp has decided to temporarily block access to its website from Russian IP addresses until we can assess the situation with more clarity.
Again, we regret this inconvenience, but we do not want to expose anyone to possible fines or criminal sanctions by the Russian state.
Best regards, 
Bitstamp team



The thing is that the Russian government is NOT prohibiting access to Bitstamp's website for anybody. bitstamp.net is not in the list of sites being blocked, you can search here http://eais.rkn.gov.ru/en/

Right now Bitstamp is blocking access all by itself for all Russian customers, though it is not blocked by Russian government and there is no law prohibiting use of bitcoin in Russia. There are news that some prohibiting laws are coming, but for now using bitcoin in Russia is NOT prohibited.

Instead of warning customers and letting them flee safely with their funds from the exchange Bitstamp has blocked all customers funds by its own initiative.

crypto,Would a government HSM in every ISP provide a secure backdoor?,"A US government mandated encryption backdoor would be prohibitively expensive, fragile, and nearly impractical.

The closest practical solution might be using a HSM to supply a public key to be used for escrow (here called a ""warrant escrow"", credit to grc.com for this concept). This warrant escrow would produce a redundant header which carries the session key only decryptable by the warrant HSM.

There is a problem: no party can verify the presence of a correct warrant escrow header without also having the ability to violate the message's confidentiality (provable?). This means that the warrant HSM must be federated throughout the network infrastructure and auditing all of our traffic.

Practically speaking, such a wide distribution of HSM devices means that a singular key pair would be eventually compromised. Multiple key pairs would lead to a drastic increase in complexity and a fragile web of trust (compare to modern problems with certificate authorities).

personalfinance,How do you handle getting paid weekly?,"Hello, first I'd like to say thanks for all the information you guys put out there. I read a bunch of random topics that while I hope I never have to go through personally I'm more knowledgeable about due to this subreddit.

Recently I've been trying to set up my budget. I've been working for 7 months now and am looking to move out on my own. I have been reading Rammit Sethi's book, ""I will Teach you to be Rich."" Overall I think the book is amazing. It's helped me get my head around the whole budgeting concept. 

In the book Rammit covers several ways to make budgeting automatic with several pay periods. The only way he doesn't really cover is weekly pay. I currently get paid weekly and am having a hard time figuring out how to save for bills from each pay check, instead of paying a bill completely from one pay check.

So, lets say my phone bill is 80 dollars a month, how do you guys cope with being paid a different amount of times each month?

Also I was wondering if someone had an excel spreed sheet that calculated take home pay, I know there are online calculators but I currently work 39 hours a week and none of the ones I found allow you to change the time worked.

Another tough one I have problems with is my car insurance bill. I pay 3 months and am off for a couple.

Edit:
UPDATE: My solution

The below section is meant for people who come across this topic later on. I wanted to share what I decided to do.

I decided to go with the ""4 pay check per month"" method. In summary most months have 4 weekly pay checks. So if you calculate your monthly budget in terms of this 4 pay check months you end up with months with five pay checks (this year march is the first one). What this means is that on the 5th paycheck I'll have a windfall since all my bills were already saved from the first 4 paychecks of the month. This gives me the decision to put that money where I want it. I'll probably add it to my IRA, snowball my student loans and/or add it to a savings goal (i.e. big purchase or vacation).

In order to figure out all the above what I did was I went back to my last pay check in 2015. Calculated what Federal and State tax percentage was for each category under the taxes section of my paycheck (some were fixed so I just manually put those in). Then I did the same for my pre-tax deductions I coded in my 401(k) and then added in the fixed cost of my healthcare. Did the same for some employee benefits. Then I calculated what an average pay check was and made a spread sheet that took away all withholding and found, year total pay (avg pay *52), Monthly avg (avg year/12), 4 Pay Check Month (avg pay* 4), 5 Pay Check Month (avg pay * 5).

The reason I put it all in a spread sheet is because its fluid. I don't have to enter any numbers. If my pay changes, my deductibles and everything changes. If I increase my 401k contribution all I have to do is change a number. The one thing I have to pay attention to is if my tax percentage changes.

Below is the spread sheet I made. Of course I live in NJ so your tax section will be different if you're in another state.

First time poster here. Figured I'd give you guys a shot to get some advice.

I recently graduated in May and had multiple Wells Fargo Student Loans out for about $42k. The interest rates were crazy high, so in November, I went through SoFi Consolidation and got a great interest rate.

At the time, I was paying off the Wells Fargo loans, so the amount I got through SoFi was more than the total of the Wells Fargo loans. SoFi sent the check to WF and paid off all the student loans, even receiving a letter stating I did. The leftover amount should've been returned and applied to the SoFi overall balance. 

I called WF asking where the money was on November 17th. They replied with it can take 45 days for it to be applied, with SoFi saying the exact same.

Here I am. Still missing about $3k that I'm paying interest on. I called Wells Fargo asking to see if the check has been cashed which they will have to get back to me. Not even sure what type of advice you can give me, but anything helps.

It is a decentralised digital money which does not need central bankers to control the money supply or dictate interest rates.

Recent infighting and divisions in the community have distracted away from the sheer genius and magnificence of bitcoin as a concept which can change the world. It is the first truly global currency given value by it's users - not the barrel of a gun or the necessity of a tax form. A genuine effort to separate money and state by turning money an internet layer. I think we are forgetting that.

If the resurgence of alt-clients such as Unlimited, Classic and XT (not forgetting BTCD) have shown us anything it is that bitcoin can adapt to survive any crisis of confidence. 

Right now we have a crisis of governance. Those who have worked hard to further bitcoin development feel they know better than the economic majority actually using bitcoin as a currency and store of value. Things are bound to get messy as the existing power structures and empires built around the status quo are forced to adapt to the needs of the userbase.

My income is off by approximately 15k, with ~2k of that being taken out for taxes already. They want me to file the 15k as tips when I do my taxes. Since I already paid 2k in taxes, they will cut me a weekly check of $133/week so that I have the 2k when April 15th rolls around. Their math doesn't add up exactly on that, but I'll bring that up to them. 

This will turn into a headache for me though, I think, because what about SS and medicare taxes, etc? I don't have the pay stubs for the last part of the year. I can figure out my gross income and net income per pay period, and see exactly how much I did pay in taxes, but that won't break it down into ss/medicare/federal.  

Is this legal for them to do? Is there anything I can do to just have them amend my return? I don't like making a big deal about most things, and I know the reason is that they're tight on money, but that doesn't mean that I should have to put up with this.

financialindependence,First FI milestone achieved: Net Worth &gt; $0,"I want to share a huge achievement - after more than 10 years in debt, I've hit positive net worth! 

My FI journey started 13 months ago when I stumbled across [this inspiring article](http://nomoreharvarddebt.com/2012/03/29/mission-accomplished/) about paying off $90k in student loan debt in less than a year. I started reading MMM and found this community soon after. 

Before getting aware of the possibility of financial independence, I disliked paying interest, so I bounced all of my debt around between zero interest rate credit cards - however I spent way too much money and paid little more than the minimums. I really thought I was shrewd for avoiding interest. However, even with a rigorous budget for the last few years, I couldn't stop myself from overspending.

I tried to ignore the feeling of carrying the weight of debt, yet every time I made a purchase outside my budget, I felt guilty and knew that I should be paying the debt off first.

The inspiration I got from this community, from MMM, and from that initial article is what I needed to make the change - I modeled my debt pay-down in a spreadsheet, then set my goal to be 100% out of debt by Nov 2016, 23 months from when I started. I cut my spending and started pouring $2k/month toward debt.

When I started, in Nov 2014:

    Net Worth: -$40,146

Now, 13 months later:

    Assets: $21,741.30
    Liabilities: $-20,537.58
    Net Worth: $1,203.72

In a little over a year, I've increased my net worth by $41,350. This is a combination of tax-advantaged savings, larger emergency fund, and paid off debt.

My goal this year: save $35k, which includes paying off my remaining $18k in debt. (Auto loan, student loans, and a little bit of 0% credit card debt. Debt number doesn't perfectly match my liabilities because I have credit card balances I pay each month.) This represents a 32% savings rate on my estimated gross income, 52% on my net income.

Here's a Mint chart of my [net worth over time](http://i.imgur.com/ksDBXrp.png). (Edit: black line is net worth)

Thanks everyone for the encouragement you've given through your own posts.

Edit: Math fixed.

For context: Earned $85k in 2015, got a raise and a side gig that's going to net possibly $20k, so I'm estimating around $109k in 2016.",finance,1453141391
personalfinance,"[US] Recent College Grad, Employed 6 Months In 2015. Massive Student Loan Debt, What Tax Credits Are Available To Me?","Hey PF!

I graduated from college this past May.  In the Spring semester, I was taking classes part-time (9 credits, whereas 12 credits is the threshold for being a ""full-time"" student at my alma mater) from home.  I paid my way through college with strictly federal loans, (Pell) grants, and scholarships.  I received a full-time position with an annual salary of $58,000 shortly after graduation and started working on June 29.  Exactly 6 months of work, so my wages in 2015 were $29,000.

I should add that I am currently opted out of a 401(k) or Roth IRA with my employer because they do not do employer matching, and I assume having that extra money on hand will do better in the long run by saving me on interest on my loans than the amount it'd gain in interest.

My student loans' grace periods ended in November, and my first payment was in December.  My total student loan debt is currently a sliver above $60,500, and my monthly payments are $700 exactly (which is a bit extra than the real amount due; I plan to overpay by a bit every month to get rid of this ASAP).

I just made my second payment (for 2016, so it's irrelevant here), but I saw a notification from my loan provider about an interest tax deduction.  It was the 1098e Tax Form.  I got just about $680 of the $700 payment I made listed on this form (can't believe that only paid off $20 of principal!).  I understand that this reduces my effective earnings (AGI?) by $680.  However, I don't know exactly what this means.  Does this solely work to scale back the amount of taxes I'm supposed to pay?  Say, if this is a 20% tax bracket, does this reduce what I theoretically owe by 20% * $680 = $136?  Or does this money work towards an income tax refund?

According to my last 2015 paystub, I have over $4,100 in federal income tax and a bit over $900 in state income tax taken out.  I would like to know of any any all tax credits/refunds I can reap from this year's earnings.  I really want to tackle my huge student loan debt, and if I could get all of the income tax I paid this past year back, that would put a very sizable dent in what I owe!  Or, maybe there are credits and such that would add on top of what I would get back.  I have no idea.

Are there any implications for my 2016 tax filings if I make a large lumpsum payment on the order of $5,000 *on top* of making my monthly payments?

I want to get as much back as I possibly can in the hopes of demolishing my debt.  If anyone knows of any lesser known/niche programs and credits for someone in my position, that's exactly what I'm looking for.  But I'm also fairly new to this, so any guidance is greatly appreciated!",finance,1453141439

personalfinance,[Debt] Should I refinance/consolidate these student loans?,"Hi folks -- I'm looking for some advice, and whether or not this is a good idea. I'm *pretty* sure it is, but always beneficial to have another set of eyes look things over.


I have 3 private education loans I'm working on paying off -- two from the same provider, and a third from a different one. Fortunately I was paying down interest while in school, but now all my loans are in repayment and I'm considering consolidating / refinancing through [SoFi](https://www.sofi.com/).

The breakdown of the current loans are as follows:

Name | Approved Principal | Current Principal | Interest Rate | Repayment Term | Monthly Payment
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
**Loan A** | $5,161 | $4,939 | 6.5%(variable) | 45 months (~4yrs) | $70.76
**Loan B** | $8,000 | $7,404 | 6.0% (fixed) | 59 months (~5yrs) | $160.36
**Loan C** | $5,000 | $4,379 | 2.75%(fixed) | 96 months (~8yrs) | $54.25


Kinda shitty with the double-6% rates but blah.


Here's the pre-approved estimations I've gotten for consolidating/refinancing: 

Name | Approved Principal | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment | Lifetime Cost | Lifetime Savings | Monthly Savings
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
**All 3 Combined** | $16,732.00 | 4.74% (fixed) | $313.76 | $18,825.00 | $156.60 | $2.61 
**Just A+B** | $12,343.00 | 4.74% (fixed) | $231.46 | $13,887.60 | $516.00 |  $8.60




So I'm considering refinancing with SoFi, which I've heard good things about and was recently pre-approved for. My question is threefold:
* should I do this?
* should I consolidate just two of the loans (A and B), and leave C as-is because of the low rate?
* Or should I just consolidate all 3 together, ending up with a lower (average) interest rate?",finance,1453143501

personalfinance,I need some guidance with regard to credit repair,"In the grand scheme of things I don't owe that much, but I've been subject to some crap circumstances that led me to make crap decisions (more accurately, I just ignored the problem for dumb, illogical reasons).

1. Student loans. I owe about $11K. I defaulted on them at one point, then got them out of default, then repeated my stupidity but got back on the bandwagon before a second default. They're current, but everything I'm paying goes to unpaid interest, of which there's a little less than $500 remaining. My principal is basically untouched at this point. They're all federal: 2 unsubsidized at 6.8% and the largest balance subsidized at 4.5%.

2. I had one credit card in ye-olde-days that went into collections. That was 7 years ago. I'm not 100% sure, but I'm expecting that it will be off my report around July or August this year. This is the only credit card I've ever had. 

3. I owe $5.6K on a car. Mostly on time, a few late payments here and there, but not within the past year. Theoretically, I still have 3 years left to pay on it. It's reliable enough, but as it stands, I'm underwater on it. 

I'm in a position where I can throw real money at my debts (between $600 and $800 a month) and I expect a solid jump in my score from that old CC coming off. The usual snowball would put me at about 33 months, which I'm fine with, but it's not just about repayment - I also want to get my score out of the swamp, simultaneously if at all possible. 

I'm thinking about throwing everything I can at my car until the fall and making a little bit more than the minimum payments on my loans. In the meantime, I can reasonably save an additional $1000 for a secured credit card. I'm hoping that lowering the debt and increasing my available credit, in combination with the old blemish coming off, will allow me to get a single loan and roll all the remaining balances into one bill (I'm looking at Earnest Loans) that I can aggressively pay down while rebuilding my credit with a secure card. 

Is this an ok plan? I'm not sure if I should try to refinance anything and suck up the hard pull on my fragile credit, but it would be a lot more convenient to keep up with. Should I not bother with the secured card at all, or should I try to get a secured card sooner to build history before I try to consolidate? Will my credit take a hit if I pay off my car and my loans with another loan? Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

I'm 46, and have been extremely fortunate to work for a company that has granted incentive stock options for the past 10 years, while the company stock price has gone up astronomically during that time.  My salary+bonus with this company has steadily grown from $36K about 15 years ago to around $75K in 2015.  I'm blue collar, no college degree.  Despite the financial rewards I've reaped, I hate the job, or more accurately, hate working in general.  I'm ready to stop, and plan to retire at the end of March 2016, as the annual bonuses are paid in March.

I'm unmarried, live with a significant other, will never have kids (vasectomy), will never be married.  While my SO contributes to household expenses, I am not relying on this in any of my forecasting.

[Here is a list of my assets and required / desired living expenses](http://i.imgur.com/ZOBulKj.jpg) at retirement.  I'm considering the following action items:

* In 2016, sell all company stock holdings.  The $620K of proceeds will result in a $420K capital gain.  Between federal capital gains tax topping out at 23.6% and state tax of around 4%, I'll end up with around $510K, all of which will be added to my taxable investment account, bringing that up to about $960,000.

* The remaining unexercised incentive stock options aren't fully vested, and they're not worth much, so I'm not counting on any value from them for now.

* Starting in 2017, my expected income will consist only of dividends and interest.  I'm anticipating stock dividends of around $12K and bank interest of maybe $1,500.  Assuming tax law stays the same, this will result in a $0 federal tax liability and negligible state tax liability.

* I plan to do a Roth IRA conversion strategy starting in 2017 of $40,000 per year.  Under current tax rules, this will result in federal and state taxes totaling around 17% of the converted amount, which I'll cover out of my cash holdings.  The plan is to have everything converted by the time I'm 70.5, and ideally sooner.

* Start drawing $5K/month out of my taxable investment account in June 2016, which I'll use to meet my living expenses.  This falls just a bit short of my ""desired"" living expenses of $64,530 per year, but I think I'll still be able to do all the things I want/hope to do.  $5K/month, or $60K/year, represents a withdrawal rate of 3.7% on my $960K brokerage account (after capital gains taxes on selling employer stock) and $675K IRA.

* Begin drawing social security at age 70, which would be around $1,900/month in today's dollars, assuming the system is still solvent at that time!  So, even if my financial assets only get me to age 70, I'll still have enough to live on after that by selling my house and renting a cheap place.

* If my portfolio experiences a severe decline due to market movements, I can cut back monthly withdrawals to as little as $3,500 per month.  Or, you know, try to go back to work (ugh).

* 2016 Starbucks Match—What It Means to You

The Starbucks Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan can help you build savings for your future. Through the Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan, you can save part of your eligible pay as either 401(k) pre-tax contributions (before federal, and in most cases state, income taxes) or Roth after-tax contributions. Plus Starbucks matches a portion of your 401(k) pre-tax and/or Roth after-tax contributions each pay period.

((( Obviously this says 1 or the other))))

Questions &amp; Answers

* What is the Starbucks Match for 2016?

The Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan provides a Starbucks Match (also called a Safe Harbor matching contribution) of **100% of the first 5% of eligible pay that you contribute each pay period as 401(k) pre-tax and/or Roth after-tax contributions**.  The Starbucks Match is contributed to your account each pay period along with your contributions and is immediately 100% vested.

((( This sounds like both... AND/or )))

* What do I need to do to get the 2016 Starbucks Match?

First, you need to contribute to the Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan during 2016. The Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan is generally open to all partners on a U.S. payroll who are employed by Starbucks Corporation and its participating affiliates, and who are at least age 18 and have completed 90 days of service. Eligible participants can contribute from 1% to 75% of eligible pay to Future Roast 401(k) Savings Plan each pay period up to the annual IRS limit (see the following page), in a **combination** of 401(k) pre-tax and/or Roth after-tax contributions.

I borrowed $15,000 as Direct Plus Parent Loan in August of 2011. Six months after graduating, I have my first payment due and the current balance is $18,612. Was this increase due to accrued interest? Could someone explain how the total is calculated?

Additionally, how is my monthly payment calculated? How are the principal and interest payments, that make up the monthly payment, calculated?

If you can help me with this loan, I can examine the rest of my Direct Payment Plus loans as well. I am considering refinancing my loans with a different institution for a fixed 3.5% interest rate.

personalfinance,Bank accounts question,"Hey guys, first time poster in this sub. I didn't see much on savings accounts and have a few questions. 

My current bank account offers 1% interest in savings up to 20k, no interest on checking. Once you have more than 20k the interest rate drops. There's another bank I want to open a checking account with to make use of reimbursements (ATM, popmoney, etc) but their savings interest isn't that great.

I'm still building an emergency fund and want around 30k that's easily accessible just because I really like the padding. Once I hit 20k in savings should I just shop around for other good interest rates for the other 10k or are there other options to let me earn a little bit of money while having quick access to the money?

I'm also not 100% sure how the interest rate changes over 20k. I know it goes down but I'm not sure by how much and I'm not sure if it's 1% on the first 20k and .x% on everything over.

personalfinance,Clueless college student with $60k in debt needs advice,"I've been lurking on this sub for a year or so but I haven't seen many threads about current college students. I go to a public university which costs about 20k a semester. I live on campus so I'm not paying rent monthly. I also have the smallest meal plan so I eat 50% at dining halls and the rest at home.


In the past five years, my dad has had a hard time keeping a good job, so I'm able to get a lot from FASFA and supplement the rest with bank loans. I'm not sure if my parents contribute anything, but it's probably only a couple thousand a semester. 


Currently, I have $24k in bank loans. And all the rest from FASFA. I'm guessing by the time I graduate (May 2017) I'll owe about $80k. 


I work two nights a week as a server and typically make $60-100 a night. I currently have $800 in the bank (usually 1k but I was home for the holidays and didn't work). I don't follow a budget, but most of my money goes to prescriptions (~$65/month), gas (~$30-60/month), and food/groceries (no clue but I only eat out rarely and my mom buys most of my groceries because she's a mom). I pay half my car insurance $250/biannually. I try to stay frugal, but I don't restrict myself from the occasional clothing item or night out. Also I usually don't buy books if I can get around it. Last two semesters I only spent $100 on reading materials.


I am able to pay back my bank loans already without penalty or starting interest rates and such. So I guess my question is: Should I start paying a bit of my loans every month? Any other advice would be great as well.

personalfinance,"Single mom, head of household, tax advice","Hi all,  

I need advice on preparing taxes, whether I should do them myself online or bring them to a professional tax preparer.  

A little background; I made 79,000 last year, single mom, head of household and claim 2 on my W2 for state and federal.  My son went to baseball camp, which was about 300 dollars.  I had student loans I was paying off last year.  

That's about it.  I normally do my taxes online, but this year I am claiming my son.  The last 6 years, his dad has raced to his tax preparer and claimed him first.  We have no custody agreement on paper.  And this whole time I thought the first parent who claims the child gets to claim him.  But I've done some research that says if there was nothing written in writing or ordered by the court in terms of custody, the parent that makes more, will be able to claim the child as a dependent.  I have my son 70-80% of the time, and his dad has had trouble with the IRS a couple times (falsely claiming other dependents), and his dad made probably less than 30,000 so I'm not worried if we both get audited.

Though it will be cheaper to prepare my own taxes, do you think a professional will be able to increase the refund amount?  Would I waste my money to go to a professional tax preparer?",finance,1453185084

No car loan or insurance (company vehicle)
Company paid Cell Phone

I currently have about $25k in federal student loan debt, down from $40K.  Max interest is 6.55% with some at 3.5%.  So 5% is a safe average.  Currently paying $400/month, was paying $800 but decided to slow down to build up some liquidity. 

No company sponsored retirement or matching.  Usually when I have excess cash I dump it towards my loans to try and get them paid off ASAP.  So $0 retirement fund.  I currently have ~$7k sitting in my checking/savings account.  Usually I do not have this big of reserve, as I want to pay off my loans, but I am considering moving and wanted a larger safety net for this.

My question would be:
Would it make sense for me to contribute $1-$2K to a Roth or traditional IRA right now (for the 2015 Tax year), or just keep the extra liquidity.  Would I see much of an increase in my tax return this year if I did contribute this?

Trying to gather some knowledge before I meet with our work representative.,"Work has a 403B with MetLife. My employers match 4%, I contribute 6%. I recently switched my part to a Roth, which of course I question even that if I did the right thing(that's a whole other discussion though). On my statement under plan-type: Tax Sheltered Annuity. Product Type: Universal Annuity. I am getting conflicting advice from other employees, none of which have education experience myself definitely included, and I look to you guys for some guidance. People see all the ""losses"" on their statements and say they are ""losing money"" and ""look at all my money gone!!"" They switched to T-Flex and ""look at all my gains"". To me it looks like a glorified savings account with an annual variable interest rate never going below 3.5% as far as I have researched online, not bad by any means. As far as I see you can't get that kind of return on an account at any bank. And yes compared to what my plan is worth and theirs it does look like they are gaining faster, now. However since I do not fully understand either and future predictions I cannot make an educated decision. I'm looking for long term gains when I retire and I thought I was on the right track.

I've got a bit of a confusing one. I spent 5 months of 2015 working for the National Parks Service through the Student Conservation Association. My particular program didn't have an Americorps education award (relevant later).

From the SCA handbook, the relevant information reads:
""Is my living allowance taxed? If you are enrolled in the AmeriCorps Education Award Program, you will have federal taxes withheld from your living, travel, and housing allowances. The number of exemptions you claim on your W-4 form determines the amount of tax that is withheld. If you are not enrolled in AmeriCorps, your allowances are not taxed.""

I was never instructed to fill out a W-4, and won't receive a W-2. SCA refuses to confirm whether or not the money is taxable or not. The only semi-relevant materials I can find from the IRS are about the Peace Corps (I'm not sure if my situation would fall under the same category).

personalfinance,Paypal refusing to switch default account or verify my ID; anything I can do?,"Afternoon,

So recently a whole heap of bullshit has been thrown at me by PayPal and I searched through the sub and found some related problems, but it usually boiled down to ""don't forget to switch your accounts."" I did, and PayPal isn't letting me. 

I have a number of bills coming out of PayPal (Amazon subscriptions, Netflix, Spotify, etc), which links to my now old bank account of USAA. Wonderful bank. I recently switched my main checking/ direct deposit over to Navy Fed, they pay military earlier, I got an auto loan approved through them, whatever, I switched banks save for keeping some savings in USAA.

I switched my main accounts within PayPal after verifying the new checkings, PayPal told me it was all confirmed, easy peasy. Well, then I get hit with a message saying my ID could not be verified, for whatever reason. Really no idea. My address changed several months ago but that didn't seem to be a problem. They're asking for a picture of my ID, proof of address, and proof of social security number. Very very sketchy to me. After a few phone calls, I determine this has to happen or I won't be able to do anything with my account.

Even after confirming, on the phone, that my default account would be switched and that this issue with my ID would be taken care of, it still hasn't. PayPal continues to overdraw my old account, and despite my best efforts, because my ID still is not verified, I cannot change my accounts, add money to PayPal, etc. I'm more or less locked out. And as you can imagine, the charges are killing me. Even though it's only a few bills (I switched most places to just charging my card), PayPal is repeatedly charging USAA every few days for those charges, which gives me a ~30 dollar overdraft charge. And again, I can't fix the negative balance with PayPal because my ID isn't verified. 

Sorry for the long winded post, I'm just incredibly stressed out and it's very possible I'm about to get stationed overseas and I need my finances to be completely in order before that happens. Is there any precedent to make PayPal overturn these charges? Or my bank? What do I need to do to make that happen?",finance,1453230515

personalfinance,Should I apply for income-based repayment of student loan even though I can make more than the minimum payment?,"I have $12k in federal student loans.
$2k @ 6.550%
$5k @ 4.410%
$5k @ 3.610%

My minimum payment currently is $133/month. Paying off this loan is my top priority, and I am making payments of $500. The first $133 each month is divided among the loans by percentage of overall amount, and the remaining amount goes to my highest interest rate loan. 

I am a teacher, and if I did income-based repayment, my minimum payment would be $50. I don't need to do this to make ends meet, but would it make sense to apply anyway so that more of my monthly payment goes toward my higher interest rate loans? It might be negligible, but psychologically I'd love to feel like I'm doing everything I can to get rid of the debt as quickly as I can.

technology,Y2K of Time Zones with Popular Browsers on Windows,"Currently the latest version of major browsers (Chrome 47, Edge 20, Firefox 43) are broken on Windows 10 when it comes to dealing with time, more specifically the JavaScript Date object. The Date object, as most JS developers may be familiar with, deals with all things time related on browsers. This is all well, unless for example you were born on March 10 1980 at midnight EST in the US. If you are that unlucky fellow, this means that whenever you are submitting your birth date on a website on Windows 7, 8, or 10, using one of the major browsers mentioned, you will in fact be telling that website that your birth date is March 9th.

The reason for this is the historical shifts of the daylight savings time in the US. For example, in 1980 the daylight savings time for EST US started on April 27th, the last Sunday of April. However as time went on, laws such as **Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986**, and more recently **Energy Policy Act of 2005**, have shifted when the daylight savings time starts and ends.

What's happening on Windows 10 with these modern browsers is that the current daylight savings time policy in 2016 (starting at the second Sunday of March) gets applied historically to all dates in the past, meaning on March 10 1980 at midnight EST, the clocks still showed 12:00AM, but what Firefox, and Chrome does on Windows is to go, ""Daylight savings time starts at the second Sunday of March right? Right. Surely it did back then as well."" and gives you the Date instance of March 9 1980 at 11:00PM instead.  Given that Unix timestamp is exactly what the Date object's value outputs, this is universally incorrect and may cause issues with browser calendars as [this article](https://www.getdonedone.com/timezone-specific-browser-specific-datetime-bug-2014/) points out from 2014, **still an outstanding issue in 2016**.",technology,1453231056
personalfinance,"Married into student loan debt and I'm overwhelmed, please help","I married my husband a year ago after over half a decade together. He had undergrad loans from before we met and took out his grad loans while we were dating. I did not get involved because I didn't assume we'd get married and I did not understand the process. I have no debt whatsoever. He went to art school and has 140k of federal loans at several different interest rates, I think none higher than 6% or so, they are not currently consolidated. He also has about 4K on credit cards. He set himself up for IBR and is 2 years into that, was a waiter until last year, making $0 payments under that plan. This year with a new job making 40k he is anticipating 300-400 a month. He did not know about the tax bomb (I can explain if you are unfamiliar) and neither did I, I found out about this yesterday. 

We are both 30, have no kids, we rent, and our combined income is 66k. I have 55k in retirement/mutual fund, a portion is taxable and can be liquidated but I do not want to use it to pay for his loans. I am willing to help him pay them down monthly. I know we need to start kicking this in the dick asap and I need a plan. My initial estimate is that we are gonna owe at least 1000 a month for 20 years with a traditional loan. I know we need higher paying jobs but that's been struggle for both of us. I work in an office position for 25k and he is an office manager and like I mentioned makes 40k. I do plan to look for a new job which really sucks because I love the fast growing startup where I work now. Moving home with parents is not an option for us. I want to stress this, we are not able to move home. 

Gonna look at reducing the phone bill (180), cutting my art studio (100) and possibly my website (25) although I use it to get side work regularly. Our rent is low for our city/area at 875 water included. We live very modestly, no vacations and I buy thrift clothes and cheap groceries. We have about 1000 in a savings account. He can sell at least 1000 worth of collectibles easily if not more, and I am pushing him to ask his parents for at least some help but he does not want to. I also thought to pay off just his cc debt (4k) with the mutual fund so we can free up the 300/mo he pays on that for the loans. Again I do not want to use my only asset in this world on his loans, while his parents do not contribute. 

I never looked at his situation before and now I'm so overwhelmed I can't sleep or eat. He has high blood pressure and I'm so scared the stress could hurt him.

I also feel like a naive idiot who married a fool, although let me be very clear I love my husband very much. Am I on the right track? What else can I do?",finance,1453231092
personalfinance,Taxed on DOJ settlement for settled student loan.,"Around 2005ish I took out a private student loan for a ripoff school. (Long story) I went to basic training in July 08 through Feb 09 and then left for premobilization training in June 2010 and returned home from deployment in Nov 2011. I sent all the required docs to sallie mae for SCRA benefits and was assured I was fine. Set up autopay for my deployment and had my spouse on my POA to handle any issues while I was deployed. Mid deployment I kept getting emails saying my account needed attention. I had my wife call SM numerous times and called myself, numerous times and was assured everything was fine and payments were coming out of my bank account as normal. Came home to find out they had increased my interest rate to over 21%, after 3 mos of me being at training. Fought with them for months, as I had accrued late fees for the underpayment I had auto withdrawal from my bank account. My loan balance had gone from 6500 to over 9000. I filed a complaint with DOJ, my congressman, and National guard bureau. Finally I just told them to shove it. 

6 mos down the road I got a phone call from a collection agency wanting to settle. I settled the account for $2000 and that year got a 1099 for the remainder which was 7200. Filed it with last year's taxes.

Then July of last year I received a check from Navient (sallie mae) for a settlement from a lawsuit against them from DOJ for breaking interest rate rules and overcharging  military members under scra requirements. Now I received a 1099 for the settlement amount. I feel as though I am being double taxed on the same money. 

I've read on the IRS website in regards to settlements but to say it was confusing would put it mildly. I'm assuming that sallie mae sent the 1099 as a CYA measure as the IRS doesn't seem clear on what types of settlements you get taxed on. What are the tax liabilities on a settlement like this? To me it's more of a refund than a settlement. Not including what I paid before all the scra stuff started this makes 14000 that I have been taxed/paid. on a 9000 loan balance",finance,1453231318
personalfinance,"So im 21 years old, in college, and need some help organizing my finances.(US)","I have looked over the how to handle money and debt parts of the sidebar, but am looking for a little more personalized information. i will explain later how i have already applied the tips in the sidebar, thankfully i did a lot of these things before i knew reddit existed. i also apologize before hand as this has become pretty long, i hope im not breaking any rules here. Im a college student, previously full time, now going to school part time as im almost done with community college. 

i have quite a bit of debt, and honestly not that much income. I realize now how my bank did not have the best intentions handing me a credit card at 18. I live on my own, payin rent of $695 a month. Southern California is a pretty pricy place to live. My boss is currently going throught the steps necessary to make me a full time worker, which will hopefully come with a raise, and definitely health insurance which i do not currently have.

The lack of health insurance was a major setback for me, i attempted to go Medi-cal for quite some time unsuccessfully, manly due to their inability to get anything done in a resonable amount of time. in this time i had two emergency room visits, totalin probably around $2000 - $2500. That debt a have basically deemed impossibly to pay off at the moment and essentially said fuck it. now the credit card is about $1300. havent used it in over a year but i keep forgetting to make minimum payments. this is my top priority debt at the moment, because its the only on i can reasonably pay off. I also had a dog a few years ago. keep in mind i had absolutely no parental support, and really no parents at all. i loved this dog more than anything, to this day I havent felt closer to anyone that this dog. I only say this to put it into context that i then went into about $2000 of veterinary debt trying to save my dog when it was sick, only to find it had cancer pretty much everywhere, and the credit card i maxed out was essentially for nothing. I know thats stupid but i genuinely loved the dog, and was under the impression my POS parents would help me with the bill.

Now on to my sources of income. Throughout High School i knew i would need to save as much money as possible, because my father was going through a very drawn out eviction situation from his insane family and whatnot. Anyway, during that time i had saved aroung $10,000 through means that i wont go into detail about. That money sustained my costs of rent for quite some time, along with money from federal financial aid for school. Well now that money has just about run out, and since im not going to school full time i wont be receiving as much financial aid.

From my work i make anywhere from $300 to $700 every two weeks, depending on the hours i get. so $600-$1400 per month. Im a lifeguard so during the summer i do often have the opportunity for overtime.

My savings has about next months rent in it, $700.
My emergency fund also has about $700 in it.
Checking account until next pay check is just shy of almost 0. luckily i have some food so my spending for the next week will only include gas to get to work, probably have to dip into emergency a little for that.

Tl:dr: Bank credit card debt: $1300

         Medical bills: $2000 - $2500

         Completely unnecessary veterinary credit card: $2000

         Savings: $700 (basically comes from my paycheck that isnt used on food/gas/necessities, and school financial aid. i use it for rent.)

         Emergency: $700 (this does increase as i occasionally take some to invest, and put back into it more than i started with.)

         Income: $600 - $1400(rarely do i get the higher end) per month

         Rent: $695 per month

         Expenses: All the things that im sure you're very familiar with, gas/food/car issues/hopefully a nice date with my girlfriend becase she really deserves it.

What the fuck to do?? :(

Aditional note: I will most definitely have to take out my first federal subsidized student loan next semester in order to pay rent, whether i end up getting a raise or not, as it will just make me feel much more secure. I've honestly decided to say fuck it on the medical and vet bills, and pay my credit card if i can, which lately i havent. Should i be putting as much as i can into savings? Or should i be putting more of that money towards paying the credit card bill? It seems that the more money i use towards credit card, i will have less for rent, and therefore need student loans. To my limited knowledge i take it its better to have credit card debt than student loan debt. Is there really anything i can do about the medical/vet bills? It seems that with gas and grocerys and occasional car issues there really just isnt much i can do about this debt. Honestly my plan at the moment is to just hope by the time i graduate (plan to get a phd in some area of math or physics) that i will be making enough money to pay these off. i also heard that if given enough time, credit card companies and medical bills will settle with you, possibly making you pay less, just because they want to get some money rather than none, dont know whether that is true or complete nonsense.

I thought that I had (maybe I didn't?) set up direct monthly payments withdrawn from my checking account and kind of forgot about it. About a month ago I was browsing my recent transactions and noticed that there was never any money withdrawn for best buy. I looked back a few months and there was absolutely nothing.

Confused, I walked into best buy with 1400$ (they said they couldn't take a card?) looking to just pay off the remaining sum, but when the customer service rep said I could make a minimum payment of $250ish I decided to just give her 500$ and put the rest back into my bank account for the time being.

My plan was to just come back in a few months and make another 500$ payment, and then again a few months after that and pay of the remains amount ($400ish).


SO, just yesterday I got a letter in the mail from a debt collector (Global Credit Collection Corp) saying ""Your Best Buy Private Label Account remains outstanding with Global Credit &amp; Collectino Corp. etc...""
There saying I owe $900.

I called best buy to figure out what happened and they told me that citibank handles their credit cards. I called Citibank and they told me that my account got transferred to the debt collector and I am essentially out of their database at this point and their is nothing they can do about but I can contact the debt collector. I called the debt collector and they pretty much said that they are contracted out to collect debts and they no nothing about what happened and only know that I owe them money.

NOW, I have a few questions-
1.) I am assuming there is nothing I can do about this and I am just going to have to pay the debt collectors?

2.) How is this going to effect my credit?

3.) The letter I got from the debt collectors said I could settle for about $500 instead of $900 if I respond in 10 days. Is this a trick or what? It sounds to good to be true. Essentially I bought a $1400 dollar computer for $1000.

4.) What are the steps I need to take in order to make this effect me least as possible?


Sorry for the long post. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Ill be here answering any other questions you might have me.

I've budgeted things out so that one check/month is primarily mortgage and the second check is monthly bills/utilities. I was still having a decent chunk to squirrel away or spend on extras. 

Due to my new place being an antique house, the furniture that will fit in and up the stairs is quite limited and I ended up having to spend quite a bit on a sectional that would fit (I had been using a dog bed in the interem). I opened up a Pottey Barn credit card that has zero interest if paid off in full within the first year. After that it is an absurdly high interest rate. 

I can pay off the card within the year - it just means I will have to seriously cut back on saving and buying non-essentials. My employer does not offer matching and I currently contribute 8%. It would give me an roughly an extra $500/month that I could use to pay off the card sooner and have less anxiety.

personalfinance,[Housing] Six months... too soon to sell my house?,"Hi, /r/personalfinance. I'm feeling like I'm in a bit of a pickle. I bought a house 6 months ago, and am now wondering whether I need to sell. A natural gas company has bought land near (about a quarter mile from) my subdivision with the intent of building a [compressor station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressor_station). Construction is apparently scheduled for early 2017.

A neighbor has confided that this is **not** something you want to live near, and has suggested I sell (despite my relatively short stay here) to avoid the loss in property value once the development commences (not to mention pollution of the air and water in the area, and noise, and any potential hazards: see [Erin Brockovich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Brockovich) and [the recent (ongoing?) California gas leak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliso_Canyon_gas_leak).

The development of our station wasn't revealed until four months into living here, so I couldn't have known this was going to happen. The area is very residential/agricultural, with lots of subdivisions and cow pastures; this industrial project is out of left field.

Am I being hasty by wanting to sell and move somewhere else in my city? The house is in the better part of what is a mostly low-income area which is treated like the red-headed stepchild of the city, and it's no surprise to the residents that this neighborhood was chosen. The residents are willing to fight it, but since the land has already been bought (and gas companies apparently have a lot of power in the form of federal overrides of city and state ordinances), the fight looks to be challenging enough (to me anyway) as to be almost hopeless. I moved here (on a risk) thinking the area could gentrify and I could turn a profit on the home when I *do* decide to move... but it sounds like the news of this compressor station is a sign that the area isn't ready to improve, but rather to do the opposite. Another note, the traffic here is the worst in the city, so it would be a relief to have an easier drive. 

I realize nothing stops me from moving somewhere else in the city, only to have the same thing happen there, but I'd feel a little better if it wasn't already a neighborhood with a nasty reputation. If you were in my situation, what do you think you would do? Is it a totally daft move to sell the house this early, regardless of the circumstances?",finance,1453251638

personalfinance,[Planning] Spouse and I are ready to start a family and looking for advice in a lot of different areas. Messy loan situation causing complications.,"Hello /r/personalfinance! My spouse and I have a whole bunch of questions related to our finances and came here looking for help. Apologies for the ensuing wall of text...

&amp;nbsp;

We are looking to start a family/buy a house and all the other things that married folks do, but we really need some advice on planning it out. Debt-wise, I am in a much better spot than my spouse in terms of both debt and credit history. Both of us have great degrees and our earning power is only going to increase, but we want to base our decisions on the debt/salaries we have now and not just on what we hope to make in the future. Long story short, Spouse 2's loans are substantial and have defaulted. Two of them are in repayment and the third will be soon, but when we tried to start rehabilitation on that loan, they demanded an insane amount of money, which was not feasible for us at the time. Instead of tackling the problem head on, we just let it slip and slip and obviously that was a huge mistake, but there's nothing we can do about that now. We want to get all loans/debt under control so we can actually buy a house and start our family. We expect to be repaying these loans for years to come, but that is not an issue. We just want to be moving in the right direction with them. We've tried to capture all of our info/debt/expenses below:

&amp;nbsp;

**Salaries**

Spouse 1: $84,000 (credit score 811)

Spouse 2: $35,000 (credit score 650)

Total Income: $119,000

&amp;nbsp;

**Existing Debt**

**Spouse 1's loans**

Loan 1: Principal $17,032.42 Interest 6.800%

Loan 2: Principal: $2811.12 Interest 5.000%

**Spouse 2's loans** (this is the scary part)

Loan 1: Principal $71,168.37 Interest 6.800%

Loan 2: Principal $165,300.41 Interest 8.500%

Loan 3: Approx. $100,000. **This loan is in default.** We are in the process of setting up rehabilitation on this loan.


**Spouse 2's landlord debt**

$6356.00 - we saw this flagged on a credit report recently and are planning to dispute. Unfortunately, this has been on Spouse 2's credit report for 4+ years before we ever saw it (shame on us for not doing regular credit checks...), so I have no idea if we can even dispute this anymore, but we do NOT owe this money.

&amp;nbsp;

**Misc**

Credit Card Debt: None

Rent: $1500.00 /mo

No car loan

Cell Phones: $40/mo

$6000 in savings account. This is the start of a down-payment on our house, which is why we are not using this to pay off the highest interest loan. This may be a mistake, but I'll leave that for you guys to decide...

&amp;nbsp;

**2016 Upcoming Expenses**

Surgeries (Approx. $6,500.00)

Buying a house

Having kids in the next year or two

&amp;nbsp;

**Questions**

1.     House loan in just Spouse 1's name since spouse 2's credit is much lower?
2.     We badly want to buy a house. How expensive is realistic? Best avenue for first time home buyers given our situation? Our rent is already $1500.00/mo, so this would instead go towards a mortgage. Given our current expenses/lifestyle, we estimate we can afford around $2400.00/mo in Mortgage. We live in Seattle, so houses are damn expensive, but this is where we want to raise our kids.
3.     Financial adviser? Are they worth the time/money or figure it out ourselves for now i.e. you guys :) 
4.     We want to start investing in retirement, even if only a little bit each month. Best options? 401k? IRA? Should we hold off until loans are paid?
5.     Should we file taxes separately or jointly (we've only done joint filling in the past)? 
6.     Spouse 2 loan consolidation. Which loan to prioritize? Consolidate now or later or never?
7.     General advice on the landlord debt? How best to proceed and what options do we have for disputing this old debt?


&amp;nbsp;

We're not interested in regretting what we should have done, only what's best moving forward and learning from our mistakes. Thanks for reading and any advice is greatly appreciated! Please let me know if I left out any important information.

Edit: Spouse 2 is non-practicing lawyer. All federal loans. There is a promising loan forgiveness program we are looking into which requires you work for a 501c(3) non-profit (or non-prophet) or state/city/federal government job for 10 years for complete loan forgiveness. I hope we still qualify given the nature of the loans...This seems like the quickest path to victory over the debt. We're looking for such jobs now :)",finance,1453253527
personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation Options (2 Loans in Default),"Hi Guys,

I need your help for a friend. This is the current situation.

He has a few different loans with a few different banks for his student loans.



Bank | Balance | Interest
---|---|----
Key Bank | $15,000.00 | 0%
Key Bank | $15,000.00 | 0%
Discover | $27,000.00 | 11%
Sallie Mae-unsubsidized | $3,500.00 | 6.80%
Sallie Mae-unsubsidized | $1,800.00 | 6.80%
Sallie Mae-subsidized |$2,800.00| 6.80%
Sallie Mae-subsidized  | $5,525.00 | 6%
Sallie Mae-unsubsidized | $8,850.00 | 6.80%
Total | $79,475.00

Issues that he is having:

1) Key Bank loans are in default due to problems with payments he had after school. They are currently in collection and I guess nothing can be done. This seems to be hurting his credit (credit check showed ~660)

2) Discover is at huge 11%.

3) We are thinking of consolidating the Sallie Mae loans if at all possible. 

4) Current payments on these loans are about $900 / month with the majority going to Key Bank $400 and $350 to Discover.




Does anyone have any idea of how to organize this better and structure it. I'm thinking of trying to consolidate all the Sallie Mae loans and at least try to refinance that Discover loan if at all possible. The problem is that the Key Bank Default is hurting the credit which could jeopardize the Discover loan if we can refinance. The Key Stone bank was an honest mistake where he was making one payment to Key Bank and instead of them applying it to two loans they only applied it to one.

personalfinance,Life Questions/Should I pay off my car loan? Please Help!,"Hello Reddit and thanks for your time in reading this!

The reason for my post is to acquire some advice about how I should proceed in paying off the remaining balance on my car loan, totaling $8,100. About 3 years ago my mother's car was totaled and as a result we were left without a vehicle. My mother needed a car and I used the previous one often enough where I agreed that getting another one together was probably a good idea. The primary reason I agreed to buy the car new, especially at a rather young age was because my mom agreed that the car will be primarily mine down the road. The original total of the car was about $22,700 and we put about $5,000 down. Unfortunately we were convinced to get an additional warranty totaling $5000. Within the first week of owning the car we decided to return this warranty that my mother purchased, however we were only returned $2700. My mother sent me into the dealership 3 separate times in an attempt to recoup the remaining $2300, but I was unsuccessful, they stated they returned the full amount. I will be calling in tomorrow to see if somehow I can recover this remaining $2300 prior to proceeding with paying off the car in full (if I do that). The car loan is with Honda and I live in New York. Where we're at currently:

&amp;nbsp;


Original Cost: $22,700 (+/- 5000)

&amp;nbsp;


Remaining Cost: $8,100

Remaining Payments @ $398/mo.: 27

Interest Rate: 2.65%

I am currently in my early 20s earning about $50k/year in my current job. I am expecting about $3,000 back on my tax return next month and currently have about $18k in the bank with zero debt. I pay no rent, however I do support my mother financially on occasion. I do spend a bit more monthly on personal expenses like food and entertainment as I usually cover the costs for my SO, but we do not go out too often. The primary reason I ask is because of other life factors I am considering. I plan to move out later this year and NY has a rather high cost of living, I want to ensure I have enough in savings to be safe in the event of an unexpected expense / job loss (although my job is pretty secure). I also have no money invested anywhere, not even my 401k (I recently transitioned to a new employer and they do not allow you to contribute to your 401k until you've been there at least 1 year, it's been about 4 months). This post is not just about the car loan, I am certainly open to any advice any of you can possibly provide for all aspects of my life. Between the car, gas and insurance I usually pay about $400/mo. my mom pays the other half. Reducing this to 0 and finally owning the car would relieve an immense amount of stress off my mother and it would be nice to not deduct about $300/mo. for the next 2+ years - not to mention skipping out on a few thousand in interest if we continued paying the minimum monthly.

We need some money to repair the house (~$30k), want some to pay off the rest of my student loans (11k).

personalfinance,Reducing taxable income with a home business,"Hey everyone, what I've found in the wiki here supports this idea, but I'd like to double check with everyone. 

I just became a salaried employee of company X that will withhold federal, state, and social security tax, they'll give me a w-2 at the end of the year. The side jobs I do are completely separate, completely on my own as a home based business Y(wiring work for random offices, selling cables on eBay, web work, lots of work from my computer in my room, etc). I understand that its up to me to pay taxes on business Y, but after write offs business Y is net negative. I estimate the combined write offs for business Y to be $9000, so Im putting that amount on the w-4 for company X as income adjustments. From what I understand this will lower my taxable income by $9000 and thus company X will still obviously withhold taxes, but they will base withholdings off my salary - $9000. So at the end of the year I will file a 1040 for company X, and an attachment schedule C for home business Y.  I have records of the jobs I've completed, what I've paid for inventory, my sales, how half of my room is dedicated to solely business, advertising material and the receipts for paying for them, obvious proof of working on my business at the computer. Putting the adjustment on my w-4 will also double my allowances and bring my monthly income tax down by around 50%. as far as i know this is completely legitimate. am I correct here or am I misunderstanding something?

personalfinance,Putting in an offer for a house - should I wait until summer to close or close in 60 days?,"I'm putting in an offer for a house today. The seller is giving the option of waiting until summer to close. I currently have enough cash for 2/3 of the down payment. The rest of my savings is in Alphabet (Google) stock (I work for them). I could liquidate some of the stock to pay the rest of the down payment and close on the house within 60 days, or take the option to wait until summer to close, when I will have enough cash saved to make the full down payment without touching the stock. This seemed like a no brainer for me until I talked to the loan officer who mentioned that I would either need to pay to lock in current interest rates, or rates might go up by summer. 

So my options are:

1. Offer to close in 60 days, take out some stock to pay the remaining down payment


2. Close in 60 days, put down only 10%, but pay PMI, refinance in 6 months when I have cash for the rest


3. Wait until summer to close, put down 20% in cash

What would you do? How likely is it that interest rates really will go up by summer? I feel like everyone keeps saying interest rates will go up but I don't know if it's just people trying to sell houses.

Also, let me add that the mortgage payment is double the cost of my current rent, but I have to get more space because I'm currently in a tiny studio apartment with my husband, baby, and cat. I know this might work for some, but it's driving us all nuts and we're constantly waking the baby when we need to cook or do things after he goes to bed. Toughing it out until summer though, does give us the benefit of saving faster.

Edit: thanks everyone. I decided to cash out some stock and put down 20% and close in 60 days. We made the offer today. Now just waiting to see if it's accepted.",finance,1453292693

I ask because if my employer offers health benefits, then that is not included in my wage and then not taxable:

I'm former student with &lt;130k in student loan debt. I' have .gov student loans that occupy ~60 of that. Most of those are at ~3.3% and 4.5% interest and in my name, and pretty easy to get out of in case of super emergency/death and at those interest rates its whatev. There is about ~70k at a terrible 8.25%. It's in my mom's name and they are all ParentPlus loans. I am the one responsible for it and am close and in good relation with my parents. I tried to apply for re-financing with like Sofi(sketch) and called a couple others, and they all indicated that they don't do ParentPlus refinancing - i'm not sure if they were telling me that because they don't do it period or they don't do it because I'm not the one authorized to do it as I have since learned my mom has to be the one that applies for the refinancing. 

So I can work with my mom and apply around, but things would go a lot quicker if I could line stuff up and organize everything initially? so any advice or companies that you know do it  - would be great!! 

Also any reading material on assessing variable interest rate vs fixed? I'm averaging ~3000 a month over the year on those loans so I think they will get paid within the next 5 years. 

Edit: In case it wasn't clear - I understand I can't refinance the loans in my name or by myself. But I am trying to do research on who does and where I can get it done because I have to be the driving force in the process.

investing,Is dollar cost averaging (DCA'ing) now into stocks the height of folly?,"With the market nose diving, lots of people in this sub are commenting that they are long term investors and dollar cost averaging to take advantage of stocks that are ""on sale."" Does this really make sense for everyone?

Our younger readers particularly are heavily weighted towards stocks (and even worse towards the more fashionable, frothy names - I won't give tickers but you know which ones). Portfolios that are close to 100% equities are not uncommon after the long bull market. These people are now realizing that maybe it wasn't such a good idea and [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/41snbp/anyone_had_enough/) are practically soiling themselves. Compounding their woes was a virulent misconception that bonds are terrible investments once the Fed started hiking rates, never mind their wonderful diversification properties in just this sort of economic slowdown scenario (not to mention their positive carry).

But hindsight is 20/20 (although some saw all this coming last summer). Considering their current predicament, what should people do now? The default answer for their existing portfolios seems to be head-in-the-sand inaction. Few can be convinced to take a loss (""hey it's only a paper loss now"") short of a 40-50% drawdown even if they are clearly overallocated to stocks. (Remember that it these decisions don't need to be all or nothing.) Everyone is gambling big for a rebound. This is classic ""get-evenitis.""

**So bottom-line, people won't sell existing stock positions yet they continue to plow even more cash on a monthly basis into stocks. To me this is the height of folly.** Here is an opportunity to lower their stock allocations (albeit gradually) with new cash and yet people are doing the opposite and buying even more stocks. Madness.

The primary defense seems to be that ""stocks are on sale."" But are you really confident that many stocks are not merely going from overvalued to mildly overvalued or fairly valued? I'd be more convinced that stocks are cheap if we have a real 40-50% crash. Being a ""long-term"" investor doesn't change this calculus.

An even more important point is one of diversification against a range of scenarios.  Let's keep it simple and reduce it to just two. (1) The market rebounds relatively quickly. In this case, you were better off putting your incremental cash into stocks. These new purchases make a bit of money and more importantly your existing portfolio rebounds. This is the happy (upside) scenario. (2) The market crashes. You didn't put all your new cash into the market, but instead kept it in cash or better yet bought bonds. So now you really can take advantage of some bargains. This is the bad (downside) scenario, but at least you've mitigated some of the damage.

Investing is about managing risks. In scenario 1, the market (and your portfolio) rebounds so you would do just fine whether you made a little extra from DCA'ing additional funds into stocks at a small discount or not. You are getting greedy and looking for a cherry on top of your ice cream sundae. In scenario 2, you are hurting since your portfolio really takes a hit. But since you kept your additional monthly contributions in cash/bonds, you can now really benefit from the situation. Of course, you're still way underwater on your portfolio, but at least you have partially insured yourself. The additional cash might be substantial if you are getting your annual bonus now or are realizing some proceeds from selling your house, exercising options in your company stock, etc. *In my mind, it's much better to give up a bit in the good scenario to protect myself in the bad scenario.*

**TL;DR: For people who are heavily allocated towards stocks, further DCA investments into stocks seems very foolish since you are forgoing the opportunity to reduce your allocation to stocks (without selling current stocks holdings for a loss, which many cannot bring themselves to do) and not hedging the downside scenario in which stocks fall considerably further by keeping your new cash on the sidelines.**",finance,1453311201

I took a look at the post https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/12mry8/your_credit_score_explained/ but still had a few questions that I'm hoping you can help me answer.

* I have a checking account with BoA that I'd like to switch to Chase to keep my credit card and checking account in the same place. Is this going to impact my credit score at all? From the looks of the that thread posted earlier, it wouldn't, but I just want to make sure.

* I have a no-rewards credit card that I want to close down since I'm not using it and have no reason to keep it around if I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred as well. The no-rewards card I've had open since 2007 while the Sapphire I opened about 2 years ago and use exclusively. The posted article mentioned that 15% of your credit score is determined by the age of your open accounts so I'm assuming that means that I shouldn't close down the other card for a few more years even though I'm not using it? Is there no concept of archived credit history where closing that credit card won't make or break my score?

I realize I'm micromanaging my score a little but just want to put myself in the best position to take out a loan to buy a house in the next 3 months. Don't want to shoot myself in the foot with a higher interest rate just for a minor convenience. As a side note, I had also taken out a car loan of about 30k in 2012 that I paid off well ahead of schedule. Don't know how much weight that will carry compared to the other factors mentioned above.",finance,1453312198

personalfinance,Weekly Tax Calculation / Take Home Pay,"I'm trying to calculate how much money I'm going to get if I work X hours per week, after all deductions. Basically, take home pay. However, finding out how this is calculated at this time of year (tax season) is yielding a lot of answers about filing taxes. My end goal is to create a spreadsheet that I can enter my hours worked into, and have it spit out my take home pay. Or, more importantly, how many hours I need to work in any given week / month / pay period in order to meet my financial goals.

This, so far, is how I assume the calculation goes:

* Hourly wage x hours worked = weekly gross pay
* Weekly gross pay x 52 = yearly gross pay
* Apply appropriate Provincial and Federal taxes based on brackets to yearly gross pay
* Calculate equivalent tax %
* Apply equivalent tax % to taxable income

Taxable income would be calculated as

* Weekly Income + Benefits (paid by company) + Employer RRSP contributions - EI - CPP - personal RRSP contributions (pre-tax)

Take home pay:

* Weekly income - EI - CPP - RRSP contribution - Tax

However, when I try to use this method, the tax I calculate is higher than the tax I pay. It seems as though I'm going to end up paying more come tax season, but it always comes back with me getting a decent sized return. What am I missing?

A bit more background. Some of these in the list are to remove any tax benefits some groups have, which, as far as I'm aware, I'm not qualified for (or at least haven't signed up for).

Internet - $39  
Electric - $25  
Netflix - $7 (Split account with GF)

Federal Student Loan - $150  
Emergency Fund - $75  
Savings - $100  
*Bad Debt* - $100  
Personal Loan - $200  
  
**Debt Breakdown:**  
Federal Student : $50,000  
Private Student: $4,000  
Bad Debt: $7,000  
Personal Loan: $3,000  
  
I plan on doing all my **Fixed** and **Financial** split into two biweekly. This will give me a full check that doesn't need to go to bills or anything in July (Three pay periods in July for my work schedule).  
This leaves me 31.71% for flexible spending. I have a bad habit of eating out that I'm trying to shake. So far this week, I haven't eaten out once the whole week and I'm trying to make it a routine. I spent $33 on groceries on Sunday and it'll last me until Tuesday or Wednesday next week plus work provides us with snacks and food to cook.  
I'm wondering if I should take another 11% and apply it to financial goals (split between my bad debt and emergency/savings). The student loans will be here a LONG time (the private one will only take 2 or 3 years to pay off but federal is gonna be here for a while). I'm thinking that if I keep the student loans in good shape and pay down my bad debt, I'll fix my credit score.   
  
**For Bad Debt:** I'm not going to straight up pay into bad debts because a lot of them are aged old credit cards or accounts that have just been sitting. Some of them are near the 7 year cut off, some of them are younger than 3 years. My approach will be to put enough money into a separate account that I'm at 50% of one bad debt, call them and ask for a bottom price and put my foot down until they give me the lowest price they can, in writing, with agreements to delete. My goal is based on the age of the debt and I'll do some research on it, but whatever I save over 50% on the debt, I'll pay 10% of that into an ""income tax"" pool and the rest of it will go towards savings/emergency.  
Also, please don't judge me on my bad debt. The world isn't perfect and when someone is already trying to be a better person, kicking them just makes you look like a dick face.  
  
**Places I'd like advice on:**  
My company is a start-up so we don't have retirement contributions or a 401k. When it comes to retirement, I'm not too keen on it or looking forward to it to be honest. I'm in my very early 30's and just starting my career due to a lot of unfortunate life circumstances. I'm not married and I don't have kids, I don't want to buy a house until I'm a millionaire (Yes, that's part of the plan and the career I chose can definitely lead to it if I work hard enough).  
Should I look into private retirement or investing funds? I will probably have a large company job next year that will have a 401k contribution in their offer but I'd like to at least get the ground running on it. How does a Roth IRA affect AGI if I'm doing it as a personal and not through a company set-up?  

**Second key area:**  
My primary goals are-  
1) fix my financial profile and debt worthiness (I want to get to 650+ credit score and have at least one or two personal credit cards).  
2) save up for a cheap car like a Mazda Miata so I can save on transportation (the public transportation here is pretty bad and very sketchy, people have been shot walking home from the stations and people on bikes have been slammed by cars, telling me it's ""okay to just walk"" is like telling me it's okay to just die eventually) because I won't have to Uber or rely on a grocery store nearby that has overpriced goods. Plus I visit my girlfriend and she's 4.5 hours away so being able to go there on gas would save me a lot versus plane tickets.  
**Power Edit**: This might also affect your opinion on me getting a car but for a few years during high school and after, my shitty father forced me to learn auto mechanics. In my 20's I always had to fix a car I owned or a car I didn't own. I'm pretty solid with my wrench skills so maintenance costs and repair costs will always be subsidized by me being able to do most of the work on a weekend by myself.  
  
**Key Fixed Costs Facts** :  
I am currently living with a roommate. My rent is $650 with utilities included, but it's not a sustainable living condition. For one, I am not on his lease so it's more of a situation where I'm paying to rent the room. The other, and more crucial detail, is that his girlfriend is a sociopath and making me incredibly uncomfortable. He wants me to live there because it subsidizes his costs considerably (I'm basically paying 70% of his rent, or 55% of his total living costs, but I didn't have to buy furniture) but his girlfriend doesn't want me there because she has this vision of them living together alone with their pets (even though she's unemployed).  
I decided that moving out on my own would be a better option. I tried to find a roommate, but this city is rather sparse so while I have a good job, everyone I propositioned on Craigslist was either not responsive or had unreasonable demands. In fact, the only ""roommates"" I found, my rent would've actually gone up.  
I found a studio for $685 and when I get a car in the future, a parking spot will cost me $60 a month. However, as a sign-on bonus, they're giving me February and March rent free.  
During February and March, I want to capitalize on the savings but I'm not sure where to put the funds. Part of me thinks, just buy the car because it will instantly improve my personal safety and allow me to ""fix"" my transportation costs for the year, but I'd like advice on that.",finance,1453317641

3. Can I claim the american opportunity tax credit for myself if my parents have claimed it for four years prior? (I took awhile at community college to figure out what I wanted to do)
4. Correct me if I am wrong but this is the last eligible year for my parents to claim me as dependent because I will turn 24 in September.

personalfinance,Need help combining finances with my fiance,"Hi personalfinance,

I’m getting married this year, and we trying to figure out how to combine our finances. We both make a good living, but we are in some major debt due to education. My SO has dreams of buying a house in the next 3-5 years or so, but I’m not sure that’s really feasible given our situation. 

So, we are trying to figure out our financial plan for the next few years, keeping our longer term goals in mind. I was hoping you nice people could take a look and suggest some things we might not be thinking of. I’ve listed a lot of details below, but I’m happy to add more if you ask.

(Please keep in mind that we are not touching our savings. We are paying for a tiny wedding, and then the rest will become our emergency fund.)

Questions:

1. Once I pay off my 7.25% interest rate loan, I was thinking that $1000/month should go to his 4% loan. SO wants to start a down payment fund. Seems like the “smart” thing might be to feed that to retirement, but are we okay there?  
2. Same question for the $560 that is freed up from the Government loan repayment in 5/2017. 
3. Is there any hope of starting to save for a house in the next few years? Or do you recommend putting all energies into his big loan? Seems like we could get his big loan paid off in ~4 years if we roll our current payments to that loan once the smaller ones are paid off.

Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Pay down student loans or bank money to savings?,"Wife and I are having a baby in 6 months and as of today I have paid off our only credit card debt. It wasn't too out of control by comparison to some of the crazy stuff I read about, but it was something that needed to go away and something I've focused on paying down over the last year.

I'm trying to decide if I should now be taking the money I've been paying out to pay it down as much as I could afford to every 2-3 weeks, and banking it into our savings account to have liquid cash around OR trying to pay down my wife's remaining 13k in private student loan debt. 

A bit more background on the loans: Before anyone asks why private loans, she was forced into that situation because her father was self employed, never did his taxes on time, and therefore she was told that she did not qualify for federal student loans. She applied anyway and was denied at that time. We have been steadily paying them since 2007, putting more and more at them as of the last 2 years, and they have come down from about 40K to 13k now.

Last August, we were able to refinance her 2 loans through a work program that was launched in partnership with SoFi, taking them from a combined interest of 9.5% down to 3%, so this helps a lot.

personalfinance,Don't know my best plan of attack for the immediate to medium-term future.,"Hi all,

I'm looking for advice on my best approach to the next couple years of my life. Here is the relevant info I can give. 
 
I'm 30, and with all my expenses (rent, car insurance, travel, etc...), I'm pretty much breaking even and not putting anything into savings (except 5% into a 401k). I have some big expenses on the horizon, and want to figure out my best plan of attack.

I'm about to get engaged (like... in a month - whoa), which means buying a ring and a wedding on the horizon. After that, within a couple years, we're planning to buy a house. Before I took out my auto loan at the end of 2014, I had a 780 credit rating. It's now down to ~700-720 due to the loan and one (my only one ever) late payment on a credit card. I could have paid cash for the car if I had liquidated some holdings when I bought it, but chose to take a loan out to build more of a credit history (besides just credit cards) and because my stocks were performing well. I'd like to get that rating back up before we look at buying a house. Given the general ""consensus"" in the market of 2016 being somewhere from horrifying bear (2008 all over again) to ""what was all the fuss about,"" I'm trying to decide what my best financial move would be. 


* **Option 1 -** Stay the course. Keep paying off my loan making my $250-$300 payments per month, hold my investments.


* **Option 2 -** Liquidate some stock (MCD has had a great run over the past year) and realize the gains in case the market drops hard. Use that money to pay off the remainder (or most of) the car loan and hold some more for the wedding in the next year. Anticipate this will improve my credit rating for the future home purchase. Put the current monthly car payments into savings and invest once the market recovers.  

* **Option 3-** ????


**Assets**

Net: $68,000

* Cash - ~$13,000 in checking/savings 
* Investments - ~$55,000

     * $3,000 couple-year long speculative play in some small cap biotechs
     * $28,000 in equities (MCD and AAPL)
     * $24,000 in a tax-free mutual fund

**Liabilities**

* Auto Loan -  $10,900 (2.11% interest rate) - Originally $14,194. Regular payments are $250/mo, but I'm generally paying $300.

personalfinance,I'm midway through college with short-term steady income. How much to save and how much to put toward loans?,"I'm not sure of the best way to approach my finances in my current situation. I am 22 years old and currently in a mid-college transition period and am unsure of much I should be putting into emergency savings, putting into my student loans, or investing. All advice is appreciated!

**Background**


Last spring, I completed my 3rd year at university ""A"" and from June 2015 until March 2016 I have been working full-time for university ""A"" and not taking classes, while waiting to transfer to university ""B."" In March 2016 I will be transferring to university B and I will have 8 quarters until graduation for a computer science degree there. This is all set to go, all I have to do is register for classes at this point, once registration opens next month.

**Work**

I started off in June working as a Web Developer for the school making $16/hour. Now, since the beginning of January, I have effectively acquired two more positions of people who have left: Executive Assistant to the VP and a Program Assistant for a department under the VP's umbrella. The paperwork has been filled out and is awaiting processing for a raise to $18/hour. This will be retro-paid for January 1st, 2016-onward.

This is not the point of this post, but how do I ask for more money here? The former Executive Assistant told me she was making $23/hour and that was low for the position, since she was a temp worker. The former Program Assistant was making $20, ""because he had a degree"" (my boss's words.) I am quite literally doing both of their jobs, and my old one as web developer. I do not have time to finish everything in my days and am getting a backlog of work piling up--my boss tried to downplay this before I started and said that the EA position would be ""just sitting there answering the phone and being a presence at the front desk,"" but she doesn't know what she's talking about because its *her* boss that I'm the EA for. This is only a temporary arrangement; the VP says she will hire a long-term EA within 4-6 weeks. I'm just not sure how to approach it to say that I deserve higher pay for these 4-6 weeks, or if its even appropriate for me to request that.

**Current Finances (January '16 - March '16)**

* Income: $2560/month before taxes, $2031.20 after. (This is at $16 and will $2880/month before taxes when raise is finalized.)

* Savings account: ~$9,000.

* Rent: $0 (lucky situation with girlfriend's family and their condo.)

* Groceries: $0 (same lucky situation with girlfriend's family.)

* Gas: ~$50 to ~$200 per month depending on trips leaving the city.

* Misc personal spending, eating out, etc: ~$200/month.

* Student Loans:


 | Loan | Interest | 
|----|--------|
 | $3134 | 3.40% | 
 | $3500 | 3.86% | 
 | $2000 | 3.86% | 
 | $5500 | 4.66% | 
 | $893 | 4.66% | 
Total: $15,027 | $284.33 |
Grand total: $15,311.33


Summary: 

Income: ~$2000/month. 

Expenses: Nothing mandatory that is significant.

Debts: $15k federal student loans.

**Future Finances**

After March, I will be moving to the city of university B with my girlfriend and beginning the first of 8 quarters there. My financial situation will change drastically:

* Income: Student loans (not sure of the exact amount but in the past I have always received enough to not need to work during school)

* Rent: $400 - $800 / month. (this would be my half after being split with girlfriend, relatively low cost of living city but have not locked into a place yet.)

* Groceries: $300/month?

* Tuition: ~2500 / quarter (eight quarters to completion)

Summary: No income other than loans; no longer receiving ""free"" rent and groceries.

**Conclusion**

So right now I am in a good place and able to save nearly my entire paycheck. By the end of my time working here, if I saved everything I could, I could roughly have $15k in my bank. How much of that should I use toward my $15k student loans? How much of it should I use toward my future loans or save for rent in the new city?

personalfinance,401k to 401k while still employed?,"TL;DR: Is it possible to transfer contents from a current employers 401k (while contributing) to an old 401k? (Is this considered an in-service withdrawal?)

I'm a federal employee who is vested in the TSP and will potentially be leaving federal service soon. The TSP has the lowest rates in the industry and I plan on keeping it even though I can no longer contribute directly.

I contacted the TSP and they mentioned that ""The TSP can accept transfers at any time and without limit as long as your account balance is greater than $0.""

I was wondering if it is possible to get a new job, contribute to the new jobs 401k, and then periodically (monthly/yearly) roll it over to the TSP?

personalfinance,critique my budget for kamikaze massive student loan payback?,"I posted yesterday about my wakeup call over my husband's massive student loan debt. 150K in the hole at 7%, all federal student loans. 


 I created a very basic budget based on our current situation to figure out the minimum we need to get by. I tried to overestimate, and these numbers are an accurate gauge of our current bills and expenses. This is based on two major changes: first is freeing up cash in certain places, most importantly his 4K in credit card debt which we plan to wipe out in the next weeks. Second is me getting a better job that pays more. To meet this budget I would need a $6 an hour raise if he were to make no changes to his income. I do think this is achievable for me, and I am pushing for us to move back to our hometown. I'm also assuming that if we get into the right jobs, do not add new debt on credit cards, and get any raises, gifts or bonuses, then we should be in an even better position. 


Side note: Back in my hometown, I think I can make a lot more, maybe even double what I do now by swallowing my pride and hitting up family connections. Furthermore, his mom wants to give us up to 10K saved from an old home sale to help us move home (we are currently thousands of miles away from her). Living expenses are much lower, and we'd be surrounded by family for support emotional support, and some old friends. Cookouts with my sister &amp; bro in law or my oldest friends are cheaper than nights out in a downtown bar. I argue that overall quality of life is going to be better while we go through this really intense blitz to pay this off. However, he does not want to move AT ALL. We live in a liberal metropolitan area now and he does not want to go back to the conservative smaller city we came from. But he got us into this mess and I think is lucky I'm here with no debt creating budgets reading his contracts and doing all this work to help him get out of it. I don't think I'm being too harsh in squelching his dreams right now but would welcome constructive criticism of my approach.


Anyway I would also love for a second set of eyes on this budget, and thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time.


Important note: we have about 1000 total in cash savings and a mutual fund with @48K in it that belongs to me from pre-marriage. No I am not using it to pay his debt off if we can pay it off monthly, its the only asset I have. I also have an IRA with 4K in it. I do not plan to save much during this payoff blitz but we do have this fund for emergency money, and I do plan to start thinking aggressively about retirement when it's over.

Update 1/24: not that anyone is dying for an update, but just for the record. I was panicking this week, full on, but over the past few days we talked a lot and worked out a more realistic plan. This is a lot of debt but it's comparable to a modest house, we can handle it with a smart budget. Prob not gonna pay it off in 10 years, but we are aiming for less than the 25 year plan gives us and starting with minimum payments of just over $1000 a month. My husband already got a $5 raise by asking his boss, and we have every penny accounted for right now. Don't even have to use my mutual fund to pay off the credit cards, my husband stepped up and sold a few belongings to cover it. I guess the takeaway for anyone who reads this is not to obsess or panic. Shit happens you deal with it. We could be a lot worse off than we are. Thanks everyone who took time to give advice. Once we have lived a couple months on our new budget I may post it to hopefully give other people with massive debt an idea of how what we are doing is working for us.",finance,1453339524

I signed up for Credit Karma and have tried all of their refinancing offers and been denied by each. My debt to income ratio apparently sucks too hard for me to qualify, even with a parent to cosign. My credit isn't terrible, 739 Transunion and 742 Equifax.

personalfinance,Account showed up in collections? Advice please!,"So to make a long story short I made a myriad of financial mistakes when I was younger and instead of fixing my problems I hid from them and wallowed in depression. Over the course of the past 3 years I have fixed almost all of these mistakes and taken care of my depression through therapy and am trying to get on track to have a healthy and successful financial future. 

So about a month ago I get an alert from Credit Karma of a new debt reporting on my credit and my score (which isn't great to begin with) takes a huge hit. I immediately go about checking my credit report. I see a new account labeled as being in collections for about 6k. I freak out for a little and then calm down and begin to investigate. 

So it's seems that this account is collections for a private loan I took out when I was in college. Now, I did not realize I had taken out a private loan, all my other loans were through the federal government, but I was drunk a lot at that time in life as a depressed 22 year old and it's fully possible I went with a private lender to cover some of my school expenses. I look further at this account. It was already on my credit report as a delinquent account from Education Finance Partners. I looked them up and all I could find was that they apparently filed Chapter 7 at some point in the 2000s. This new collection account seems to be that same loan. However, the old loan was reported delinquent in 2008. It's been over 7 years. How can this new company report me as delinquent as of 2015? Any advice on what to do about this? 

TL;DR Old loan last reported in 2008 is showing up as a fresh collection account with a new agency. Are they re-aging the account? Is this legal?",finance,1453381948
personalfinance,"(CAN) In monthly compounded interest, is the amount of interest the same regardless of the number of days in the month?","I'm trying to help someone out with a question they have on a 2nd mortgage of theirs.

It is a $50,000 loan at 8.99% compounded monthly, on a 360 month am period.  In Excel, -PMT(.0899/12,360,50000) = $401.95 yields their monthly payment.  You can create an amortization schedule with this that proves it's consistent with the monthly interest being 0.0899/12 * Balance, every month, regardless of the number of days.

I've spoken with the bank, and they said that they convert the interest rate into the daily equivalent, and then charge monthly interest based on the number of days in the month.  E.g. for January, they charge (((1+0.0899/12)^(12/365))^31 - 1) * Balance in interest.

I've created a similar amortization schedule using this logic, and I'm seeing that after 360 months, they will still have a $352.56 balance.

I realize it's not a lot, but it's still something, and I'd imagine that this ""nickel and diming"" would add up.

Is the bank doing this properly, or should the monthly interest be the same regardless of the number of days, so that the am period is exactly what they say it is.",finance,1453385497

personalfinance,Should I go with a 15-year mortgage? Help appreciated!,"Hi r/personalfinance, I could really use some mortgage advice. 

I'm 22 years old and making 2.8k/mth. My monthly expenses are $1,750. including HOA and property tax, but not including savings. I get a bonus of 3% and a pay raise of 2% every year (+/- .5%). 

My parents bought me a condo at 165k a few months ago and financed it, with the agreement that I would refinance under my own name soon (they did this because they really wanted me to purchase a place vs rent one). 

Now, the time has come to refinance, but I'm not sure what option to choose.. Here are the options:
  
1) 15 year fixed, 3% interest - $854/mth (153k total payment, including 30k interest)  
2) 30 year fixed, 3.75% interest - $573/mth (206k total, inc 83k interest)  
3) 5 yr ARM, 2.875% interest - $513/mth   
4) 7 yr ARM, 3.25% interest - $538/mth  
 
I have 4k in savings. Closing costs are 3k. I plan to live in my condo for 6-8 years and then upgrade. Afterwards, I want to rent it out or sell, depending on the market. I live in Seattle, WA. 

On to the dilemma: I can make the 15-year payments, but I'd have very little wiggle room, and with the 3k closing costs my savings would be wiped out. My boyfriend (who is living with me) is looking for a part-time job to help out but I don't want to 100% count on that. 

The 5-year ARM looks attractive but I'm afraid with the rising interest rates, by the time I refinance in 5 years the rates will be up to 4-5% (plus, paying 3k everytime I want to refinance is not appealing).

In addition, I can't stand the thought of paying $80k in interest for a 30-year loan, it seems ridiculous..

personalfinance,(Europe) Should I pay back my mortgage ASAP or invest \ save?,"Hi Reddit!
Here’s the story. 
I bought apartment in my home country, after that I decided to move abroad. Now I have to pay installments on my mortgage + fees and rent a place where I live. 
I’ve got 120,000 USD in mortgage and currently I am able to save 3,500 USD per month. I took mortgage when I was working in a bank, so the interest rate I was offered in quite good (1.4% on top of interbank interest rate, so not bad). Theoretically I would need 3 years to pay back my mortgage although I reckon that if I really wanted I could have done it faster (2 – 2.5 year). The question is, should I do it?
I’ve made a list of arguments for and against paying back my mortgage earlier and still I don’t know what to do. Hope you can help me.

Against:

1.	I have good skills that are demanded in the labor market, so even when there is economic downturn I should make decent living

2.	I could use this money for travelling

3.	I could invest then to offset interest rate

4.	The mortgage is very good (if you can say that any mortgage is “good”): low margin, no extra fees at all

5.	I could use this money to buy second apartment and let it to offset mortgage installments (then in 3 years I could own two apartments instead of “only” one fully paid back)

6.	It’s always nice to have some extra cash for “stupid” expenditures like a bit better car or anything

7.	Installment is only 10% of my monthly income, 17% of my monthly savings (so in practice I could pay back 5 extra installments each month and still save something)

8.	Currently I am hanging between three countries, I work in country A, live in country B and have mortgage in country C. So if I pay mortgage back and would want to buy another property I have to pay in cash, there is no bank that will give me mortgage for property located in another country, and a bank from country where I would like to buy property won’t give it to me because I am not employed there. 

For:

1.	I am soon getting married, we might need to think of kids in 3 years’ time, it would be good to start new life without debt

2.	Debt is not cool, its a financial burden...

3.	I am paid in different currency than my mortgage is,  you never know what will happen with currency rate

4.	I am not really sure what I want to do with that saved up money, I don’t know if I want to buy another property and let it, so not a lot of alternative options there

5.	Currently I make decent money, you never know what will happen in few months

You can see that there are more arguments against, but still I don’t know if they should be weighted equally. Debt generally speaking, in my opinion, is not good thing to have. However… I can afford it! So why should I not live my life to the fullest and enjoy it? I don’t know Reddit, I could use some advice.",finance,1453401660

It was simple enough; I started in october, so buy mid-october i was informed that i should edit my w-4 online through the costco website. I Learned that because i was to be making such little money that i could file tax exempt, so i did. At that point in time i had only recieved one or two paychecks for a total federal withholding of $101. I will be receiving all of that back because of my exempt-status.

My wife just graduated, and will be entering repayment in March.  For the majority of 2015, she was an unemployed student, so her income this year is probably a maximum of about $20k.  I switched jobs this year, and collectively made $58,000  (about $8k less than last year because I was out of work for over a month).  In 2016, we will each earn $71,000 ($142,000 collectively).  She works for a non-profit and is eligible for 10-year loan forgiveness.  I am not.


We will both be on an income-driven repayment plan. (because who can afford $4-5k a month in loan payments????)

 

We want to know if we should be filing taxes separately or jointly both this year and moving forward.  My thoughts are that if we file separately now, her income-based payment would be $0 (based on her ~$20K earnings this year), and my income-driven payment would go down (based on earning about $8k less this year).  Am I way off base here?

I currently attend college in the US and have a full ride scholarship, which covers my room &amp; board, meal plan, books, and tuition. After all these expenses, I generally have a bit of money left over to use on meals off campus or to save.

This year, while filing for taxes, I've hit an interesting issue. Scholarships are divided into taxable and non-taxable money. Only the amount of my scholarship used for tuition is tax-free (~$15,000 for 2015). The rest of the money (~13,000) is taxable.
So, a good chunk of that money has been spent on room, board, books, and other college-related materials, but I still owe taxes on it. I have exact numbers calculated for amount spent on room/board, amount spent on books/required materials (but NOT at the university itself, at bookstores, etc.).

I was planning on filing as a dependent of my parents this year. However, when using TurboTax to file, I have to fill out ""Tax for certain children who have unearned income"", FORM 8615. Because the ~13K is taxed at my parent's bracket using this form, TurboTax reports that I'm going to owe over $5000 in state and federal taxes on my scholarship.

I also have a part time job at which I made ~$8000. I asked them to withhold extra (~$300), so everything's fine on that end.

I did some research on the Kiddie tax, and I'm under the impression that it only applies to dividends and investment income (it was created to prevent parents from using their kids to avoid paying taxes).

personalfinance,Unexpected refund from a closed Amazon Store Card,"Hey folks!  I keep an eye on /r/personalfinance regularly. Though don't often post, I do have an interesting situation I'd like feedback on.  

I've been on a crusade for the past four years to pay off about $22k in credit card debt.  And I've been making excellent headway.  I paid off and closed my Amazon.com store card (serviced through synchrony) in March 2015. I received a tiny check for a slight credit balance (a couple of bucks) which zeroed out my account. 

Haven't heard a peep from them until today, when I got an email saying a payment had been posted on 1/20/16.  I WTF'd over to my account online to check it out, and sure enough, I see I have a credit balance of $352 and change.  The transaction was listed as ""*INTEREST CHARGE* PURCHASES REFUND""

I called up customer service and spoke with a very friendly outsourced CSR.  I asked him about the refund and he happily told me--and this is paraphrasing as closely as I can remember--

&gt;""Yes sir, ah, you see, we were going through all of our records with our computer and some customers were over-charged on their interest rate, so we have issued a credit to the affected accounts, would you like us to send you a refund check?


I said ""sure"" and so they're sending me a refund check in the next 7-10 days.  

I want to be excited for this, because it means between this and my tax refund I should be able to finish paying off the rest of my credit cards by the end of February.  

But should I be concerned at all?  I sort of worry it's an accounting error of some sort and they'll just bill me for the erroneous disbursement of the credit balance.  

Would I be wise to just sit on the money for the meantime, and if so, how long should I wait? Has this happened to anybody else recently?  Thankfully this is rather low-stakes, if I had to pay it back unexpectedly I probably could but it would hurt a little since my focus has been on paying off credit cards and not building a savings cushion (read:  i'm still living paycheck-to-paycheck for about the next month or two).  But the whole situation seemed a little curious.  I'd feel more comfortable if it turned out to be a widespread thing that other people are experiencing, too, though a google search turned up nothing.

personalfinance,Missing money or paychecks,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

M18 here, and I just received my W2 today. I had one job through the end of October, and something is amiss. Specifically, my bank  account shows I received $2031.19 (USD) from the business in checks (We did not do direct deposit). However, my W2 reports the following:

Gross pay: 3299.75

Social Security: 204.58

State income tax withheld: 93.95

Fed. income tax withheld: 175.56

Medicare withheld: 47.85

If we take the 3299.75 and subtract the taxes and the  2031.19 I  have in my bank account, There is a $746.62 deficit.

It is  very possible that I did not deposit some checks or did not receive others. Is there something I am missing here, or can I request the  $746.62 from my former employer?

Thank you all in advance, I'll try  to monitor this regularly through tonight and tomorrow.

Update: Found my last pay check stub for 2015, and it reports Year To Date earnings to be the $3299.75 as in the W2.",finance,1453420717
personalfinance,Talk me down from the ledge.,"I'm a 29 year old recent finance graduate and at risk of sounding melodramatic, I feel as if this is the darkest time I have ever been through in my life. I have worked so many different dead end jobs (dishwasher, roofer, waiter, general construction, cashier, manufacturing, IT support, farming, industrial-scale printing, and probably more that escape me) before getting fed up and deciding to go off to school to give myself an opportunity for something better. 

My big takeaway from these jobs was that I hated workplace politics, and that I wanted to be more than a punchclock monkey and work either for or under people who I neither respect nor admire. This may make me sound entitled, and that's fine. I just felt that I was more ambitious than to end up as a 40+ year old manager or assistant manager of walmart, like the bosses I had at my first job. I don't want to - like many of the superiors I have worked for - advance only by being the dumb fuck that sticks it out for longer than anyone else at a shit job. I could see the defeat and resignation in their eyes, that they know that that is what their lot in life will amount to. At 16 years old I told my coworker if that was me in 20 years, I'd rather kill myself. This theme was apparent at many of my other dead end gigs as well.

So I went and finished a business and entrepreneurship college program while taking courses to get my real estate license. The idea of helping people through one of the most important financial decisions of their lives appealed to me, as did the opportunity for a limitless earning potential and being an entrepreneur. As a 'backup plan' (given that something like 9/10 realtors ultimately fold on the career) I stuck around and bridged into university, completing a commerce degree majoring in finance. My rationale was that it would provide a 'safe' job to fall back on in case real estate didn't work out.

My problem now(or at least one of them depending on what you think of me at this point) is that I'm 29 years old with almost zero work experience in finance(although I've been through a small library of books on the subject out of pure personal interest), nor even a desire to pursue the field. I have been doing real estate since graduation but it has been punctuated over the last year with working menial jobs to make ends meet.

I also have 11k in credit card debt, 25k in student lines of credit, and 38k in student loans. To me, it looks as if I'm well and truly fucked at this point. The thought of looking for an entry level, soul crushing job at a bank and putting in *years* before I make enough to even *begin* to claw out of poverty has me so despondent I can barely function. The part that makes me want to cry is that I will almost certainly throw away years some of the best years of my life doing something I will almost certainly hate, just to get back to *zero*. 

My plan at the moment is to string together what little dignity I can salvage and try to do some business in real estate for the next couple of months(which has been ridiculously difficult when I have trouble filling my gas tank and feeding myself each week) and if things don't work out, I'll have to give it up.

My question is, what would you do? What do you think I should do? I have thought about claiming bankruptcy to try and salvage a start at a new life.

Please offer me any fatherly or friendly advice - be critical and be tough if you have to. Please try to be helpful, I'm looking for truly constructive suggestions that are coming from a good place, even if what I need to hear will be painful.",finance,1453420965

The refi would raise the mortage to $390k and move us from FHA (with insurange) to a conventional at 4% (up from 3.75% with FHA).

•Laptop (not a concern currently as I bought a business power laptop for this purpose)

his credit score is around 400 and hers is sub 600. Disability income is around $1200 a month. She makes 50k a year before taxes and im not sure of her debts. He has 25k in debts in medical and others, plus a vehicle debt, 400$ a mo. payment around 20k on that.

Now then...

I have 27 hours left on my BA, taking 6 hours right now and will have those done first week of March. My degree is basically worthless, Criminal Justice Admin. but it is a degree and I hope will put me in a position for promotion when time requirements are met at my current job. I have 4 years in as a LEO, worked municipal, then university, now back at municipal. Was told I would get a short version of the FTO, field training program, as I have had a commission with the city when I worked at the uni. and worked with just about all of the city officers on several hot/big calls for service. Once out of FTO I will have a take home vehicle so that will save a lot on my own vehicle. I need 5 years at a single agency or two at my current one to qualify for the first promotion; senior officer. That would mean a pay increase but to what I do not know yet. 

Reading the city policy I should be up for a pay raise next fall, 5 years or more experience, but I don't know what it would be. 

My plan, although still in the early stages is a follows...

* 2015 tax return right now is looking like I will get some $3k back from feds and a few bucks, under $100, from state. I have two ideas on what to do with that money. 

* After FTO I will be allowed to work grants/extra duty such as security during holidays where businesses are closed, checking IDs at frat parties. Our department gets a lot of grants for DWI enforcement and DWI checkpoints. I have personal objections for checkpoints so I may not sign up for those but they have been effective in our area on catching DWIs. 

I am debating on the two ideas I have for the possible $3k. One is throw it all at my credit card, ask for a lower interest rate and rewards. The second idea is a business idea. 

I like guns. I own guns. I like to shoot my guns at matches and just go to the range and put holes in paper/make metal go ding. Checking on a protective finish website, [Cerakote Coatings](http://www.cerakoteguncoatings.com/), there are no trained/authorized people with in 100 miles of me. Granted there might be some that are not trained, but the website only lists those that have been to the training. The training costs $1500, plus hotel. After that they add you to the website, refer people to you that call/visit their website. I could take half of the $3k, get certified, and spend the rest on starting up. Only place I have planned so far to do it at is my garage. I would also need to get licensed by the BATFE as a gunsmith, $200 fee. I don't think I could pay all of the fees and business licensing fees with the $1500 but it would be a start. 

My only concern is going into business for myself. I wouldn't make it full time, unless it just really took off and I was making good money, anything above $50k where I live you are doing very well, cost of living is cheap here. But I would like to use it to help me pay off my credit card and my student loan. My student loan scares me. I would rather clear a 1million square foot warehouse alone with no backup than the idea of paying on them for 10 years and possibly still not have them paid off. 

I have done a lot of research, forums and YouTube, about this Cerakote. I read where one person got an extra 190 extra customers a year after he was certified just from referrals by the company. It looks fairly easy, clean off parts, spray, bake, send back to customer. Only hard parts are when designs start coming into play like camo patterns. 

I estimate an extra net income of $500 a month if I only do a couple coatings a month on my days off/after work. I feel that I can make my prices competitive because I am not making it my primary method of income. My concern is not having enough room in my house to do it all.

Undergrad Sophomore here trying to make some major life decisions. I'm choosing between pursuing a career in medicine and CS; medicine is more of a passion to me (it has lessened a bit, so I'm considering CS too), but I enjoy CS as well. I can see myself having a career in CS, but I would probably get bored down the line, especially as I move into middle management. That said, I could see myself offsetting that by investing my money wisely and starting some semi-passive forms of income that excite me; a small rock climbing gym, for example.

I'm wondering how much of a $180K total compensation package (50K of that is RSU, ~100-120K salary, rest bonus) can I multiply that into? I don't know exact expenses, but I'd be living in Seattle, no house with no kids/possibly a SO. Rent 1.5K/mo. How much on an average stock market return rate could I expect? I'll be graduating with minimal debt and no interest rates as its me paying my parents.

I'm really sorry if this question is incredibly ignorant. I did some research online and it seemed to indicate that 12% return rate is reliable in an upward swinging economy, and others said 8. I really have no knowledge of personal finance, which is something I'm hoping to improve on in the coming years as I move into a moneymaking position.

I graduated from the University of Minnesota in 2010 with $44,000 worth of student loans.  I regret the way I went about my financial aid and I should have worked harder to actually pay my tuition rather than just taking out loans.  I did work my last two years of college but most of this money just went to daily spending and rent my final year.  I graduated with a double major in English and Sociology and I wasn't sure what I wanted to do except I wanted to work in social work or non-profit work.  

I joined the local AmeriCorps program and served for two years at United Way.  I learned some great skills and made connections in my community and got some professional experience.  My federal loans were on forbearance during this time and I paid the minimum on my state/private loan.  When I finished two years of service I got an educational award of about $10,000.  I used this to make payments on my loans after my service ended.  That has all been used up.  

I then became an English teacher in South Korea in 2012 where I make about $22,000 a year and don't pay rent.  It has been much harder to save than I anticipated because I always have a paycheck each month and spend a lot on travel, social activities and shopping and I have not had a budget at all.  However I have been putting a lot of money towards my loans and I got another $10,000 paid off in 2015. The other $4000 I have paid off comes from some other payments I made in 2013 and 2014 when the educational award was running out.  

I guess now that my loans are finally less than $20,000 I feel like I can start saving now.  Right now I have $6000 in the bank and it feels really good.  But my first instinct is to send home $3000 and pay of more of the loans.

Bitcoin,Apple approves bitcoin geocaching game!,"Apple have approved our bitcoin geocaching game ""takara"" on the iOS app store.
[Download](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/takara/id1009304559?ls=1&amp;mt=8)

""takara"" means treasure in Japanese and the game lets users drop bitcoin in the form of jewels anywhere in the world. However users must go a location takara has been dropped to pick it up.

**Users can added a message and question to the bitcoin they drop.**

**Advertisers can also attach a custom banner and link to their site.**

**The app also has a built in secure wallet.**

We hope that businesses will drop bitcoin at their store to attract customers!

Checkout our demo video here [Watch Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGlhoFg8qHo)



Although the app is live dropping bitcoin is currently **disabled** for a few days, this is because we want to invite users to try and spoof their location and collect some takara we have dropped in **Antarctica**

Some of you may know that geocaching games are subject to ""location spoofing"". We have special algorithms to detect spoofing however for the user's sake we would like to do the due diligence and make sure the app is as secure as possible.

When dropping takara users are told to add a question that only somebody at the location would know, and that if they don't they run the risk of their takara being collected via spoofed location.

If all goes well dropping takara will be live in a few days, if not a new app with a slightly different model will be released.

Please report any bugs or security holes to admin@mandelduck.com and follow our [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/mandelduck) or twitter @mandelduck for updates.

Here is also some security info


**A lot of people have been asking about the security of the app, do I store private keys? what about location spoofing? etc. Here are my answers**

I have special algorithms to detect location spoofing however I admit this is not 100% spoof proof. The app warns the user of this when they drop bitcoin and tells them to add a question and answer that only somebody at the location would know.

The private key of the bitcoin is then stored on our server, the private key is encrypted with the answer to the question. We do not store the answer, meaning that even we can't decrypt the private key without getting the answer right. This also means if the server is compromised the private keys are encrypted.

The app has a secure wallet built in and signs all it's transaction on the app meaning the private key of the users wallet never leaves.

The private key of the users wallet is stored in the iOS keychain.

Having said this I will be honest and I don't promise 100% security, the app is a game not a secure exchange.",cryptocurrency,1453474595
personalfinance,Significant difference between MFJ and MFS ($2k+),"tl;dr **My tax liability increases by $2k if i file MFJ versus MFS.**

Couple years ago my salary bumped above the 55k threshold and has increased even more this year.  My wife makes around 30k. We are very generous with charities/church and deduct usually between 15-20k.  Because of this (and preferring to invest early instead of waiting for a tax return) I claim 4-5 deductions.

I've run our numbers every year on HRB and TaxSlayer to see what I should be getting back from an accountant.  Last year I was surprised to see that we'd actually owe Federal when filing MFJ (~1k).  When I ran everything as MFS we made a little bit, even with extra tax prep fees.

This year I'm looking at the same scenario: started as MFJ, income - deductions and I'm looking at a $2k Federal liability but breaking even with MFS.  

According to what I've read, MFJ *should* give significant benefits but in my situation doesn't apply.  [Post credit](http://taxfoundation.org/sites/taxfoundation.org/files/docs/ff352_chart_small.png).

personalfinance,Where Should I Keep My Six Months of Expenses?,"So in this tread, you guys recommend that people keep at least 6 months of expenses on hand for the unforeseen.  Six months of expenses for me is around the $75,000.00 mark or more.  I generally only keep about $5,000.00 in cash in my bank account because of how pathetically low the interest rates are.  The rest of my money goes into stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.

The question I have is - obviously it takes a few days to free up invested money.  But seems silly for me to keep 75,000 in a bank account. Or should I keep 75,000 in a bank account?  But then again, investments go up and down so that 75k might be 50k if I need it or 100k...

I've been lurking this sub for awhile now. You guys have taught me everything from budgeting to tax withholdings to negotiating salary. Thanks.

But now I need more personalized help and I have no idea where to go from here. I'm 29 years old. I have a Masters degree in Industrial/Organizational Psychology.

* 700ish credit score

* Graduated from a school with low popularity. No points will be gained here.

* I owe $32,810.58 in undergraduate loans. The average interest rate is 5.95%, but they range from 2.32% - 6.8%.

* I owe $86,102 in graduate school loans. The average interest rate is 6.3%, but they range from 5.4% - 7.2%.

* All federal.

* My salary is ~$50K right now. I'm fresh out of school and looking for a better salary, but my forbearance period is coming to an end, so I'm looking for my next move.

* I believe I'm going to apply for the IBR option.

Do I refinance? Consolidate into one huge loan? 

If I do consolidate, will I lose options such as IBR if I consolidate with a private lender such as Sofi? Should I keep my loans federal and consolidate with them?

personalfinance,Need a little general guidance,"Hi All,

Hit the big 30 last July and have started to realize that I need to better educate and handle my finances, and I thought this would be the best place to go. I will try to categorize everything as best I can.

About me:

- 30 yr. old male, currently living in CT, employed full time, occasional consulting work
- Annual gross pay between $65k - $75k depending on consulting
- Living situation is currently living at home, looking to buy a house in the next year with my girlfriend
- Vehicle: Recently purchased Pre-owned2014 Chevy Impala with 16k miles, 18 months free oil changes, warranty to 42.5K miles or 3 years, and I have the remainder of the factory 5 year/100k powertrain warranty. I drive a lot as part of my job and I need a solid reliable vehicle, which is why I purchased the car I did.

Financial Situation:

- Total in the bank right now: Just under $12k
- Stock portfolio: Exists, not terribly happy with it ($5k total cost, current face value is about $3.5K, does pay about $45/month in dividends) currently with sharebuilder, I'm overall OK with them, but I'm apparently an idiot with stocks.
- Credit card debt: ~$5.5k (recent, working on it). Interest rate is 10.79%, second card has a 0 balance every month, but I pay all of my bills and do all my purchases on that card (gas, cigarettes, etc.) for rewards purcahses (it's an Amazon visa by Chase)
- Car loan remaining: $17.5k
- Current Retirement: I am enrolled and partially vested in a pension plan for a school district, but that's about it right now. I had planned on trying to use my stock portfolio to bolster that, but I'm an idiot with stocks apparently.

Current expenses:

- Rent is $400/month
- Car payment is $276/month minimum, I typically pay $300 even
- Cell phone is $225, split with my dad, my end is actually only about $80/month. I pay the bill, he gives me cash
- Credit card I am currently paying between $250-$500/month at the card with the balance hanging on it

Upcoming Expenses:

 - This June the girlfriend hit's 30 this year, and I need to set aside for that. Between surprise party and gift, I am expecting about $2000 (that's high, intentionally)
 - On that same note, a wedding is going to be in the cards in the next 4-5 years or less (including the ring)
 - Planning on buying a house within the next 12 months
 - 1 business trip currently being planned for late Feb./Early March, no vacations this year, estimated cost is about $1k

Savings (per paycheck which is bi-weekly):

- $25 per paycheck into general savings account with my credit union, who I'm very happy with
- $75 into house savings
- $75 into company savings (short version, game company start up, 3 guys, low budget, first title should be released this year)
- $25 into misc. savings
- $50 into stock savings
- $25 into vehicle maintenance (which is really car taxes at this point)
- $50 pre-tax to my HSA

Tax situation:

- As a fairly young guy with almost no deductions and 2 years running have fairly significant 1099 income, I get hit pretty hard. I am filed as single and 0 with no additional deductions. I will be changing that before my next pay check.

My questions:

- Retirement is a big one. I have the option to do a 403B through my job, or should I go for an IRA? I would prefer to stay with Capital one 360 for convenience, any reason I shouldn't?
- Buying a house. Honestly scares the crap out of me financially speaking. That said, in talking with the girlfriend, our budget is $175K, which given our area, is on the low side, but I'm handy, and I have the tools and the talent to do what I need to do (read: fixer uppers do not scare me, within reason). We currently have about $12.5K saved for a down payment between us (I have $11K of that). I am considering setting up $5k into a 6 month CD to try and get a little better return, knowing I need to keep $5K+ on hand for expenses, emergency funds, my tax bill, etc. Thoughts?
- Emergency fund. I know I need one, and right now it's rolled into my house savings. How much did you keep on hand when you bought your first home? I want to keep $2K at a minimum on hand, but if that $2K is the difference between PMI and no PMI, I think it's worth it to drain it. Am I wrong? My credit union said they would give me a mortgage with 10% down and no PMI
- You're probably going to read this and say that I have a large amount of disposable income, and I do. Right now the bulk of it is being paid to the credit card.
- Overall, what kind of shape do you think I am in financially?
- Is there anything else I should be doing?

Thanks again, I know there's a lot going on here.

tl;dr - Thanks for stopping by, I appreciate it!",finance,1453481050

I am stupid. Please bear with me. I am using turbo tax to file. I know this sub generally dislikes turbotax, but it's what I'll be using for this. Next year, I'll switch!

personalfinance,"It's my first year filing taxes, and my mom is demanding I let her claim me because (she says) I'll receive a bigger refund. She's untrustworthy and I don't know if that's true or not.","Sorry in advance if this is tangential.

This is my first year working full-time, and I am 21 years old. I've been working since August and I live at home and pay my phone bill, student loans, food, transportation, etc, but not rent. This is also my first year filing taxes, so I am not very familiar with all the different ways of filing and what affects the amount you get back.

I received my W2 in the mail and with the help of my friend, starting filing my taxes online. I got to the question ""can anyone else claim you"" and ""will anyone else claim you"", and I called my mom to ask her if she had already filed for hers and claimed me. She immediately got upset and told me not to file myself because if she claims me I'll receive more money. My sister and brother in law told me not to give in to her because she was planning on using this year's refund to go on vacation to our country in the Caribbean. 

Before I go on, I feel like I should give some backstory as to why I'm so hesitant to believe my mom about what she's saying about taxes. My mom gets thousands of dollars back in refunds (somewhere close to 10k) because we are low-income, and she claims me and my two siblings. She goes to some shady woman who is a tax preparer who is known for ""scamming"" to ensure people get as much money back as possible. Everyone who goes to her gets at LEAST $6,000 back in tax refunds. People here also claim random children who are not related to them or ""sell"" their children's information to people who want to get more money on their tax return. Obviously, tax time is a big deal, since it's the first time all year where most low-income people here can afford to splurge on things. Where I live (the Bronx), tax time is like a second Christmas, and most people will lie so they get a bigger refund. The norm is that parents will give their kids hundreds of dollars or buy them something they've wanted for a while. However, she has never given us money, she usually spends the money on clothes, shoes, and trips for herself. 

Anyway, she asked me how much I was estimated to get and I told her what it was, around $600, and she scoffed and said that she could get more money for me if I let her claim me. She said that $600 is nothing and that she'll take me to the woman she goes to. I kept saying I don't understand how that would even be true and she just started repeating, ""I'll give you the $600. I'll give it to you. I'll give you the $600"" when I kept asking her how that would work. I'm not sure if she doesn't really understand it herself and this is just a lie that her tax preparer told her, or if she just wants to get money from claiming me and then give me the smaller amount that I would get by filing on my own, which I don't think is fair. I'm moving out in a few months and I haven't ever really felt like an adult because my mom insists on handling all this kind of stuff for me, and I just want to do something on my own and for myself. I'm worried that she was planning on using what she gets from me towards her vacation, and my phone call to her caught her off-guard. 

She's trying to frame this as if I MYSELF, PERSONALLY, would receive more money by letting her claim me, but I suspect that she means SHE will receive more money for letting her claim me and that by doing her that favor she'll give me what I was going to get back anyway. 

I just don't want to be involved in some kind of scam and I also don't want to be used as a way to fund someone's vacation. 

Do you guys know if there is actually a way for me to receive a bigger refund check by letting her claim me or is she just bullshitting me?

EDIT: About the fact that I don't pay rent: I give my mom $100 a month which is about half of our rent, but I never told her it was specifically for rent, it's money she can use if she needs help with light bill/cable bill, etc since I use those things too.

TL;DR my mom says that if she claims me on her taxes I'll get a bigger refund but this sounds like a lie and I don't trust her with money.",finance,1453516662
personalfinance,"Better paying jobs, now looking for how to best pay off debts","Hi all - would love some input on a plan of action to pay off debt and get some savings put away. We’ve been living mostly paycheck to paycheck up until the beginning of last month. I lost my job in Feb. ’14 and was able to get PT work that July with 18 hours, at about half what I was making before. I was bumped up to 30 hours in January 2015 with a very small pay increase, but it still wasn’t much. I was offered a new job in November with a start date of Dec. 1 making 50k/year and took it without hesitation. My husband had started working at his new job in August with a base of 45k, so currently we’re at 95k before taxes. After taxes, insurance, 401k, etc etc, take home will be around $6000

We have A LOT of credit cards, and a lot of cc debt. A majority of them had been paid off, but then when I was out of work and couldn’t find FT work everything started to go wrong and we depleted what little savings we had. There were two trips across the country – one for a funeral and the other for a wedding (both immediate family so not something we could avoid), our car started having issues right after we paid it off (of course!), and we recently had to put almost 2k of work and repairs into it – but it should be good for another year or so. Our dog just had a cyst burst that needed to be surgically removed, which turned out to be cancerous. So after x-rays and ultrasounds to make sure it hadn’t spread, that ended up being about 2k overall as well. All on credit cards. His student loans had been in deferment for the past year, and we have that to start paying back as well, but now that we finally have some more money coming in, this is all manageable, but I’m not sure how to tackle it, and what to focus on first. 

Below are the credit card and student loan numbers from lowest to highest, as well as the other monthly items underneath it. . I have already scheduled CC #1 and 2 to be paid in full on their due dates next month, just to get those out of the way.

- CC #1 $205 at 22.00%

Groceries, gas, eating out (usually once a week) comes to $800 or so, so we're still left with a lot leftover.

personalfinance,"33 years old, disabled, in debt, no savings, and going through a divorce. Where do I go from here?","I was born with a terminal heart and lung condition. I have always worked when I could but it has worsened and I now no longer can. I am working on getting a Youtube channel and Twitch channel up for some extra money as well as getting into online publishing but for now I make about $16000 a year on Social Security Disability forcibly retired. 

During May of 2015 my wife got a lucky break in her career however we had to go a month without her pay before she could begin collecting the income from her new job. We had $900 in savings and in order to keep it I got a temp job for that month. I managed to double my income for one months time and all that income went into the black hole that was my wife. Attempting to work though nearly killed me by causing me to have a heart attack. During this time my wife reconnected with her old high school flame. He has now moved in with her and her entire plan to pay her bills is to get him to get a job and pay half her bills for her ASAP.

She is mentally ill, abusive, obese, and addicted to eating out for every single meal, often going to places she cannot afford like Red Lobster. For five and a half years I tried to keep her madness in check and I was constantly cleaning up her financial and other messes.

I managed to trick her into revealing her plans to take the money and run on May 28th by accident. Once the jig was up she threw away our marriage and the life we had built together, including two years of progress towards a better life, in a month. She took everything we had in savings, did not pay me half the rent and utilities for the last two months we lived together as agreed, did not return half the security deposit on our apartment when she transferred the lease to her new one bedroom apartment as agreed, and wracked up thousands of dollars in bills in my name. 

It is now January and having spent since May of last year doing nothing but paying bills I have finally gotten this mess at least contained and under control. I have been forced to move back into my parents basement. 

**Personal Financial Details:**

I take home $1280 a month. I spend about $300 in medications, and another $250-300 each month in food. Everything else has gone to bills and debts. I do not have a vehicle, I borrow my parents when I need to and replace any gas I use. I do intend to try and purchase one in April or May. I am looking at most likely getting a Honda or Vespa scooter because it will more or less meet my needs and the cost to own and operate it would be a lot less than if I get a car. 

I have nothing in savings. It has taken everything I have had just to get to this point. I still owe $400 in some medical bills, $463 in bills my wife left to me, $640 on a Capital One credit card out of a $850 balance, $640 on a Credit One credit card with a $700 balance, $1800 for a loan to get a new PC I had to have (my old one was ten years old and dying), and $1500 to family and friends.

Under Social Security Disability I can have up to but no more than $1000 in a savings account and up to but no more than $2000 in financial assets. 

While I am currently living rent free at my parents place that cannot continue past the end of this year.

Due to my health I had to have a bankruptcy five years ago and have about a 630 credit score as I have had limited ability to rebuild my credit until freeing myself from my wife. Before the bankruptcy my credit score was close to 800 if that means anything.

**Here is the question I have.** 

Where do I go from here in the next 6-12 months? What debt should I wipe out first? The two credit cards which do have an interest rate? The medical bills or the rest of the bills my wife left me that do not have an interest rate? Should I go minimum payment for a few months and instead focus on getting that $1000 in savings?

So I've got about four grand coming back in tax returns due to tuition which considering my 1600 a month income, is alot.  I just burrowed for school for the first time and will be burrowing more in the future to finish my degree, but I also have just over 5,000 left to pay off my car.  I have no major high interest credit card debt to pay off so the only two money sinks are my car and the student loans I'll be piling on for the next year or two.

Would it be better to pay off the car and get the title in my name and everything, vs paying down the student loans?  My gut says deal with the car because the minimum payment is over 200 a month, and once I have the title in hand I'll have more options in the future when it comes to selling it.  

That, and I know there are lots of tools available for managing student loan payments such as income based repayment, where with my car there are far less.  I don't even know the interest rate on my car loan off the top of my head, or my school loans for that matter.  

The last thing is, my loans are unsubsidized meaning I need to get them down as quickly as possible to avoid interest accruing while I'm in school.  Does this change things?

gaming,Video Games as more than Visual Art,"Let's talk about games as art for a moment. Not for the graphics, but for what the medium can do. 

I wrote about this a bit recently (link at the end), but let's talk about art for just a moment. What's the difference between the Mona Lisa and Jason Pollock's No. 5, 1948 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._5,_1948 )? Simple. Most people can look at the first one and immediately feel it's art. The second one is hard to appreciate unless you're into art.

Now, this isn't to say that the latter isn't art. There's enough money invested in the latter to make it nearly pointless to argue. But it's appreciated as such. Why are goes not getting the same treatment?

I have two ideas which I touched on in the article but want to expand on:

1. Most people think of video games as a set of rules with win/loss conditions. Those sorts of games are games, and while there's an art to mastering them, I can agree that they are not themselves art but a tool with which you can ""make"" art, if you really want to call a playstyle art. However, when you look at a game for its story and experience, that's art the same way a movie or a book can be art. It's an experience.

2. If games are a kind of experiential art, why do people write them off? Simple: they're not experiencing them. Ebert admitted as much when given an opportunity to ethically experience some games (space and time to borrow a console and games to experience them). Even then, not every game is made to be art. Just because Seven Samurai can be considered an artistic movie, doesn't mean every other movie is art. 

I'm not going to try to argue that games are high art, but there's a reason some folks get a bit miffed when they're told they're not. We've experienced the medium and have been moved in ways that we usually associate with art. Those who haven't (the ""uninitiated"") can't see it because they don't have the training to feel it. If prodded, like Ebert, they can see there's something lurking behind the stereo-types, but I think that's the best we can do for now. I've tried to get a few non-gamers into Undertale, but it's not quite as newbie friendly as it initially seemed. Non-gamers old and young really don't seem to consider exploring; they're more task based, which is why I feel like puzzle games are the mobile industry's blood- they're easy to understand and create for the masses, which is usually what high art isn't.

personalfinance,Any way to know ahead of time what my payments will be?,"I'm currently in a rehabilitation program to get my student loans out of default, and because of my income currently (low -- I'm a self-employed artist, I didn't even make enough that I filed taxes last year) they only expect me to make the minimum payment for the program. So what I was basically told was that, I make the minimum payments each month ($5/month) for 9 months and then it is transferred to a different collector. When I spoke to the people at Fedloan prior to calling the people they transferred the debt to, they made it sound like it would be reopened with them. 

So the problem I ran into last time (and that I screwed up badly because of communication issues -- I am autistic and struggle really hard to talk on the phone in general nevermind about complex issues like this that I have little experience with) is that because I didn't file taxes I don't have tax documents to show my income. I do, however, keep a careful spreadsheet of my income, expenses, etc. so I know how much I make. 

The only thing that the people required for me to send them for their rehabilitation program for my default is a letter stating my monthly income to them, faxed to their office. I got the impression that that is something I will be able to give to the Fedloan people too, once the loans are transferred back to them, but I'm not sure and have had a really difficult time understanding on the phone if that is going to be the case. I keep getting people saying that when the loans are in their possession they'll send me a letter and we will be able to figure out my payments at that point, but I'm extremely anxious and struggling with the anticipation and just want to know what I'm going to be expected to do in 9 months. 

Does anyone have any insight on this or experience?

As the market soured, Goldman created even more of these securities, enabling it to pocket huge profits.

My question is: when do you think rates will start to rise for savings products like online savings accounts and CDs?  Is it simply a matter of competition; when one bank raises the rate to get business the others follow to retain business?  For those who have been around a while, when does this tend to happen?  I haven't seen rates rise for savings products at all yet.

The reason I ask is because I'd like to open some CDs, but obviously would prefer to wait until the rate hike flows into savings products.

edit: I current have my cash/emergency fund in an online savings account at Barclays earning 1%.  I'm looking at the Barclays 5 year online CD which has a rate of 2.25%.  The early withdrawal penalty on the CD is 180 days worth of interest.  So even if I only keep the cash in the CD for 1 year, I would beat the return from the savings account (I'd get about 1.125%).

personalfinance,Tax issues of intra-family loans as replacement for holding stocks as parents go into retirement?,"My husband and I are planning on buying a rental/vacation property with another couple through an LLC. Initially, our thoughts were to either take a commercial mortgage, or to use a cash-out refinance on our primary home (which has appreciated significantly since we purchased it) to get extra cash and reduce our interest rate.

However, I spoke with my dad today, who's nearing retirement and feels he's significantly over-invested in stocks (I think he's basically 100% in the market now - no bonds at all). He made a comment that he's looking to start moving his savings into safer vehicles with more guaranteed rates of return, and wondered if he couldn't do an intra-family loan to us. We get a better interest rate than the bank would offer, he gets a guaranteed rate on his money, and the interest income stays within the family. The amount he would lend me would be less than 15% of dad's total portfolio value, max.

Of course, I have no idea how taxes would be handled here, and I am not very knowledgable on how tax-deferral works up to and through retirement. Questions I have:

- Are you taxed whenever you sell stock, even if you roll it into a bond fund instead? In other words, by doing this kind of loan, is it the case that he'd be paying a bunch of capital gains taxes now that he could otherwise defer if he moved money from stocks into a bond fund or similar safer vehicle?

- I am assuming he would have to pay income tax on any interest income as well, and that there's no way of avoiding this - does this make it much less worthwhile to then rely on guaranteed interest income vs. interest on a bond fund

- Basically, I'm at a loss to figure out how to compare the different options for moving money out of stocks, whether into intra-family loans, bonds, or something else--especially as it concerns minimizing taxes.

personalfinance,"$25k accident settlement coming in, but in serious debt.","Ok, up front I've been a shit head with personal finance for the better half of my adult life, trying to not make this sounds like a sob story and sorry if TL;DR....

I went to college around 2004 at Full Sail because I was 21 and dumb and thought I could be an audio engineer. Didn't realize that it was pretty much a joke degree until graduation and realized how hard it was to find work. (they had about 300 people graduate every month at the time...) Computers were just starting to take over the audio engineer's job market. Then the 2008 recession. I decided to go back to school for computer science but my father passed away and I kinda went down a dark road. I was basically homeless for a few years and let everything get behind. 

I have about $90k in student loan debt and really the only derogatory marks on my fico score are from the behind student loans. Some of the federal loans are garnishing my wages, but I'm enrolled in a program to get it straight. 

I was involved in a vehicle accident recently and will be getting a $25k settlement shortly. The layer is charging a quarter and after taxes I should be receiving ~$17K 

Ok, after the long back story.... my questions are, will the garnishment take all of this settlement money? I was working towards getting student loans back on track, build my credit score back up and save for a home purchase. I was out of work for almost two months from injuries and am now slightly behind on bills, need a new vehicle to travel to work and the time away from work took all my savings. I'm afraid they will take all this small settlement to basically pay interest, not helping me at all. If they don't garnish it, or only garnish a percentage of it, will it be a bad idea to use all of it towards a home down payment or just pay down my debt and continue being a renter? The area I live, homes are fairly inexpensive compared to rent. I pay $525 a month for rent but the homes I've been looking at would be ~$300/m mortgage. I've been working hard to re-establish my credit score to purchase a home. After reviewing first time buyer programs, I think I may meet the requirements now.

personalfinance,(NL) Using student load to buy stock.,"I'm 19 years old, I'm still living at home and I'm not planning on leaving any time soon(Free living, Cooked dinner). The commute to Uni is about 30mins with public transportation so I'm pritty happy with where I am currently.

Currently I have about 10k in savings to pay for only my tuition, which is about 2000 Euros a year. I got 4 more years remaining. I got a decent income for a student. Every month I'm left with about 200 euros which I'm also saving, and sometimes using to buy nice stuff or to take a holiday. 

Now the government is currently offering student loans where I can borrow 560 euro a month, till I graduate. Afterwards I'm required to start paying back that debt as soon as I find a job, then I have 15 years to pay it back. Where I need to pay off with a min of 4% of my salary till it's all paid back or till its 15 years after my graduation(After 15 years the (remaining) debt is forgiven). 

The Interest rate I need to pay is 0.01%. If I'm jobless I don't have to pay it back, till I get a job again.

I was planning on borrowing the max of 560 euros, and start buying shares in big dutch companies that pay dividend(Shell, ING, Unilever, Heineke, Dutch &amp; Germand Bonds). Which would result me in a interest of about 5%. 

These Student loads will not effect my ability to get a mortgage. Also after graduating the starting salary is about 2900 Euros. If I only buy into these big companies that have dividend I will make a modest 5% interest on them.

After that however I should have saved up about 35.000 euros, in a stock portfolio. Not considering the potential rising/lowering of the stock value and the amount I can write of my taxes. 

So from here there are 2 options I can do:
1. I sell my stocks required to pay everything off in 1 go.

2. I pay off a certain % every month. 


I'm aware there is a risk in doing this, what do you guys think? Am I missing something? Also should I got with option 1 or option 2, I'm also thinking of only going for option 1 if my stocks are above the value I paid for them, and going for option 2 if they are below the price I bought them for.",finance,1453574725

personalfinance,"Renting vs. buying a condo @22: looking for opinions, devils advocate comments, life experiences","I'll try to provide as much detail as possible; I've ready similar ones enough to know to state that I will go to a financial planner before making a decision.  What I'm hoping to gain from this are experienced opinions - I just turned 22 and will be graduating in May, and I've worked hard to become as financially independent and responsible as possible during college.   I'm not looking to make a lot of money by flipping or anything, just to have somewhere comfortable to live and not take a loss.  I've seen my family work hard and I ultimately want to get in a position to help them out in the next 10 or so years when they exit the workforce. 

I'm deciding between renting for the next two years or buying a condo.  I intend to stay in the city I currently rent in for at least 2 years due to family obligations.  The rent vs buy calculator says that buying would break even after 2 years, however it is a goal of mine to live in another country and would probably only stay here maximum of 3 years, before moving abroad for about 2-3 years.  I would then likely move back to the city I'm in now.

Financial picture: I own a car, worth little in the KBB, but has been maintained enough to last at least two years.  I owe $17,000 in student loans, but I have consolidated all at a 3.75% interest rate.  I have no other debts and a credit score of almost 800.  I currently have a Vanguard targeted IRA account with over $1,000 however due to my age I'm too young to claim retirement tax credits (which annoys me more than anything).  I am confident that I will gain employment making at least $30,000 a year before or soon after graduation.  I'm not an extravagant person - I have more fun reading a book or going to a $5 social dance than in going to a movie or out to dinner.  While I don't do electrical work I have a DIY personality and am competent at basic home repairs/improvements.  I have an emergency savings account of six months of expenses that I would not use for either my security deposit or down payment/closing costs.

Renting:    Currently my rent after my lease is up this August would be minimum $800 a month as I would need to be located close to a bus line (more expensive) as I can't see throwing away money both to a landlord and a car I won't be able to sell for anything when I move abroad.  I also have a cat, which narrows places down considerably, and adds a $20/month pet fee.  I'd sell my car for probably less than $1,000 since indoor parking (to prevent rust, battery problems, etc) in any of the apartments near bus lines is over $75 a month.  The apartments available for that rate, unless I'm able to find someone who is desperate for a sublettor, are studios or 1 bedrooms on the cheap side of nice - which is a-okay with me.  Just useful in comparison.    I calculate this would cost right around $20,480 for two years including security deposit, assuming no damage, and no increase in rent.  I'm not including utilities, heat, etc, as I would need to pay that anywhere.  

Owning:   I have about $6,000 to pay towards a down payment.  Not much, but it comes out to about 7% of the most expensive places I'm looking at.  Condo's in this town can get pretty expensive, but basic places are between $65,000 - $80,000.  There are some on the lower end of that, however there seems to be an excess of for sale property in the vicinity of these condos which makes me hesitate.  Just for fun I looked at two condos in different areas, that are the only ones for sale in that location, to get an idea.  My requirements are that they have an indoor parking spot or garage (as I would need a car since they are further out), at least one bedroom, low or no condo association fees, ability to be slightly improved by paint, new flooring, new light fixtures, or addition of shelving in closets.  All are things that I'm capable of and that are relatively inexpensive, especially if I have two years to look for deals or ""new"" used fixtures.  Benefits to condos are that they normally have a w/d in unit, a balcony or patio I can garden on, and owning a cat is not a problem.  The first condo is $75,000 and is 2bd/2bth, last purchased within the past few years.  The other that I looked at is $79,000 and is 2bd/1bth and was last purchased in 2006.  There are a few other places on the market right now, and they seem to be on the market for anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months.  I'm not worried about not finding a place that meets my criteria.

Future Financial picture: My first priority is to pay a minimum of $325 a month towards my loans, starting during my grace period to pay them off within 5 years.  I do understand that if I choose to rent, I can put my entire down payment towards my loans.  Secondly, I hope to contribute $100 a month towards my IRA, however this is something where if I don't make that goal each month I won't be too bothered.  I hope my future employer will have a matching program, decreasing the amount I need to contribute to make my retirement goals.  Thirdly, and most importantly if I purchase a condo, I want to add to my emergency savings, as I know my liability as a homeowner increases dramatically.  Fourthly, I suppose I'd like to invest some money at some point, but it's not on my radar at the moment.  The rest of my income would go towards necessary bills and fun things, like paint to make my condo feel like mine!

After running the calculation, it says that at year #2 the total cost for renting is $20,286 and owning $18,113 with a 15 year mortgage.  However I know that between purchasing and selling costs they will be mostly equal.  Likely more expensive to own.  It is my understanding that if i bought it for $80,000 and paid $20,000 towards the mortgage, I would have to sell if for $60,000 or more, which seems entirely possible in this market.  I have more to learn.  I suppose I'm attracted to buying because I'd have something tangible after two years to sell or stay in, plus during those two years I'd have a nicer and larger place, along with the ability to remodel and decorate as I see fit.",finance,1453590519

Democrats controlled the House, Senate, and Presidency in 2010. Why couldn't Sanders pass his healthcare plan then, and why does he think he will have a better shot at doing it when the GOP will control the House and likely the Senate as well?


Most of his policies are legislative in nature - such as healthcare (see above question), marijuana legalization, and taxes. Why doesn't he try to pass more bills in Congress? The Presidency is the executive branch - Sanders is clearly only interested in the legislative side of things.


Why is his run in Congress so uninspiring? He has practically no major bills he pushed. He's called the ""amendment king"" - so if he can't push anything through congress and can merely amend things, why run for President?


Why did he allow two protesters to take over a mic at a rally he was expected to speak at, and why did he allow them to call his supporters ""white racists"" over that mic?


If this was simply to allow them to speak, why was he hesitant at first and during a town hall event in 2014, why did he tell hecklers to ""Shut up!"" and threaten the police on them when they questioned his support of Israel? Does he only fight back against hecklers with a certain skin color?


Why have many people that have worked for him said he is super rude, and even barbaric, to employees?


Why doesn't he mention in his stump speech that with a net worth of $700,000, he is technically part of the 1%? Also, does he give 90% of his earnings after $250,000?


Why has he supported every U.S. bombing of Iraq from 1992 on?


He stated that ""open borders is a Koch brothers idea,"" and that illegal immigrants cause wages to go down and harm the American poor. So why does he support illegal immigration now, and if open borders are keeping our wages down wouldn't Trump be a better choice to fight against this?


Why did you say Donald Trump lied when you said you would be OK with a 90% tax? You stated during an interview with John Harwood you would be OK with it?


If he is so consistent, why did he go from anti-imperialist in 1988 to pro-imperialist in 1990, even going as far as to state he wouldn't let that ""damn (Gulf) war cost me the election?""


Why did he in the 90s support the objectively racist and mass-incarcerationist Federal Crime bill?


Why did he support every US intervention since elected to Congress–Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Liberia, Zaire (Congo), Albania, Sudan, Afghanistan and Yugoslavia?


Why did he support economic sanctions that killed more than a million Iraqi civilians?

Why did he claim America was on the brink of ""death by poison gas"" in the 1970s?


Why does he fly private jets that emit tons of carbon, and why is his response that it shouldn't matter if he does?


In the 1990s, why did he support the War on Drugs (and even defended it when running against an African American woman named Delores Sandoval)?


Why did Bernie champion in Congress the dumping of Vermont’s nuclear waste near Sierra Blanca, Texas, a low income border community with a mostly Latino population that is overwhelmingly opposed to the dump project?


Why did he support the Federal Crime Bill that give the gave the capitalist state more than 50 new pretexts to execute members of the working class?


Why is it that when he was asked why he was the only member of Vermont’ s three member Congressional delegation who had no person of color on his staff, Bernie responded that “we’re hiring the most qualified people we can."" Why?


Why is his net worth so low when compared to the money has been making the last 20+ years?



If he is not a Communist, then why:

Why is he a huge fan of American Marxist Eugene Debs? Why does he still have a portrait of what the Soviets called America's Greatest Marxist in his Senatorial office?


Why did he defend Fidel Castro's policies in 1985? He stated ""They forgot that he (Fidel Castro) educated their (Cubans) kids, gave their kids health care, totally transformed society.""
He also stated during that same 1985 interview, that just because "" Ronald Reagan dislikes these people does not mean to say the people in these nations feel the same."" Why did he state this during a time when thousands of Cubans were trying to escape Castro's regime?


Why did Bernie Sanders call Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega ""an impressive guy with deep convictions,"" while Ortega was targeting Jews, Catholics, indigenous peoples, journalists, etc. etc.?


In addition, when he was Mayor of Burlington why was he was the only elected U.S. official to attend the anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution in Managua?


Why did he have a Soviet Union flag in his mayoral office and why did he honeymoon in the USSR in the late 80s?


Why did he address the Communist Party's US Peace Council when America was at the brink of winning the Cold War? One of the US Peace Council's goals was to help ""the triumph of Soviet power in the US.""


Why did Bernie embrace the ""People's Republic of Burlington"" moniker? China is called the ""People's Republic of China"" and North Korea is called ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea."" Notice the term ""Democratic"" in NK's name. ""Democratic"" is a term Communists use all the time. Why is Bernie any different?


When he first got elected Mayor of Burlington why was he the only elected U.S. official to attend the anniversary of the Sandinista Revolution in Managua?


Why does he call himself a ""Social Democrat,"" which is what Leon Trostky and Vladimir Lenin called themselves before it evolved into the Communist party?


Why did he organize for the Communist United Packinghouse Workers Union, which at the time was under investigation by the House Committee on Un-American Activities?


Why did he head the American People’s History Society, which was a Marxist organization?


Why has he used the Che Guevara term ""Venceremos"" (which means ""We will overcome"") and why does he always use the famous Communist term ""revolution?""


Why did he name a baseball team the Vermont Reds?


Even though Bernie has praised the Marxists of Nicaragua, Cuba, and the USSR, he now states he is more like Sweden, FDR, and Denmark. If this is true, why did Denmark take its time to refute Sanders and state he is nothing like them?",energy,1453604242

I was motivated  to write this article by the threatening situation developing on the Instant Messenger market that threatens any future perspective developments in the area of Instant Messaging and video- calling, as well, I wanted to address those tiring questions with regards to what messenger is the best, right and secure.   

Over the past years the competition  in the messenger market was as high as never before. General availability of the Internet and increasing  popularity of  Smartphones have made IM applications very popular. Many folks have taken this dynamics step further, by writing their own messengers. Every day a new application comes out, promising to revolutionize the messenger market in the way we communicate.  You even get to see some absurd messengers once in a while like, Yo, that allows to send only one word at a time. 

Yet, every messenger continues to have their own audience, that markets exclusivity of their own service. As a result, we as customers over time, go after the features of different messengers, and have to install all of them to be able to conveniently connect with different people. 

All of this creates a really terrible situation, that at its root threatens the fundamental principles of communication. In this article, through numerous examples I will show you one very important idea:   

&gt; ""Why such an important for humanity area of technology, as Instant Messaging  and audio-video calling cannot be monopolized by one single company and how such monopoly slows down the overall development of technologies  and threatens the freedom and security of communication.""

I do not have anything personal against the products or companies, to the contrary I think they still can evolve. Their model of work, their architecture - that`s what has to die and here is why. 

----

Internet, as we know it, exists because of the open standards. All interconnections in the network starting from physical ( the coding on wired, radio and optical signals) to the application / protocol layers (HTTP, E-mail) are open and accessible to anyone. Anybody can create their own website, browser and e-mail client. You do not need to have permission, buy patent or sign any contracts.
That is why we have so many Operational Systems that can work with internet, as well as wide selection of different applications that support major protocols.  

Imaging if you could send e-mail only from Outlook to Outlook. And before sending e-mail you had to find out what application does the recipient use. Or if the phone calls worked only among the same manufacturer. Samsung to Samsung. Apple to Apple, it's absurd isn`t it? 

But that is exactly how the situation looks when you have to connect with someone on instant messenger or make a video call. Commercial companies own the market, trying to get the largest market share, and  profit from it of course. That is why every messenger becomes isolated from others, and companies fiercely compete for the users. 

This happened because at some point open standards could not longer keep up with increasing needs of the users and commercial companies could offer much  more attractive solutions, that made commercial IMs very popular.  At times of dial-up, no one could dream of such quality of the voice as Skype provides, especially for free. As a result, some statistics say that right now about 40% of all international calls come through Skype. 

The second wave of IM popularity came with the significant growth of Smartphone users.  People suddenly realized, why would they pay money for SMS, if they can use IM for the fraction of the cost. SMS- market started to shrink, something that will soon happen to the  phone market. Mobile operators know this very well, and are try to delay the moment of truth for as long as they can. First they try to block VoIP- services in their local networks, and later they try to mask for them. 

This situation somewhat reminds me of the fight of the copyright owners with the pirates: at first with the right to record on one`s audio-cassette, VHS and discs, and later on the internet by introducing Digital Rights Management ( DRM, ) and creating laws like the DMCA. That almost ended up in complete failure.   

The only difference is that mobile operators are part of very influential telecoms that own a significant portion of Internet networks. That is why the road from SIM-cards and  mobile calls services is going to be long a and painful. However, there are already companies that support the new movement. For example, a new e-SIM standard developed  in cooperation of Samsung and Apple would help the user to select the mobile phone operator right from their phone, without the need to purchase the SIM-Card. Such method would not be very different from any other existing subscription services. Just, look at the list of operators in your region, select the right plan, and pay by credit card. 

In such conditions users would always want to keep their phone number. iNum, had to become such number, that to my opinion have failed. Maybe instead of phone number there would and ID of the user`s favorite IM. In this case we can see that the user would need nothing besides the internet from the operator and all additional services would be ignored.  Even today, as see some people use the SIM cards for the internet in their tablets being bombarded with different paid subscription services from ISPs, which just annoys the user. In the future, such feelings toward ISPs would keep growing stronger.    

It is seen that in such conditions the influence of messengers would grow to significant extent. From an alternative means of communication, messengers would move up to the primary method. Its frightful to imagine what would happen if the current tendency continues, and we would have hundreds of isolated and incompatible applications. 
 
&gt; ""Why Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram, Hangouts or any other proprietary application should never become the dominant global messenger? ""

To see the whole threat of monopoly in the technology sector, it would be enough to take a look at business solutions that work only in Internet Explorer, forcing the users to use poor instrument in order to access required business solution. Or let's take a look at dominant electronic file formats. The leading position was taken by the proprietary doc format, and there is still no standardized format for all electronic documents.

When it comes to security, the mass media often rises questions such as : Which messenger is the most reliable? Which one is the most ""secure""? By secure, most of the time, the security of the  transport protocol is assumed, which is odd, because besides secured protocol there many other aspects that can create vulnerability to the user. It is not a right question to ask in the first place,  and every time its asked, a specific threat should be outlined.  Security - is not a final product, it's a combination of technology and architecture working  together. So to answer the question correctly we would have to look and examined separately.  

Let's take a look at the security and functionality of different messengers below.

**Skype**

I have been using Skype for over 10 years. After browser, this is the second most used application on my PC. For me it's more than just an IM, it is a tool I use to hold business meetings, conference calls, talk with friends and create new friendships. I do not even create social media accounts, because I prefer voice and video over text. I have tried all of the features offered by Skype, and  to me they are simply amazing. 

I have tried all development tools for Skype as well, such as Skype4Com, SkypeKit SDK. I actively tried to improve Skype, by regularly posting to bug tracker, till it was closed. As a result of using Skype **I have found 2 critical errors, that allow remotely close Skype client for Windows**.

I truly ~~love~~, loved Skype, and as I believe I have enough experience and moral right to write all of this down. 

**Why Skype is great?**

Today,  Skype is the most advanced software in its market segment that definitely beats the competition. and here is why:

**Quality of audio**

Skype has the best technology in place, that provides the best quality for audio. Its  codec (SILK) and the dynamic routing make call quality good, even for people with slower internet connection.

**Connectivity-**

Skype is a very sneaky software that can find a connection when the other programs cannot. You have probably seen it happen when the browser doesn`t load, yet you can use it to communicate. The reasons for it, is its ability to get through firewalls and NAT blocking, many companies can simply dream of such  connectivity.  

**Encryption**

For me, it's important to know that my communication is private and cannot be intercepted an analyzed. Even with government programs in place, such as Microsoft Government Security Program, which allows special agencies to gain access to my communication I can be sure that my communication is secure at least at the network level. Even the most advanced DPI systems experience difficulties in tracking traffic of Skype.

*It's important to note, that the encryption at the network level is being marketed by messengers as a feature that makes them secure. I am going to explain why the encryption of traffic alone does not make communication secure.*

Some other excellent features of Skype include its stability and functionality. Skype is stable and  rarely crashes, you can use it for video conference and calls for many days non-stop without crashing. When it come to functionality, there are many, group calls, monitor sharing, file sharing, editing tools, call to phones. You can access all of them by navigating through the convenient application interface without the need for additional plug-ins and add-ons. 


**Why Skype has to die?**

**Insecure **

Not only insecure, but its highly dangerous!

Skype continues to disclose your IP-address, including your local address. Based on this information it is easy to find you current location and build a map of your movements. While, the bug tracker still existed,  you could have watched how Skype spend over a year trying to fix a bug that allowed to create remote DoS for any application running on Windows. The vulnerability that allowed to remotely unblock the microphone took them over half a year to fix. I had to ask, almost beg the developers to pay attention to these vulnerabilities, that simply did not allow the user to use the application securely, without being exposed to external threats. 

When a vulnerability that allowed any account to be stolen was announced, simply by knowing the e-mail of the user, I tried to reach Technical Support to explain the issue for over a day, but wasn`t able to do so. Meanwhile Skype accounts of some notable people were stolen. Actually, after this incident Skype has failed to review its policy of account registration, and still does not require e-mail confirmation. You can still enter any e-mail when you register and the accounts would be displayed in the list, which allows to spam the search  results, if one would perform search for account by e-mail. 

At this moment (!!!), I know at least two vulnerabilities, that would allow to block someone's Skype account, so that the victim would never be able to use it again. The attacker has to know only the Login of the target, without the need for password or e-mail. Again, I was not able to get any response from Technical Support and  posted the issue to their forum. The issue is still unresolved.

Such posts usually get replies from remote support centers that have no desire to investigate the issue further and simply reference some vague FAQ sections, failing to see the real threat on their side. 

Even though the messenger is secure at the transport layer, due to the size of the company and internal politics/ organization, many highly dangerous  vulnerabilities are not addressed, to this day and if found, take very long time to resolve. At the same time, you can always see some new smiley`s with each new version release of the product.

Let's get back to the statement: 

**Secured transport layer protocol does not make the messenger secure.**

Its only part of overall security. And as a reader we have to keep in mind when we read another marketing nonsense, about three layers of security, the length of encryption, military grade security and other bullshit, that has absolutely no connection to real security. 

**Unpredictability**

You cannot just take and write an alternative Skype client, because its protocol is closed and is often changed. That's why, the company has the decision power to decide which devices would be able to run Skype. Some time ago, SkypeKit SDK existed, that allowed to develop a client for integration on own devices. All you had to do, was to sign a few non-disclosure agreements, promise not to run the Skypekit on the server side, and create personal certificate ( that, in case of misuse could be taken back), and you could start developing. But later on the company changed its mind and decided to take down the support for Skypekit and block all existing purchased versions. Same thing happened with Skype4Com, and Skype for Asterisk. That is why if you decided to integrate Skype in one of your products, be prepared that tomorrow it may stop working and all of you development efforts would be lost. 
We face the similar situation with interface for the desktop client. After the release of another new version, you always look for ways to turn off crazy fantasies of the marketers, that create huge - smiley taking half of you screen, as well as make many other uncomfortable changes that you were used to before.  That's the problem, you cannot predict what is going to be on the Skype's mind next, and it always poses a threat to the customers.  

The reason I spent so much time explaining details of Skype, is it because you can count it as a flagship in the industry of IMs. It has the richest arsenal of functionalities, and its competitors are very far away. At the same time it is the oldest and has many visible symptoms telling us it is time for it to go...  

For those who still think Skype as a service that should continue to be the leading messenger probably do not understand the whole seriousness of the issue, or probably because you did not face one yet. If you want to see how dangerous some of the open bugs are or if you do not believe me just leave a comment below saying: "" Want to test  my Skype account for vulnerabilities"" 

Issues of Skype, in one way or another, can be related to all popular messengers. I am not going to look at its closer rival Viber, because I do not have much experience using it. But I will say a few words about others. 

**Telegram**

I am looking at Telegram separately, because it is a messenger that at its core differs from the competition and does not have many of the shortcoming of Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp. Its often displayed as a long-awaited alternative to all existing messengers. In  mass media it was advertised as so secure, that even terrorists use it. But unfortunately, in most cases people take security as a separate entity, without taking into account any particular threat, which is an absolutely wrong way of doing it.  

I, myself always use Telegram, and to be honest, I have to say it has amazing usability. None of other messenger have ever give me that sense excitement. Its stability with  bad internet connection, alone makes it an  exceptional choice.  In the areas with weak signal, in areas were the device barely catches the GPRS, non of other messengers perform this well. But when we start talking about security and exceptionality of Telegram, unfortunately we have to say that is displays similar symptoms as its competitors do. 

**Why Telegram has to die?**

**Centralized control**

Which is the main issue of all outlined messengers. I often notice that people fail to see the seriousness of this argument. One may think,   how bad can  it be,  if one single company has full control over your communication? They are all nice guys after all.., they do not ask for money, they provide convenient API, and smileys are really cool. But you should not forget, that any company goes after its own interest in the first place, and it's there for a profit. Today,   under the pressure of another commercial company you see that the Telegram  defines topics that you can and cannot discuss. Just recently in deleted over 78 forum posts on the topic of ISIL, just because of Apple`s request. What if they are going to ban something else tomorrow? 

Such company, having ""group on nice guys"" at its head would always confirm to more powerful structures. Such structures may consist of the whole Government State or smaller jurisdictions, especially those, in which the company operates. Therefore, at any point in time, some sort of information or activities can become undesirable for the overall politics or vision of the company, and it can make changes regardless if laws of your country allow you to do what was banned or not. Having one centralized company have full control over your communication, disregarding your opinion and say is a very dangerous position to be in. It difficult to say how the politics of separate Governments will change tomorrow, and the ease with which they can influence the instruments of communication is simply unacceptable. Upon waking up tomorrow morning you may realized that your ability use your favorite messenger is gone, simply because someone decided so. 

Let's take a look at some other issues of Telegram.

**Centralized architecture**

This issue goes closely with the one mentioned above. One point of failure allows at any moment to limit accessibility to the server for whole countries or even fully liquidate Telegram by the ruling of the Court. Servers of Telegram, together with chat histories, that are openly stored in there, could be withdrawn at any time if the government, in which they are located decides to do so. Even though that the client part of the Telegram protocol is open sourced the server side is still closed from the external audit. Basically, the security of regular chartrooms is based on the words of the Telegram team alone. It`s like them saying : ""We promise not to read your communication, we promise!""Probably they are honest in their promise, but the possibility in itself, for some group of people having the unlimited access to the private information at the scale of the whole World is simply unacceptable.  

**Authentication through SMS**

Telegram is as secure, as your current mobile providers , because of the authentication through SMS. It's enough to remember how malefactors 5 times reissued SIM-card Beeline. Telegram helps to protect users from such plotters, allowing the user to create secret password, but it's not an option set by default.

**End- to-end encryption**

I have to admit is that use of such function in Telegram is very convenient. Especially, handy comes the ability to set a timer that self-destructs the chat history, so one would not have to worry if the companion would delete the history log at the right moment. But the procedure of key comparison is very ambiguous. Every time, the copy of the key is different and  its unknown what channels are used to compare the keys. There is no possibility to once create the verification of chat key and to have the ability to verify its authenticity by yourself, as it is possible with OTR. 
In the end, without looking at the fact that Telegram has being developed  really well and in most cases it is much more secure and usable compared to the competition, you cannot really say that it is significantly different from  the competition. It is the same commercial product, bearing all the threats to the freedom of communication of the user. 



**But how about my favorite %messenger_name%?**

All mentioned symptoms, to some extent relate to the majority of top messengers known today. Centralized architecture, and operational control by one single company, is the largest nail in the coffin for each one of them. That`s why there is no need to describe all of them individually. 

*Short table of popular messengers and reasons, why they have to die.*

**SIP and Jabber**

Anyone who is looking for real security is forced to use good, old open source protocols. For voice communication it is - SIP + ZRTP, for text - XMPP + OTR. But on in comparison to the commercial services, we can say that most of the time these protocols are not working, than actually work. It looks a bit odd to me that in some cases while making calls through SIP, you can hear voice only on one way, experience problems with incoming and outgoing calls and have many other problems that commercial solutions lack. I do not want to think about NAT type, working with ICE and STUN, guessing ports, when I simply need to make a short call. That's is just disgusting . 

Similar story with Jabber. How can you even imagine that in 2016, your message can get lost simply because there was a lost connection with the server? Where is the normal confirmation message delivery and read receipts? Jabber is absolutely terrible with unstable internet connections and mobile platforms
. 
Until all of these issues are fixed, we should not even start talking about competition of open source protocol with commercial messengers. I would be happy, if today there would exist at least one open source solution, capable of taking the place of dominant messenger in the world. But it does not exist.


**What should be done?**

I sincerely believe that this topic is extremely serious and it is important not to miss the right moment. We should not allow anybody to take over or restrict our fundamental ability to communicate.

Such serious for humanity question, as a development of one single standard for instant messages and calls, should be dealt by organization such as IETF together with the leading IT- companies in the industry.  

A very good example is the story of OpenSSL. When a vulnerability heartbleed was found, everyone  was terrified by how helpless the whole industry looked because of one mistake. After that an organization called Core Infrastructure Initiative was formed which consists of the larges IT-companies such as Cisco, Google, Intel. The goal of such organization is to support critical for the industry software products such as OpenSSL, GnuPG, Network Time Protocol and others. I hope, that people would become aware of the importance of open instruments before critical and fatal issues in current proprietary products would be discovered and that similar organization would be created  in time, to work out and create proper standards. 

Internet protocol allows any node to connect to any other node on the internet. To the present day, it's not 100% true because of the issues with ipv4, but let's assume, that some years passed and everyone got ipv6, and every devise at any moment in time, with the connection to the internet have real, routing IP-address. This would allow any device, be it a Smartphone or computer to connect with each other without the need for the companies, that provide communication services. You just have to say you  current IP-address to the other party. Add to it cryptography that can be supported by all mobile devices that allows to use encryption without much strain on the battery and we have an excellent solution. 

&gt; Such environment inevitably leads to P2P Utopia, in which people would be able to communicate securely by connecting directly, without third party services.

While such ideas are being realized in the forms of different prototypes, that are weakly suitable for daily use, overall the situation keeps changing with each day,  You can try out some of the available products today.   

**Tox**

Probably, the most advanced instrument on the market that gets us close to P2P cryptoanarchy. It is fully decentralized messenger, with ability to make video and voice calls, allows screen sharing, and conference calling. All communication by default is being encrypted and is sent directly between users without servers. The client is available for  Windows/Linux/OSX/Android. Unfortunately, the realization of the client is malfunctioning in some areas and some functionalities do not work between different platforms, but they continue to actively develop and grow. 

**Ring**

Previous SIP-client of SFLphone. Now capable of working in 3 states: for regular SIP-caller (centralized), like federal service (with self-hosted server, that can  connect with other servers) and fully decentralized. Roughly, with this client you can use SIP to call through DHT. Unfortunately the client for OS X is still malfunctioning and I wasn`t able to use all of its functionalities to the full extent.

Probably there are more example out there, but I do not know any other clients that really work. These two examples are very far from being ideal and regular users probably would not like them.  I have to say, that the success of one particular product measures  not only in advanced technology, but also in its usability, design, ease of use and simplicity. Probably, before such technologies would be adapted, a lot of iterations of different protocols would go by.

I am not prepare to say, how an ideal protocol should look like, but I would try to outline basic requirements below: 

**Open and developed for the interests of the Community**

No company should have a monopoly over the whole architecture and development. The development should come as a results of collective discussions, just like stated by RFC. Licenses should not in any way restrict the use of the client. This does not exclude the existence of commercial clients, just like today there are paid E-mail clients and companies that make money on e-mail technologies. 

**Decentralized**

By decentralization I do not necessarily mean exclusively P2P, in which there are no servers what so ever. Basic servers could exist, similar to super nodes in Skype, for example for transfer of large media information, hashing, exchanged of routing data, etc. Pure P2P network in many cases creates some difficulties, for example, for mobile users with narrow, unstable internet. It could be decentralization, similar to E-mail and Jabber, when there is a large amount of independent servers, that can  interact with each other. Closure of one or several servers would not influence the system as a whole. Even if whole countries or continents would be cut off from the internet, the system would continue operating. Probably, the company should also foresee the continuing operation in case of failure on the server side. Also, client, if he wants, should be able to delegate the storage of messages to the server, and access the client thought login/password, or store private keys locally and have the ability to access network by oneself, without using any server. In this way it is possible to keep the convenience for regular users and give opportunity to more specialized users to create a more customized level of security.

**Protected against blocking**

The protocol should be stable against the attempts to be blocked, and be able to connects between different ports, transport protocols and obfuscate traffic in such a way, so that it could not be detected by DPI systems. In the worst case scenario, the application should use any of the available protocols, for example HTTPS.

Even if all possible entry points would be fully closed on the routings of the provider, there should be an option to specify own address of the gateway, similar on how it is done in TOR.

**Protected from eavesdropping**

All communications between end -users should not be transferred and stored in unencrypted state anywhere, except for the users`s device. For convenience and synchronization between the devices, the history can be saved on the server, if the user wants to, but it has to encrypted.  For example,  with master password as it's done in ProtonMail. At the same time there should be convenient tools for key verification, that are used for end-to-end encryption, similar to how it is done in RedPhone. The software should in every case send notification about untrusted connection, interception attempts and any issues with encryption.

**Be Interoperable**

All clients should be compatible at the basic level, as outlined in the standard. So that the calls and chats should work among all existing software products. E.g. there should be an ability to call from Skype to Viber, and vice versa. Firm specific, unstandardized  functionalities should be available for the users if they use the same vendor. 

**Conclusion**

I am not calling everyone to opt out from using their favorite instant messenger. Unfortunately, there is no suitable replacements for current commercial products, and we have to use tools that meet our needs best. The goal of this article, was mostly to shed the light on the existing problem that awaits us in the future, if we do not take any measures to fix it today. In this article I also attempted to answer all those questions with regards to which messenger is the best, and why you should be more careful reading news with regards to any new super amazing messenger, with  ""exceptional"" security, that has finally got it right.",technology,1453606449

personalfinance,I feel like I've made an unwise decision regarding my finances.,"I am currently active duty. I would say I am better off than most people around me in the military when it comes to the money, but I dont know. 

I got taken on a car, and I know it. I needed a car after I got home from deployment and I was going to finance through a credit union, but I ended up using the dealers financiers. dumb. 

I peronsally feel that the car I got was a pretty okay deal. its on 06 grand cherokee that has 56,000 miles on it. it has the leather and a sunroof and plenty of space in case my wife and i decide to have a family but the main reason i bought it is because i know i can get another 100,000 miles out of it *atleast*. 

i financed 15,000 total and bought the warranty bringing the total cost to 18,000. here's the shitty thing. i screwed my credit up when i was younger, because i didnt understand how it worked. **my interest rate is 9.49%** i pay 275 a month for this 10 year old car and my wife pays the same for her car she bought brand new in 2013. my math tells me this **10 year old car is going to cost me 22,000 dollars at the end of the loan**

we have no major expenses. rent is always covered (thanks obama) and medical too. 

for the two cars we pay 710 a month. cell phone is 160. cable bill is 62.04 a month - for now (thanks cox)

i am currently behind on my student loans. i was an irresponsible ~~man~~ boy and thought college was for me. it wasnt. the loans are 4,000 dollars and i have a credit card that i have about 2,000 on. 

my wife is way better with her credit. she has never missed a payment on anything, and has amazing credit

she has about 6,000 in student loans, and 0 credit card debt. she owes 13,000 on her car. 

we have in our savings account nearly $18,000. i say nearly because $500 is tied to a secure credit card i have that i got 2 years ago in order to restore my credit. i should mention, the car is the first thing i have EVER financed. it's my first car ive ever owned that wasnt a hand-me-down with over 150,000 miles on it. 


theres a small part of me that wants to just throw the 4,000 dollars at my student loans to bring it out of default. they told me i could settle at 90% but i dont want to do that if i dont have to. 

i would like to buy a house within the next 5 years. i qualify for the VA loan so i dont necessarily NEED a down payment, but i would personally feel comfortable having one. 

i just dont know what to do. our household income is about 83k a year. my car payment is 275, but i pay 300. its a simple loan through wells fargo. my plan is to refinance next year.

personalfinance,Need help with understanding equity and possible fraud,"My SO's parents marriage is on the rocks, their house is worth around £280k and they have paid off around 110k. So my SO's nan (dads mum) came over the other day and asked SOs parents if they can lend her 50k so she can pay off money she loaned on the equity on her house. Her house is worth around 280k and her Mortgage was fully paid off, although here's where it gets REALLY complicated. SOs parents would only be able to lend her 50k if they took out equity on their home, leaving their home only having 50k paid off. The nan says that she can't keep up with her payments on the equity she took out, she didn't take equity out with the bank, but with a private company who have a high interest rate, she borrowed a total of 30k in order to pay the bank 30k of her deceased husbands death around 2-3 years ago and now owes 50k... 
It all seems odd to me. Here's my questions..
1. If she owned 100% of the house, why wouldn't the bank let her take out or borrow 30k of the house's worth?
2. Would she now be able to take 50k out of the bank in order to pay off the 50k to private company and pay bank back at a much lower rate?
3. Is it possible that SOs father is trying to take money out of equity in their home in order to make a nest egg that's safe with his mother?
4. If so, would that be fraudulent?
5. Is it odd that SOs nan also said that if she can't pay back 50k, she wouldn't be able to leave any money to anyone (she  told SOs mother a few times that ""the grandchildrens will is at risk""

personalfinance,Minnesota Student Loan Refinance Program. Choosing Between Variable And Fixed Rate Options.,"The State of Minnesota has just allowed for student loans to be refinanced. Here is their [website](http://www.selfrefi.state.mn.us/calculatorAction.cfm) on the matter.

I am currently in a 15 year repayment program through Great Lakes and my payment amount is $241.88 per month. I have approximately 11 years worth of payments left and my total balance remaining is $19,831.16. My interest rate on this loan is a fixed 6.25%

I'm looking at doing the 10 or 15-year options that are available. The 5-year payment plan would be too much of a burden to budget for, unfortunately. Right now, I'm leaning towards the 10 Year option. So my choice is limited to whether I should go with a fixed rate again, or whether I should take the risk and go for the variable rate. The rate is based on the 1-month LIBOR and will use the rate at the beginning of each quarter (January, April, July, October) for that quarter's payments. The maximum interest rate that could be used is 18%, should the LIBOR ever get that high in the future. 

With the recent [LIBOR Rate History](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/USD1MTD156N), the variable rate is very enticing, so I wanted to get your opinions here to see if that is worth the risk. Any comments pro or con are appreciated.

personalfinance,"Should I refinance, and what is the actual process for ending FHA PMI?","I purchased a townhouse back in July 2012. The original loan balance was $91,300. It's a 30 year FHA loan with an interest rate of 3.75%. Monthly PMI is $87.23. I've made some early prepayments along the way, and the current mortgage balance is $67,600.

I'm trying to decide whether to refinance. I have an offer on the table from a mortgage company to refinance to a 15 year mortgage at 3.25%, with closing costs of about $2600. I'm trying to decide if it's worth it.

If I understand how the FHA PMI works correctly, then the PMI should drop off in July 2017, or about 18 months. From what I've read, it seems you need to have both 20% LTV and five years of premiums paid. I have the 20% already due to the early principle payments I made, and in 18 months I'll have the required time length.

The question is, is it worth the closing costs? I'll save a bit on the interest rate, but the big savings is in the PMI. 

Also, what's the actual process and method for removing FHA PMI once you reach the five year mark? Will it happen automatically, or will I need to go through a long process with the lender involving a bunch of fees and charges? Once you reach the requirements, how does one actually physically go about getting the PMI dropped?",finance,1453667211

Now the big tamale:  
Car loan July 2014, 18% interest rate (my credit is really bad) and I didn't have a choice, I *NEEDED* the car or I would have been fired a short time later. I should've just gave up on the job but I had just graduated and I really wanted to start my career so I did it. Buying a cheap A to B car wasn't an option. So please, don't get into me not getting the loan or the loan being a mistake because that's in the past and there's nothing I can do about that now.  
Loan Amount: $14,000, Balance After Repossession: $10,000. Current status: Charged off as bad debt/ collection. No longer on report as a repossession.  
I'd LIKE to pay a settlement on it, without interest, because I'm pretty upset on principle that they sold the car for literally 40% of its market value. I'm basically going to be paying 100% of the market value of the car, after they repossessed it and I'm not a fan of that at all.  
So what I'd like to do is:  
Settle for half of what the balance is, with payments, and an agreement to delete.  
Or file for chapter 13.  
Will the threat of a chapter 13 make them play ball? I have no assets, no house, no car, no savings. If anything, a chapter 13 might make me more debt worthy than I am now.  
I realize this isn't a lot of debt, but there's a 0% possibility that i'm going to pay them $10,000 with an interest rate of 18% (keeping the loan in my name) after they took the car and sold it the way they did. No one can convince me otherwise.  
The question is how much weight a Chapter 13 threat plays with banks in this situation? And has anyone successfully negotiated a 50% settlement PFD on a repossession?  
I work in a field that's in such high demand, that companies will hire you even if you have a repossession and even a strike on your record. It's a field that doesn't depend on security clearance or government positions so I'm not worried about that.  
Mostly I'm just concerned with how to not pay the $10,000 balance and still continue to fix my credit.  
I won't apply everything I have after expenses/fixed toward debt. Not a chance. I'm keeping/spending 10~20% on myself, regardless of what option I choose.

**The questions I have are entirely about taxes owed to the U.S.**

Fast-forward to 2015, this is where my tax situation gets a little weird.

In 2015 I received a study grant from the Finnish government, and housing grant for students from the Finnish government. I also took a student loan and received a Grant from my university to study in Ireland where I lived for 5 months. **In 2015, I paid €0/$0 in tuition.**

Student grant: €303.19/mo. before tax. (x9 months)

Housing Grant:€122/mo. before tax. (x9 months)
These were taxed at 8% by the Finnish government.

My university grant of roughly €1,000 was not taxed.

**For study related grants and income (not including loan) I received €4552.92 in 2015.**

Of this, I spent €1,830 on rent in Foreign countries.

After Ireland, I went to the U.S. (Washington) to work for 70 days or so. While working I paid very little in taxes (Federal: $130.52, WA State: $349.29, FICA: $283.08, Medicare: $66.21). I only made $4565.94 of W2 income.

After leaving the U.S. I came back to Finland and began working on my thesis. I also **started an LLC with 2 other people**. It has made no income in the last several months (it is surviving during product development on a bank loan made to the organization) but I received **€400 salary for 1 month, of which I paid 8% in taxes to Finland.**

Essentially, I am trying to calculate what (if anything) I owe in taxes. I am both a student and small business owner who lived abroad and worked in the U.S. during 2015. Because of this, every time I try to make sense of what I might owe to the U.S. with software like turbotax, it doesn't seem to be able to take all of this into account, and I'm terrified of doing something wrong. Any help here?

**TL;DR - I made €4,552.92 in grants and $4,997.88 in income for 2015. I paid WA state tax of $349.29, and Federal tax of $130.52. Am I going to owe anything?**",finance,1453667815

It's an annual interest rate but it's calculated daily and paid monthly? Ah! Is this even a good idea to do?

personalfinance,What to do with my car (Canada)?,"Hi there,

I am not sure what to do with my car. In March 2013, I bought an honda civic LX for my wife and I. At that time, I hadn't saved money for a car and I needed one for a new job. I bought new for the following reasons:

1) Warranty
2) Interest rate for buying used were 8-9%
3) Did not have saved funds.

So I bought the car which cost $24000 and with a monthly interest rate of 2.9% which sums up to about 29k. I pay $353 monthly on a period over 7 years. Now, my car has about 48K and it will have 3 years in March. I still have 4 years to go to pay it off completely.

I am not sure what to do? Sell it to get max possible cash? Now? In 2 years? or use it all the way until it dies. My warranty will be over in March because Honda comes with a 3 year warranty. If you need more, you have to pay. I don't want to wait too much were the resale value will be too low. 

I was thinking that I could maybe sell this car, assume the difference between the amount of money I could sell the car now and how much left I have to pay. I have already paid 34 months, so it sums to about $12 002. I could sell the car at maybe 14K?? Is this right?  

What I would do is lease a new car. I would probably get something cheaper like a Kia forte 5 doors. I would like to lower my monthly payment. My mind is not set on anything. I am not a guy that likes cars, so I don't know anything about it. I don't seem to trust people where they sell cars because they will tell/demonstrate you anything to get a sell.

Auto Sales record high, gas low and economy slowly improving, makes sense. But has auto sales peaked? Suddenly auto companies are investing heavy into driverless cars. Gearing for the future after a recession or anticipating more demand?

Unemployment low, but is this going to be justified or is it due to ""sharing economy"" companies and seasonal workers?

I'm making about $76k (pre-tax) a year, I have a $103k mortgage with 6.125% interest, and about $33k in student loans (about $18,750 at a 3.86% interest rate and the remaining $12,500 at a 4.66% interest rate).  My company has a 401k with matching, but the matching doesn't kick in until I've been there for a year. 

Three questions:

1. Kick some money towards the 401k or wait until matching is valid and instead tackle the student loans as aggressively as I can?  I *think* tackling the loans is the right way to go, especially since that is what the ""basic financial advice"" wiki page seems to say,  but I wanted to double check. 

2. Asset Allocation: I've got three options 
    -  I can pick a target retirement date portfolio that is ""designed so that to invest you can simply determine the target year when you want to start withdrawing your savings. ... Your portfolio is managed by a team of investment professionals and these professionals will change the portfolio's asset mix for you over time."" These appear to be BlackRock LifePath Portfolios.
   - I can choose from ""core funds"" like JPMorgan Stable Value Fund, BlackRock U.S. Debt Index Fund, BlackRock Balanced Fund, Dodge &amp; Cox Stock Fund, BlackRock Equity Index Fund, T. Rowe Price Large Cap Growth Fnd, WEDGE Mid Cap Value Fund, Times Square Mid Cap Strategy Fund, Dodge &amp; Cox International Stock Fund, TS&amp;W Domestic Small Cap Value, Stephens Domestic Small Cap Value.
    -  Or a self-directed brokerage account through Schwab PCRA where I can select ""from a wide variety of mutual funds and from most publicly traded stocks and bonds."" This has a one time $50 fee and a $10 quarterly ""maintenance fee"".

      This part I'm not sure about. In fact, I'm not even sure how to educate myself to make a reasonable decision and I'm not comfortable picking the first option because someone else will just take care of it. How can I evaluate these options to make a smart decision?

3. Company stock purchase program: Company stock is available at a 15% discount.  Even if the company is large, well known, and usually profitable, is there a circumstance where this is a smart idea?  I don't think so, but again I'm so new to all this that I wanted to check.

I need some advice.","As I mentioned in the title, I recently got married (24yo) and the two of us bought a $400k house. We put 10% down and have 3.875% interest, which left us with a $360k loan over 30 years.  We also have $25k in student loans with a 6.8% interest rate. Between the two of us we make roughly $125k per year and have about $30k in stocks. 

I am looking for some direction on where I should put our money for the future. I personally am really wanting to pay our house off in the shortest amount of time possible, so I've been paying an extra $1k per month towards principle. Even though we have a 30 year mortgage, I'm aiming to do it in under 15. I know that we could get a 15 year mortgage, but I enjoy having the flexibility for what we can do with our monthly payment. 

Aside from that I'm really just looking to get some solid advice on how exactly we should go about paying things off and saving for the future. We both have our 401(k) paid in full up to the match by our employers. 

Some questions that I have are: Should I continue to pay extra towards our house each month or should I put it all towards the student loan until it's paid off, should we be putting more into our 401(k), what other financial investments should we make for the future, etc.?

personalfinance,Question about claiming a dependent (may be specifically in regards to TurboTax).,"This year I'm claiming my sister as a dependent. I did my taxes through TurboTax. When I claimed her as a dependent it said ""$4000"" would be allotted to me due to claiming her, but that number did not initially appear on the left hand side of my screen with my current Federal/State refunds (the numbers next to my current federal/state refunds only updated as I entered individual sources of income/W2's).
At the very end of my third W2 (before I had even indicated that it was my last W2) my 'current federal refund' did re-calculate to be about $4132. I figured that at the end it would add the additional $4000 from claiming my sister as a dependent, but I got to the very very last screen of filing and the federal refund never went any higher.


So I'm a little confused. I highly doubt that my third W2 (which was from my most lucrative source of income) only gained me $132.00, leaving the rest of my $4000 federal refund to be from claiming my sister. However, if I am receiving the additional $4000 it's strange that it didn't appear factored into any of the screens that listed how much money I'd be receiving.


Am I reading something wrong? Do I not get any additional money from claiming my sister because I made so much from my W2s? Did I do something incorrectly? Does anyone else have experience with turbotax that can verify that I am getting an additional $4000 that wasn't listed when I finished filing?",finance,1453681868

I took a semester off and because it overlapped with summer, I was out of college for 6 months and therefore was required to start making payments on a loan.

Should I just estimate and pay the interest/penalties and minimize additional interest? Could the 2012 refund have offset some of the interest for 2010 and 2012...or is each year treated separately ? Will it be awhile until the IRS bills on the older years?

personalfinance,"Got W2 from a previous employer, says I paid LESS in taxes than I actually did","So, some context: 

My old boss was an asshat, and I worked as his assistant basically. He paid me with checks (no official clock-in clock-out type of situation) and deducted my taxes from my paycheck manually. He wrote the amounts at the bottom of the checks so I had them for my records. I only worked with him during January, he never paid me my last paycheck, I filed a complaint with the Dept. of Labor and got my last check a month later, and had to contact him to send my W2. 

I have two of the three checks he gave me, and am in the process of getting my bank statements to figure out if they scanned a copy of the check for deposit/etc so I can see the amounts.

I just did the calculation and the taxes on my W2 only state the taxes taken out of 2 of my paychecks (which I have hard copies of), but the amount is $120 more than the 2 paychecks I received. So I'm assuming there are taxes that were taken out that weren't stated on my W2. 

Numbers:
 &gt; W2 Statement
 
* federal withheld: 65.74
* social security withheld: 44.64
* medicare withheld: 10.44
* total wages: 720

&gt; Check 1

* federal: 47.78
* social: 26.04
* medicare: 6.09
* total pay: 340.91

* federal: 17.96
* social: 18.60
* medicare: 4.35
* total pay: 259.09

Bitcoin,Why Bitcoin Won't Go To The Moon This Year. Or: How I'm Procrastinating From My BA,"First off, the both titles is stretching the truth a bit. This is tangently related to my BA, and the other part... I'm not putting the tl;dr here. Go look at the bottom for that

So, lurking around in here, it seems like you guys think Bitcoin could go to the moon, or 1000 USD. That seems like it's *really* far away, considering the [current price is ~399 USD](http://bitcointicker.co/). Also, it seems like you currently view Bitcoin as a *really* volatile investment rather than a currency, since you are really happy whenever the price goes up, and kinda shrugs when it goes down. That means we can use normal stock evaluation tools to look at Bitcoin. That's where my BA project comes in.

My project is about pricing options, and a part of that is forecasting stock prices. I'm doing that by following the Monte Carlo process outlined in [Wikipedia]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_in_finance#Sample_paths_for_standard_models). As you can see, we need a volatility and µ. However, µ is defined to be the riskfree interest rate, and over a year, that's currently [0,47%](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield). The volatility can be read on WolframAlpha, and over the last year, that comes out to [51% over a year](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=bitcoin+vs+dollars). By pluging all that into the formula on Wikipedia, we get a sample path for the value of Bitcoin. One such path is seen [here](http://imgur.com/Uq8NJNB), and another is seen [here](http://imgur.com/J4H2Axr). As you can see, really volatile, just like real life Bitcoin. You could argue that the first is unrealistic, because people might not want to get back into bitcoin once it hits 300, but that's besides the point.

So, to get back on track, what I did then was to put in a check to see if my model Bitcoin hit $1000 and then run the simulation 50000 times. The result, when running using 341 days, because that's what's left in the year, was that it hit 1000 in 3512 of them, or 7,024% of them. Not necessarily staying there, mind you. Just hit it. However, if we are a bit less ambitous with our ""moon"" wishes, and say 750 is good enough, we get 9570 hits, or 19,14% of the time.

To put those numbers into perspective, 538 puts the odds of [Hillary winning the Iowa election at 82%](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/iowa-democratic/) and Kasich winning in New Hampshire at 9%, which means the odds of both happening is 7,38%, better than the odds of Bitcoin hitting 1000. If we stay on the political scene, 538 puts the odds of Bernie winning in Iowa at 18%, which is only slightly worse than the odds of 750 BTC

tl;dr: Bitcoin has 7,38% shot at getting to the moon this year",cryptocurrency,1453736884

I have about $3500 in savings but don't feel comfortable dishing that out, as I am building up a little emergency fund.

-----
I'm one of those people that lost money having their account closed in the middle of a trade and was never given a reason why.  Though I can think of several reasons they might have done it.

I ran BTC-TC (btct.co) and was fined by the SEC for doing it.  I paid my fine, there were never any criminal charges involved, and the shutdown was orderly.

I also used btc-e.com quite a bit back in the day.  Not that there were many other choices.

I have never had a darknet market account, or done anything illegal with my coins.

Ultimately, it's their right to close my account.  But not in the middle of a trade.  They had a fiduciary duty as my broker to do what was in my financial best interest.  That's the law.  They could have completed the trade, THEN closed the account.  Instead, they went to extra effort to back out the trade, costing me an approximate 9% gain as the bitcoin price rose while they had custody of my funds.

Now they have not only closed my account, but they are preventing my access to the records I need to meet my legal obligations with my Federal and State taxes.  They still allow me to log in, but reject API requests and redirect all requests to coinbase.com/reports to coinbase.com/closed_account.

When I closed BTC-TC - a one-man hobby site - I rewrote the code to allow continued access to account records via API and CSV download, and kept the site online well after tax season, at my out-of-pocket expense.  How is it that Coinbase, with their millions, can't figure out how to handle this stuff?

Why post this publicly?  Other than just feeling butt-hurt?  (which I am not going to deny... I've sent many friends and family to Coinbase.)  Because I want them to improve! ...and I don't think any of my back and forth with ""support"" is going to achieve the awareness necessary.

So here it is... Coinbase... get with it!  Be the service we all want and deserve!


**Update &amp; Add:** I have received XLS files from Coinbase.  Here's to hoping they fix the system so no one else has to deal with this in the future.  I can't imagine it'd be all that hard to send the files with the cancellation notice.

I'll also add that this is not a case of support not responding.  I made my initial request November 24, 2015 and support promptly replied the next day telling me to go to coinbase.com/reports.  Problem is that that doesn't work, and they've been cancelling accounts for years.  Plenty of time to hammer out the details.

- $2000 of debt on an Amex Blue/Clear card (ditto above) Minimum payment is $60
- $30,000 in government school loans (mostly unsubsidized, so interest is accruing) due in 3 months (got sick and used part of the grace period already). I think the minimum payment will be around $250-$275/month, but the Penfed website isn't showing what it will be anymore.
- Income is usually about $200/week in the winter, probably for the next couple months. This has been killing me. (I worked part-time in a restaurant while finishing college; $600/week in the summer with more hours and more business, $200/week in the winter with less hours and less tips. Trying to find a second job while also looking for a ""real job"" in my field.)
- No savings
- Other bills—internet is about $40/month, power is about $40-100 a month (after splitting with my girlfriend)
- Rent is $650/month

So, basically, I'm not really making it right now. Trying to get more hours and a second job, and I'm also applying to jobs in an art-related field. May or may not get a job, and if I do, it'll probably be barely $20,000 a year. My income this past year (2015) was right around $20,000. Luckily my girlfriend helps me out, so I'm not starving, and bills get paid on time regardless of what is (or isn't) in my bank account.

My father was paying my health insurance at $275 (about)/month for the past couple of years, which he's now ending because he'll need to start paying my loans. My mom is broke, but she pays my car insurance, and as soon as I'm making more money, I'd like to take it over for her. And the restaurant I work at closes in the slow season, Late december through early February, so my income drops to the vacation pay they give me—$70/week.

The complication is that I kinda live between two states. I went to school in New York, but left my residency in Connecticut, which was legal (mainly so that my mom could claim me as a dependent and get a bigger tax break, which she needs). My car is registered in Connecticut. It's probably worth about $3500, so I'm going to try to sell it when I get back to my place in New York.

I'm currently trying to figure out if it would be cheaper (if technically not legal) to leave my residency at my mom's in Connecticut, and go on the Connecticut healthcare exchange ( https://www.accesshealthct.com/ ), or if I should change my residency to NY (I'm living with my girlfriend in an apartment in upstate NY, we're planning on moving into her parent's place in NYC once she graduates this spring) and get on the NY healthcare exchange. The Connecticut website says I qualify for aid, which would bring my healthcare cost down to about $70/month (which I could handle). Car insurance quotes (liability only) are about $75/month in NY. I haven't gotten a NY healthcare quote yet, because honestly it is much more complicated, and I've been busy, and this (my father cutting me off) has all gone down in the last couple days. I'm pretty flustered. Not really thinking clearly.

So, I need some sort of plan. Until June I'm pretty much stuck with my expenses (I can't move out and leave my girlfriend paying $1300/month without my paying half the rent). I know I need to budget, but budgeting doesn't really work when my monthly income doesn't even cover my basic bills, so that's more for the future, and I have been using Mint, though I think I need a better system.

Should I consolidate the credit card debt onto one low-interest card/loan? Should I stick with CT residency or change to NY?

personalfinance,Looking for a calculator to calculate using the monthly payments from loans as they wrap up to accelerate paying for other loans with longer terms...,"Here is the situation...currently have 9 student loans between my wife and I, plus mortgage.

I would like a calculator to figure out if once loan A is paid off, and I stick that into the highest interest rate loan, and then B, and then C etc etc until all are paid off, including my mortgage, how long would it be until we were debt free.

Another way of saying it would be how long it would take to be debt free if I always paid the same amount monthly no matter how much less we owed. 

Does anyone know of a calculator that does this sort of complex analysis?

personalfinance,"Currently managing a $15000 loan at 6.7%, just got offered another $5000 1 year loan at 2.7%, is it worth taking it to help consolidate debt?","So, a little bit of background info:

I consider myself fairly good at managing debt, I've got a Visa with a $14000 credit limit that generally sits at $0, I recently finished paying off my $37000 student loan (7% interest, had a 10 year term but accelerated payments and paid it off in 4).

I'm getting married in the spring and saving up for that, my goal is to pay for it up front without having to borrow any money.  Barring any unforseen circumstances, we should be okay.

Also paying mortgage on a house, 2 years into our first 5 year mortgage term, we have boarders living with us to bring in extra cash.

The issue is that my fiance ran up a bit of debt and was struggling to break even paying interest on a $8000 19.5% Visa and a $7000 line of credit at 11%.  I was offered $15000 at a lower interest rate (6.7%) by the bank so I saw the opportunity to help consolidate her loan and also take control of the finances.  This way she makes loan payments to me, and she dropped her Visa limit to $1000 so she doesn't overspend on it, and now I handle all the bill payments and budgeting.  Her loan is now at $0 and I now carry the $15000 debt load, albeit at a much lower rate, freeing up extra cash to save for the wedding.

We plan on paying down on that $15000 as soon as the honeymoon is over.  Now the bank has offered me $5000 at prime rate for a year.  My thinking is that I accept the loan, and transfer $5000 into the cheaper loan account and save a bit more on interest fees.  I'm not going into any more debt, just getting a better rate.  Right?  I have no plans to go any deeper in debt, and I make enough money and feel I'm disciplined enough not to dig into that extra available borrowing money.  Is there a flaw in my plan?  I'm thinking the credit pull will probably damage my credit rating in the short term, but the bank seems to be willing to offer me lots of money at ever-lower interest rates without me even asking for it, so is the lower credit score even an issue?",finance,1453756525

personalfinance,Is there any benefit to maintaining the same checking account for a long time?,"I've had a checking account at the same bank--- Chase--- for a long time.  I recently opened a savings account there as well (I know the interest rates are bad, I just wanted something that could easily do an automatic monthly deposit into.  I'm probably going to open an Ally account to be my main savings account with most of my emergency fund savings, to get better interest).

Now, I have very poor credit.  Let 2 thousand-dollar credit card bills go to collections 5.5 years ago.  I understand that those 2 old debts will fall off my credit report in a year and a half, and I will be able to rebuild my credit then.  But I've gotten antsy to get started on the rebuilding, so I learned about secured credit cards and just applied for the Wells Fargo one today.

The Wells Fargo secured card appealed to me, because after a year (or so, it's up to them) of use it can eventually transition to an unsecured card, and I'll get my collateral back without having to cancel anything.  The folks at the bank mentioned that if I transferred my checking account to them, it would likely speed up the process of me eventually getting approved for an unsecured card (because they could see that I never had any overdrafts on the account, I carry a decent balance in checking, etc).  

I don't have any particular loyalty to Chase as a checking account bank.  There's a convenient location, the app works well, never had any problems.  But Wells Fargo has the same.  I'm wondering, all things being equal, if I shouldn't transfer my checking account to WF, to help speed the process to an unsecured card and eventually rebuilding my credit.  

What I don't know, is would I be hurting myself or losing anything, to give up a checking account I've had for 5 years?  Chase doesn't offer a secured credit card and can't do anything in particular for me, but I had hoped that by establishing a multi-year relationship with a bank that would help rebuild my credit in some way.

I am fairly confident I could manage a *standard repayment plan* over 10 years and pay down all the debt at about $420/month. However, wanting to utilize the *avalanche repayment method*, I came up with an alternative plan that I want to make sure is feasible. What if I switched the plan to an *extended standard repayment* plan over 30 years, but still payed the debt down as if I was on a 10 year plan. Then I could apply the 'surplus' payment (around $200) directly to the highest interest loans, rather than being spread out over all 4 loans.

My wife and I make a pretty good living. Combined, we made $321,000 last year (~$221k on my w2 and ~$100k on hers). Yet, despite withholding and 401k, we owe an additional $16k in federal taxes (and $1k in state). I don't have all my 1099's yet, so this number only stands to go up!

We have one child and own a home on which we pay a mortgage. With our income level, we don't seem to qualify for most income deductions.

When I had put in _only_ my w2, TurboTax estimated that we would get a $5k refund. That sounded good to me! As soon as I added my wife's w2 to the mix, everything took a turn for the worse.

Even more frustrating - last year we owed $8000. I remember increasing my withholding specifically to avoid this situation. Somehow it became much worse.

Is increasing my withholding an additional $1400/month our only hope?

stocks,The United States Federal Reserve in relation to the U.S. Economy (Stocks),"The U.S. Federal Reserve is a massive agency that lends a firm, yet guiding hand for the U.S. Economy. 

Though there are many branches to the Federal Reserve, I want to focus on the Federal Funds Rate (Interest Rates).

From my perspective, the FEDS will lower interest rates if analysts suspect the markets will perform poorly. On the other hand, The Feds will increase rates if analysts suspect the markets have reached or will soon reach their peaks.

Depository Banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America or even Credit Unions are required by U.S. Law to maintain at least 10% of their assests in cash value. The goal is to prevent banks from being overstrained and to safeguard against another financial depression.

When Banks issue money, they recoupe their losses by tacking on interest rates. These help pay worker salary and keep the lights on. 

When Banks are in need of Money, the Federal Reserve will sell the financial institutions ""Debt"" in the form of a loan. This money can be used by a bank to create even more money. 

When the federal reserve adds more money to a system (society), interest rates become lower due to competition. This stimulates the U.S. economy because people take advantage of the low rates and purchase trade goods (Cars, Houses and Entertainment). This creates jobs.

Question: Why would the FEDS ever INCREASE rates? Wouldn't this hurt the economy and production. Why wouldn't the U.S. Federal Reserve Keep Interest rates at 0.

personalfinance,Is it worth paying off a student loan early?,"Hi, r/personalfinance.

This is the first year that I'm looking into taxes now that I have graduated college and have a full-time job. I have a couple of federal loans with ~~varying interest rates~~ *two fixed interest rates; two loans have 3.40%, and two loans have 3.86%*, but let's call it 3.80% where principal is $20.5k.  

Today I learned that interest paid on loans is tax-deductible - yay! It looks like in the first year, I'll have paid about $700 in interest, $670 in interest in the second year, and it continues to scale down over 10 years where my monthly payments are a little over $200/month. I have no other outstanding debt except for a lease, and a 0% loan from my mother. I'm not sure exactly what deferring paying off the loan entirely would do to my expected return over the term- maybe like -2%? - but after a certain point when the interest payments become small enough within 5-6 years (6th year comes in at about $380 in interest), I could just pay it all off at that point. I have read on a few articles that ""it's not worth it,"" but this seems sensible to me.

I think a big hole in my thought-process is that I'm not sure how much I get back from the interest payments on my tax return.

Assuming you can get greater than a ~2% return on some investment, it sounds worth it to me. Can anyone provide me with more explanation, or an article or source that may break it down a bit more?

I spoke to a few financially literate friends, who told me my total salary contribution towards retirement should be somewhere in the area of 10%.

So my questions are as follows:

1) What should be my contributions into my 401k. I don't mind managing it semi-annually or annually, but I'm not sure if there are any fees for doing so. If I wanted to be as hands-off as possible, I'd imagine that 100% of it should go into the TA Vanguard Instl Trg Re 2050 account, which is what it automatically put me at when I signed up. I looked into some of the other funds, which had 5-star ratings, with above average returns and low risks, and the three that fell into that category were the American Century Mid Cap Value, Janus Triton, and American Funds New Perspective Ret Acct. I'm currently set to deposit 85% into the 2050 account, and 5% into each of the others. Good or Bad idea?

2) Since my company only matches 3% of my salary, should I cap my 401k contributions to that, and invest the other chunk of it into something like a Vanguard IRA?

3) If either of those are completely off base, what would you suggest?

Thank you very much in advance for any advice.

EDIT:

I also forgot to mention that I have student loans. The other plan was to contribute the 3% and then pay off all my loans that have over a 4% interest rate, before I plan on investing anything extra over the 3%.",finance,1453777497

personalfinance,Military Tax Question - State of Legal Residence,"Update - 
I talked to JAG and to the Virginia tax help-line. It looks like I *did* change my state of residence to Washington prior to coming on active duty. Honestly, given that when I in-processed I already owned a house and had a WA driver's license that makes sense. In-processing the military and having a baby within the space of a few weeks was fairly overwhelming so I didn't keep a record of the change but both places confirmed that I'm legally a WA resident. Huge relief. Thanks!

Virginia and Washington State

I was commissioned in 2012 in Virginia into active duty with the Army. I moved to Washington state for 3 years shortly after. While in Washington state, I bought a house, got a drivers license, registered to vote, etc. I thought that this made me a legal resident of Washington state, which doesn't have an income tax. I filed federal taxes through the base from 2012-2014, but because Washington state has no income tax didn't file state taxes. I moved to Texas last summer.

I was wondering what my refund might look like this year, so I went through Turbotax tonight and clicked on Texas as my state of residence. I read the pop-up, which said that as a military member my legal residence is the state where I joined the military. Virginia *does* have an income tax, so if VA has somehow been my legal residence since 2012, I'm 4 years behind on my Virginia state taxes. As far as I can tell, I met all the requirements for being a legal resident of WA besides filing a DD2058, which I frankly didn't know existed until 20 minutes ago. I'm going to call JAG in the morning, but does anyone out there know if I'm going to owe VA 4 years of back taxes?",finance,1453778203

personalfinance,What can cause low federal tax withholding (other than num of allowances) ?,"Hi all,

I'm going through my taxes and to my surprise, it seems like we're in a debt instead of getting a return.

My wife and I had a single job this year, we filled our W4's as married with 0 allowances for most of the year; when our daughter was born, we changed it to 1. My wife did it on Nov 1st and I did on Dec 15. 

Yet, according to a bunch of calculators, we're missing about $7K and I have a feeling it's not because the number of allowances. What else could have caused that?

personalfinance,Someone help with understanding my return,"Hello PF, I have learned a lot from this community and would like to ask you guys for some advice. Ever since i was 15, I would receive all of my federal taxes back that i payed. I turned 18 in October this year. When I was filing for my tax return on turbo tax, it told me i was supposed to get $507 back, exactly half of what i paid in federal. My parents have always claimed me as a dependent and it never has affected it, and they are this year. I moved from nj to fl, this will be my first w2 in fl. Every other tax return was filed in nj, but i dont think that should matter with federal taxes. 

Also, I have very little in dividends, and about $1900ish in capital gains i would say. I need to find the form for the dividends, and i will sold stocks and was gifted them, not sure when as i was a child and my parents are not sure either, so i will check how much i sold them for and claim it all as capital gains. I am positive it is under $2000 

Can anyone tell me if this is the way i should file my return, and to why my federal is cut in half? I did a tax calculator on HR Block and said i was getting $906 back, which again is a little weird but more then what i stated before.

Thank you",finance,1453783686

I am 23 years old and a full time student for at least half of 2015, and I have always filed as a dependent. Last year, my income was only around 3k and I received about $300 in returns (fed+state). This year, I made around 11k and had $600 Fed withheld and $250 from State. TurboTax says I should only get $49 from Fed back, and $48 from state. Does this seem correct?",finance,1453787233

I'm in the process of trying to get myself going on budgeting 101.  I've tried before but it always seems so damn overwhelming, but at this point there's no excuse.  So I'm working on getting myself budgeted out using one of the awesome spreadsheets in the initial ""How to handle $"" page and I'm thinking of driving for Lyft until I get caught up.

Right now, I just paid off my car payment from what I was behind, but I still owe about $600 for car insurance and $200 by the 1st for energy.  I also have no idea where I'm going to get my $300 health insurance payment from.... I have, at best, about $200 left in money before my paycheck that will hit sometime next week (my boss has trouble remembering to pay me on the same days.) (My health insurance is supposed to go away, given that as of January I'm supposed to become a normal employee instead of a 1099 contractor, but something that was presented as a guaranteed switch is actually something that's up in the air, which I didn't realize when I selected my health insurance 3 months ago, and now I'm worried that I can't afford it.  Basically, I'll have to go with a drastically cheaper policy if I don't become a normal employee.)

I've really been realizing how much my car expenses are impacting me.  My housing costs are less than 25% of my income, so that's not a serious stress.  However, I pay $360 per month on my car, and $300 per insurance.  I owe 5545 on my car as of the payment that I just sent, and my interest rate is 9.49%.  I got my car brand new (I know) when I was 20, without a cosigner, so I signed a 63 month contract.  I realize that the end is in sight on my car loan (ish) and at this point my car is worth more than I owe (although body damage from parking in a shitty work lot that got me a ton of door dings and high mileage due to work definitely doesn't help.  My credit score is a 559 right now, mainly due to the fact that I'm about maxed out on my current lines of credit.  

**Given what I said here, is it worth attempting to refinance my car?  Should I try to sell my car and use the approximately $3,000 of profit as a down payment on a used car that's more within my means?  Given my nonexistent savings right now, would that be worth it since I'd likely have to pay more in maintenance on an older, less reliable car?  Or should I really not focus on making these big changes right now and instead focus on getting used to a routine budget?**

Edit: Despite my current financial situation, I have paid extra on almost every single car payment I have made, so I should be paying off my car early.  Not sure if that factors in much?",finance,1453787647

personalfinance,Could use some advice on credit card billing/payment after taking a cash advance.,"Could anyone help fill me in on how paying back cash advances on CCs work, and perhaps some advice on how I should move forwrad? I took one a couple months ago, and my CC billing isn't making sense to me.

Background: I got married last year. I have one credit card (BoA) with a much higher credit limit than my others, so in the run up to the wedding as expenses were piling up, I defaulted to that one, and topped out about $10k. While on the phone with BoA over another issue, I mentioned that my balance was due to wedding expenses, and the rep offered a cash advance. I normally wouldn't bother, but the offer came with a promotional APR of 0% for 18 months. I did have plenty of other costs to deal with, and it was helpful, so I took a $5k cash advance.
 
After the wedding expenses ceased, I decided on the snowball approach, paying off the smaller cards first. Thus I have not been paying much more than the min payment on this card for the last couple months. I was under the impression that the min payment would go towards my card balance (with the higher interest rate), and then anything over would go to the cash advance. However, after two months of the bills not lining up with my projections, I reviewed the allocation statement on my bill. BoA states that they 'allocate the amount of your payment equal to the Total Minimum Payment Due to the lowest APR balances first.' Excess will go to higher APR balances. This seems to have caused my snowball plan to backfire, as most of what I've paid has gone to the 0% interest account, and I'm getting a lot more interest on my balance and higher min payments, negating the whole purpose of taking the advance in the first place.

This seems wrong to me, but before I go raging into BoA, I was hoping to get some advice here. Is BoA in the right or no? Is there anything I can do to change the allocation priorities? Should I change them if I can? Maybe I switch from snowball to the other one, and just hit this CC. I'm just not sure. Any advice would be great. Thanks Reddit!

personalfinance,What should I do with my return?,"I'm 25, making around 47k now entering my second year working full time. I'm living on my dads couch, who can barely afford his $1850 rent payment - so I have been paying him 400 a month for this 'privilege'. This is a whole other topic for a different day that I can't bother to type out on my IPhone right now...  

So basically, here are my expenses. Car: $305.  Student loan: $250. Car ins: $169. Past due tuition that I negotiated into a payment plan: $100 for the next 5 months. (Odd, I got money in my return for this, the bill is from 2014..) Phone: $100. 'Rent': $400. Gas: $80-100. Gym: $30. BOA CC: $100 set on auto transfer from my checking; the balance is around $1,669. I also have $25 a week on payday being deposited into a betterment account. I earn $2404 a month. Around $1500 a month in expenses...

I'll be getting around $2300 back from fed + NYS taxes in a few weeks. Should I pay $1000 right away into that BOA card? And put $1k into my betterment account?  Should I pay off the CC in full? Ideally I want to be saving money to move out, should that money just sit in my checking account? Paying my dad, who has taught me many life lessons on what NOT to do, is killing me inside. I want to save that $400 to move into an apt with some friends by June, when this lease is up, but with these expenses, it scares me. 

I sit down ever few weeks and hand write out my expenses, and wonder how it would be if I had to shell out close to an extra $1,000 in rent and utilities, if I'd be able to survive here on LI, NY. Food and pleasure spending would be very scarce. I'm trying to find a weekend job. I wish it wasn't so damn expensive here.

**Fixing the mess::**  

My first priority is paying off the credit card and keeping the balance under $50 every month. I am debating on using my CC to pay big bills such as rent to accumulate points once I clear the current balance. I'm currently with PC Mastercard in Canada and get 1% cashback at their grocery stores. Obviously the card would be paid off immediately after paying rent with it. This would save me a few dollars on food per month. Are there any downsides to this, or better alternatives?  

Secondly I want to lower all my bills as much as possible. Rent can't be changed until August when my lease is up and when I'll be moving to the new city. I just changed my phone plan to the minimum possible (for my situation) which is $35. Internet bill will be lowered about $10/month as well.  
  
My biggest priority with lowering bills is food. I live 5 minutes from a grocery store but find myself ordering in too often, especially when I have friends over. I'm going to be using /r/mealprepsunday, /r/cheapmeals and a few other cheap food related subs to cut my food cost to &lt;$100 per month. I live alone so this shouldn't be too difficult. Cutting my food cost by more than half while eating more, healthier food will serve as a great motivator.  

So assuming I stick with these changes, my monthly college cost would then be $100-150 cheaper, sitting at ~$700-850, or $1-1.1k including savings for next semester's tuition. That's about 30 hours per week of min. wage work. I'd also like to move with a few thousand saved in case I have trouble finding a job but will also move without it (work is easy to find here.) 30h of work while in school (plus many after-school projects) will be difficult but doable.  Thanks for reading this I really do appreciate it. Sorry that I can't contribute yet, I love reading this sub and especially the success stories.

If there are any other ways to spend less/get out of debt faster so I can lower the amount of hours I'll have to work I'd love to hear your suggestions.",finance,1453815897

Here is a primer of different games from major developers (not just rhythm games alone) available to play in Japan that may or may not ever see a console or international release in your local arcade (often it's licensing and localization being the major roadblocks plus policy on game services). Should you ever to encounter one of these machines when you visit Japan or somewhere around the world that has the game, do not be intimidated on the daunting nature of the game itself with foreign text. Most of the games I'll mention comes from actually spending physical time playing it (out of 2 visits to Japan in the summer in 2012 and 2015), casually observing other players play at the arcade, or additional research.

**Spotting an Arcade**

Often the major chains in arcades come from either Taito, Sega, Adores, Round 1. Very often they're easily identifiable based on their logos alone. 

* Sega - [Club Sega](http://i.imgur.com/SbXgUpy.jpg) is their flagship arcade center that will carry games published or developed by them. Easily spotted with their red color and huge text. 
* Taito - Now owned by Square Enix, their flagship arcade, [Taito Game Station](http://i.imgur.com/N0UgynX.jpg), is easily identifiable with it's red color and the Space Invaders alien logo. 
* [Adores](http://i.imgur.com/MW5ox3s.jpg) - While I haven't visited these spots too often, typically I've seen they're oriented towards crane games, medal games, and photo booths. Their logo is a square and slanted A on it.
* [Round 1](http://i.imgur.com/tYCJDQw.jpg) - A venue similar to Dave &amp; Busters in scale, they will carry games from all the publishers. In addition, they also carry Karaoke, Billiards, Darts, and Bowling.

Private arcades may follow the same rules as the big chains, but they can have some flexibility on what they want to do operationally. They can host tournaments, setup recording devices connected directly to the machine, or even livestreaming. 

**Arcade Locater Resources**

* [Tokyo Arcade Guide by MMCafe](http://www.mmcafe.com/arcadeguide/)

**Player Cards**

The majority of the games you see in Japan will require a specific card to get the most experience out of it. Most importantly, they're your memory cards per say. Most of the games are connected to their respective online services that enable recordkeeping, unlockables, or even multiplayer between different arcades. The major companies that carry these cards and services are Taito, Sega, Namco, and Konami.

Purchasing a card is only 300-500 yen at the arcade. Each game you start for the first time will require you to register your username to the card. From there you can also manage your data with their online services.

[Image of the cards by me](http://i.imgur.com/wo38OfI.jpg). Disregard the bottom left card (DJ Max Technika 3) as their online service is currently dead.

* Sega - AiME is their card service that's connected to SEGA ALL.Net. The card is also compatible to Namco's Banapassport. You can use either card to play their respective games. Select games you can play are Guilty Gear Xrd, maimai, Wonderland Wars, Initial D v8, Wonderland Wars, and Border Break.
* Taito - NESiCA is their card service that is connected to the Nesica x Live network. Select games include Persona 4 Arena, Groove Coaster, Gunslinger Stratos.
* Namco - Banapassport is their card service for Namco games (Tekken, Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune, Taiko no Tatsujin, etc.). The card is also compatible to Sega AIME/ALL.Net. You can you use either card to play their games.
* Konami - e-AMUSEMENT is their card service for Konami games (Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania, jubeat, etc.).

**Prices**

* Typically, a game will cost only 100 yen per play (3 songs in a rhythm game, 1 match in a fighting game of 3-5 rounds, 3 lives in an action game, etc.). Some places may charge 200 yen per play (e.g. Dance Dance Revolution in Taito HEY Akihabara). There are some places that will do 2 credits for 100 yen (observed in rhythm games, saw one in Round 1 Osaka in Namba). Some arcades that carry old games will charge 50 yen per play.
 
* Private arcades may do a by the hour purchase if you're planning to compete in a tournament. Example: [Game Spot Versus](http://www.game-versus.net/) in Nishinippori, Tokyo will charge 700 yen for an hour of play on Tekken 7 or 2250-3300 yen (depending on day and time) for an hour of Gundam EX VS Maxi Boost (4 players, 2v2). 

**Queueing at a Machine**

Often you may walk into an arcade in the night time and it's jam packed with players on their favorite games. Your mileage may vary depending on the location, time, and day you're playing at. Often I've seen queuing coming from the form of:

* Chairs &amp; Seats - You sit down in their respective chairs that's facing the machine and wait until the player is finished with their session. I recall visiting Round 1 in Osaka (Namba), they had numbered seats from 1-6 and you sit down until you're #1 to go next.
* Pen and Paper - Observed in Tokyo Leisure Land in Akihabara's Don Quixote  building 7th floor at the Dance Dance Revolution machine. Write your name down, and wait until your name is next.
* Quarter or Card Line - Put your coin on the machine to know the current player you're next in line.
* Waiting in Line - Usually if there's a new release scheduled for a location test, this will happen.

**Featured Games**

**Sega**

* [Inital D Arcade Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOmBmUbCG-w) (currently on v8 Infinity) - The crazy drifting 1v1 racing game is still alive to this day. Starting from v6, the game featrures 1v1 linked/online play or 2v2 online tag play. I believe Inital D is the only exception to the AiME service as they have their own specific card for the game. The average race takes around up to 2.5-3 minutes depending on the track and your skill. 

* [maimai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGJEpfplXao) (currently on ver. PINK) - Sega's other flagship rhythm game (the other being Hatsune Miku Project Diva). The game features 8 buttons equally spaced in a circle with a touch screen (to drag notes along during songs). Wearing cotton gloves is strongly encouraged as due to the intensity of the hard songs with whacky note patterns that you'll be sliding your hands accross all the buttons. The game is usually set for 3 songs plus a bonus song if you pass all your songs. Unlocking songs, titles, etc. requires lots of plays invested (upwards of $50 of play). A unique feature of the machine are the cameras which allow you to record your gameplay (usually 1 song per session) and upload online to maimai.net for future viewing (usually lasts 30 days before they're automatically deleted).

* [Wonderland Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPFdVuy_xo0) - This is Sega's version of a MOBA (DOTA, LoL, Smite, Etc.) in an arcade cabinet. The game is played on a touch screen with a pen stylus with a controller. Movement is controlled by a joystock and attacks require you to trace pen to direct your attacks. Matches are set for 7 minutes (based on the video link provided) in a 2 lane or 3 lane map.

* [Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnT2_sURqh4) (Currently on Future Tone Revision 5) - Vocaloid songs on a 4 button (playstaion shaped X, O, tangle, []) plus touch pad. Gameplay notes are all over the screen as you see in the video. 

* [Border Break](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcnAHtqYwAE) (Currently on ver. 4.5: Scramble) - a 10v10 mech arena fighter where you take bases over or kill opposing players in order to win. Players select from 4 specialized classes for the match lasting around 10 minutes.

I am a US resident, working two different jobs. My first job is as a server, where I have reported approximately $15,000 annually. On my W-2 for that job, I have listed zero allowances. So, (from my understanding) that means the government takes the maximum amount from my paycheck, and I get a nice return come tax season.

Recently, I started a second part-time job. This one is a fixed pay, $8.25/hr, 25 hours a week. For this W-2, I had listed 1 allowance, because I didn't want the government taking out QUITE as much from this paycheck, since it is substantially larger than the 2.15/hr paycheck I receive from my serving job.

Now, my very first paycheck for my second job came in, and I noticed there is zero federal withholding from my check. The state has withheld about 15 cents, but there are no federal withholdings. From my research, that is because the government will not start withholding from my paychecks until I exceed $10,000 annually.

personalfinance,Dave Ramsey Class and Struggling with the 15 year mortgage and suspending retirement contributions until non mortgage debt is paid off.,"Was wondering if anyone else has taken the Dave Ramsey class and had thoughts on these two points.  While I agree with a lot of what I read so far in his books and we went to the 1 class so far on saving, i just cant get my head around how these two points could be good ideas.

1.  Our mortgage is 4.25% over 30 years, I was paying an extra $800 a month on principal to make it more like a 15 year term, but then we switched it investing monthly into Vanguard index SP 500.  It seems like this is better since the market on avg returns 7% and we are looking long term.

2.  We have about 48k in non mortgage debt 

-35k auto loan at 2%

-13k student loan at 6%

Each year we max out our 401ks, which at our MAGI highest tax bracket is 33%, so even on a bad year the return on this money along with the compounding interest factor could not be worth suspending to pay down this debt.  

The tentative goal is to pay this debt off this year- we just struggle between choosing to invest v. paying down debt when the interest rate is lower than we feel we will get in a long term market return.

Bitcoin,One Concern with the New Core Communications Channels &amp; solution,"One suggestion I'd add is that the channels Bitcoincore.org and the Twitter and slack have some basic rules the holders agree to hold to.

Bitcoincore.org was originally purchased for the purpose of being a community asset, this, as well as the Twitter and slack should follow a code of conduct that prevents the types of problems we see now.

Right now they are in the names and control of individual people -- this is potentially problematic for the long term as people could die, be injured, be sued, get divorced (and have a domain name seen as an asset), lose interest in Bitcoin or find themselves on the opposite side of an argument with other devs.....

Then we end up with another disaster like this where a huge problem is created partly by centralized control of communications.

It also concerns me a bit when people refers to ""core"" as if it's one monolithic thing, like a company -- sure, right now there is a majority group of the main core devs who agree....but it's a bad road to travel to say things like ""core believes X"" or ""core says Y"" this is an open source project and anyone can be a part of core - using the slack, domain and Twitter could imply more consensus buy in than exists or discount minority opinions.

/u/btcdrak do you think you and Wladimir could agree to:
1) not ever censor these channels based on opinion. And 
2) put in writing that you consider these community assets and they should be governed by multiple people or an impartial organization and won't be sold?  

Ideally maybe even have a simple committee of 5-7 people who have the power to remove you as admin if they ever voted to.

Or I can get a credit union loan with a lower interest rate, save a couple hundred dollars in total interest payments, but then I'm stuck with getting a full coverage insurance policy with lower deductibles that equates to paying a couple of hundred dollars more on insurance (for the term of the loan) than I would like to have spent.

Basically, I'm wondering if going lein free on a car makes the most sense if you can get a loan that allows you to do so.  Let's say you are paying 90% of the car cost with your own cash but need to get a loan for 10% (and don't have time save up for it because you're getting a really sweet deal on the car) is there a reason one would finance it with a low interest rate loan from a credit union that would hold title on the car?",finance,1453859855

personalfinance,Should I take a personal loan to pay off an auto loan?,"Hello PF, I am in need of some advice. In my mid 20s I made a bad mistake when it came to financing a new car and now I am a little older and a little wiser but I am paying for it.

A couple years ago I thought I was a hot shot and decided to finance a brand new 2014 Camaro ($35,000). I think when all was said and done (taxes, fees) I financed a little less than $40,000. My payment was $500 a month (plus insurance, plus gas etc.) Making $35,000 a year (pre tax) I shortly realized that this was not really doable. I now make $45000.

A year or so into the loan (and after a horrible winter) I decided to do some damage control. I decided to get a car (2012 GMC Terrain) that was less expensive ($20,000) that would be a practical vehicle for the next at least 6 or 7 years. I knew i would take have to carry some negative equity but i was at peace with that. I was going to double up on payments for a year and refinance to get the payments down to a reasonable amount. I financed $30,000 over 72 months with a 6%+ interest rate  for a $20,000 car including the negative equity from the Camaro. Still $500 a month payment.

3 months into the new loan I totaled the car. Which turned out not to be the worst thing. Insurance paid $20,000 for the car leaving me to pay off the negative equity (now $7500) at the $500 a month payment. At the very worst I pay $500 a month for the next 18 months (for a car that I don't have) but at least I will be out of my car payment which was my initial goal.

I called Huntington Bank (the lender) and they cannot refinance/rewrite the loan because they do not have any physical locations in my state of Massachusetts.

I am trying to lower the payment.

Would it make sense for me to take out a $7,500 personal loan through a local bank at the same if not lower interest rate to pay off Huntington and thus lowering my monthly payment? $150 a month for the next 4 years is a lot easier to swallow than $500 a month for the next 18 months.

Can I even do this?",finance,1453862509

personalfinance,A Couple of Questions About How Car Loans Work.,"Greetings all!

I am considering a refinance on my car loan.  The goal is to lower our monthly payment responsibilities in anticipation of applying for a home loan.

I have been approved for a loan through our credit union.  The interest rate is nominally higher and for the same number of months as I have left on the original loan.  The monthly payments would be about $50 less per month.

How can this be?  How can higher interest over an identical term equal lower monthly payments?

Also, I am correct in my thinking that paying the car off faster than required saves money on an auto loan? Right now my finances are set up so I make a weekly payment on my car loan and I end up paying $80 to $110 (depending on how many Fridays are in the month) more per month on my loan than required.  Am I actually doing myself any good?  Does this save me anything on interest? My thinking is that the slightly higher interest rate won't matter much since I'm paying off the loan faster and on a weekly basis?  Am I off the mark here?",finance,1453864761

personalfinance,Wanting A HELOC On A Home Refinance. Your Advice Is Appreciated.,"Hi /personalfinance. I recently applied for and received a home refinance on my primary home. When I started back in Dec-2015, my credit score was above 650-below 700. I originally ask for a HELOC and the representative advised that to get a HELOC I would need a score of at least 700 or greater. I am not arguing if this is right or wrong, this is what I was told. After the 45 days of jumps and hurdles and do this and do that, I was given a closing date and successfully made it thru that date. I did get a ""cash out"" deal and this allowed me great financial gain. I paid off all bills (CC and bank loans...etc.) and placed the CC's in ice. I was even able to put 1K + in an emergency fund and also fund further my brokerage account. I was madly working on my credit score and all 3 reports well before this started as I had planned on doing a refi well before the feds announced an interest rate hike in Dec-2015. Now that it is all finished and I am breathing a lot easier, my credit score has taken a big leap and my appraisal came in more than I figured for. Here is my question. My loan/refi was for 80K. My appraisal is for 108K This leaves 28K difference and With my score in the 710+ ranges, would I be able to do a HELOC for possibly 10K?

I wanted to get one for the actual use of the home. I am not having appliance trouble but we just about do back flips every time the dishwasher finishes a load and the washer and dryer complete a job together. Summertime will be here before we know it and although I have a vented attic, I personally know that one of the vent fans I installed some time ago is locked up and dead. I was wanting to use the HELOC for true home uses.

personalfinance,Seeking outside opinion - Student Loans vs Savings,"Seeking outside opinion - Student Loans vs Savings
(throwaway account)


We have been able to pay down a lot of our debt over the last year or so and have been able to have a savings account with quite a bit in it.  My husband wants to take a very large portion of our savings, cash out 11 stocks from his place of work, and take our tax refund (est around 5500) and pay off my student loans completely.  After looking through this, should I just let him do what he wants to do?


The links below provide some information about our finances and bills.  One thing to note about my husband, he overestimates our bills.  Our food for example, is not 1400 a month.  It IS high, but we had a weird situation this year with food.  


Here is my issue with paying off the student loan.  I grew up poor and the thought of going from over 20k in savings to only around 5k in savings freaks me out.  We living in an expensive city.  My husband has two very major health problems, and takes about 12k worth of meds a month.  In April our deductible will reset and we will need to pay 3k almost right away towards his medications.  I have savings cards for them, so I'll admit, that is a high estimate.  We also have a very old car.  We only take it out once a week or so, but if for some reason the SO gets really sick  I have to be able to get him to a hospital.  With no extra money, we can't just buy a car.  Finally...I just started a new job, and he is only a year into his.  If he loses his job then we can't stay in this city...with our savings gone we won't be able to afford to move across the country.


I'm ""Miss Worst Case Scenario"" and I know that is what I'm doing, but I'm really uncomfortable.  If he holds onto his stock, every year more will vest.  I hate the thought of him cashing it out.


From the Husband who doesn't Reddit:


My take on the situation is that these loans are a large (over $500/mo) mandatory expense with a high (almost 6%) interest rate. I would like to get them out of the way and have the interest payments making us money rather than costing us money.  While we would be going from around $20k in savings to $5k in savings, I don't see that as a major deal as we've had an average of *maybe* $2k in savings for the past 7+ years.  Additionally, once it is paid off, I'd work to build back the savings account.  My estimates have us around $40k by year end barring any extreme unforseen circumstances.  Speaking of, even with just $5k in the bank, we would be able to survive four months on just my wife's pay (and longer if we used credit cards).  I don't see myself getting fired, and if I need to leave work due to my illness, I have Short-Term and Long-Term Disability that would cover around 60% of my pay while I was out (which would cover the gap).  Finally, when it comes to the stock, this is just 5% of the total options I have.  As the market has been *very* volitile lately, I've watched my stock price swing wildly, so I don't see an issue using it to kill off the loan, as it could always take a nosedive in a month.


In short, I'm quite optimistic here, as even my worst case scenario is better than we were doing just a year ago.  I feel that with this loan out of the way, we're almost completely debt free and can work to build up the massive savings to make my wife feel better about our financial situation.

personalfinance,Need advice on repayment: making 52k this year with 186k in student loans,"I don't know if this is the best sub for this, so please forgive me if it's not.  

I need some advice.  I just spent about 45 minutes on the phone with fedloan servicing.  Got some useful information and need to decide what to do.   

Background - Graduated law school in May 2015, passed the bar, and secured a job last week of November making $25/hr (roughly 52k/year).  I also do work as a contract attorney, i.e., independent contractor, and expect to make an additional 10-15k.  First payment was December 2015.   I'm on the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plan, which is currently $0.00/month.  I plan to have my PAYE payment recalculated at $52k/year so it'd be around $350/month.  The interest that accrues every month is $1061.  Also, none of the loans are private. 

I have two decisions to make: 1) Do I consolidate?; and 2) Do I pay off my loan ASAP or shoot for loan forgiveness?

First, consolidation.  I have loans totaling $185,974.20 and is broken down as follows:

a.  21,855.01 at 6.21%

b.  31,828.48 at 7.2%

c.  22,807.72 at 5.4%

d.  30,662.48 at 6.4%

e.  43,326.69 at 7.9%

f.  24,793.86 at 6.8%

g.  8,300.35 at 6.8%

Note the above interest percentages do not include the .25%/loan deduction from signing up for monthly payments because I cannot set up monthly billing on a $0.00 monthly payment.  It is the reason I want to recalculate my PAYE payments to take advantage of that.  

I was told that because these are all government loans, I do not loose any of the federal loan benefits, such as forbearance.  I was also told that the negative of consolidating would be that any prior payments to consolidation would not count toward the 20 year forgiveness under the PAYE plan (the time period would start anew  after consolidation; in other words, if I consolidate in February 2016 my December 2015 and January 2016 payments do not count toward the 20 year forgiveness and February 2016 is the first payment toward forgiveness).  

As for PAYE plan payments, the monthly payment won't be enough to cover the interest each month.  However, given my current circumstances (very little bills, still living at home) I would pay $2,500/month.  After the interest is paid, I would be able to allocate the excess amount to my largest and highest interest loan.  

If I decide to consolidate, I would have an interest rate, according to my math and their formula, at 6.45% after the .25% deduction for monthly billing (6.7% before).  I'd have to consolidate now since I will only be missing one, maybe two, payments.  I don't know if it's the wiser choice when I can allocate excess moneys to my largest loan with my largest interest rate.  

Second, do I aim for loan forgiveness or paying off my loan ASAP.  After 20 years the loans are forgiven.  Since I'm on the PAYE plan, the amount I pay would gradually increase as my salary increases but I would be encumbered for the next 20 years.  

Thinking long-term, even though I'm currently single (complicated relationship but the outlook is up), if I choose this root I would not be able to file a joint tax return and claim many of those benefits because the PAYE amount would be based on me and my spouses combined income.  I wouldn't want to burden her and she would most likely have her own loans.  We would both get shorted.    This avenue also leaves open the path for public service for me and 10 year forgiveness, which is currently her plan.  

Under this option, I would be able to move out (27M), which is something I really want to do.  Eventually the loan will be paid off  at 47. I would be able to allocate money to retirement, save up for an emergency fund (currently $1k), enjoy my youth, invest and still be current on all debt.  

Under the pay off ASAP choice, I would live at home for the next 2-3 years and allocate as much as I can to my payment.  Hopefully in that time span, find a better job and pay off even more before moving out.  I think this option will be a much harder struggle in the beginning and don't know if the struggle for the first few years are worth it when I could have smooth sailing till 47 on the PAYE plan.  

As for the long-term, marriage under this option doesn't seem feasible.  Although I would be in a position to file jointly and obtain those benefits, I don't know if I'd be able to save up for a ring, a wedding, or a honeymoon whereas under the other option I would have more play with my income and could save for certain things like a ring.  In addition, I would have very little spending money for myself.  Marriage and enjoyment do not seem feasible.  Experiences at this age are invaluable.  

I want to make the smartest move financially and for my goals.  Is it better to consolidate or not, and to pay off my loan sooner and struggle early or coast until 47?  I'm in a profession where there is no cap on the amount of money I can make, but also no guarantee I will be making an astronomical amount.  

If there is anyone who can see between the lines here or has gone through this, I would appreciate your advice.  The decision now is going to have a lasting effect and I don't want to make the wrong choice.  Thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to your comments.",finance,1453869684

Final Total = $125,491.91

**Scenario 2**
*Paying off Loan #3 first*
If I use the entire windfall to pay down the highest interest rate loan the remaining balance is $5,359.77, with a 10 year repayment of $7,088.96. The first two loans with have the interest capitalized and the total repayment will be $110,537.63

Our names are Ruã Daros, João Costa, Marina von Keyserlingk, Maria Hötzel, Heather Neave and Daniel Weary. We are researchers from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Canada and the [Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina](http://en.ufsc.br/) in Brazil. Our research focuses on animal welfare, how to use changes in behaviour to make inferences about the quality of life that animal’s experience.

We recently published a study entitled [""Separation from the Dam Causes Negative Judgement Bias in Dairy Calves”](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098429) in [PLOS ONE]( http://journals.plos.org/plosone/).

Young farm animals, including dairy calves, are often separated from the dam far earlier than what occurs under natural conditions. Farms animals are also sometimes subjected to painful procedures like hot-iron dehorning. The aim of this study was to better understand the effects of these routine procedures on the emotions of animals. One way to investigate mood states is to look for evidence of judgement biases. We tested for cognitive biases in calves before and after separation from the cow and dehorning, and found diminished responding to intermediate, ambiguous stimuli (evidence of a pessimistic response) following both physical pain and social loss. This paper illustrates one approach to investigating emotional states in animals, and draws parallels in the emotional experience of physical and social pain.

personalfinance,"(US) This or that? Pay off student loans, or save more for down payment for home?","Hi there, Reddit!

I see that this question is asked sometimes, but considering we all have different circumstances, I figured it couldn't hurt to see if anyone had advice they could give that was more tailored to my current financial stats.

Here’s my question: pay off student loans (private, variable interest rates), or save for a larger down payment?

Background: in late fall of 2014, I got a tremendous pay bump when I got a new job (close to double my highest salary) and subsequently paid off over 16k in credit card debt and the remaining balance on my car (2k or so). The only debt I’m left with is just under 23k in student loans (AES at 5.9% and Navient at 7.25%).

I’m looking to buy a co-op in south Brooklyn, a 1BR, 200k or under.  My parents will be helping me with the down payment, as well as me borrowing against my 401K (normally not advised, I know).  I’ve started the search, but I’m not anticipating finding anything worth putting an offer down on just yet. So for the moment, I’m living rent-free at my parents house, no longer making CC and car payments, so I will have more funds at my disposal than ever before.

So what should I do? Aggressively pay off my student loans (feasibly within 1 year with the help of my weekend side job)?  Or should I sock away more money to put down on an apartment?  I have excellent credit (800+), and I’ve put away a modest emergency fund so far (5k).

Concerns:	rising interest rates, minimal inventory, increasing home prices

What I would like to know is if my strategy of paying extra money towards my loans is the right move to make. Should I be saving up to acquire assets or building a nest egg instead? My current plan is to continue to pay all of my money towards my loans until that January 2017 move out date and then refinance for a lower monthly. Should I still contribute extra money towards these loans when possible? Should I refinance at all or tough out the high monthly minimum?

personalfinance,(AUS) Debt payment priorities,"So I recently picked up a second job and I'm now making substantially more than my expenses, so it's debt-killin time.

I'm curious as to whether I should prioritise higher-interest debts at all costs, or if I should focus on other things first - like paying off smaller debts sooner, or what prompted this question in the first place, pay of off the debt which most impacts my cashflow.

To be specific, I've got about $5400 in credit cards/overdraft accounts, with interest rates varying between 10-15%; the monthly payments are in the $150 area. I've also got a personal loan sitting around $21k, with monthly payments of $481 (interest rate is about 11%). Up until now my income has been about $2100/month, and now that's likely to be closer to $2900. The vast majority of the difference gets the fun job of paying off my debts, but I'm curious as to what the consensus is in terms of order of payments.

My initial plan was to pay out the highest interest account first, but he more I look at it, the more I realise that those smaller accounts have a negligible effect on my cashflow, and the loan is the thing that's the biggest issue in that regard. I still live at home, and until the loan is gone there's no way I can afford to move out, despite how much I need to get out of there.

personalfinance,Curious of PF's opinion on a friend's financial situation...,"This is the story of a friend of mine. He told me his new financial ""plan,"" and I am a little confused.

He is: late 30s, making around $40-$45k, two kids (teens), owns a duplex home which he lives in and has the other side rented out, and has an estranged partner from whom he is getting divorced.

Details that I recently learned:

* He has $30k in cc debt (which he claims was acquired mostly after the separation, even though he's always been the higher wage earner in the marriage)

* The mortgage minus the rent income leaves about $300-400 still due on the mortgage each month

* The house is worth about $30k less than they owe, but I don't  know the total or interest rate... but the point is that selling the home will leave a large balance still due

* I'm pretty sure the estranged partner has outstanding student loans

* The estranged partner works largely in a cash industry, and unreliably gives my friend cash, which is *supposed* to amount to something like $1000-$1500 per month

* Each of them have relatively new/large vehicles, the payments of which amount to over $800 per month (wtf)... both car loans are in my friend's name

* They can't file bankruptcy because they already went through some sort of discharge program less than 7 years ago

The plan:

Amazingly, the plan seems to be for my friend to move out of the house that they own, split up the children, move in with family and... stop paying the mortgage, and completely lose the house. Then, I think the plan might be to start paying down the credit card debt as best as he can.

The plans *don't* seem to include trading in their unnecessarily pricey vehicles, getting second jobs or additional methods of income, asking the kids (who are both 14+) to help out or be more responsible for personal food/clothing expenses, or telling their tenants anything. 

My friend claims to have spoken to some sort of ""professional"" about the situation, and that the person advised him to let the house go in this manner, and not wait or pursue other options first. This ""professional"" could have been a divorce lawyer, accountant, mortgage lender rep... I'm just not sure. This person told my friend that defaulting on the house now was important, because later down the line it wouldn't be an option. I'm unsure what that means, or if it has anything to do with the fact that he and the estranged spouse own it jointly, and won't for very much longer.

Another justification for letting the house go was maintenance and repairs. My friend says that if *anything* goes wrong with the house (ex. leaks, plumbing, broken dishwasher) in regards to the tenants, that he can't and won't be able to invest in the repair. Even if he moved the family out and rented the other half, so the incoming rent exceeded the mortgage... he still said it ""wasn't going to work."" Therefore, letting the home go completely is the ""best option,"" and (again) he was advised to do it now. But he also didn't say he was letting the current tenants know of his impending departure. I suspect that he may keep the tenants in the house for as long as the bank stays away, which I know can often be a very long time.... and keep pocketing their rent while skipping mortgage payments.

I'm not really looking for ways to make suggestions, but to educate myself. I've never owned property or been divorced. This friend is older than me, and (at this time) acts very curt when these topics come up in conversation. He pretty resistant to thinking about them in-depth, except to passive-aggressively complain about not having enough money in general. I thought the whole thing sounded really suspect, and at least very evasive. Therefore, I was very curious how the plan sounded to others, just as a general discussion topic, or so I could have some speculative insight.

personalfinance,Thoughts on 401K loan,"Everywhere I read it seems everyone says that 401K loans are a bad idea. But I am trying to figure out exactly why.

Scenario: You are making a large cash purchase (perhaps a house, perhaps something else) of 20K. You have 20K in a 401K, and 20K in a regular account. Both are invested. (I know you can only borrow half your 401K, but ignore that for now...I'm trying to make the math simple). Let's assume 10% risk adjusted market growth and a 5% interest rate. Let's assume a term of 1 year and simple interest.

Also (and from what I can tell, this makes the key difference), assume that no matter what, I am going to use 21K of my cashflow to restock whichever account I used.

Option 1: Pay with regular account At the end of 1 year, regular account has 21K that I refunded it with. 401K has grown to 22K.

Option 2: pay with a 401K loan At the end of 1 year, regular account has grown to 22K, 401K has been repayed with interest to 21K.

So by taking the 401K loan, I was able to essentially move money out of the 401K tax free (I think, right?). This works as long as market growth &gt; 401K loan interest rate (or rather, risk adjusted market growth &gt; loan interest rate).

Furthermore, there isn't really any risk of switching jobs, as that would just mean that I use the regular account to repay the remainder of the loan, and I've moved from Option 2 to Option1. Heck, I can do that at any time.

But this feels a bit problematic. If this is really the case, then if I have the cashflow, why wouldn't I essentially do this all the time? (Assuming growth &gt; interest rate). Woulnd't borrowing from my 401K to invest in a regular investment account mean that I can siphon some money out of my 401K tax free (well not tax free, but esseintially converting income to LTCG?).

Where is this weak point in all of this? Is it that risk adjusted growth is not truly greater than the rates?

investing,Price to earnings question - can't figure out SP500 PE,"Today SP500 is at 1890.

[multipl.com](http://www.multpl.com/) claims PE=20.76 today.  This implies earnings of 1890/20.76=$91, using 2014-Q4 to 2015-Q3 [real earning per share](http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-earnings/).

But [yardeni.com](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/peacockfeval.pdf) says that earnings for 2015 Q1-Q3 are about $30 a quarter, suggesting that earnings for 2014-Q4 to 2015-Q3 is more like $120, and PE=16, not 20.76.

Now the spreadsheet [here, upon which multipl is supposedly based](http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500), says ""2015 Est Oper PE""=19.16 (row 43) but also says ""2015 EST PE=17.52"" (row 76) based on 2015 EST earnings of  $106.65.  The Q3,Q4 earnings are lower of those than yardeni.com.

So, in short, I can get 2015 PE anywhere from 16 to 21, or historically-priced to somewhat over-priced.

Why?  What's the real PE? 


**edit** - here's part of answer, I think - in the SP spreadsheet (Additonal Info menu button [here](http://www.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500)), operating earnings are about $104 for 2014-Q4 to 2015-Q3 but 'as reported' earnings about $90.   This is much of the difference.  If I use 2015-Q1 to 2015-Q4-EST operating earnings from the spreadsheet, I get operating earnings of $94.86 and PE=19.8.

The reported PE seems to use as-reported earnings, which takes one-time charges into account.  But even the higher operating earnings are below the $30/quarter operating earnings level of yardeni (Fig 5). Yardeni uses an estimate consensus, but this should approach true earnings as 2015 draws to a close. Certainly not a $15 difference between yardeni operating and SP operating.

So now there are 3 types of earnings: yardeni operating ($120), SP operating ($106), and SP reported ($94).   As long as SP 'as-reported' is used consistently throughout history, then it might to say that the market is priced on the high side (ignoring low interest rate environment).   

Here's a [good article](http://avondaleam.com/why-you-should-value-the-sp-500-based-on-as-reported-earnings/) on why to use reported earnings  - because 'one-time' charges tend to knock 10% off reported earnings, averaged over the years.",finance,1453930621

Ran them up during a time of need without thinking about the consequences. Now I'm trying to pay them off but between my bills and stuff I seem to barely be able to make a dent on them every month.

 So I think my best option is to get a loan totaling the amount. It's easier for me to make one payment every month for it rather than worry about both especially with the somewhat high intest rate. I think I'd get a good rate via most loans due to having a fair/good credit score and payment history. What are my best options as far as that goes? I don't  know if a balance transfer is a good idea for me. What are some other suggestions as far as what route I should take.

The interest rate on both cards is around 26-28%. Balance on each card is $2500. Income is 2300/2400 a month. Expenses vary but are about 1800-1900 a month. Which may be going down quite a bit soon due to moving into a smaller less expensive place.",finance,1453936535

How do I get that money back so I can pay what I owe to DC?","Hi everyone, this might be one of the more unusual ones.

Congressional employees are allowed to claim tax residency in their home states if they work for a member of Congress from that state. In 2014, I worked for such a member, so I paid taxes to my home state even though I lived in DC -- an arrangement called reciprocity. However, in January 2015 I switched offices (but stayed in Congress), meaning I lost reciprocity. However, through an oversight on my part, I did not go to the disbursing office and change my tax residency to DC until around May. So, for five months I was paying state income tax to my home state, even though I was technically not a resident, and was not paying taxes to DC.

Now, I'm trying to file my taxes (using TurboTax) and it's telling me I owe a lot of money to DC, obviously because my federal wages are a lot higher than my reported DC wages and tax paid. At the same time, my home state isn't giving me much of a refund because my W-2 shows I made a lot more money while a resident of that state than I truly did.

How can I fix this?

Edit: One option I noticed is I can fill out a form on my home state tax return to claim credit for taxes paid to DC. I am given the opportunity to enter the income I earned while a ""resident"" of my home state (even though I was not) that was also taxed by DC and any taxes paid to DC on that income.

economy,Simple question about currency,"Is there a fundamental difference between bartering raw resources and using paper, backed by raw resources, to buy things? Obviously you wouldn't have the metal right there for the transaction, but you're essentially bartering with the help of the bank.

If this were true, then the concept of exchanging something based upon trust has only been heavily used in the past 100 years, no? I'm familiar with natives that used wampum beads and the Chinese started using fiat currency in 1000 AD, but has there ever been a large economy that solely used currency backed by trust, prior to the 20th century?

Furthermore, what are the arguments in favor of and in opposition to trust vs resource currency?

The biggest negative that I can see regarding resource-based is that people would be encouraged to destroy the entire natural world in search of more gold/silver/etc, and that a new discovery (either a deposit or maybe an experimental way to create the resource) would instantly devalue everyone's currency.

The biggest positives that I can see regarding resource-based is that no one would be able to modulate the supply of the currency, so markets would be less imposed upon and possibly more stable as a result.

The big argument that I've heard in favor of trust-based currency is that a steady level of inflation encourages investment of capital and, with the creation of a federal bank, allows Big Brother to theoretically save the day if everyone fucks up. There's a whole logistical argument, but let's not get into that.",finance,1453980369

science,"Science AMA Series: I'm Steve LeVine, Washington correspondant for Quartz Magazine, I wrote THE POWERHOUSE: America, China, and the Great Battery War (Penguin), a real-time thriller about the worldwide race to perfect the next engine of economic growth, the advanced lithium-ion battery. AMA!","Hi Reddit, 

I'm a writer at Quartz. My beat is the intersection of geopolitics, energy, science and technology. Today, oil prices are around $33 a barrel, and most analysts think the highest they'll go this year is another $10--up to $43, which is much lower than it was when I started looking seriously at advanced batteries. That was around six years ago. 

Batteries caught my eye because I kept seeing the presidents and prime ministers of countries assert that they--their nation--was going to dominate what they predicted were big battery or electric car industries. That was the US (Obama), China (Hu), Japan and about a dozen more, and the numbers they tossed around for how much these industries would be worth were enormous. They were the size of Google's annual revenue at the time. The kind of wealth that could move geopolitics. 

I persuaded one of the federal US labs--Argonne, near Chicago--to let me sit with its battery team for a year while they worked on creating the big breakthrough that would bring on this age. Argonne's credential is that its battery material--NMC--is in the Chevy Volt. 

It stretched to two years. By the end--and through today--Argonne did not create the big breakthrough (nor did anyone else). The electrics and hybrids that have been introduced have not gone viral. And, as we started with, oil prices are about 75% lower than they were when it was thought that economy--saving gasoline--would be a big impetus for the electric car age.

So was the battery and electric car talk back then a bunch of hype? In some cases, definitely, and we can get into that. I've done some work on a couple of the hypesters. But my own theory--and it's based on what I'm watching--is that we are entering a natural, second stage of the mainstreaming of electric cars. 

Batteries are one thing--the researchers I talk to don't have a lot of confidence that they are close to a big leap. Nor do they see anything on the horizon that creates the big electrochemical advance. They are still at the bench, working away.

But--and we can get into this--the manufacturers are going ahead anyway. The pure electric Chevy Bolt, introduced a couple of weeks ago at CES in Las Vegas, was an example of this. It will go 200 miles on a charge and cost $30,000 after the federal subsidy. That is mainstream distance and price. It's based on advances on the factory floor--engineering with the cars, and tinkering with the batteries.

So I see the possibility that the last half of the decade proves to be a tipping point for electrics. 

A wild card is Apple. It’s stealthily building its pure electric Titan, aiming for launch in 2019 or so. If it does launch, that will mean serious resonance for mainstream electrics.

personalfinance,A house that isn't selling putting me in a bad place.,"Ok, 5 years back, my wife and I fresh out of varsity, bought a house, it was in a pretty obscure location, but close to a place where she had to work to pay off her study bursary, the company offer's employees finance and offered her a 100% bond, including deposit and transfer duties. It was a lovely big house, and we were sick of landlords after being students.

Fast forward to 2 years ago, we decided to have kids, my wife decided that she wanted to be near her parents, and my contract where I worked was ending. So we moved across the country, and ended up buying a lovely house next to her parents house... this would have worked out if the first house sold... when we were buying the second house we had an interested buyer on the first who agreed to rent for a few months (to gather a deposit he told us) 

Then life happened.. the biggest employer in the area by the first property went under, and a lot of people left, property prices plummeted, we lost our buyer, and we've had tenants in it since. The rent we get from tenants doesn't come close to paying our bond,  because the company we owe has a high interest rate for non employees. Our last set of tenants trashed the place and left a very large amount of damage, we also still owe more than the value of the property, and the wife and I had twins... (babies are expensive!!)

This property is sinking us, we lose every month the difference between bond and rent, and every few months massive amounts of maintenance... I have tried to be financially wise, we have paid off our study loans, we have paid off our cars, and we have minimal credit card debt... but I'm certainly cant save in any way...  I'm simply not able to pay off two houses ..(NOTE: I live in South Africa so I'm not sure if the relative values will make much sense)",finance,1453989601
personalfinance,EE Savings bonds-variable rate?,"I recently found my file with 21 EE bonds from parents'family members from 1988-2002. When I calculated the value in 2013, all the bonds except for the 4 most recent showed an interest rate of 4%, which is their current interest rate. The 4 most recent bonds (99, 00, 01, 02) showed an interest rate of.63% in 2013, and are now showing an interest rate of 1.39% in 2016. I had no idea that savings bonds could have variable interest rates...I was considering cashing in those 4 (for ~$280) because I currently have student loans at 5% I could apply the payment to. Can someone point me to a resource that explains how these variable interest rate bonds work? What are the chances of the rate on these 4 going up to or above 4%? If it could- I'd probably just keep those 4 until full maturity, since I plan on paying off my student loans &gt; 5% interest in the next year or so. I plan on keeping the bonds at 4% until full maturity.

It seems it's a simple question of $280 now or $400 later (full maturity in 13-15 years, well after my student loans are paid off)...but I am curious about how the variable rates on these work",finance,1453990821

I'm a second year medical student with approximately $50k in loans. I am going to be switching to a PhD program in August and will not incur any additional loans thereafter, as the program will pay for my final 2 years of medical school after I complete the 3 year PhD.

After completing my MD and PhD, I plan to do a 5 year surgery residency. I'm currently 24, so in the long run, I'll complete all my training (not including a potential fellowship) in 10 years when I am 34. 

I lurk this subreddit pretty frequently and, based on previous advice in regards to early investment and retirement planning, I wanted to reach out for any of your wisdom on money management. I wasn't sure if there are any prudent investment steps I could be taking now that may pay off in the long run, or if it would be foolish to invest, as I would basically be investing borrowed money. Maybe there is some fund with an interest rate that would exceed my current loan interest rate, so that money would grow at a faster rate than my current loan interest? Or in the long term when I pay off my loans, are there any benefits for me to get involved with an account now (maybe fixed interest rates?) rather than wait until I am no longer in the red with loans before I start investing?

The first case was the worst. I paid the local municipal taxes but was unaware there were also school district taxes. To the best of my knowledge, I wasn't notified of any outstanding tax bill for over 2 years - by then the penalties were in excess of $400 for a $177 tax bill. Is this legal?

Just looking for some help and what's the best way to approach this when I talk to them about this non-remittance.

Now, i'm on some kinda gradual payback plan where they increase the amount I automatically pay every year or two.  So while before I may have been paying like 250 a month, now I'm paying 400 a month.  May not be exact on those beginning numbers.  Now, I have about 6 years to go on this 10 year payment plan, though I hope to be done in about 3 with my overpayments.  Actually, after making a bunch of overpayments I think they knocked down the amount they bill me from like 450 to 400 a month weirdly enough.  I think they play games.  So, given the interest rate, I noticed that right now of those 400 dollars a month, approximately 100 of it is going to interest in my payment history.  However the statements say accrued interest is about 25 dollars on each months statement.  Showing the overall history, it shows that about 40 percent of my payments have gone to interest.  What happened to 6.2 percent and lower??  Note, after the 400 auto payment i sling a manual payment of at least 500 into there every month.",finance,1454004063

Arcen takes games where they've never been and, more often than not, the results are phenomenally entertaining. Challenging, yes. Frequently unattractive, yes. But stimulating? Refreshingly new? Yes.

They create niche genre-bending games. [You can see them here](http://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Arcen%20Games%2C%20LLC). Games like the extremely challenging 4X tower defense RTS fleet battle game [AI-War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400/).

Games like the side scrolling village building procedurally generated platformer [A Valley Without Wind](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209330/).

They just released a new game this week named [Starward Rogue](http://store.steampowered.com/app/410820/), a bullet-hell roguelike. Despite being a fan of their games I had no idea it was in development and I'm somewhat certain no one else did, either. And this morning, [per this Rock, Paper, Shotgun article](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/01/28/ai-war-devs-arcen-layoffs/), we find out why: Arcen is on the verge of laying off most of its crew again. So they probably dropped everything they were doing a few weeks or months ago and got cracking on Starward Rogue, a project they could turn around quickly, in order to generate revenue to keep them afloat.

In doing this they skipped press previews. They skipped telling their community about the game. They skipped teasing screenshots on their social networks. I'm not even sure any reviews have been published yet. They finished the game and punted it onto Steam so quickly it isn't even listed on their web site's own store.

You may be thinking ""Hey, survival of the fittest."" I'm typically with you on that one. But not in this case. The industry needs a developer like Arcen to explore possibilities of what experiences games can bring.

I'm not calling on everyone reading this to go out and buy their games. They aren't everyone's cup of tea. I guess what this post is, is a plea to fate to give Arcen another chance with this launch so they can make a buck and stay afloat until [their much better publicized next game](http://store.steampowered.com/app/354480/) is ready. If any bloggers, YouTubers, or writers out there have had Starward Rogue in their queue and have been waiting for a slow news day, I urge you to review it (and review it honestly, without taking Arcen's situation into account) sooner than later.

stocks,$F Equity Analysis,"Yay, another post on Ford. I'm going to open by saying that I've been a Ford shareholder for about a year now and I've lost... maybe 10%? That being said, I still believe - more now than before - that Ford is a strong buy. Why?


**Fundamentals**

Let's get this straight: Ford is not the best auto company in the world. I'm sure many of you would even argue that it's not even the best in America. Many other car companies have higher efficiency ratios, growth rates, stronger exposure to international markets, etc. That being said, it is the largest American car manufacturer by market cap and its assets are significantly undervalued. P/E of 5.95. Other P/something ratios significantly lower than the industry average. It's worth looking into. The fundamentals are certainly above average, but nothing extremely special. The only thing we care about at this point is *whether Ford will survive into the future*. Will it? Yes. Cool, let's move on. 

But what about its debt, you might ask. A quick visit to Yahoo Finance reveals that this company has a D/E of about 300 - 400%. Surely that can't be good! 

Most of this debt here is FINANCIAL SERVICES debt. Ford, as it turns out, has its own financial services wing to finance auto purchases. For financial companies, debt is absolutely critical; not to mention, all of this debt is backed by consumer and dealer purchases. This debt has an average interest rate of 0.5%. Not 5%; 0.5%. In terms of its automotive debt (bad debt), you'll notice that it's significantly lower. 


**Technicals**

[Chart](http://finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=F&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=1&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)
Ford's stock has hit a **double bottom** and RSI is sub-30. I don't know much about technicals but I do believe that this stock is heavily oversold. Today's negative price action is likely the result of yesterday being the ex-dividend date; people are dumping their shares after qualifying for the dividend. As the selling begins to wean off, we should expect to see a bounce in the short term unless the overall market shits itself in the next few days. Which, factoring in my luck, it probably will. 


**Dividend**

This is where it gets interesting. Ford currently has a dividend yield of 5.1%. Factoring in its special dividend, it has a dividend yield of **7.3%**. Remember that this is a large cap non-energy, non-REIT, and non-telecomm S&amp;P company. This is GOOD.

Recently, Ford announced that it would NOT be raising its regular dividend and would issue a special dividend instead. GM instead announced a dividend hike and increased share buybacks. Which is better? You're wrong. It's Ford. But why? Why, you might ask. If the company truly believed in its future, then wouldn't it hike its dividend obligation?

Ford does NOT believe in its future. This is a GOOD thing. Ford's stock is divided into two types of shares, Class A and Class B. Class B shares have 40% voting power and the Ford family owns 100% of these OP shares. When sold, Class B shares turn into Class A shares, reducing their voting power. As such, there is no incentive for them to ever sell their Class B shares.

Why do people buy stocks? They want return on capital; they want to either sell their stock at a higher price than purchased or to get dividends. Since Ford's family probably will not sell significant portions of their Class B shares, they will seek return on capital through dividends. 

Remember 2008 - 2009? I don't. According to the internet though, this was bad. The Big 3 auto companies nearly all went down, with GM being owned by the US Treasury for some time and Chrysler being sold to Fiat. Ford was the only company to make it through without any government intervention (yay). I'm sure the Ford family remembers this, and expects that they cannot continue to post record profits in the future. Since automobiles are an incredibly cyclical commodity, a market recession (heyyyy 2017/2018 hype) will result in lower sales. GM, who has raised its dividend, will struggle to meet its obligation. It'll either have to cut its dividend or make cuts elsewhere, neither of which will be greeted by shareholders. Enter based Ford. Ford issues special dividends in good times and maintains a sustainable dividend. Ford does not cut its regular dividend. Be like Ford. 

I strongly believe that Ford will continue to issue special dividends in the future when times are good, and I expect to see another in late 2016/early 2017. When times get bad in the future, Ford can merely trim its special dividend and maintain its freaking 5.1% regular dividend. Either way, it's a win-win. This is a perfect income stock for the long term, and it's trading for an EXCELLENT price right now.

personalfinance,"Now earning more money, need to re-balance my withholding allowances and 401k contributions.","My post title describes the whole picture, while bulk of my question surrounds tax withholding. 

- How does the number I declare for federal tax withholding translate into a dollar amount? Is it a fixed percent or a sliding scale?

Background: In TY 2015, I earned roughly $55K (pretax), declared ""2"" allowances for both Federal and State (California) and I'm expecting to receive a few hundred dollars in my tax return. Thanks to a raise and a new job I'll be starting soon, I'm expecting to make between $70K and $75K (pretax) in TY 2016, yet my calculations show if I continue to declare 2 allowances, I'll end up owing a few hundred in taxes next year. If I declare 1 allowance, I can expect a refund of around $1000. All of last year, I contributed 5% to my 401K, and used the same 5% in my scenarios for 2016.

- How exactly does this work, since both the $55K and the $70-75K figures are in the same marginal tax bracket?

What I'm trying to accomplish:

I'm hoping to keep my withholding declaration at 2 allowances, and increase my 401K contribution such that my tax liability decreases and I will owe less than $100 in taxes or get a very modest refund. It does go without saying, of course, that I am also interested in what my final paycheck looks like too, but I can work around that.",finance,1454006517

personalfinance,Disabled and unsure of tax filing status,"Hi all,

Last year I had $14k in Social Security Disability payments in my own name, $7k in my minor child's name and $182 in earned income. I am married, but my spouse only had non-taxable worker's compensation payments last year. As far as everything I am reading, it looks like I do not need to file federal income taxes because my spouse's payments do not count as income and without them we do not reach the threshold for my Social Security to be taxed. I just need to make sure I am interpreting this correctly, because I did have some earned income last year.

personalfinance,"Going Back To Work, Want To Invest Money For 2-Years To Save For Starting My Own Business","Hello everyone, first post to reddit. Hope it is a good experience.

I've been an on and off contractor for a major Pharmaceutical Company for the past 5 years. On and off because of the 24 month rule. A contractor cannot stay with one company for more 24 months, after the 24 month period is over the company must either hire them or end the contract and they cannot be rehired until a 6-month black out period is over.

During the black out periods I spend my 6 months collecting unemployment and working towards personal goals. I am currently a homeowner, have no debt, a 6-month emergency fund, a good amount of money just sitting around waiting to be spent, and live well below my means. By mid February, my black out period will be over and my previous employer has contacted me again for 2 positions. The pay is over $40/hour and my goal is to save as much money as possible the next 2 years during this contract so that I can pursue after a dream of mine. I'm estimating $60,000 is enough to pursue after this dream.

My plan is to put $2500/month into a separate account. I've thought about opening a savings account or a money market account with at least a 1% interest rate, but over the course of 2 years, I'd only be making about $600. For me, that's really not worth it. As a contractor, there are no options for a savings vehicle (roth ira, 401k, etc.) nor is there health insurance. I'll leave the health insurance for a rant another day. Anyway, I want to know if there are any other clever ways to invest the $2500/month so that after the 2 years are over I'd at least have gained something slightly significant. $60,000 will be enough to fund my dream, but I'm wondering if there's a way that I could invest that $60,000 instead of just letting it grow in my checking or savings account.

*Note, in the past I day-traded and was quite successful until GTAT decided to tank. I'd like to get back into investing again, but for 2 years I'm wondering if it's worth it to do dollar cost averaging, also there is the possibility for the market to crash and I lose a huge chunk of the investment when I'll need it in the next 2 years. Not sure if risk is worth the reward.

Fellowship received: $12k

Cash on hand: $40k

I already started school earlier this month. It is an executive MBA program so I have classes every other weekend for the next 18 months while keeping my full time job (no my job won’t cover any tuition; trust me I tried). The program has a deferred payment schedule (payments aren’t due until 45 days after the last exam per module) so I will owe ~$5,666 every 1.5 months or so until I graduate. I have decided to take out private loans instead of Federal Direct Unsubsidized loans because I can potentially get a better loan rate with private loans (I have a great credit score ~810 last time I checked), private loans have no origination fees, and the Federal loans have a cap of $20500/year. 
Here is my thinking: I will use my cash to cover all payments until it is exhausted and wait to take out the loans until I need them. This is my thought process because the loans will start accumulating interest as soon as they are paid out. 
My cash will cover all payments for 2016 and I will need loan $$ starting January 2017. 
Here is my question; when should I apply for the loan? I don’t want to apply early and I don’t want to apply too late. Can I apply and get approval now and not have the loan pay anything to the school until January 2017? I don’t want to wait too long in case interest rates rise and also can’t risk running into any issues with the loan that would keep my tuition payments from getting paid on-time.

How's it going? Good? Good. I could use your help...

Long story short, I've recently come into some money, £24k in fact. I also have £3k saved and will receive another £25k or so later this year (probably May/June).

I come from a working class background and this is way more money than I've ever had. I know little about finance and am a bit unsure as to what I should do.

A bit of background - I'm mid 20s, live in London and have a pretty good job (I earn enough to pay my rent, bills/expenses and still have a few hundred pounds left over per month) and, aside from my student loan repayments, I have no debt. 

My question is, what should I do with this money? It's currently just sitting in my savings account, which has an extremely low interest rate. Clearly, this isn't enough to retire off, but I feel it could definitely be used better than it is now. 

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",finance,1454020590

The warranty says:

    This repair is covered under the Toyota Federal Emission Warranty. This warranty is in effect for 36 months or 36,000 miles, whichever occurs first, from the vehicle’s in-service date.**

    For California specification vehicles sold, registered, and operated in California, Maine (starting with 2004 model year), Massachusetts, and Vermont, this repair is covered under the California Emission Warranty, which is in effect 36 months or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first, from the vehicle’s in–service date.

Now notice that this applies for 2003+ Corollas and the TSB came out in late 2007.

So what about the 2003 - 2004 Corollas which would be, by definiion, out of warranty when the TSB came out?

Would the owners be 100% responsible for the cost of repairs?

If so, not considering that this fix requires just a gasket replacement, if we could assume this is for a $1000+ part or a dealer only replacement (dealer will not just sell the part because it needs some dealer specific tools for the whole repair to work), how would it work?

A couple weeks ago Netflix announced that they would start cracking down on these services, and as of a few days ago TurboFlix customers have been complaining that the service stopped working. 

I think these guys made a huge mistake in closing down VoS, since it ought to have been pretty clear that Netflix had the ability to crack down on their service at any time.

personalfinance,$25.5K debt. $300 monthly deficit. Moving/Medical Bills/Budgeting. Need advice.,"TL;DR: $25.5K debt.  Monthly credit line payments totaling $621.40.  Monthly income deficit of $300.  $2200 in my pocket.  $1000 in medical bills on their way.  $1045 rent due tomorrow.

Between finding a second job, moving out immediately and finding a roommate or roommates, downsizing on everything and anything I can possibly sell, applying for consolidation loans, and budgeting as tightly as I physically am able to with my food/carpooling/generic-brand necessities/etc., is there anything else that I'm missing that might make this scenario a little lighter?


I currently make $35.7K.  My monthly net takehome after 401K contributions and health insurance costs is roughly $1880.

My debt is in the form of a personal loan, auto loan, and four credit cards.  No student loans.  Never missed a payment.

My monthly payments to all of my credit lines now totals $621.40.  Due to being month-to-month at my apartment complex, my rent was raised in October, and then again in December, and I now pay $1045.00/mo in rent, not including electricity.

With all of my other mandatory expenses (food, gas, auto insurance, cell phone, internet), I now have a $315 monthly deficit of income, meaning that I am going $315 further into debt every month.

I have a promotional salary raise coming at the end of February that will bring me to  $38.7K.  In March, I will get a merit increase, most likely to $39.9K.  In April, we have a performance award which will be roughly $2290.00.  My current checking balance is 2177.20.

I have been fervently searching for apartments, townhomes, duplexes, roommate listing, etc. under the sun over the past two weeks to try to get out of my current place as soon as possible.  I live out-of-state from my family and do not have any friends that would be willing to take me in.  My folks gave me $10,000.00 last year, which wound up going toward other debt, car repairs, and medical bills, so financial assistance from my family is out of the question.

This weekend I am going to start looking for a 2nd part-time job for my evenings and weekends to assist my income.

I also have mounds and mounds of tossed out Lending Club solicitation letters that I am considering applying for in order to consolidate as much as possible to reduce my interest rates, but more than that, my monthly payments toward credit lines.  I applied for $35,000 back when my debt was higher, as the offer itself said up to $35,000 and I stupidly thought this was a pre-approval.  I was denied.  I keep receiving their letters, though, so I don't know if it would be pertinent to apply again with a denial in their records.

My vehicle is a 2005 Kia Sorento LX that has had about $4000 in repairs since I bought it for $5400 on my auto loan.  Everyone here told me to get rid of it and buy a cheap Honda, but I went with advice of family and friends about not being out of work further and pursued the repairs.  The engine is still not right and there are issues that I believe will ultimately lead to more hefty repairs in the not-so-distant future.  It's a huge liability and I'm not sure what to do, as there's this lien that I can not pay off with my current funds.

More than anything else, medical expenses are going to be difficult this year.  I just checked my insurance claims and I have almost already met my $1000 deductible, with $991.86 in bills that have not yet reached my mailbox.  My out-of-pocket maximum is $3000, which I expect I am going to meet this year due to certain treatments that can not be delayed.  Although I'm not going to let it stop me, my medical problems already cause me to be very exhausted and tired after my desk job, to the point where I have focus and eyesight issues that leave me scared about what kind of level of comfort I'm going to have once I pick up a second job.

I moved out to Washington State to pursue physical and emotional independence, and between poor budgeting, previous depression and apathy, and a host of medical crap that has resurfaced recently, I have managed to do the exact opposite with my finances.

I want to get out of debt as quickly as I can... but I feel as if the #1 most important thing right now is to minimize my monthly expenses, including my credit line payments, so that I can have a place to live while still managing to make payments on my debts without a deficit.

I am still reading through this subreddit, and have been listening to an audiobook that a coworker suggested to get more acquainted with financial responsibility, but I need to change my circumstances in such a short amount of time, that I was hoping to post here in case there is anything major I might be missing.

personalfinance,Can we afford to buy a house?,"Deets:

Location: Los Angeles

Wife and I currently have about $20k in credit card debt (all 0% APR through 2017), and about $18k left on a 5 year 0% APR car financing deal. 

Combined AGI is about $140k, and have we have about $19k in liquid investments ($12k in equities, $7k in a Roth IRA).

Currently we are paying $1900/m in rent for an apartment neither of us like. 

Our goal was to focus on paying off all our credit card debt by the end of the 0% period next year, and then start saving agressively for a downpayment. I'm confident we can do that. 

I just got thrown this wrinkle though: My mother was just offered a deal through her bank for a $300k HELOC on her home at a rate of 2.4% the first year, and then a fixed rate of 3.05% after that. 

She has offered to lend us up to $150k of that amount for a downpayment (repayable to her at the same interest rate). I don't think we could get a rate that good anywhere else, plus we wouldn't have to apply for it. She could literally write us a check, we could then leverage as a down payment. 

We would still have to get a mortgage for the balance. I don't think we would look at anything over $400k.

I guess my question is, should we take advantage of this or should we hold off a few more years?

personalfinance,What a Buffet Taught Me about Financial Advisors,"A few weeks ago I gave patronage to one of the great American experiences. This is a place where every appetite-fueled desire can be fulfilled and not an empty stomach can be found. There is a selection of B-Grade appetizers and C-Grade desserts as far as the eye can see, and all for the low, low price of $15.95!


What is the slice of heaven?


The All-You-Can-Eat Buffet…God Bless it. And God Bless America.


As I stood there pondering the method in which I want to devour my plate full of guilt and regret crab legs, I began to wonder how this place can make a profit when they seem to only appeal to an audience of wide-waisted individuals.  Then faster than the approaching bout of diarrhea, it hit me.  Adverse selection! Economics 101 is back.


Students, take your seats.


All-You-Can-Eat Buffets (AYCEB) charge a premium price for all customers in hopes to mitigate the effects that certain customers have on their profit margins.  Since they will, at best, break even with the heavier eaters, they will attempt to turn a profit from those gluten free hipsters that decide only to eat a kale salad with lemon water (It’s a dietary restriction, of course). This is essentially a rigged trade, where one group always gets screwed.

This is able to happen due to a concept called informational asymmetry; or the theory that one party (like the high appetite eaters) has better information (the fact that they’re going to tear up that buffet) and hence receives more value within the transaction than the buffet owner.  So how does the AYCEB put the transaction back into balance? They simply charge a higher price for everyone.

One could argue that it’s not entirely fair that both parties are paying the same amount even though the amount of food eaten is vastly different. You’d be right too, it isn’t.  However, welcome to the second “most American” experience we have to offer, the moral hazard.  Nothing gives us more joy then to see someone’s burden fall onto the back of another.  This is precisely what the heavy eater does to the slimmer customers of the AYCEB.

So how does this relate to Financial Advisors? I thought you’d never ask.

Think of your Advisor as your favorite local buffet, chalked full of products and services, with some that you otherwise may have never known to exist.  Ranging from the staples like financial planning, tax consultation, and brokerage trading all the way to the “next to the men’s room door” items like private placement investing and venture capital formation.  It’s great to have an Advisor that can offer such a wide variety of services, and they are undoubtedly well versed and knowledgeable in the areas they offer. But, are they necessary?

Let’s look at an example…

Typically, Investment Advisors are compensated in the form of hourly fees, flat fees from financial planning, trade commissions, and assets under management (AUM) fees. This all depends on what type of contract or service you signed up for.  So let’s say you walk into an advisory office for a one-time financial plan, just to get a handle on your entire situation.  The Advisors charges you a conservative $500 fee or $125/hour for a half day of work.  He offers some basic suggestions about rolling your old 401(k) over, diversifying your portfolio, and setting up a 529 Plan for your child’s education along with giving you a breakdown of your own financial security.

After much talk, you agree to allow him to actively manage your assets for a fee of 1% (common) of your total AUM.  Once all the paperwork is processed a few days later your $100,000* nest egg is safely in the hands of a licensed professional. Phew! You can sleep again. Or can you…

Now let’s make a few assumptions: your investment earns 5% a year before any expenses or fees, you make no additional contributions or withdrawals, and you invest only in low-cost mutual funds with a .25% expense ratio.  In five years…

With your Advisor, your net earnings rate would be 3.75% after the 1% annual fee and the .25% expense ratio. After 5 years, your $99,500 (you need to decrement the initial planning fee*) is now worth $119,984.
Without an Advisor, you net earnings rate would be 4.75% after only the .25% expense ratio. After 5 years, your $100,000 is now worth $126,748. An increase of almost $7,000 compared to the Advisor assisted plan.
But, wait. You say. That’s not fair. How can you use the same return for both accounts, managed and unmanaged? Well, you’re right. We are probably giving too much credit to the advisor, as advisors often fail to meet or outperform investments in low-cost index funds, such as the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO).


Back to the buffet analogy…


Investment Advisors can make a lot of money off of those folks who have large, complicated portfolios (larger appetites), with complicated tax situations and other needs which may render their services necessary.  However, the majority of us have much smaller portfolios and the need for only basic services and advice on markets and personal investing. Hence, a much smaller plate and no need to pay the relative premium for the All-You-Can-Eat type services.

So if you’re thinking about signing on with an Investment Advisor first ask yourself…Is your appetite big enough to cover the cost of the buffet?

Now that you’ve weighed the costs and benefits of paying a Financial Advisor, if you’ve landed on the decision to sign on with one…Great! As I said previously, many Advisors are extremely knowledgeable and can not only help you generate reasonable risk-adjusted returns in investments but save you much more in their understanding of tax sheltered accounts, mutual fund load types, and overall tax and fee avoidance.  But before you sign the dotted line, I urge you to do some due diligence on the person or firm you may want to do business with.  It goes without saying that not all Advisors are the same, and just because you have or know an Advisor, does not make them right for you.

So often in an industry known for market fluctuations, regulatory changes, and other unknowns, problems exist.  However, many are completely avoidable.  If you follow these five tips when choosing an Advisor, I cannot promise you positive returns, but I can promise you that you’ll be more confident in your Advisor.



Five Things To Know About Your Financial Advisor



Disclosure, Disclosure, Disclosure.



In real estate it’s all about location, in finance…disclosure.   Financial Advisors come in all shapes and sizes with varying investment objectives, expertise, backgrounds, and even personal agendas.  With that said, no matter what the Advisors is offering, it must by both State and Federal law (SEC), be disclosed.

I’ve seen Advisors base their firm’s advice structure on everything from gold and precious metal plays to only investment areas that are backed by biblical verse (not joking).  Is one more right than the other? Is it illegal to cite Genesis in your promotional materials? No. But it must be clearly disclosed to current and prospective clients.  The financial regulatory industry does not make it illegal for people to invest their money, or for folks to issue securities based on crazy ideas or farfetched theories.  Hell some may even pay off, just look at Spanx.  But most unfortunately for the investor, do not. Cue up the Beanie Baby.

It is only when a person or entity deliberately misleads, or fails to properly disclose material fact, do they cross the line into illegal territory.  So before getting in too deep with a specific Advisor, make sure you see what they are all about first.  So how do you do that?

Per SEC rules, each Advisory office must submit a form called the ADV Part II, more commonly known as a Brochure. This documents provides, amongst other things, an overview of the business, their investment strategies, any third party affiliations (i.e. insurance broker), and past disciplinary actions.  Moreover, this brochure is public and must be presented to any potential client.  So if you want a copy, just ask!

If asking someone directly isn’t your thing, or if you’re trying to maintain a low profile, there is another way to check.  This method will provide you an overall snapshot but without all the fine details the brochure would, but it is equally as important and easy to obtain. So without further ado…



BrokerCheck



The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) created a one-stop shop for those people who want to get a short and sweet background check on pretty much anyone associated to a financial entity.  You can search by name or CRD Number (think a financial and public Social Security Number) and even narrow it down by distance from a certain zip code if you want to find someone in your area.  Once you’ve found the person of interest, just print off the detailed report and viola, check complete.

These reports will show you any and all financial exams they’ve passed, past and present employment history, and even what no-no’s they have on their record.  These can range from previous suspensions from the industry (major red flag), customer complaints, and even personal bankruptcies.  Even though you may think you’re accessing some confidential information, trust me, you’re not.  All of this information is for public viewing and completely reasonable to question if and when you decide to meet up for a consultation.

Even as the website states right on the homepage, there is really “no reason not to check”.  Click on the hyperlink above and start your digging.



Do they follow a Fiduciary Standard?



This tip is a little bit trickier than a simple search, but may be the most important.  Unbeknownst to even financial literate people, currently the law (Investment Advisers Act of 1940) states that all investment advisors must follow a fiduciary standard; however broker dealers are exempt from the definition of “investment adviser” and therefore must only meet a “suitability standard”.  This, in a nutshell, means that brokers should not push for investment choices that are not suitable, or appropriate for the given client given their risk tolerance and objectives for instance.  An example would be having an 85 year old grandmother in poor health opting into an annuity with a lengthy surrender period.  Obviously the broker is just looking to gain the commission off the sale.

The point here is that many Advisors have what the industry calls a “dual affiliation”, meaning they are registered as an Investment Advisor and an agent of a broker dealer.  It’s because of this difference that requires advisors who are recommending securities to clearly disclose whether they are brokering a security or advising for a security.

So even though there is at a minimum a suitability standard, which definitely helps avoid egregious issues; there is still some leeway for advisors to subtly push for investments that may present higher commissions rates for them.  Although these types of investments may arguably be suitable, they may not necessarily be in the best interest for the client, and hence would violate the fiduciary standard.  I would advise you to see whether or not your potential Advisor has language of this sort in their contract, or just ask them to add an addendum if not.

Read this article if you are interested in better understanding this dilemma and what the President and Congress is trying to do to fix it.



Check the Fee Schedule!



As cited above, fees are the proverbial thorn in the side of almost every investor.  The lower you can get them, or avoid altogether, the better.  There are two areas that an Advisor must disclose their fee arrangements that are fully available to a potential investor.  First, is on the nifty Brochure that I spoke about earlier.  Specifically, Item 5 on that document should breakdown how the Advisor plans to withdraw their fees, if they will be paid in arrears, how often they will be deducted, and even disclose if they (or any other associated person to the firm) will be compensated for the sale of a certain security.

Furthermore, the SEC states that this form must be written in “plain English”.  Meaning, it should include “…short sentences, definite and concrete words, use active voice, and use tables or bullets points for lengthier or complex topics.”  It is the right of every investor to ensure that material being presented to them is clear and complete.  Never forget that.

Secondly, knowing that the brochure is a more universal document available to all potential investors, the advisory/investment contracts are usually tailored to a specific clients needs, and hence will provide greater detail on the types of fees you will be accessed.  This is the where the rubber meets the road in a sense.  This contact will lay out what percentage you will be charged (if you are on an asset-based plan) and should never really deviated from the .25% – 2% range, or 25 to 200 basis points.  Normally the more money you have, the lower your fee will be.

Also be aware that not only will your Advisor charge a management fee, but there will be often multiple other fees that you should know about.  For example, if you invest in mutual funds there will often be a load, a management fee, and a brokerage trade fee for the initial purchase.

Lastly, you should also know that not all of the fees you will be charged go directly to your Advisor. The managers of mutual funds, custodians of the accounts, brokers and solicitors, and even costs associated to distribution and advertisement (also known as 12b-1 fees) all get a cut.  Many of these fees are unavoidable, even if you decided to forgo the services provided by an Advisor and manage your own money.



Trust



They say go with your gut, and no truer words have been spoken when talking about entrusting someone with your finances.

Read the details within all of the aforementioned tips and press them on anything you want to clarify.  If they seem to skate around the issue, or in any way leave you feeling confused, that might be a sign that are not right for you.  Understanding your financial outlook doesn’t have to be complex or hard to understand, but rather the complete opposite.  The more confusing it becomes, it is in all likelihood, making it a far riskier environment for you.  As my graduate school professor once said, in situations like those just “KISS em’”.



Keep It Simple Stupid.



And, you know what? There’s nothing simpler than low-fee index investing. As Occam’s Razor tells us, “The simplest solution is most often the correct one.”

personalfinance,22 year-old engineer &amp; recent grad; looking for debt payment &amp; saving advice,"I graduated last month and have gotten a job in my field as an engineer in training. For the next 3 months I've been placed on a project with shift-work and lots of overtime hours. Without paying rent and with other added benefits I'm confident of being able to save +$25k by the end of this time. I will then be moving back to the city where my office is located (Toronto) and getting an apartment.




With current debts:

* Car: $19,000 with .99% interest &amp; $280 monthly payments

* Maxed Line of credit: $15,000 with 3.7% interest rate

I've budgeted being able to contribute about $1000/month to debt &amp; savings after this 3 month period. 
I definitely need to build up a solid emergency fund and would like to really grow my savings/start an RRSP/TFSA.

So I'm wondering how aggressively I should pay off my debt and in what order? My initial savings are essentially nothing. Any other advice would be very welcome.

I played the game through once with the Institute win.  Then I started over and dropped some save-bombs where I knew the key decisions were made, and played out the other three outcomes (Railroad/BoS/Minutemen).

I was a bit miffed that the institute HAD TO be blown up in three out of four endings.

I'm sort of upset that I couldn't take over the institute and occupy it, rather than destroy it completely.  Even for a a synth rebellion, they were only too happy to commit eventual genocide against the synths, by blowing up the factory that made them.  Either you're all for the institute and become a powerless figurehead, or you annihilate it.  I didn't like blowing up the blimp, either, really.

personalfinance,Need help fixing my life and financial situation. Save me lol,"I apologize for the ""Great Wall of Text"", bad grammar/punctuation but I'm new to /r/personalfinance and I could use a LOT of help. Financially I'm a disaster.

I'm 28 and I've spent nearly half of my life homeless and living very frugal. The other half i've spent spending crazy amounts to barely get by, and stay on my feet. 

I've never established any credit, my credit score is low and I qualify for nothing. Providing proof of income is difficult, I have trouble finding a place to live, I am living dollar to dollar and I know nothing about taxes.



Let me start off by whom I live with:

Girlfriend
3 Step kids
1 Biological Daughter
-
what I do for a living:

I buy/resell. I go to auction houses/import/store liquidations/yardsales/thrift stores and I buy things which I later resell on ebay/amazon/craigslist/etsy/close5/offerup. 

depending on the month I generally sell between 2,600 - $3,300 from ebay/amazon alone. craigslist/esty/close5/offerup/facebook groups probably brings me in another $3,300 in sales. I estimate profits being at around $3,600 monthly


Household income:
Social Security for disabled step-son(aspergers): $796.68 a month
Child Support for 1 child: $767.00
Myself:  $3,600 buying/reselling. fluctuates monthly.

grand total = around $5163
-

Expenses:
Rent: $1,750(1bedroom apartment)
Internet: $77.55
Cellphones: $170(sprint contract)
Gas &amp; Electric: $112-$160 monthly
Car Insurance: $68.97 monthly(basic liability)
Water + Garbage: $50 monthly 
Food: No clue, estimate between $800-1,300

I consider those my basic expenses. I estimate it coming out to around $3,100+ monthly.  unfortunately I'm left in debt at the end of the month because I'm constantly playing catchup, something comes up and/or something always happens. My truck will break down,son with aspergers will destroy property that i have to pay for,I repay numerous loans I've taken out,interest fees, my digital camera will break, parking tickets, late fees on everything. I feel I'm just forever paying late fees/interest/debt/unexpected expenses.


Before 6 Years ago I was doing great. spending around 70% of my earned income after supporting myself, my family, and my mother. I even had a nest egg saved. I thought I was financially perfect and would even blog about how people are in their current financial situation because of their spending habits.

So 6 years ago My mother was diagnosed with a laundry list of medical problems. things ranging from cancer,copd(chronic obstructive pulminary disease),hepatitis, liver failure, heart condition, kidney issues. I was told she wouldn't have much longer to live and I decided I didn't want to be one of those people who spent a ton of money on a funeral. I'd rather be the type to spend it on my mother while she was alive.

We spent money wrecklessly, gambled, traveled,vacationed. I felt I was young, and fully capable to get back on my feet and resave for another nest egg. Unfortunately things didn't workout that way.

I was living in Stockton, CA and I had the worst year ever 3 years ago. I had my vehicle stolen and my house broken into. I had to cancel numerous online orders because items I had already sold were stolen or damaged during a break in. Because of a mass cancelation of items I had both my ebay and amazon account restricted/limited on how many postings I could post monthly. I had to repurchase a camera, computer, printer, tv, truck, and a ton of other things. about a year after that incident. I took out numerous loans on reddit from various people. Paid everyone back and slowly got back on my feet. then my house was broken into again but this time with my family home.

Wife/Kids held at gun point. everything pretty much destroyed, my vehicle stolen again. I've been robbed before and even at gunpoint, but that was the first time in my life I ever felt like my family was in danger. I hated that feeling and we sold everything we could salvage, took out more loans and bought the cheapest running truck on craigslist and moved to Southern California. it's way more expensive here but it's a beautiful town that I've dreamed of living in since I was a child. It's safe and It has tons of programs for my son with aspergers and buying/reselling seems better down here.

I took out more loans and found the first apartment that would allow me to live there. Unfortunately it was overpriced and unsanitary. I had to break the lease to leave because management wouldn't take care of roach/mice issues. Now i'm in an overpriced 1 bedroom apartment paying month to month.

Anyways here is my current situation:

I've got around $500 right now. I'll have an additional 796.68 for my sons disability coming in on the 30th. my rent of $1,750 is due on the 5th. I'll most likely be able to raise the money or scrape it together by then by selling off inventory. 

I realize that $1,750 is ridiculous for a 750sq ft 1 bedroom apartment. I can't see myself doing this for many more months. I see 2 bedroom houses for around the same, and even nice 3bedroom houses for $2,100. I am determined to move next month as I'm super crammed in this tiny apartment, and I feel like I could use the storage space for my business.

I'm going to have to come up with 1st month + deposit to move. I'm anticipating this to cost me around $3,700 - $4,000. 
-

Another issue is my truck: It's a piece of junk. total gas hog.(13mpg) It has 366k miles, the transmission doesn't work,the blinkers do not work, and the power steering is terrible. It's so hard for me to turn right and I'm shifting the automatic as if it was a stick shift. Fixing it will most likely cost me around $2,500+.

It's a hospital bill which I refuse to pay on principal. I was in an accident taken to the hospital via ambulance. left strapped to the gurney in the hall in the back of the hospital. I unstrapped myself after an hour and talked to the front desk. i explaind i came via ambluance and saw nobody. they told me they were very booked and had me wait in the emergency waiting room. I signed papers, waited for around 5-6 hours. saw someone waiting beside me bleeding from multiple stab wounds and decided to leave as if he wasn't being seen chances are I wouldn't either.. I was charged for the hospital visit and the ambulance ride. I paid the ambulance fee and refuse to pay the hospital as I was never seen.

I'm assuming it's an AT&amp;T bill. I've never had AT&amp;T, no idea why I would owe them. I'm assuming my mother might have opened an AT&amp;T account in my name, but I'm uncertain. I'm not paying them though because It's not my bill.

Because of these issues on my credit report I assume thats why I was never approved for any credit card I attempted to get one.



___________





So I'm at a point right now where I need to move, and I most likely will need a new vehicle as I'm not sure how much longer i can survive with my truck. I literally spent around $500 last month fixing a radiator issue + fuel pump issue + paying tow truck expenses. I'd hate to spend more or that again and still have issues with my truck.

I've taken around $5-6k in loans in the past 3 years through reddit. met some great people and have paid everyone back.

Currently I've got a bunch of redditors who will help me out if I need it. I have a redditor who will loan me $2,000 to go toward the purchase of a truck. I'll have to pay around $600 in interest and not have to pay back for 4 months. I also have 2 other redditors who have let me borrow in the past that will most likely lend me around $700-800 each with $100-300 interest for a month or two.

So I can potentially borrow $3,400 at any point but I'm still debating on what to do.


Currently the only loan I have out is a paypal working capital loan. It's through my paypal account. anytime I sell something online 15% goes towards repaying my loan. It's a $1,000 loan, I owe around $400 on it. I think If i pay it off I can be given a larger loan of around $1,500-$2,500.(that's what i was offered last time, but took less) interest is around $100 on a loan between $1,500-2,500. I'm uncertain though because I read from various posts online that paypal working capital only loans out so much money at one time, and if there are too many loans currently out they wont offer anyone a new one.





Here is what has been going through my mind:


#1 buying another truck before mine goes out again and i have to 
pay more money for a truck I don't plan on keeping.
-
#2 I don't have the cash to pay rent let alone pay off my paypal working capital loan early. So  i was thinking of potentially borrowing $400 to pay it off.  pay around $20-50 interest on that $400 and hope paypal offers me the same loan they offered me in the past.


I've also been looking on craigslist every day for a 6 seat truck. can't seem to find anything for under $3,500. they all have super high mileage or mechanical issues. I found a few dodge durangos and 6 seat SUV's with mileage around 150k. I can get them for around $1,700-2,500. It'd save my ass right now and I wont have to worry about breaking down again. but I'll eventually need a truck as I buy/sell a lot of furniture and need a truck for transporting that stuff. 

I was thinking of the SUV route. I think i can squeeze more time out of my current truck if I only drive the SUV and arrange pickups with my truck anytime I find a big furniture piece. that way i'm only driving my truck for pickups and not an every day driver.
 
Unfortunately the older cheaper SUVs don't have the best mileage. they are around 14mpg-18mpg but they fit everyone


I was thinking about going to a dealership for a truck with good mileage. but the last time i went to a dealer they wanted like $6,000 down and gave me estimated payments close to $500 because I have no credit history + no proof of income. they didn't accept ebay/amazon as proof of sales/income, nor 1 of my kids child support as income because it could potentially stop at any moment if the biological father becomes unemployed.

I was thinking of building up my credit but I have no idea how long it would take. If i could build it up somewhat in 3-4 months enough to get a truck at a reasonable price from a dealership I might do that. I might be able to squeeze that life out of my current truck. I was thinking of borrowing the cash and get a secured credit card and build up my credit.

So here is what I feel my choices are:

#1 borrow 2k and buy an SUV and use my truck only for furniture pick ups.
-
#2 borrow nothing and pray my truck lasts me a few months so I can save to get out of this hole.(I'm terrified though as I've had trouble with my truck for the past few months)
-
#3 borrow money to payback my paypal working capital loan and hope they reissue me a loan they offered me in the past with a very low interest rate
-
#4 borrow money from multiple redditors and buy decent 6 seater truck so I don't have to worry about any additional truck issues. but then I might be out of resources to lend me additional money for my moving expense.
-
#5 borrow money for a secured credit card and start building up my credit in hopes of buying a truck from a car dealership at a reasonable price.




I really want to move, and I'm afraid my truck will not last me. I hate getting towed. I've had to tow my truck 3 times in the past 3 months. If i don't move I'm stuck paying an $1,750 another month for a tiny 1 bedroom apartment.

Also last year my gf had a friend of hers talk us into doing our taxes. gave them our info, he gave me $1,000 and never gave her anything, and changed his number. No idea what I actually recieved or what he did with my information or hers. When he was filing for her, he did say someone else tried to claim her and 2 of the kids. We assume it was her husband who is father to 2 of those kids as he's a scumbag who has done stuff like that in the past. she can't even divorce him because we have no idea where he lives. she hasn't had contact with him in the past 9 years.

I think we need to fix our tax situation, but I'm unsure how. I get no W2 forms because I don't have a traditional employer, and I've honestly never done them before.",finance,1454037235

I'm a college freshman and was fortunate to receive a large enough scholarship that when combined with federal aid pays my tuition every semester, complete with books. I only had to pay $300 for a parking pass both semesters. It is possible that once I am in my last two years of undergraduate I may have to throw in a few hundred of my own towards tuition because the costs are always higher for Junior / Senior credits.

I don't pay any bills (insurance, etc) and my only expense is gas for my commute to school. I have a part time job which allows me to cover my gas and leaves some extra spending money as well as savings. I've had about $3000 just sitting in a savings account for a while and I'm considering just throwing that all in a Roth IRA.

The conditions of a Roth are that you can withdraw the contributions you make penalty-free &amp; tax-free anytime you want, penalties are only paid on withdrawing earnings before the certain age. So is there anything wrong with me letting my savings sit there if I don't really need them? 

I don't foresee any major expenses, and even if they were to happen, I would be able to withdraw my own contributions with no penalty, right?",finance,1454042124

personalfinance,I have a question about filing tax return and commission pay.,"Well maybe more than one question.

I make commission at my job. Every single month I get three paychecks, two for the hourly wage, and one for the commission. My commission check gets a 25ish% tax. For example if I made $2800 commission for that month, I get about $2100 to my bank account. It's something similar every month.

Fast forward to my w2. I ended up making about 35k in salary for the whole year with the wages and commissions mixed in there, but its saying that they only withheld about $1300 for the federal taxes.

Is that normal? Shouldnt the taxes withheld for my commission show up in there as well? 

To add to that, last year my gf and I made about the same amount of money, and she got about 1k back for her tax returns, while I had to pay about 2k.

Why is it so different? Why do I have to pay more because I made commission? I feel as if they are not giving me credit for the taxes withheld from my commission thus making pay more taxes at the end of the year.

Last year my fiance and I found out we were expecting our first daughter and about 4 months in some severe health issues and complications began to arise for her. For her safety and for the baby her doctor put her out of work until the baby came which brought us down to a single income household. Being in an entry level position I don't make alot of money (~$22,000/year). While she was out of work we were forced to put some heavy usage into my credit cards for unexpected expenses that came up (multiple car repairs, appliance replacement, and an emergency vet bill). Fast forward to today (baby and fiance are both healthy and recovered) but we now have about $5,000 in credit card debt spread across several of my cards. A couple of these cards have 30%+ interest rates (secured cards with predatory lender: First Premier) that come from credit building after my dead beat dad stole my identity. Anyways, our monthly payments are pretty high and I have been looking into a debt consolidation loan. I don't have any experiences with these loans and was hoping for some advice.

We have 4 sources of debt. 

- Rooms To Go Card with a balance of $349.76 and is currently on a 0% interest promotion until January 2017

- Lowes Credit Card with a balance of $900.71 with a 0% interest promotion until January of 2017

- Personal Credit Card with a balance of $6,295.65 and a 0% APR (Not sure how but that's what my statement says)

My current plan has us paying off the Rooms To Go Card in 3 more weeks ($91 a week) and then the Lowes Card being paid off in April. The big question is, do we tackle the loan after that or the credit card?

We maintain more than the minimum payment on the credit card because we use it for almost everything and then pay that portion off. It got increased in balance due to a house expense that was unexpected.

My common sense says to go after the loan since it has the interest rate but with the credit card being able to fluctuate, would it be wiser to tackle that first? Or is it worth consolidating it into one payment and just dealing with it that way?

personalfinance,"Within a bracketed tax system, do I pay the higher tax on ALL my income, or JUST the portion ABOVE the bracket limit?","This question is about federal taxes within the US.  I'm ignoring everything about deductions/credits/etc. - I'm looking for as simple of an answer as possible.

I was talking to a couple of friends about taxes, and one of them commented that when your income puts you into a higher tax bracket, you only pay the higher tax on the amount OVER the bracket limit.  The other friend disagreed, and said that you pay tax at the bracket percentage for the whole amount.

Here's some made up numbers to illustrate:

* Bracket A taxed at 5% for gross incomes of $0-$999.99
* Bracket B taxed at 10% for gross incomes of $1,000-$1,999.99
* Bracket C taxed at 15% for gross incomes &gt;= $2,000

In this case, if my gross income is $2,500, do I pay 5% on my first $1,000 ($50), 10% on my second $1,000 ($100), and 15% on the remaining $500 ($75)?  (So $50+$100+$75=$225)

Or instead do I pay 15% of the whole $2,500? (So $375)

The latter seems ridiculous, since a person making $1,999 would pay $199.90 (netting ~$1800), but a person making $2,000 would pay $300 (netting $1,700), even though their income only differed by a single dollar.

Official sources that would be great, since I want to settle this argument with something other than ""See?  This guy on Reddit says...""",finance,1454087360

investing,The Case for a Bear Market (US),"Basic catalysts/indicators:


1) Overvaluation. Schiller PE Index at 24.37 vs 16.65 mean. GDP growth (0.7%) is slightly north of anemic does not justify an earnings-growth reversion to mean, nor does the current (to-be-reported in the next few months) impact of low oil prices on energy stocks, and trickle-down effect on financials, consumer, housing. PE is higher than fundamentals and historicals justify


2) Emotional, not fundamental rally. Biggest driver of oil price rebound in the last two weeks was shorts covering. There has been no substantial, fundamental change in supply/demand dynamics to support a sustained bounce. Oil prices are below long-term equilibrium by at least $5-$10/bbl, but no near-term catalyst exists to support a reversal.


3) Fed rate increase: ~~The cancellation of the most recent hike is a suspension, and~~ at least one hike will occur before FYE2016, likely two. The end of QE coupled with interest rate increases, which are inevitable as the fed eases tension on the debt and equity bubbles, will drive down stock prices, *in addition to* placing pressure on a soft US economy, likely spurring a short-lived, minor recession. 

4) Corporate bond spreads are increasing. This indicates growing belief that credit conditions--and broader economic conditions--are set to deteriorate, a leading indicator for equity markets.  


5) BOJ: Just set interest rates negative. This couples a weak Yen with a weak Yuan, which hurts US exports, a major offset for any benefits manufacturers may experience from lower oil. 


6) Recent S&amp;P performance. Predictable pattern of exuberant growth, followed by a steep correction (seen in Dec/Jan), followed by upward correction (last two weeks), followed by full bear market decline. We're in a bull trap now, based on shorts covering, optimism decoupled from fundamentals, and once reality sets in, markets will plummet.

Our combined income is $120,000 pre tax. We owe $72,000 on our house, with a monthly payment of $700. It has a new roof, new furnace and air conditioner, new siding and insulation, ect. We've done a lot of work to it.

worldpolitics,What Exactly Putin Had to Say on Communism (x-post /r/BritishCommunists),"https://irrussianality.wordpress.com/2016/01/26/putin-on-communism/ Paul Robinson

On Monday, Vladimir Putin followed up last week’s denunciation of Lenin with a long exposition on what he thought of communism. Given that Putin’s political ideology is a matter of considerable, often ill-informed, speculation, his answer to a question about Lenin at the regional forum of the All-Russian Popular Front in Stavropol is a really important ideological statement. So below is my (somewhat quick and rough) translation of the key segment.

My own interpretation of this statement is that Putin:

approves of socialist ideas (equality etc) in the abstract, but feels that communism failed to put them into practice.

disapproves of Soviet methods of government, particularly political and religious repression, and definitely doesn’t like Lenin.

sees some advantages in state intervention in the economy, but not on the scale practised by communism. He comes across as favouring a European-style mixed economic system.

is willing to countenance limited regional autonomy, but nothing more, and is strongly opposed to confederal ideas of a state made up of equal members. He strongly opposes regional secession.

regards Ukraine as an artificial construct.

puts a great emphasis on the state and the harm that communism did to it in Russia. Again and again, Putin returns to the state and the idea of statehood (gosudarstvennost’). A strong state emerges as a primary value.

Anyway, this is what Putin had to say:

[When I worked in the KGB] I wasn’t one of those who became a party member because I had to, but I can’t say either that I was an ideological party member, my attitude towards it was one of caution. Unlike many public servants I wasn’t a public servant with a party point of view. But unlike many of them I didn’t throw away my party card, I didn’t burn it. … It’s still lying around somewhere.

I liked a lot, and still like, communist and socialist ideas. If you look at 'The Code for the Building of Communism,' which was widely distributed in the Soviet Union, it strongly resembles the Bible. This is not a joke, it’s like an excerpt from the Bible. The ideas are good: equality, brotherhood, happiness, but the practical embodiment of these remarkable ideas were far from those laid out by socialist utopians like [Henri de] Saint Simon and [Robert] Owen. Our country did not resemble the City of the Sun.

Everyone accused the Tsarist regime of repressions. But what did the establishment of Soviet power begin with? Mass repressions. I won’t talk about the scale, but simply of the most appalling example: the destruction and shooting of the Imperial family together with their children. Perhaps there was some idea that it was necessary to eradicate, as it were, any possible heirs. But why kill Doctor Botkin? Why kill the servants, people generally of proletarian origin? For what purpose? In order to cover up the crime.

Remember, we didn’t use to think about this much. Very well, they fought against people who resisted Soviet power with arms in their hands, but why kill the priests? In 1918 alone, they shot 3,000 priests, and in ten years 10,000 of them. In the Don region, they threw hundreds under the ice. When you start to think about it, and you get new information, you evaluate many things differently.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, in one of his letters to Molotov, I think, wrote – I can’t quote him exactly – that the more reactionary representatives of the bourgeoisie and the priesthood we shoot, the better. You know, this approach doesn’t tally with some of our former ideas about the essence of power.

And the role of the communist, Bolshevik party in the collapse of the front in the First World War is well known. What was the result? We lost to a country which lost, since several months later Germany surrendered, and we ended up losing to losers, a unique occurrence in history. And for what purpose? For the sake of seizing power. How should we, knowing this today, evaluate this situation which brought enormous, simply colossal, losses to the country.

And then there’s the economy. Why did they move to the New Economic Policy (NEP)? Because the existing requisitioning of farm produce wasn’t working, it couldn’t. It couldn’t supply the large towns with food. So they moved to a market economy, then quickly got rid of it.

You know, what I am saying now are my personal deductions, my own analysis. A planned economy has definite advantages, it allows general state resources to be concentrated to fulfil very important tasks. In this way, health care questions were resolved – an undoubted service of the communist party of that time. So also were questions of education solved – an undoubted service of the communist party of that time. So were decided questions of defence industrialization. I think that without this concentration of general state resources, the Soviet Union could not have prepared for war with Nazi Germany. And there was a great probability of defeat with catastrophic consequences for our statehood, for the Russian people and for the peoples of the Soviet Union. So these are all definite pluses. But in the final analysis, insensitivity to changes, insensitivity to technological revolutions, to new technological structures led to economic collapse.

And finally, the most important thing, which is why I said that we must look in a different way at the ideas which the then leader of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, formulated. What were we talking about? What was I talking about? About how a mine was placed under the building of our statehood. What did I mean? This: I had in mind the discussion between Stalin and Lenin about how to build the new state, the Soviet Union.

If you are a historian, you should know that Stalin formulated the idea of a future Soviet Union based on autonomy. In accordance with this idea, all the subjects of the future state should join the USSR on the basis of autonomy with broad powers. Lenin criticized Stalin’s position and said that it was inopportune and incorrect. Moreover, he promoted the idea of the entry of all the future subjects of this state – and there were then four: Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia, and southern Russia, the Caucasian Federation as it was called, you know better than me.

So he, Lenin, said that the state, the Soviet Union, should be formed on the principle, as he said (I may be mistaken, but the idea is clear), of complete equality with the right of secession from the Soviet Union. And this was a slow-acting mine under the building of our statehood. Moreover, the ethnicities of a multinational but in essence unitary state were given boundaries and territories, and these boundaries were drawn completely arbitrarily, and in general without any foundation. Take Ukraine. Why was it given Donbass? To increase the percentage of proletarians in Ukraine, in order to have social support there. It’s such gibberish, you understand? And it’s not the only example, there are many more.

Cultural autonomy is one thing, autonomy with broad state powers is another, and the right to secede is a third. In the final analysis, this combined with ineffective economic and social policies led to the state’s collapse. And this is a slow-acting mine. And what is it if it is not a slow-acting mine? That’s exactly what it is. And bearing in mind the possibilities of today, we must simply attentively analyze everything which happened in the past. But one can’t smear everything which happened in the past with black paint or look at everything which happens today in bright colours. One must attentively and objectively analyze it in order not to repeat the mistakes of the past, and to build our state, economy, and society in such a way that the state only gets stronger.

**From the Turbotax website:**

&gt; **What's the difference between Federal Free Edition and Freedom Edition?**
&gt; 
&gt; TurboTax Federal Free Edition is part of our TurboTax Online product lineup and is intended for very simple returns. Unlike Freedom Edition, there are no income limits. Upgrades and add-ons (such as TurboTax PLUS and Audit Defense) are available.
&gt; 
&gt; TurboTax Freedom Edition is geared towards lower-income filers **(regardless of tax return complexity)†** and is offered through the IRS Free File Alliance (FFA) program. State returns are free and no upgrades are available.

**You can receive a free Federal return with Turbotax if:**

* Your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is $31,000 or less, OR

* You are eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit, OR

* You are active military with an Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of $62,000 or less

Free extensions for anyone

Same criteria apply for free state return(s) for any state

**Note**: 

* Other companies offer this free service if your AGI was $62,000 or less **(which is, for some reason, different than Turbotax's $31,000 AGI limit)**, you can find other free software options in the link below.

* Review each company's offer to make sure you qualify for your free federal return.

* Some companies offer free state tax returns; some charge a fee. For more information, see the IRS link below.

**If Turbotax isn't your thing there are 12 other free softwares that offer the same service via the IRS Free File Alliance program, which includes TaxACT, H&amp;R Block, Jackson Hewitt and more:** https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/jsp/index.jsp?ck

†This is what really saved my bum because I did make under TurboTax's $31K limit in 2015 but I had a complex income form (1099-R), which disqualified me for TurboTax's Federal Free Edition (1040EZ/1040A) and forced me bumped me up to the Deluxe version, which in turn made my State Return not free as well.

financialindependence,Anyone know a formula or tool to compare a job with a DB pension plan to another with a higher salary but no pension?,"Hi, long time listener first time caller. I recently took a government position and am enjoying the idea of having the defined benefits pension plan that it comes with. 3.1% required employee contribution for a pension equal to 1% of the highest salary (maintained for 3 years) per year of total service (1.1% if over 20 years). I'm still getting offers from the private sector and am trying to figure out an accurate way to calculate what kind of salary increase I would need to break even or match the long term benefit having this pension plan provides. 

For example, I am at roughly 100k currently. If I stay until ~60 I will have 40 years of service at 1.1% per year (44%). This means if I never get a raise or promotion, I will have a 44k a year pension. Assuming something more realistic, in 30 years I should be making at least 150k a year, for a pension of 66k. Using a SWR (Safe Withdrawal Rate?) of 4%, this means I'd need to have had a 401k or other investments equal to $1,100,000 or $1,650,000 respectively, correct? This coincidentally also equates to the sum of my yearly pensions if they last 25 years of retirement (from 60-85 years). To see that kind of nest egg, I'd need to have the ability to invest an extra 15,750 or 23,650 (after taxes) per year respectively (assuming a 5% per year compound interest rate), right? 

So according to this formula I'd have to see a salary 24k or 35k higher (assuming 34% in total taxes) in order to break even. Meaning at 100k now, I'd have to see at least a 124k or 135k salary to objectively make it worth it. The numbers seem a bit off, so I want to check my math.

Is this the best way to calculate the objective long term worth of my/a DB pension plan in Salary comparisons?",finance,1454104415

Questions about Obamacare/Medicaid in NY","Hi, like the title says I am over 26 (not eligible to be on my parent's insurance plan), been living at home with my folks and been unemployed for the last 6 months. I recently tried applying on the NY Gov Insurance Marketplace website, [link here](https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/individual). I entered in all my info and I requested the option see if I'm eligible for any federal help paying for health insurance as I really can't afford even the most basic premiums.

I list that I'm unemployed and not sure what my income will be in 2016. I end up getting a message that what I entered did not match their federal/state records and that I would need to send Proof of Income. The options were things like paystubs for the last 4 weeks (which I don't have), expense records if I'm self employed (I'm not), a certified letter from my employer (again I'm unemployed).

Here's the one last piece of information before I ask my question: my 2014 income tax return does not qualify me for Medicaid, but my 2015 (which I have yet to file) does qualify me (I've been unemployed for roughly half of 2015 and my 2015 income is roughly half of my 2014 income). 

I tried calling the NY Health Insurance helpline but they must be swamped and I just couldn't get through today. I tried calling a bunch of times and was on hold for almost an hour at one point.

I'm hoping some of you could help me out and offer some feedback:

- Are they basing my eligibility on my 2014 tax return? Is this why they are requesting Proof of Income? 

- Is my 2015 W2 considered proof of income? If not what would I have to provide? I believe I could get PDF copies of my paycheck statements, but those end in June 2015. Would that count?

- What qualifies as proof of income if I've been unemployed the last 6+ months? 

- I read that the Obamacare penalties do not apply if you are applying for Medicaid or child health insurance, no matter when you apply (i.e. past the January 31st deadline). Is that true? 

I'm sorry if these questions have been answered. I tried searching, maybe I missed it. I would appreciate if you could refer me to the relevant thread.",finance,1454112515

personalfinance,"The elusive question: Roth or Traditional? A case for Traditional, and why having both is a good thing.","I have been seeing this question pop-up lately, and wanted to bring up the advice given about paying attention to your *current* marginal tax bracket and your *future* effective tax rate. I specifically want to address 401(k)'s. The FAQ specifies current and future *marginal* tax rate as criteria for choosing. The rest of the criteria highlighted in the FAQ are simple to interpret and apply to your situation.

Marginal tax rates are important today because your 401(k) contributions are scraped off the ""top of the bucket"" meaning that any Traditional contributions will defer taxes from your highest marginal tax bracket, and any Roth contributions will be taxed at your highest marginal tax bracket (income that had the opportunity to be scraped from the top). 

However, in retirement, these contributions will make up your *entire* bucket, meaning all Traditional distributions your receive in a given year will be taxed at your effective tax rate, and your Roth distributions are obviously tax-free.

I was inspired to post after reading this article, which might be a little misleading, showing that Roth is a better choice if all else was equal. Again, we should be talking about before-tax and after-tax dollars: https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/roth-or-non-roth-401k

I ran a comparison on my own assuming a 25% marginal tax rate today, and a 15% effective tax rate in retirement, ignoring deductions and exemptions, and contributing $18,000 **gross pay** in a year and letting it grow for 5 years at 6%:

   | Traditional 401(k) | Roth 401(k)
---|------------------|-----------
Gross Pay | $18,000 | $18,000
Marginal Tax Rate | 0% | 25%
Contributions | $18,000 | $13,500
Growth YoY | 6% | 6%
Year 1 | $19,080 | $14,310
Year 2 | $20,225 | $15,169
Year 3 | $21,438 | $16,079
Year 4 | $22,725 | $17,043
Year 5 | $24,088 | $18,066
Effective Tax Rate | 15% | 0%
Distribution | $20,475 | $18,066

**Some obvious points:**

* **Traditional 401(k) is maxed, but Roth is not**. If you have the flexibility to max a Roth and are not in a super high tax bracket/state, going Roth will increase your tax-advantages.
* You could max a Roth, do both, or go all Traditional + taxable brokerage. But if you are a moderate to high earner, and want additional cash flow *today*, Traditional is a sensible option, especially if you plan to retire to a no-income tax state, and keep your expenses low in retirement. 
* Someone's marginal tax rate will always be greater than their effective tax rate. Does this mean that really, with all else equal, and assuming you get distributions equal to your career pay, will Traditional be beneficial (""top-of-the-bucket"" concept)?
* There is always the lurking shadow that puts a wrench in a Traditional 401(k)'s plan... RMD's (required minimum distributions) where you are forced to withdraw a certain amount instead of withdrawing small amounts to stay at a lower tax rate.

But here is why having both helps. If you have an opportunity to convert to a Roth, the flexibility is there to do so. If you need more income in retirement, your Traditional funds can fill the ""bottom"" of your income bucket (and low tax brackets) and your Roth can be the extra that fills the top, distributed tax-free.

I have spent the past several weeks trying to justify to myself for having a Traditional 401(k), but now looking at it this way: as someone who is in the 25% marginal bracket, contributing about 75% of the IRS 401(k) limit in a year, maxing a Roth IRA, and choosing to have additional cash flow today to increase liquid savings for short-term goals (car, wedding, house), and expecting to move to a lower income tax state (indifferent about the potential rise in federal rates), and keep low expenses in retirement, a Traditional 401(k) plus Roth IRA seems sensible.

Our first step is to find a new bank. SO has had bad experiences with his current bank and my own doesn't have easily available branches/ATMs nor does it offer any credit card options except for businesses. This doesn't help either of us very much.

We have recently created a spreadsheet to help along and organize our research, but we are at a loss on where to even begin. We're both young and we both have decently paying jobs and make quite a bit of money for a couple in their mid 20s. We want something that'll give us the best options to help us grow, save, and build credit, but beyond that we're not even sure what we want out of a bank. We are very new to all of this and are trying to be proactive.

In our spreadsheet are these research tops:

* Fees
* Card Options
* Branch and ATM Locations
* Interest Rates
* Additional Services

What else should we be focusing on, /r/Banking? What should we look for in a bank?

The topics we have thus far seem very broad. While they have helped to narrow down google searches - the results leave us with more questions that are hard to find answers to. We don't know enough about banking to understand when something is good or bad. How do we know if we're getting a good deal or if we would be setting ourselves up to be screwed in the long run?

Here are more questions based off of those searches:

* What are industry standard banking fees? 
* What are the average interest rates banks usually charge?
* APR???
* What additional services do banks usually offer?

personalfinance,"YSK: Take advantage of co-op education programs if your college offers it, to increase financial aid eligibility.","Hey guys. So this is something I have recently realized and researched on and surprised it wasn't a more well known topic. Also disclaimer I am just an average Joe and have no professional experience or anything I am just stimulating discussion!

What cooperative education is, at least at my community college, is that if you work a job (any number of hours, any job), you can enroll in a cooperative education class at the school and basically get college credit depending on how many hours you complete while in the program. You would need to have the job already before enrolling, so a typical Spring semester would mean to hold the job already anytime before spring semester starts, enrolling in the course (which doesn't actually meet, but you need to attend a couple seminars or something). After which you get the paperwork setup with your supervisor, and continue working the job as you do normally and log those hours. Once the semester is over, submit the final paperwork and get college credit for the hours you completed while in the program. You still work the job as you did before the semester, if you choose to.

Why is this beneficial? Let me give an example:

You might confuse this with work study. What work study essentially is, the federal government offers some money to subsidize wages you get paid by an employer if you setup an agreement and are eligible. If you are given let's say, $2000 in work study, you can earn up to $2000 in that eligibility period with that job (which usually is limited to part time jobs, either on or off campus). When the FAFSA asks you about your income and other info, you input this number and they calculate your Estimated Family Contribution (just a # they use to determine if you're eligible for financial aid and how much you can get). If you make less than the income allowance of around $10,000 (for students who are independents with no dependents or spouses), you're good to go regardless. If, let's say, you make $12,000, $2000 of that is counted AGAINST you in the calculation. This is where work study comes in. By inputting the $2000 you earned from work study into that box, that amount then becomes disregarded, thus giving you an adjusted income of $0 and making your eligibility status better.

So what is the difference between work study and coop education? Well, work study for one is limited to the amount the federal government and your school determine you are eligible for, so very much tied to your award package as well as the cost of attendance at your school. Second, work study is limited to part time, so people who might need or prefer full time jobs given that some may provide nice salaries and benefits, can't utilize it unless they demote or quit. Why cooperative education is a much better alternative is because you can work any number of hours, and then get college credit equivalent to the ratio of the hours for whatever the course policy is, and ANY earnings you make as long as you are in the program are then disregarded on the FAFSA, with its own question similar to the work study one. You input the earnings you made while in the program, and that amount is then not counted against you. So let's say you are someone who makes $55,000 a year, and in the spring, summer fall semesters you enroll in coop. Give or take around 10 months of time spent in school and in the program, any earnings you make in those 9 months, you add up, put in the box in the FAFSA question, and that number is then disregarded. So that is $41,247 minus your yearly salary, coming down to $13,753 of income that the FAFSA calculates. Then when you factor in the 10,000 income allowance, it brings down your adjusted income to $3753. Still a pretty high number, and of course this is all very basic calculations, but look at this way, you a good portion of the money you make back in your pocket, and STILL get some extra money to pay toward school, so you don't have to go bankrupt or take out loans because you have more of a chance to build up your savings. ALSO mind you, some colleges may not offer the program, or may have limitations on how many times you could do it. Mine for example, a community college, limits it to 4 semesters.

There is also a double benefit to this for taxes. Because it is highly likely any income you make is going to be less than 100,000, as long as that (along with financial aid) is the only income you have, you can file a 1040A or 1040EZ which means all your assets are disregarded during FAFSA. So by building up your savings, not only will you have all the money you earn, but you get to keep all the money too should you choose to do so in savings, and not have FAFSA penalize you by factoring that in their calculation and expecting you to pay out of your savings.

I hope this makes sense for you guys haha. This is really good for working parents who also go to school either part time or full time, or young adults who maybe have been put in a rough spot and needed to get a job to support themselves before they could focus on school. It sucks that the FAFSA essentially penalizes people who's parents don't support them, if the student makes over the income protection allowance and thus has to choose between paying for school against other necessities.",finance,1454136498
Bitcoin,A Fork in the Road - What is Bitcoin?,"Questions and Answers about Bitcoin from both Core and Classic perspectives. 

# Who makes Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is an open source project so anyone can use it and modify it but it has a group of developers who are dedicated to improving it

## Classic Answer

Currently there are five developers however there are zero current developers who will lead the project in day to day programming in the long term or are working on any significant new features. This is hoped to be improved in the future. Big companies such as mining operations and fiat exchanges and in the future node operation companies decide what Bitcoin is, with the help of market research to determine what people want Bitcoin to be.

## Core Answer

Currently there are well over a hundred contributors to the project, many new features are in progress and there is a generally accepted roadmap for future features that the developers are happy to commit to. In the last year, 45 different people directly contributed to the codebase. Development on the system is open to companies who want to contribute, or anyone as long as they can work with others and produce results that everyone can see are helping accomplish the basic use cases of Bitcoin

# What Is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a new kind of money that is designed to be used by anyone in the world via the Internet. 

## Classic Answer

Bitcoin is something that can be used to sync money and all sorts of information in a global database. We don't know if that can be cheap for the long term but we will try and extend that concept using currency inflation and expanded supply of space for sale for as long as possible. It's difficult and expensive to control your own money fully but you can choose from some providers who help you control it which should hopefully keep it pretty accessible for most people. The tradeoff for that convenience is that those people who help you use Bitcoin get to represent you when making changes to Bitcoin, although you can always just stop using Bitcoin.

## Core Answer

Bitcoin is a stable and reliable currency ledger that makes a limited set of promises and avoids risking people's money through as strong as possible security guarantees. You can fairly easily control your own money completely, others can stop using Bitcoin of course but no one can possibly redefine the strong starting guarantees guaranteed to you without your explicit consent. 

# When should the world use Bitcoin?

The world could use Bitcoin today, but it wouldn't be the same going forward because as more and more people used it, it would need to change its character in some respects.

## Classic Answer

If Bitcoin is used by everyone right away what will happen is that it will work as it does today, but running the servers that power Bitcoin will become more and more expensive. It will be similar to email: everyone will just look at some ads and let a company mine their data a bit in exchange for access to the Bitcoin network and sacrifice of control of how it works. It will still be possible for an individual to run their own server, but over time it will be pretty impractical and difficult to do it anonymously or in a way that can't be easily shut down by a powerful attacker.

## Core Answer

If Bitcoin is used by people right away, the network will become expensive to transact on directly but it will remain cheap to be a peer to peer node with no outside dependencies, practically anyone will be able to do it without major expense. Since the node will remain cheap and have a low footprint, it will be difficult to attack and easy to use fairly anonymously. As the network becomes expensive to transact on this will create a market opportunity that provides alternatives to the network, limiting the growth of network expense and providing a range of cheaper or more convenient alternatives.

# Why should people use Bitcoin?

People should use Bitcoin to hold currency and send each other money over the Internet

## Classic Answer

Bitcoin should be used as a permissionless alternative to PayPal and other money transmission services. Businesses can set up money transmission businesses without quite as much legal hassle and people can use a low cost way to send money or other long term stored information to each other in ad hoc ways. Businesses decide all the rules of Bitcoin, but they are motivated by profitability to make sure these rules still sound attractive to users.

## Core Answer

Bitcoin should be used as a worldwide standard basis for currency to act as a federal reserve or gold standard or European Central Bank. People can then keep their money in Bitcoin with the assurance of gold that it will retain its limited nature as well as fungibility and other essential properties, but with the convenience and flexibility of modern digital fiat currencies. Sending money to people can be done over the network itself or via various competing centralized and decentralized systems that interface with Bitcoin and depend on it as a stable foundation and use it as a unit of account.

# Where is the Bitcoin stored and processed?

Bitcoin is principally stored on the Blockchain that is essentially a ledger file that is synced around the world. Some Bitcoin are held in custody for people in various ways, still on the Blockchain but held by a proxy mechanism.

## Classic Answer

The Blockchain is a huge file that lives in a bunch of data centers around the world. People can still retain an element of control via holding their own private keys, but they depend on these data center operators to accept, store and process transactions. These operators are also the ones who are relied upon to check that the rules of the system are being followed, and thus they also decide those rules.

## Core Answer

The Blockchain is a small file that lives on individuals computers all around the world. Anyone and everyone can act as a full peer, so everyone can check that the rules of the system are being followed and thus everyone can participate in deciding the rules by deciding all the rules for themselves.",cryptocurrency,1454137869

personalfinance,"Which to pay first, student loan versus mortgage","My wife and I are having a huge difference of opinion and I'd like some educated opinions so I can either bow down to her infinite wisdom or brow beat her with, what appears to be, common sense to me.

Here's the situation:

* $120k in high interest (8%) student loans
* $159k and 13 years left on 15 year mortgage @ 3.75%

We got lucky and got a great deal on a house ($180k) that we've updated and now, just two years later, is being valued at $230-240k because the neighborhood has become extremely in demand. To provide validation to that, there have been and still are, new communities being built up that are starting in the $400-700k range that are selling like crazy so we, being an ""older community"" (homes were built in the mid-90s) are essentially the low end entry point for people to move here and homes on my street/subdivision are, literally, selling within 2-3 weeks.

So, here's the debate: My wife wants to follow the traditional ""pay the highest interest rate first/always"" so she would like to pay the student loans and mortgage simultaneously making the regular mortgage payment and putting as much on the student loans as we can afford (~$1500/mo). While it seems like a good approach, to me it sounds insane because we will be still paying both in 10-15 years and paying interest the entire time.

My opinion is that we should sign up for a student loan program we were offered to lower the payments to ~$400/mo and then switch the mortgage over to bi-weekly payments (shaving off 1.2 yrs) and also making double payments which, by the online calculators, would pay the mortgage in 5 years. 

While we would be accruing higher interest in the beginning by not making a dent in the student loans, the interest saved on the mortgage and paying the student loans in full in 3-5 years would be the more sound financial decision than carrying the interest for a decade or more on both.

Please, help us settle this debate and provde a little clarity to which path would truly help us get out from under this mountain of student loan debt and the stress, anxiety, and emotional torture that comes along with it.

While we would be paying extra interest for the student loans, we would also save close to $30k in mortgage interest and, at around year three, we could sell the house and use the proceeds to pay off the student loans in full at that point and still have enough left over for a down payment on a replacement house.",finance,1454162202

personalfinance,should I sell a home for a loss,"I'm trying to decide if it is a good idea to sell one of my homes for a loss.  I moved out of state during the housing crisis and turned my old home into a rental property.  I have no interest in ever living there again.  I did not have enough equity at the time to refinance my mortgage (and apparently still don't) so my interest rate on this home is 6.25%.  The original loan was for 186k.  I have 153k left on the mortgage and I've put around 20k into the property.  I have been talking to realtors and they estimate my home would sell for 155k.  So if I sell I'm looking at a minimum 50k loss and that's before realtor fees, possible loss of rental income while under contract, and any surprises found during inspection.

The rental situation sucks and is largely why I'm thinking about selling for a loss.   My monthly mortgage payment with insurance and taxes is 1.6k (p&amp;i is 1.1k).  Rent brings in 1.4k but after property management fees (9%) and the odd ball repair I'm probably averaging 1.2k in rental income a month which means I'm paying ~$400 out of my own pocket still towards the home.  My tenant was not being reliable with paying rent on time.  They were over 2 months behind despite their having ~6k a month in income.  I took them to court to with a notice to evict and gave them a pay and stay option and they are now current and have been since.  Outside of thinking they don't have to pay rent on the 1st they have been pretty good tenants and they keep the property in good shape.  Their lease expires in May.  

The pressure of my tenants not paying rent on time really weighed on me.  I also have a mortgage on the home I live in now and while I could make full payments on both notes for a while I obviously don't want to be doing that.  I'm so underwater on the rental property that I don't want to put any substantial amount of money into it, and that could easily happen if it is a rental and the AC or heater goes.  They are both over 10 years old and the only candidates for major items that will break in the next 10 years.  

I need help understanding if selling for a loss is a good idea.  I know I lose money on the house as a rental simply because rent collected &lt; mortgage payment.  But I don't understand how to calculate how much I really lose when I take into consideration tax benefits I get from the write offs the house provides.  I'm not even sure what parts I do get to write off ... I just enter everything into a tax program and let it do its magic.  If I sell for a loss how does that loss affect me on taxes in the years to come?  What else should I be considering while making this decision?",finance,1454163459

personalfinance,"[Debt] Feeling out of control, looking for debt/budgeting help","Hello r/finance, first time posting here.

I'm starting for feel out of control with finances here lately. My wife and I are basically living paycheck to paycheck, and even having to use a credit card to buy groceries at this point. Admittedly, it's our own fault. Even though I make a budget every month, we don't always follow it, and we spent way too much money Christmas and our recent anniversary.

We had a $1,000 in our emergency fund, but often dipped into to pay for rent or groceries, etc. The payments on my student loans are overwhelming each month. On paper, I feel like we both make enough money to pay for everything each month. Yet, it never ends up that way by the end of it. I pay over $400 to Sallie Mae each month and around $176 to federal loans. That's nearly as much as my rent. Our emergency fund is down to only $40, and we barely have enough money to pay rent and utilities this week.

Should I looking into talking to someone at Sallie Mae to stop payments temporarily or see if they can reduce the payment each month? At least until I can afford to build back up our savings. The federal loan payments aren't really overwhelming, but should I look into changing my repayment options there to income-based repayments? I make around $30,000/yr with my new job pre-tax, and my wife probably makes around 10-12k. And she's also planning on going back to school in the fall.

Here's what my current budget looks like: [February Budget](http://i.imgur.com/GU19q0Z.png)

Ignore the Emergency Fund amount, there's actually only $40 there right now. Rent is also normally only $675, but higher than usual due to a pet deposit being due.

Here's what my current debts look like:

Sallie Mae Loan 1: $13,041.10 (11% interest)

Sallie Mae Loan 2: $2,755.11 (8.5%)

Sallie Mae Loan 3: $1,953.46 (8%)

politics,So you want to have an impact,"I hear a lot of people claiming that they can't influence their governments. Various complaints of ""they don't listen to me"", ""a single voice doesn't matter"", and ""it's too complicated"". This post is to help people start to **effectively** get involved in politics. It comes from a good amount of experience with state, local, and federal government and campaigns. I welcome any other voices of experience.  

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Go state &amp; local**

It's an open secret that nothing interesting occurs at the federal level anymore. There is a reason that PAC's have  recently spent more at the state level than at the national level. Think about it, the following policies are determined at the state and/or local level:

&amp;nbsp;

* Education
* Criminal justice
* Most energy policies
* Infrastructure (except national highways, but even then states have a lot of latitude)
* Most taxes and fees
* Most health care policy (All federal health programs are administered by states.)
* Some environmental policy (more depending on your state)
* Most civil rights policies
* Many agriculture policies
* Many housing policies
* Guns
* Abortion
* Minimum wage (most states set it equal to or higher than the federal rate)
* Zoning

&amp;nbsp;

You get the idea... Most of the complaints that people have about government can be addressed at the state and local level. Pretty much the only issue that states don't touch is foreign policy.

&amp;nbsp;

**2. It's not about money, it's about getting re-elected**

People claim that politics is about money. But it's not. It's all about winning that next election. Sure, money plays a part in that, but what really matters is votes. We all remember the massive 2008 Tea Party uprising that, with little money at the time, unseated supposedly safe seats and upended state legislatures. Politicians are not thinking ""how big is this campaign donation going to be?"", they are thinking ""how does this affect my chances at getting re-elected?"" Always remember this. If you want to have an impact you need to be able to influence how many people vote for or against a candidate. Thankfully, there are a ton of avenues to do this, which we will get to. Don't believe me? Listen to [this](http://freakonomics.com/2012/01/12/does-money-really-buy-elections-a-new-marketplace-podcast/) podcast. Here is a teaser:

&gt; When a candidate doubled their spending, holding everything else constant, they only got an extra one percent of the popular vote. It’s the same if you cut your spending in half, you only lose one percent of the popular vote. So we’re talking about really large swings in campaign spending with almost trivial changes in the vote.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. How to effectively contact your elected officials**

I'm hate to say ""call your representative"", but it works, it does. Depending on the issue and timing they might get hourly or daily reports on the number of constituent contacts for or against an issue. One voice doesn't *typically* sway them (and why should it? A government in which only one voice wins the day is called a ""dictatorship""). But how can you be the most impactful with a call? Think about the question above: how do you influence votes? When contacting elected officials be polite, allow them to explain their point of view, but be frank with your opinion. The key phrase is **""I will not vote for you again if you take this action""**. If you call and are a misinformed dickhead they won't really care; misinformed dickheads aren't going to convince other voters of anything. But if you're informed, well-spoken, and once supported them, they are not only counting your vote, they are counting all of the votes of people in your social circle that you will be able to convince. Remember, it's about votes.

&amp;nbsp;

One of the best ways to get under a candidate's skin is to write a good letter to the editor (that's for another time) to a paper in their district and *call them out by name* with specifics.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Rep. So-and-so might vote for Senate Bill 69, which bans ice cream sales on Sunday and hurts residents of this district who like ice cream. People who like ice cream shouldn't support Rep. So-and-so if they vote for this bill.

&amp;nbsp;

After the letter shows up in the paper, call their office and ask them to explain ""that letter in the paper today"". Many times it results in a response letter from the official. I've seen this tactic alone sway fence-sitting legislators.

&amp;nbsp; 

Speaking of public settings, many elected officials hold public coffee hours in their districts. Go to those and get to know them. They will start to recognize you and you can develop a rapport with them. *You want them to think about your opinion when they are thinking about casting a vote.* Knowing they will have to deal with you face-to-face is a great incentive. But don't be an Old Man Phil (see below).

 &amp;nbsp;

To give you a framework on how to think about elected officials, here are set of questions I always ask before meetings with them:

* Where are they from?
* How close was their last election (both primary and general)?
* What is the big story in their hometown paper right now?
* Where did they go to college and what degree did they get?
* What are recent media statements they have made?
* What bills are they sponsoring right now?
* What committees are they on?
* What are their interest group ratings?
* What associations are they members of?

&amp;nbsp;

Some common myths/legends/stuff:

&amp;nbsp;

* It doesn't matter if you fax vs call vs email. They are all counted the same.
* It *does* matter if you use a form letter or script. Don't use them. The briefing will go something like this: ""800 people called about the new zoning rules, but 760 of them were reading from the union script, so it's not that big of a deal.""
* Keeping the person on the phone for longer does not make your message more impactful. After 5 minutes the person on the other end of the line is looking at their email with you on speaker.
* Asking for a contact back *does* matter and you should do it. But expect a lot of mailings if you give an elected official your mailing address...

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Know the process and leverage it**

See how Rep. So-and-so *might* vote for the ice cream ban above? **You must influence the decision before it's been made.** Politicians never change their mind, even in the face of evidence. It wasn't always this way, but as a populace we have unfortunately labeled people who adapt their opinions in the face of evidence as ""flip-floppers"", ""RINOs"", and ""DINOs"". But I'm digressing. Knowing the process takes work but it will make your lobbying efforts much more successful and efficient. At the state level you're typically looking for a small set of individuals:

&amp;nbsp;

* Speaker of the House (or your state's equivalent)
* Senate Majority Leader (or your state's equivalent)
* Committee Chair and Vice-Chair (both majority and minority)
* Bill sponsor (a hugely important person who is often overlooked)
* Bill co-sponsors
* Chairs of Appropriations committees (depending on the nature of the bill)
* Governor

&amp;nbsp;

At the local level it depends on the governance of that local entity. For example, some cities are run by city councils as opposed to mayors. The point is: know the process and find the leverage points.

&amp;nbsp;

There is another way that policy is passed, and that's in budgets. The budget process differs by state and locale, so I won't go into it here, but it's suffice to say that knowing this process and where your leverage points are can be very beneficial for many issues. This one is all about timing.

&amp;nbsp;

Not all policies are in bills. Some are administrative rules made by departments or agencies. This is particularly important in the healthcare field. The best way to influence these rules are through the respective committee members (so if you don't like something that the state police are doing you should see if your local representative sits on the Civil Rights Committee). Those committee members probably have the personal cell phone number of the directors of those departments. If you're having trouble navigating the state's bureaucracy the Governor's office is almost always a great resource (remember, the Governor administers all of state government). If the Gov's office can help you with your unemployment claim they will because they know you will vote for the Governor in his re-election campaign.

&amp;nbsp;

One last thing on the process: **Call the right person.** I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say ""Well I called the Governor's office about the potholes in my road!"" when the road they called about is maintained by the city. It shows a lack of interest and effort on your part and you shouldn't do it.

&amp;nbsp;

**5. Pick your issues and stay focused**

Don't be Old Man Phil that calls up the Governor's office on every issue. Elected officials don't think about Old Man Phil. You want them to pause and think ""If I vote for this bill I'm going to hear about it from that one guy that always calls about education stuff."" Very related to this: **Give your elected officials credit when they do something you like**. They almost never get credit, and politicians are ego-maniacs, so they like to be complemented. Doing this will tell the official two extremely important things about you: 1) that you're paying attention, and 2) that you can be swayed to support them if they listen to you. 

&amp;nbsp;

Politicians like to know what will make you angry or happy. *Have clear positions on specific issues.* For example: I support City Council Resolution 17. I don't support funding for Planned Parenthood. I support gay marriage. Calling and saying ""they took our jobs!"" or ""fuck the police!"" doesn't give them much to go off of. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Consider starting a PAC.** Reddit hates PACs, but they can be very effective and literally anyone can start one. Rules differ by state, but they can be extremely effective in getting your message out. However, be warned: **follow the damn rules.** There are a lot of rules for PACs and violating them is bad news. See [this Ballotpedia page](https://ballotpedia.org/PACs_and_Super_PACs) for info on how PACs work. PACs can focus on one issue (The Ice Cream PAC) or multiple issues based on its donors (The Simpletown Neighborhood PAC). PACs are a lot of work, but it's a surefire way to get elected officials to listen to you.

&amp;nbsp;

**Summary**

Influencing the system is like anything else in life: you get what you put in. It's really easy to be a keyboard warrior and complain about how no one listens to you when you're not making an effort to be heard. You *can* influence the process and be successful. Good luck!",energy,1454171659

personalfinance,"Moving Jobs, Have to Sell Home. Buy or Rent?","Hey everybody!  This is my first post here at personalfinance, so I really appreciate any advice in advance.

I am a current home owner in Tennessee and just recently accepted a job cracking into the six figure mark in Kentucky.  I have only owned my home for about 1 1/2 years on a rural development loan and am getting ready to put it back on the market.  I should make around 5-10K from the sell based on the market trends currently.

My question is, should I invest in buying a new home ASAP in Kentucky or rent for about a year (or more) to attain a full 20% down payment and avoid PMI charges?  My concerns are having to pay taxes on my home sell profits, rising housing costs, looming interest rate hikes and loss of personal equity.  I could probably swing a 10% down payment before the end of the year, but a loan would still include PMI.

Any advice on the direction I should go on this issue?  Rent and soak up the loss, or buy and pay the higher interest until I can refinance??

TL;DR
I'm moving for a new job and have to sell my home.  Should I buy another home or rent until I can save enough money for a traditional loan considering the current market trends and interest rate hikes?

EDIT: I'm not opposed to renting for a time while I figure out where I'd rather buy. I don't have the intention of just running straight to KY and buying the first house with a ""for sale"" sign. What I'm really trying to figure out is what make more sense with my money, putting my money into rent for longer to acquire a larger down payment for a home, or putting that money into a home (once I find what I like) sooner with a smaller down payment.",finance,1454176661
personalfinance,Why are emergency accounts necessarily entirely allocated to high-interest savings or money-market accounts?,"Last Fall, I had an Acorns (a type of robo-investor) account that would automatically invest $20 a day. While I was pleased with its growth, I realized the market, or at least my account, was growing substantially slower than the interest rates on my student loans. I reasoned (with only partially correct logic, given I was paying off my student loans either way) that it was better to put the money into my student loans. 

I was able to liquidate the entire account, and get it placed directly into my bank account, within two weeks. Thus, why not have, say, one month of your emergency account in an immediately available account (money market, savings), and then place the rest in an investment vehicle? 

I can think of two reasons, one being market volatility (but the risk is comparatively low, right?) and the other being for ultra-emergencies, where money is needed *immediately*--but this seems so unlikely as to cause the expected utility of the emergency account to be too low. 

Can someone enlighten me?",finance,1454178205

In Aug 2015, I was hired at a fast food place and have grossed $4314 ($375 towards fed, and $267 towards state) before tax time. 


Altogether (if it even counts/works that way) I made about $8500 taxable dollars, right? I'm aware that that's pitifully below the $15,000 margin, but this was my first ""job"" that hasn't been under-the-table work.

personalfinance,Please help me put my student loan debt on a credit card!,"Here's the quick and dirty: 

I have a 0% interest credit card. It's not a promo rate, it's a credit card with a fairly high limit, and it has a permanent zero percent rate. 

I need help in finding a way to move my student loan debt to this card. If I can successfully find a way to move the roughly $25,000 in student loans at 7.99% to this card, I'll save around $12,400 in interest. 

Here's the kicker. The reason I can't simply refinance this debt, or reduce the rate in some other way, is because the loan itself is not in my name. Thanks to the federal government in all of it's wisdom, there is no way that a college graduate can assume the debt burden from the federal Parent Plus loan, which is in your parents name. My only option is to either A: pay the loan off as quickly as possible, which would take me 4-6 years, all the while paying the ridiculous 7.99% rate or B: use some financial kung-fu to place this debt in my name using unconventional means. Thus far, finding some way to put this money on my credit card is the most attractive option.

personalfinance,Car refinance question,"For reasons that can only be explained if you know how corrupt and crazy Turkey is (except it's totally normal every day here), we need to refinance our car.

Currently our interest rate is 2.49%. The new interest rate is 3.35%. Still super great, I think. Car is worth about 20k. We owe 13,900 ish on it currently. 

Apparently the most important fact: to not refinance to a higher rate, we'd have to bribe our current insurance man. We have already paid him $1400 for a year's insurance, which expires in April, as well as $600 in bribes. To fix the problems our bank has, and to redo our insurance for another year will cost us approximately $2500 if he doesn't demand any more bribes after that, or change our rate when our current coverage ends. Math says it's cheaper to refinance at the higher rate.

Pertinent facts: 

we can wait all the way until December to refinance, supposedly. But there's always a chance our current bank could change their minds and go back to adding silly charges, so we're hesitant to wait.

We're approved for 15,120 for the loan from the new bank, (75% value of car). Also, why is this more than the payoff amount, which they asked for? They will change it to the exact amount, yes? Or do they overpay us and we just quickly pay it back to them as a principal payment?

We currently pay $336 and have 41 months left. No insurance payment (you pay lump sum yearly here).

The new loan must be in yearly increments, and we will have $88 a month in insurance.

Now the question we have to decide is, do we switch to 48 months, which would lower the payment to $305 and then $88 on top, making car expenses 393 a month? Or move to 36 month loan and go to a higher payment, but less time on the loan and thus less interest?

We have plenty of room in the budget to do this. Our only other debt is student loans, and those average 6% interest. After all bills and budgets we split about $800-$1000 a month into savings, vacation funds and student loans. 

If it matters, we will probably keep the car a very very long time, probably until it dies. It's a 2014 Dodge Journey and has maybe 7k miles. 

We're just torn because both options seem equal, pros and cons wise. It's a low interest rate, we could pay it off early if we felt like it, and we can afford the payments either way. It wouldn't put any sort of dent in our budget to up our payment",finance,1454190871
personalfinance,25yo Expat. ~$200k total savings. What am I doing!? (US/UK/EU),"I feel like I'm in a very fortunate but fairly complicated situation, so I'm feeling in crazy need of advice. I've been working a fairly high-paying job since I graduated uni in 2013, and my priority has always been ""SAVE SAVE SAVE"". Thanks to a nice salary, plus stocks and bonuses, I've managed to save up $200k total. That's the good. The bad: I have no idea what I'm doing!

It's currently split between savings and investment accounts in the US, UK, and [EU Country]. About $110k of that is in US investment accounts, from when I worked there. I now live in London, and have another £41k in UK bank accounts ($58k). The remainder is an inheritance from my [EU Country] grandmother, in a [EU Country] bank.

The thing is, my investment accounts (Betterment/Fidelity) have performed really poorly (-8% return so far!!!), and I'm starting to feel like all this cash is burning a hole in my pocket now. What am I even doing?!?

What's the smartest way I can invest this money? Early retirement isn't a priority for me, but I've always liked the idea of being able to take time for travel or funemployment while I'm young, so having some liquid cash is appealing to me. But I wouldn't do that for another 1-3 years minimum, and I'm currently losing money both to inflation and the stock market, so is there a better way?

For so long I've been saving with the vague idea of ""This money will benefit me one day."" But having no assets suddenly feels uncomfortable. At the moment, I am perfectly comfortable renting, since I am thinking about moving to continental Europe next year and like not being tied down to a location. But is real estate in London or the EU a better investment than the stock market?

Here's a summary:

**ASSETS:**

* _US Stock/Bonds:_ $70,000
* _US 401K:_ $18,000
* _US Stock Market:_ $17,000
* _UK Cash:_ £41,000
* _EU Cash:_ $12,000 (in a EU currency)

**DEBT:**

* _Student loan_: $46k @ 1.96% effective interest rate

**INCOME:**

* _Current salary:_ £65000 (London)
* _Future salary expectations:_ 50000 euro (if moving to the EU next year)
* _Unvested Stock:_ $83k (vesting in Feb &amp; May — not incl. taxes)

**EXPENSES:**

* _Total monthly expenses:_ £2600
* _Monthly saving:_ £1200


**POSSIBILITIES:**

1. Keep saving indefinitely, wait for stock investments to regain value, hope to be rich one day.
2. Buy apartment in London to rent out for profit. Could get £325k apartment at £100k downpayment, have £1000/month mortgage, rent out for profit. (Assuming profitable market...)
3. Buy apartment in future European city to live in. Risks: Don't know shit about foreign housing markets, might only live in it for a year before moving again...
4. Keep current savings for 1-3 years, then take a year off working to travel and freelance.
5. Any combination of the above?
6. ???????
7. Profit

I realize I'm in a super fortunate position, but I'm also super lost. All advice, berating, and strong opinions are welcome. My course of action has been no action, what else is possible?

personalfinance,What is the real cost of pulling from my 401(k) or stocks when buying a house? Is it cheaper to take a bigger mortgage?,"I am interested in purchasing a house.

Both my 401k and investment stocks/roth IRA have dropped considerably due to the oil price recently, which make me very afraid to ""realize"" my loss while they are in such a smaller value than when I invested them initially. Can anyone point out if I should touch my 401k or stocks, or take a larger mortgage? WA state and it is a primary housing purchase.

worldpolitics,"According to the Center for Responsive Politics, among the top five largest lifetime donors to Hillary’s campaigns, Citigroup tops the list, with three other Wall Street banks also making the cut: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. This is what the NY Times is endorsing.","The Times Endorses Hillary Clinton with a Banner Ad from Citigroup

By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: January 31, 2016

http://wallstreetonparade.com/2016/01/the-times-endorses-hillary-clinton-with-a-banner-ad-from-citigroup/

Today’s digital edition of The New York Times captures the essence of the cancer eating away at our democracy: a leading newspaper is endorsing a deeply tarnished candidate for the highest office in America while a major Wall Street bank that has played a key role in her conflicted candidacy runs a banner ad as if to salute the endorsement. The slogan on Citigroup’s ad, “cash back once just isn’t enough,” perfectly epitomizes the frequency with which the Clintons have gone to the Citigroup well.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, among the top five largest lifetime donors to Hillary’s campaigns, Citigroup tops the list, with three other Wall Street banks also making the cut: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. (The monies come from employees and/or family members or PACs of the firms, not the corporation itself.)

Hillary Clinton famously told ABC’s Diane Sawyer in 2014 that she and Bill Clinton left the White House after his second term “dead broke.” But apparently, Citigroup felt they were a good investment. According to PolitiFact, Citigroup provided a $1.995 million mortgage to allow the Clintons to buy their Washington, D.C. residence in 2000. That liability does not pop up on the Clinton disclosure documents until 2011, showing a 30-year mortgage at 5.375 percent ranging in face amount from $1 million to $5 million from CitiMortgage. The disclosure says the mortgage was taken out in 2001.

Citigroup has also committed $5.5 million to the Clinton Global Initiative, a charity run by the Clintons. It has also paid enormous speaking fees to Bill Clinton.

What has Citigroup gotten from its outsized support of the Clintons? Bill Clinton is the President who repealed the most important investor protection legislation of the past century, the Glass-Steagall Act, an outcome heavily lobbied for by Citigroup. Hillary Clinton has signaled to Wall Street that she will not push to have the Glass-Steagall Act restored while her leading opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, vows to restore it and return sanity to America’s financial system.

Just nine years after Bill Clinton signed this massive deregulation of Wall Street and gave Citigroup’s Sandy Weill a souvenir pen from the signing, the U.S. financial system collapsed in the greatest implosion since the Great Depression.  Two years before the collapse, Sandy Weill had exited Wall Street as a billionaire as a result of this deregulation, while Citigroup became a penny stock in the crash and a ward of the government in the greatest taxpayer bailout in U.S. history.

In March of 2014, during the Senate confirmation hearing to install Stanley Fischer, a former executive of Citigroup, as Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Senator Elizabeth Warren summed up what Citigroup’s money can buy in Washington:

Senator Warren: “Many big banks are well represented in Washington but the connection between Citigroup and Democratic administrations really sticks out. Three of the last four Democratic Treasury secretaries have Citigroup ties; the fourth was offered but turned down the CEO position at Citigroup. Former Directors of the National Economic Council and the Office of Management and Budget at the White House and our current U.S. Trade Representative also have Citigroup ties. You once served as President of Citigroup International and are now in line to be number two at the Federal Reserve…”

Fischer said he thought his Citigroup experience would help him.

Senator Warren countered: “I also think it’s dangerous if our government falls under the grip of a tight knit group connected to one institution. Former colleagues get access through calls and meetings; economic policy can be dominated by group think; other qualified and innovative people can be crowded out of top government positions.”

One of Hillary’s strengths according to the Times’ endorsement is that she has engaged in a “lifelong fight for women,” a statement that only resonates in some Orwellian universe intractably mired in Newspeak.

Hillary Clinton is the woman who stood by her man as multiple women came forward to accuse him of adultery or sexual assaults. Hillary Clinton is the woman who served as First Lady as Bill Clinton eviscerated the lives of poor children and single mothers by enacting welfare reform, a program so draconian that Senator Edward Kennedy called it “legislative child abuse” and voted against it.

As a result of Bill Clinton’s handiwork in the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, millions more women and children and families were thrown into poverty during the financial crash; 10 million people were forced from their homes through foreclosures, while Bill and Hillary’s rich campaign supporters became even richer – right along with the Clintons.

According to the Washington Post, in less than a year and a half, Hillary and Bill Clinton earned over $25 million in speaking fees, a significant portion of which came from Wall Street firms. In 2012, Hillary’s last full year as Secretary of State, Bill Clinton socked away an astonishing $16.3 million in speaking fees.

The New York Times has a long, storied history of getting it wrong about who is a proper advocate for women. In January 1868, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Parker Pillsbury initiated publication of The Revolution, a news weekly hoping to spark another political revolution. Anthony and Stanton, who would lead the revolution to secure U.S. women the right to vote in 1920 (a disgraceful 144 years after the founding of our “democracy”) were ridiculed by the New York Times. It wrote at the time:

“Our women – a great many of them – ‘Nelly and Kitty, and Dolly and Ketty, and Dorothy Draggletail,’ are anxious to give a helping hand in the government of the world and set things to right, in a general way, and chiefly by means of the ballot-box. We think they are all wrong…

“The ladies mistake their own case, and the world’s case as well. They have power and influence enough – exercised as these are in the sacred places and citadels for the sake of which men go out, and work and trade and fight and run from one end of the world to the other – their homes…

“If women were to quit their family sphere, as a general thing society would run wild or drop loose. They are deficient enough in the practice of those home duties, as matters are at present.”

The Times also famously led the false propaganda campaign that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction in the lead up to the Iraq war – which Hillary Clinton voted for — only to issue a weak apology later, writing: “In some cases, information that was controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged. Looking back, we wish we had been more aggressive in re-examining the claims as new evidence emerged — or failed to emerge.”

And it was a steady editorial drumbeat at the Times that helped Citigroup and Bill Clinton overturn the Glass-Steagall Act, which it also ended up admitting was a dead wrong decision.  In a July 27, 2012 editorial, the Times sheepishly apologized:

“While we are on this subject, add The New York Times editorial page to the list of the converted. We forcefully advocated the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. ‘Few economic historians now find the logic behind Glass-Steagall persuasive,’  one editorial said in 1988. Another, in 1990, said that the notion that ‘banks and stocks were a dangerous mixture’ ‘makes little sense now.’

“That year, we also said that the Glass-Steagall Act was one of two laws that ‘stifle commercial banks.’  The other was the McFadden-Douglas Act, which prevented banks from opening branches across the nation.

“Having seen the results of this sweeping deregulation, we now think we were wrong to have supported it.”

When Bill Clinton took his seat in the Oval Office in 1993, the national debt stood at $4.4 trillion. In 2007, prior to the crash on Wall Street, the national debt stood at $9 trillion, expanding significantly because of the ill-advised and ill-fated war in Iraq for which the Times had waved the pompoms. America’s national debt has again doubled, in just eight years to $18.9 trillion, because of the Wall Street crash, the taxpayer bailouts, the fiscal stimulus required to shore up the economy because of the crash, and the lackluster growth that has resulted from the financial dislocations ushered in by the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.

Exactly how many times can you get critical issues wrong and still call yourself the paper of record?

Since the endorsement of Hillary Clinton was posted on the front page of the Times digital edition yesterday, over 3500 readers have posted comments, with a large share expressing outrage along with some threats to cancel subscriptions. Coming just two days before the Iowa caucuses, where Sanders is gaining steam, one reader said he sensed “panic” on the part of the Times. Another summed up the overall contempt with this:

“With her hawkish views on the middle east and her unwillingness to reign [sic] in big banks HRC comes across more as a centrist republican than a moderate democrat. I would call her a democrat in name only, the way Trump is a republican in name only.  She, like Bill, will sell the interests of the American people up the river as fast as a New York minute… Experience? She has minimal experience in an appointed position, and a little senatorial experience, while her Democratic opponent [Senator Bernie Sanders] has 30 years in elected office.”

If the New York Times was hoping to provide a boost to Hillary’s prospects, this endorsement may have backfired. If the editorial page editors are studying the outpouring of comments, they are quickly assessing that the public is not only fed up with establishment candidates but also with the establishment media. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have unleashed the furor of the populace and there’s no way this genie is going back in the bottle anytime soon.",finance,1454260570

personalfinance,Refinancing my mortgage. Use monthly savings to pay off principal or invest them?,"I am planning on refinancing my mortgage this year. I bought my home in 2014 with 20% down at a 4.25% interest rate, 30 year fixed. I borrowed about half of the down payment from my dad, which he pulled out as an equity loan on his home. I am currently paying this loan each month. The equity loan is 4.84% over roughly 13 years. If I refinance and take some cash out to pay off my dad's loan, I am essentially moving the debt from 4.84% at 13 years to 4.0% at 30 years, saving on my total payment monthly but paying more in the long run (interest over 30 years is more than over 13 years).

The monthly savings will be about $175. Should I put this toward my mortgage each month to pay down the principal faster or should I invest the savings elsewhere (say in my 401k, an IRA, index fund, etc.)?",finance,1454262999
personalfinance,"In Good Financial Place, But Getting Laid Off in 3 Months, Question about Retirement vs. Savings vs. Debt","I will be getting laid off in 3 months, but will receive a generous severance that is equal to a year of my salary and also medical coverage for the year. The details:


*I have 6 months+ of emergency savings (enough to not cut back on current lifestyle at all and also cover unexpected expenses like insurance deductibles.) The amount could be stretched to 8-9 months if I cut back. Most of this money is in online savings account.

*Currently on track to max out 401K this year by the time I get laid off.

*10K in debt, all of which is in the form of a car loan at 3%, payment is $425/month. No other debt.

*Have 1-2K a month leftover after all expenses and retirement savings. 

*Will be eligible for unemployment which will only cover 1/2 or so of my expenses (if I cut back some), but will allow me to stretch existing savings even more.


My questions are:


*Am I doing the right think by maxing out 401K? I have a good amount of savings and will have severance to fall back on, but I'm wondering if I should be saving as much cash as possible right now, but 401K contributions have been a big part of my tax plan the past few years, and my taxable income will be higher than normal due to the severance payment.

*What should I be doing with the extra 1-2K I have leftover now (or more if I end up reducing 401K contribution)? If I throw it all towards debt, I can be done with car payments or close to by the time I get laid off, which will reduce my monthly expenses by $425. Alternatively, I can just save the money to have access to more cash, but the interest rate on online savings is lower than what I pay on the car's interest.

personalfinance,Refinanced student loans for 0% interest (woohoo!!). Pay it off immediately or not?,"I was fortunate enough to have about $26,000 of student loans refinanced at 0% over the next five years. The federal interest rate before refinance was about 7%...so this will save a significant amount of money. Awesome. The question is...Now that I'm working, I have a good income. I will soon have about that much in savings, and could just pay it off. However, everyone says to just pay it down (the minimum repayment) each month, because at 0%, there's no reason to be in a rush, and I could invest the $25k I've saved. I get that. But I'll be darned if it isn't tempting just to pay it off and not have to worry about a $450/mo cash flow hit each month. 

Another option I've considered is putting the balance of the loan in a ""high"" interest savings account, and setting up recurring payments from there. So, it will just be repaying itself, not affecting my cash flow, and while the savings balance will be decreasing over time, it will still be earning about 1% APY over the course of the loan. So, still making some money off interest, but also not taking a cash flow hit. Might be a nice compromise. 

Just wanted to share my situation, my thoughts, and see if anyone had any experience/ideas/suggestions other than what I am considering in order to 1) Repay the loan 2) Minimize cash flow hit 3) Not lose out on an investment opportunity with what I do have saved (assuming I don't just pay it off).",finance,1454265663

For anyone curious/people in the future who may stumble on this with a similar problem:
The problem has been fixed, thanks to /u/LeavesBreathe for help with getting the last hidden state. These modifications were made to the model.

**Original post**
Hello,

I began my first tensorflow project a week or so ago, which is a sentiment analyzer. I am using an lstm encoder which feeds to a logistic regression layer. This isn't my first machine learning project, but I am definitely very new to the field. I attempted to replicate the model in this [tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html) , I've also referenced this [paper](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/HongJames.pdf) with respect to the lstm model. I am having a problem, and I've been stuck for days on this. With midterms coming up this week I would really like to get this problem solved for my own sanity. I would really appreciate any help/feedback. I will provide concise code snippets below, but the code in question can be found [here](https://github.com/inikdom/neural-sentiment). If I can summarize or clarify anything further please let me know.

So to summarize my problem, when I go to train my network (with the same dataset, dataset size and hyper parameters in the tutorial) it does not learn at all. The accuracy hovers around 50%, and the loss at ~0.7 = (-log(0.5)). I have tried larger dataset sizes, and different hyper parameters for several days now. I have not seen the loss decrease by any significant margin. While I may be underfitting, given my fairly extensive hyper parameter search I'm leaning in the direction that something is wrong with my code, and my guess is it's a fairly small, significant detail.

I'm taking the last hidden state of the last layer of the rnn output and feeding that into my output projecttion layer, after which a softmax is applied. 

First I define the model. I referenced the translation tensorflow example in the repository for help with the encoding part:


		for i in range(max_seq_length):
			self.seq_input.append(tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None],
			name=""input{0}"".format(i)))
		self.target = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, name=""target"", shape=[None,self.num_classes])
		self.seq_lengths = tf.placeholder(tf.int32, shape=[None],
		name=""early_stop"")

		#create input embedding layer
		with tf.device(""/cpu:0""):
			embeddings = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform((self.vocab_size, hidden_size), -1.0, 1.0))
			emb =[tf.nn.embedding_lookup(embeddings, inp) for inp in self.seq_input]

		#create hidden lstm layers
		cell = rnn_cell.LSTMCell(hidden_size, hidden_size, initializer=initializer)
		if not forward_only and dropout &lt; 1.0:
			cell = rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper(cell, input_keep_prob=dropout)
		self.cell = rnn_cell.MultiRNNCell([cell] * num_layers)
		self.initial_state = self.cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)
		self.hidden_outputs, self.states = rnn.rnn(self.cell, emb, dtype=tf.float32)

		#output logistic regression layer
		weights = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([hidden_size,self.num_classes], stddev=0.01))
		bias = tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([self.num_classes], stddev=0.01))

		with tf.name_scope(""output_proj"") as scope:
			last_state = tf.slice(self.states[-1], [0, hidden_size*(num_layers-1)], [-1, hidden_size])
			self.y = tf.matmul(last_state, weights) + bias
		#compute losses, minimize cross entropy
		with tf.name_scope(""loss"") as scope:
			self.losses = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(self.y, self.target))
		self.y = tf.nn.softmax(self.y)
		correct_prediction = tf.equal(tf.argmax(self.y,1), tf.argmax(self.target,1))
		with tf.name_scope(""accuracy"") as scope:
			self.accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, tf.float32))
		params = tf.trainable_variables()
		if not forward_only:
			with tf.name_scope(""train"") as scope:
				opt = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(self.learning_rate)
			gradients = tf.gradients(self.losses, params)
			clipped_gradients, norm = tf.clip_by_global_norm(gradients, self.max_gradient_norm)
			with tf.name_scope(""grad_norms"") as scope:
				self.gradient_norms = norm
			self.update = opt.apply_gradients(zip(clipped_gradients, params), global_step=self.global_step)
			self.saver = tf.train.Saver(tf.all_variables())

The data being fed in is switched to be batch_size major rows like the comments in the translation seq2seq project say it should be:

    for length_idx in xrange(self.max_seq_length):
				  batch_inputs.append(np.array([data[batch_idx][length_idx]
				for batch_idx in xrange(start, start + self.batch_size)], dtype=np.int32))

Then in my training loop I repeatedly call step which calls the optimizer, gets loss and accuracy:


	def step(self, session, inputs, targets, seq_lengths, forward_only=False):
		'''
		Inputs:
		session: tensorflow session
		inputs: list of list of ints representing tokens in review of batch_size
		output: list of sentiment scores
		seq_lengths: list of sequence lengths, provided at runtime to prevent need for padding
		Returns:
		accuracy, loss, update
		or (in forward only):
		none, loss, outputs
		'''
		input_feed = {}
		for i in xrange(self.max_seq_length):
			input_feed[self.seq_input[i].name] = inputs[i]
		input_feed[self.target.name] = targets
		if not forward_only:
			output_feed = [self.merged, self.losses, self.update]
		else:
			output_feed = [self.accuracy, self.losses, self.y]
		input_feed[self.seq_lengths.name] = seq_lengths
		outputs = session.run(output_feed, input_feed)

		if not forward_only:
			return outputs[0], outputs[1], None
		else:
			return outputs[0], outputs[1], outputs[2]


I'm also going to include my model creation code, because that may be relevant as I initialize all tf variables here:

    def createModel(session, vocab_size):
        model = models.sentiment.SentimentModel(vocab_size, hidden_size,
        dropout, num_layers, grad_clip, max_seq_length, batch_size,
        learning_rate, lr_decay_factor)
        saveHyperParameters(vocab_size)
        ckpt = tf.train.get_checkpoint_state(checkpoint_dir)
        if ckpt and gfile.Exists(ckpt.model_checkpoint_path):
            print(""Reading model parameters from %s"" % ckpt.model_checkpoint_path)
            model.saver.restore(session, ckpt.model_checkpoint_path)
        else:
            print(""Created model with fresh parameters."")
            session.run(tf.initialize_all_variables())
        return model

I would love some advice. Here is the situation: My wife and I just sold our house, which left us with some cash. We have some debts, little savings, and little retirement. Where should we go from here?  

Details:  

Family situation: I'm 31 and my wife is 32 (doesn't work). We have 3-year old and an 18-month old. We probably want one more child.  

Cash: $175k  

Retirement: ~$5k (Didn't come into the type of money we now have until about 1 year ago).  

College Savings For 2 Kids: $2k for the 3 year old and $1k for the 18-month old. We probably want one more child.  

Liabilities: Car loan @2.9% ($350/mo payment - $11.3k balance), money owed to parents on 0% interest loan($15k), taxes I'll have to pay this year ($15.7k), taxes that I'll have to pay next year for income earned this year ($8.3k), law school loans (@avg. 7.5% - $112k).  

Earning Power: Base job income is $120k and side law practice income is variable, but I should be able to make at least another $100k (very unique legal experience and skill set that allows a steady job flow at a rate of $250-400/hour depending on type of project). 

Monthly Expenses: $7-8k

Current plan: Pay off everything, but for $30k in law school loans. Refinance the law school loans into a 6% 20 year repayment loan, which I plan to repay over the next couple of months. If we did this, we'd have $45k in cash, establishing our 6 month reserve. 

Questions:  

(1) Is it wiser to pay off our debts in a different structure?  

(2) I'd love to find a way to reorganize my law school debt to a monthly payment at a lower interest rate so that I could leverage the $82k into something more worth while (right now, I could refi the whole balance of $112k to an $820/month payment). In other words, if i could have the $112k outstanding as a mortgage at 3.5-4% , I'd love to make that work.

personalfinance,"Cancelled car dealership extended warranty, did I shoot myself in the foot?","I purchased a used vehicle recently.  During finance discussions, the gentleman ended up pushing the extended warranty by lowering my finance rate which would only add an additional $10 to my monthly payment (6 year loan).  I agreed, as it seemed perfectly reasonable to have full vehicle coverage for 4 years/100,000 miles.  

That night I couldn't sleep and read up online that the dealer lowered interest rate trick is common to push extended warranties.  (And that the lower rate they are pushing is what they would have been approved for in the first place).

I call in, and they said I can cancel it and that the warranty total ($2,000!) would be removed from the loan.  Part of the reason this bothered me so much was because I plan to pay off the loan after 12 months, helping to build some credit and avoiding paying 6 years of interest.  Therefore, I would of had $2,000 extra to pay off.  As you can probably guess, this is my first car buying experience and my lack of credit history made it difficult to get a loan - major banks did not approve me.

Flash forward to today, I get online and see my interest rate shows as being the lowered rate, but my payments are the same - the original high interest rate + $10 a month.  The due date is the same.  If this holds true.. I'm still going to pay the exact same amount should I extend the loan out over 72 months.  

Some background:  Loan is for roughly $15,000.  Original interest rate was 10%.  Warranty interest rate was 6%.  Web shows interest rate as the 6%, but payments due are what was agreed upon.  

Flat out, I basically screwed myself over, correct?  Is there anything I can do?  To make myself feel better.. If I do pay the loan off after 1 year, I've only paid an additional $120 for canceling the warranty?

personalfinance,"What are my chances to receive a ~15,000 loan without a cosigner as a senior in college?","Hi all,

I am a rising senior studying computer science at my local state school (pretty good CS program). 

Due to fallouts with my parents and me not wanting to reconcile with them (say what you will, read my post history if you must) I don't think they will pay for my college tuition next year. This past year they did but who knows how much longer that will last. 

So to prepare for the worst, I'm wondering what my options are. I met with my financial aid office last year and since my parents refused to sign the FAFSA or tell the office that they won't provide for me (because they did, anyways) I wasn't eligible for any loans. Which is fine because my parents paid for it, luckily.

Next year, since we haven't really spoken at all this year (didn't go home for the holidays), they might not pay. 

I have an internship this summer where I'll be earning money and currently have about 5k saved. I pay for everything else outside tuition (rent, food, etc) so going into next year I might have around ~12k but tuition for my school is ~9k a semester. With rent and the current job I have, I'm probably short about $15k (very rough estimate).

The question that I have is: is it possible for me to receive a loan for that amount from any source? I don't have any relatives/parents who will cosign.. I will have a job when I graduate, I'm studying a good field, and I want to graduate as quickly as possible. I don't want to work for a year because that's just wasting money that I could be earning if I work full time.

I know receiving loans without a cosigner is nearly impossible so I don't really know what to do. In the grand scheme of things, I would pay a higher interest rate just to graduate on time. Even $30k in debt isn't that much considering I can pay that off in under 2 years.

I'm quite scared for my future and I just want a way out that doesn't include my parents. They made my life hell the past two years and, while I know I sound like a spoiled kid, I would be fine taking on loans just to be independent. Any advice?

Thanks.",finance,1454278875
personalfinance,"Self-employed, health insurance deduction and subsidies?","**(Edit 2: maybe I don't qualify the subsidy since I was automatically enrolled in my bronze plan?  That can't be right?  New question here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/43lu9o/premium_tax_credit_for_health_insurance_i_was/ )**

(Edit: I think I've got a handle on it now, but I need to receive my 1095-a form before I can work through it.  At that point, hrblock.com still might fail me but I should be able to pull it off by hand if so.  Thank you all!)

I'm a little confused about how these work now.

I'm in my 30's and pay $350ish a month for health insurance in NYS.

I'm also self-employed, and since I spent much of the year working on a non-paying (yet) project, my income was only like 3x the Federal poverty line.

I have no other significant deductions or credits, so outside of health insurance premiums I'd end up with the standard deduction.

As I recall, I used to be able to deduct the premiums above the line, so I could take the standard deduction AND reduce my self-employment income by $4k, saving that much in self-employment tax and normal income tax.

Can I still do that?

I also think I qualify for about $1,000 for the ACA subsidy, since I spent $4kish on insurance.

Exact numbers aside, are those concepts correct?

Do I get to lop off the $4k or whatever from self-employment income, AND do I get the $1k subsidy provided I'm within the window for it?

Or are the premiums no longer deductible?

Or are they deductible but under the line so I would take the standard deduction instead of them rather than in addition to them?

Or can I only take one or the other, the deduction or the subsidy but not both?

Or am I way off?

Thanks in advance!",finance,1454280700
personalfinance,I have no idea what to do with my money (military),"Here is a little information about me to start off. I'm 20 and a PFC in the military (E2). I have $1000 in checking, $4500 in savings, $1000 in a roth TSP, and $3000 in a CD. I only put money into the CD because it is a one time thing with my bank (navy federal) and offers 3% APY for 12 months. This is all 1 year of savings and it'll only increase. I bought some really stupid things right after boot camp but I learned from that.

I should be picking up E3 in March (about $100 more a month). Right now I'm doing 10% of my pay towards my TSP.

What should I do with my money? I hardly spend any since you don't need to pay for much while in the military. Should I put more of my paycheck into TSP? (retirement fund).

My enlistment ends in 4 years and I would like to be able to have enough money to rent an apartment and be able to survive while I look for work or use my GI bill for college. I also plan on getting married as soon as my enlistment ends so I would need money for that.

Should I continue to save it? Find an online bank with a higher APY for savings? Put more into TSP? I have no idea.",finance,1454280893

investing,[Serious] A case for Gold in 2016,"#1   U.S. Dollar is a Crowded Trade

* U.S. dollar sentiment among western investors has become close to unanimously bullish. The Bernstein
Daily Sentiment Index for the U.S. dollar registered a 90% bullish reading on 1/5/15.  Somewhat counter-intuitively, I believe that the Federal Reserve will be unable to continue its supposed tightening cycle meaningfully and the Federal Reserve will ultimately have to reverse course, giving more easing to the markets.  If the Dollar fails to go higher, expect gold and commodities to catch a bid.

#2   Foreign Demand for U.S. Treasuries is Declining

* Foreign demand for Treasuries has collapsed in recent quarters, despite persistently wide spread-premiums
to competing global sovereigns.  The U.S 10-Year note is yielding much higher compared to German, Italian, and other 10-Year.  Nations around the world, notably China, are mass selling U.S treasuries at a rate unseen since 2001.

#3  U.S. Credit Cycle is contracting

* High-Yield Debt has been deteriorating for the past year and is really start to pick up.  I believe credit stress is not contained to just the energy sector and is spreading to all industries.  High Yield has not been this distressed since Lehman brothers announced bankruptcy.   Junk spreads, TED spreads, and LIBOR spreads are all trading at ridiculously wide margins.

#4 The US &amp; major industrialized nations are entering a recession.  

* The U.S is already in an industrial recession by many measures and I believe it is only a matter of time until the mainstream media has to accept this ugly fact.  Recent readings for industrial production, construction spending, factory orders, retail sales, housing starts and existing home sales have been disappointing consensus.  The industrial sector is already in a recession, the retail sector of the economy is perhaps already there, it is only a matter of time until the recession bubbles up to the corporate sector and harms corporate growth (already happening).

#5  U.S. Equity Markets are Overvalued 

* By most measures, U.S equities are historically overvalued.  During the past 135 years (figure below), the CAPE ratio
has only been higher on three occasions: 1929, 2000 and 2007.

#6  Gold Experiencing Bullish Divergences

* During the past three months, important technical indicators in the gold complex are signaling the most important divergence of the past 15 years. Since late-November, spot gold has set three separate closing 52-week lows uncon  rmed by all broad gold
equity averages (GDX, GDXJ, XAU, HUI), a development which has not transpired since 2001.  If Gold can hold above $1,000 for the next several months, we may find a bottom.

#7 Demand for Physical Gold is Skyrocketing

*  The Shanghai Gold Exchange, which has eclipsed the London Bullion Market Association as the
world’s leading physical gold marketplace, reported 2015 physical withdrawals of 2,596.4 tonnes, a new
annual record.   Similarly, Indian imports for 2015 are on course to exceed 1,000 tonnes, an 11% increase over 2014 levels (not
including smuggling totals estimated in the hundreds of tonnes). Given prospects for extended volatility in
both the yuan and rupee, I believe domestic gold demand in China and India will set a durable
price floor in future periods.

* The continued strength of physical gold buying will prevent prices from falling much further, as it becomes clear that a core group of investors is sticking with the market.

* U.S. demand for gold bars and coins surged 207% during the third quarter.  The U.S. Mint backs up that assessment. It said gold Eagle coin sales surged to nearly 400,000 ounces last quarter, the highest level in more than five years.


#8 Gold Prices Almost Always Do An accounting of Central Bank Recklessness over the long run.  

* Since the 50s, gold was closely correlated to growth in the Fed’s balance sheet and the money supply of the U.S Dollar.  I believe as the central banks of the world continue to destroy the value of their currencies by endless QE and inflation, eventually the markets will come to realize the danger of paper fiat currencies and move back into Gold.

#9 Gold is Diverging Positively from the Broken Down Commodities
 
* Perhaps one of the strongest reasons why Gold looks attractive is that is starting to show strength despite the downtrend in commodities and a strong dollar.   The commodity collapse during the second-half of 2008  saw spot gold post a positive annual return of 5.78%

#10 Commercials are Positioning for for Gold Strength.  

* In gold markets, commercial participants (jewelry manufacturers and bullion banks) are traditionally net short
and speculators (hedge funds and money managers) are traditionally net long.  The fact that commercials are becoming net-long is extremely exciting and a very strong sign.   Commercial participants have reduced net short positions to the lowest levels in 14 years
