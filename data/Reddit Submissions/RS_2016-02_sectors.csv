personalfinance,How do I owe federal taxes??? What am I doing wrong?,"Hello pf,

As the title states, I am confused about how I can possibly owe on my federal taxes. Here is my situation and why I am so confused:

I graduated in may (full time student, no income).

After graduating, I worked as a 1099 consultant for 3.5 months and earned $10,500 ($3,000/mo). I have my 1099-MISC.

For the last 4 months of the year, I was a full time employee for the same company that paid me as 1099 (bumped up to $3,666/mo).

Rather than file quarterly estimated taxes once, I just had my employer withhold extra for my last 4 paychecks in the amount of ($335- federal, for a total of $1,340). Additionally, I claimed 0 instead of 1 on my W-4- shouldn't this alone come close to covering for the unpaid 1099 taxes???????

Other info: 

I am being claimed as a dependent by my parents for 2015. 
Because of this, I apparently get no credit for the $1,800 worth of student loan interest I paid (this is so dumb I want to scream).
I wrote off the mileage I used during my commute as a 1099 (I kept track of this, it was 1721 miles over the 3.5 months.)
I opened a RothIRA and put $1,000 (planning on adding more before April deadline). This had no effect but I just wanted to mention it.

After putting all my info in, it says I owe $225. HOW??


EDIT: When I make no changes except removing my $10,500 1099 income, TurboTax says my federal refund should be $2,584.",finance,1454285350

btc,"21 months ago, Gavin Andresen published ""A Scalability Roadmap"", including sections called: ""Increasing transaction volume"", ""Bigger Block Road Map"", and ""The Future Looks Bright"". *This* was the Bitcoin we signed up for. It's time for us to take Bitcoin back from the strangle-hold of Blockstream.","**A Scalability Roadmap**

06 October 2014

by Gavin Andresen 

https://web.archive.org/web/20150129023502/http://blog.bitcoinfoundation.org/a-scalability-roadmap

**Increasing transaction volume**

I expect the initial block download problem to be mostly solved in the next relase or three of Bitcoin Core. **The next scaling problem that needs to be tackled is the hardcoded 1-megabyte block size limit that means the network can suppor[t] only approximately 7-transactions-per-second.**

Any change to the core consensus code means risk, so why risk it? Why not just keep Bitcoin Core the way it is, and live with seven transactions per second? “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”

Back in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes– the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol). **The intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction volume justified larger blocks.**

“Argument from Authority” is a logical fallacy, so “Because Satoshi Said So” isn’t a valid reason. However, **staying true to the original vision of Bitcoin is very important. That vision is what inspires people to invest their time, energy, and wealth in this new, risky technology.**

**I think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people were told that the system would scale up to handle lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.**

We aren’t at a crisis point yet; the number of transactions per day has been flat for the last year (except for [a spike during the price bubble](https://web.archive.org/web/20150129023502/http://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc.html#1y) around the beginning of the year). It is possible there are an increasing number of “off-blockchain” transactions happening, but I don’t think that is what is going on, because USD to BTC exchange volume shows the same pattern of transaction volume over the last year. The general pattern for both price and transaction volume has been periods of relative stability, followed by bubbles of interest that drive both price and transaction volume rapidly up. Then a crash down to a new level, lower than the peak but higher than the previous stable level.

My best guess is that we’ll run into the 1 megabyte block size limit during the next price bubble, and that is one of the reasons I’ve been spending time working on implementing floating transaction fees for Bitcoin Core. Most users would rather pay a few cents more in transaction fees rather than waiting hours or days (or never!) for their transactions to confirm because the network is running into the hard-coded blocksize limit.

**Bigger Block Road Map**

Matt Corallo has already implemented the first step to supporting larger blocks – faster relaying, to minimize the risk that a bigger block takes longer to propagate across the network than a smaller block. See the [blog post](https://web.archive.org/web/20150208233706/https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/08/a-bitcoin-backbone/) I wrote in August for details.

**There is already consensus that something needs to change to support more than seven transactions per second.** Agreeing on exactly how to accomplish that goal is where people start to disagree – there are lots of possible solutions. Here is my current favorite:

**Roll out a hard fork that increases the maximum block size, and implements a rule to increase that size over time, very similar to the rule that decreases the block reward over time.**

**Choose the initial maximum size so that a “Bitcoin hobbyist” can easily participate as a full node on the network. By “Bitcoin hobbyist” I mean somebody with a current, reasonably fast computer and Internet connection, running an up-to-date version of Bitcoin Core and willing to dedicate half their CPU power and bandwidth to Bitcoin.**

**And choose the increase to match the rate of growth of bandwidth over time: [50% per year](https://web.archive.org/web/20150204032831/http://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) for the last twenty years. Note that this is less than the approximately [60% per year](https://web.archive.org/web/20150204032831/http://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) growth in CPU power; bandwidth will be the limiting factor for transaction volume for the foreseeable future.**

**I believe this is the “simplest thing that could possibly work.” It is simple to implement correctly and is very close to the rules operating on the network today. Imposing a maximum size that is in the reach of any ordinary person with a pretty good computer and an average broadband internet connection eliminates barriers to entry that might result in centralization of the network.**

Once the network allows larger-than-1-megabyte blocks, further network optimizations will be necessary. This is where Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables or (perhaps) other data synchronization algorithms will shine.

**The Future Looks Bright**

So some future Bitcoin enthusiast or professional sysadmin would download and run software that did the following to get up and running quickly:

1. Connect to peers, just as is done today.

2. Download headers for the best chain from its peers (tens of megabytes; will take at most a few minutes)

3. Download enough full blocks to handle and reasonable blockchain re-organization (a few hundred should be plenty, which will take perhaps an hour).

4. Ask a peer for the UTXO set, and check it against the commitment made in the blockchain.

From this point on, it is a fully-validating node. If disk space is scarce, it can delete old blocks from disk.

**How far does this lead?**

**There is a clear path to scaling up the network to handle several thousand transactions per second (“Visa scale”).** Getting there won’t be trivial, because writing solid, secure code takes time and because getting consensus is hard. **Fortunately technological progress marches on, and Nielsen’s Law of Internet Bandwidth and Moore’s Law make scaling up easier as time passes.**

The map gets fuzzy if we start thinking about how to scale faster than the 50%-per-increase-in-bandwidth-per-year of Nielsen’s Law. Some complicated scheme to avoid broadcasting every transaction to every node is probably possible to implement and make secure enough.

**But 50% per year growth is really good. According to my rough back-of-the-envelope calculations, my above-average home Internet connection and above-average home computer could easily support 5,000 transactions per second today.**

**That works out to 400 million transactions per day. Pretty good; every person in the US could make one Bitcoin transaction per day and I’d still be able to keep up.**

**After 12 years of bandwidth growth that becomes 56 billion transactions per day on my home network connection — enough for every single person in the world to make five or six bitcoin transactions every single day. It is hard to imagine that not being enough; according the the Boston Federal Reserve, the average US consumer makes [just over two payments per day](https://web.archive.org/web/20150213132853/http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppdp/2011/ppdp1101.pdf).**

**So even if everybody in the world switched entirely from cash to Bitcoin in twenty years, broadcasting every transaction to every fully-validating node won’t be a problem.**",cryptocurrency,1454287678

personalfinance,Parent Plus Loan consolidation and IBR?,"Hello All,

I'm trying to come up with a way of addressing my parents' PARENT PLUS Loans they took out in their names on my behalf.  My research consistently tells me these loans are not inherited.  I have older parents who do work, but are also on Social Security.  It seems the most logical thing to do is find a repayment option with the lowest month to month payments, as we don't really expect to pay off the loans in my parents' lifetimes.

I'd love some advice on how to achieve this.  Consolidation and repayment plans (IBR? Pay as you earn?) for PLUS loans are confusing.  Especially when multiple companies are serving different loans under each person's name in a marriage.  Here are the details on the loans:

###Mom's Loans

1. Navient - 38k - Federal PLUS Loan - 8.25%
2. Great Lakes - 31k - FFEL Plus Loan - 8.5%

###Dad's Loans
1. Great Lakes - 22k - Direct PLUS Loan - 7.9%

I'm currently making payments on my dad's loan.  My thought is, if possible, we should consolidate these three and go on Income Based Repayment, but it's not clear to me that's available for PLUS loans.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Last year I received a tax refund... now I owe 1.6K in taxes. I don't understand...?,"Single with no dependents, I claim 1 exemption on my W-4.

Last year I received a federal refund of ~$400, and a state refund of ~$100. Gross annual income for 2014 was around $13,500 since I started working in the middle of the year, while attending graduate school full time.

Fast forward to 2015; my gross annual income is $31,000 plus an education grant for $5,500 to go toward my graduate school tuition. I still work full time and attend graduate school full time, but I owe about 1,200 to federal and 400 to state. I haven't changed anything on my W-4.

I understand an increase in income has probably affected it, but my wage has remained the same as last year, I have just been able to work for the full year of 2015.

personalfinance,"PSA: If you can afford it, not paying off mortgage early almost always makes sense","Real estate agents will try to make mortgage sexy by claiming that payment on the interest gives you tax deduction. When you do the math, it's not so sexy. Consider these numbers

1. Taxable income: I. This is a variable to represent your adjusted gross annual income.
* Income tax: I * 0.30.  The 30% is an approximate of your federal and state income tax rate on additional income.
* Mortgage rate: M * R. This is simple: Remaining mortgate, M, time the mortgage rate, R. This is how much you pay in interest a year.
* Taxable income after deduction: I - M * R. You get to deduct the interest payment from your income.
* Tax after deduction: (I - M * R) * 0.30. Now your taxable income is lower, multiply the previous 30%.
* Amount of tax saved: M * R * 0.30. This is #2 minus #5, the amount of income tax you ""saved.""
* Payments made minus tax saved: M * R * 0.7. BUT, you still paid interest on your mortgage! By having mortgage, i.e. not paying it off, the amount you pay is still greater than the amount you ""saved."" Subtract the savings from your payments to get the effective cost of the interest.
* Effective mortgage rate: R * 0.7. Suppose you didn't get the tax deduction, but you got a lower mortgage rate instead, so that the cost to you is equivalent. What would your new mortgage rate be? It's #7 divided by the mortgage amount, or R * 0.7. If your mortgage rate was 9% or higher, it's now 6.3% or higher. Even if you gambled all that money into the stock market you have by not paying off early, you still won't make that money back. 

Takeaway: You effectively get a lower interest rate, but it's still a positive percentage. Unless you are in an extremely high tax bracket or if you have an extremely low interest rate so that the lowered interest rate is better than the stock market, you're better paying it off early if you can afford it.

In the next 4-5 years we'll have other bigger purchases happening, we'd love to buy a house or condo, have a baby, get an affordable used car, etc. 

So my question is should we work really hard for the next year to pay off these loans while the interest isn't accumulating? And if this is the way to go, should we put the money into a high yield savings account or something for a year or two before making one big payment so our money can accumulate a little more or should we just make several $1000 payments over time?

Or should we keep paying them off with the normal $300/month payments we have been (even though the payments aren't required right now)?

Bitcoin,Constructing a TA indicator from the 'LoanOffer rate' on poloniex to use in a predictive model.,"I'm currently working with a couple of AI / machine learning PhDs, we're currently adapting their models to the crypto markets. These markets seem to be young and fairly inefficient, one model we're focusing on is producing very interesting backtesting results. [For anyone that's interested](https://www.mediafire.com/?57qzdvn71rqaacl)   

The model in question is based on recurrent neural networks and hawkes processes, the premise of it is to take TA indicators then use ML model to auto weight the importance of these indicators to accurately predict the direction of the price into the future. It continuously learns over time and updates its parameters given changing market condition 


Currently we're using TA-lib, a python library of 150 TA indicators as the models inputs. Currently it seems to be quite good at investing at early stages of pumps,  however it's very poor at predicting price reversals ie knowing when sell. Obviously this isn't something trivial, events such as dumps can be completely random.

We want to improve the models performance and optimize it to act more efficiently in these markets. One way to do this is to use custom indicators that have been designed to work with specifically with these markets.

Which get's me to the topic of this post. It seems the loan rates on poloniex are much higher for coins before they dump, although they are high at other times as well, by making an indicator from:
a. the LoanOffer rates 
b. the amount of active loans

We could feed this into the model to determine if it can find any patterns between how these metrics change with what the price does.

Has anyone had any experience with this ? I'm trying to figure out how the indicator would be programmed. Currently i'm thinking making an oscillator going from the minimum interest rate to the max ( 5% / day on polo). The rate of loans being taken and the amount of loans currently out for loan could also be used in another indicator somehow

This is just one idea I had, if anyone has written other custom indicators they use in these markets and are interested in what we're doing, please feel free to drop me a pm.

Monthly salary: $1638.76

**50%**: $819.38

- $205 for car insurance/cell phone - gives a check to my parents each month

- $35.31 monthly gym payment

Leftover: $579.07

- I would like to pay off my 2 unsubsidized loans with this one (my loans are deferred atm) that have a 6.8% interest rate - the highest one. Each loan is a little over $1,000.00 so I will pay $289.54 (half of my leftover) to each and they will be paid off in 3-4 months.

- P.S. After 2-3 months, I will see how the apartment hunt is going and if I have some time to spare, I'll pay down my next unsub loan with the highest interest rate.

**20%**: $327.75

- $49.16 signing up for 401(k) at work, 3% match so I will put in 3% of my paycheck

- $278.59 *definitely* saved each month

**30%**: $491.63

- I have gotten better at limiting this (I write everything I buy down) so the largest expenses/month are my gas as I commute (which is why I'm moving) and to see my long distance bf about 2-3x/month.

- Any left over of this will be saved!


So how did I do? Any tips to making it better? I want to start out simple but if I can save money anywhere/am doing something wrong, that'd be awesome to know!

I graduated last year and have recently just paid off all my student debt. I am currently working and renting in Ottawa but I am looking to buy my first house.


Background:
Myself: 23 year old male, graduated spring 2015 and full-time permanent position since April.


Salary: $46K before taxes


Assets: 41k in mutual funds in my TSFA account 


Debt: None


Current expenses: No car so only a bus pass at 103.25/month. Rent is 460/month all inclusive


Credit score: Good - low to mid 700s


Budget: Ideally no more than 300k


I've been pre-approved for a 300k mortgage at one bank and waiting to hear from another. I'm also planning on putting down at least 20% down payment to avoid the mortgage insurance.
I’ve looked around and found used townhomes from 190 – 230k. I also looked at new townhomes that start at 265k.


So my questions are:
1. What should I look out for when buying a used home? Any hidden expenses that I have to be careful about?


2. New VS used homes?


3. For those who live in Ottawa, do you prefer the East or West end?



EDIT: Forgot to mention that I live in the house and be landlord to 1 or 2 ~~roommates~~ tennants, so I will have additional income from that, roughly $1000-$1200 extra per month.

EDIT 2: Mortgage: 5 year closed variable and 10 year amortization. Not set in stone but this is what I'd lean towards. One bank is already given me an interest rate of 2.94%",finance,1454349687

We still believe the market may try to test the key 1955 level. This is a busy week for earnings and economic data, with Alphabet earnings out after the bell today plus non-farm payrolls gets released this Friday. Overall, it seems like earning have been respectable, with some technology companies having hugely positive reports, such as Facebook. We believe there is spillover buying today from last week's surprise BOJ announcement of negative interest rates.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds are down 10 ticks to 160'23. It is very interesting to see both stocks and bonds move lower in concert this morning. We notice that on Friday's committment of traders weekly report, the commercial traders (sometimes called the smart money) got very short bonds last week as prices rallied. Perhaps the bonds will balance lower this month. Friday's jobs report should provide a strong impetus either way.

**FX:** The MAR16 USD is down .5% to 99.14. The trend is technically still higher, so we believe this could be a pullback in an eventual move higher. There is massive uncertainty as to how the Fed will act (or not act) throughout the rest of 2016; this uncertainty could mean more volatility for the USD as well as bonds. The MAR16 Euro is up 61 ticks to 109.00. It looks to be in a consilidation period on the daily chart.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI crude oil is down 5% today to $31.92. We believe the next minor technical support region is near $31.30. This Wednesdays inventory report could be the next major market moving event. FEB16 gold continues its recent strength, up 1% today to $1127. Our next technical target is $1141.

personalfinance,Break mortgage to re-negotiate at another bank to take advantage of lowering interest rates and lower payments. (CAN-Alberta),"I'm currenly living in Calgary, and working in Oil &amp; Gas, as you can mostly guess, the industry isnt doing too hot right now.  I still have a job, but we have lost all bonus's and wadges have been rolled back some.  Needless to say, its taken a ton of my extra income away.  Thankfully I have been smart enough to plan for a rainy day and not over extend myself with things but I'm starting to feel the crunch and now I am no longer saving money.  Here is the scenario.  I have a house that I have been living in for about 3 years,  its worth about $450K,  and I have $260K left on the mortgage.  My mortgage is about $1200 bucks a month.  I also have a car loan that I am paying $1300 bucks a month on, about $45K left on it.  (I know some of you might say thats a lot to spend on a car, but I really enjoy my auto's so its more a hobby than a basic need for me) I am in a closed fixed 5 year mortgage paying 3.04%.  The Car loan is exactly the same rate.  

Now,  I have been looking at switching banks anyways,  as I am not really all that happy with where I am now (ATB Financial).  Many of the institutions that I have looked at will pay the early termination fee of the bank that I am at when I move my mortgage to them.  

So the plan is to move all my banking to another place (thinking RBC?) and making the mortgage worth 310K, pay off the car loan, and with 2.6% (should be able to get this rate) and 30 year amoritization  it lowers my total monthly payments to about $1300 from $2500 that it is now.  This adds three years onto my mortgage now, costing about $45K, the exact same that I am taking out of the car loan, so really no extra total cost, just lowers my payments considerably and allows me to be in a better financial situation.

Thanks in part to all of the advice and information available on PF, and a lot of meticulous budgeting, my wife and I will be in the green for the first time at the end of this month!  I'd like to offer my sincere thanks to everyone who contributes advice on this subreddit.  I wouldn't have half the strong financial habits I do today without you guys.

First, I'd like to provide some background details so you guys can get a sense of our situation.  I am 25 and my wife is 22.  We met during our enlistments in the United States Navy - my wife recently retired with an honorable discharge and is almost finished with cosmetology school, and I am enrolled in school full time pursuing a double bachelor's in computer science and linguistics (planning to pursue further education for a career in computational linguistics some time in the future).  Unfortunately, I was separated from the Navy in 2014 with an other-than-honorable discharge for drug abuse - an unsubstantiated, anonymous claim was made against me, and while NCIS found no physical evidence and could not make a case for court martial, I was referred to an administrative board and separated.  I know professing my innocence doesn't matter, but suffice it to say I'm currently dealing with a lawyer to get my discharge upgraded on the basis of how outrageous my case material is and how incompetent my JAG lawyer was during the initial proceedings.  I have high hopes for an upgraded discharge and access to my G.I. Bill, but I don't factor it into any of my budgeting or future plans (obviously).  Throughout all of 2013 and the first half of 2014, I was deeply depressed and anxious about my ""investigation"" and lapsed into some horrible financial habits, which ended with my car being repossessed upon discharge and my bank account with NFCU being charged off - all told, I would estimate ~$12,000 in unpaid debt.  I have not been contacted by collections but fully intend to use what I've learned here to cooperate and resolve this as cheaply as possible when the time comes.

We also have a five-month old miracle baby who triumphed over both birth control and condoms.  We live in Connecticut.  I stay at home with Toby/attend classes and do schoolwork during the day, and deliver pizza at night.

Income and Savings: 

Wife's G.I. Bill: $2,719 paid on or neat the 1st of the month.

My Income: ~$1,300 per month (usually more but I plan around this bottom line).

Emergency Fund: $7,000 (three months expenses) in an Ally savings account with 1% interest.

Debt:

Student Loan 1 (Federal, Subsidized): 1,750 @ 4.29%

Student Loan 2 (Federal, Unsubsidized): 3,000 @ 4.29% (paying the interest monthly to keep it at 3,000)

Student Loan 3 (Federal, Subsidized): 2,673 @ 4.29%

Chase Slate Credit Card (Balance Transfer): 1,633 @ 0% (monthly payment of 162)

R&amp;F Furniture Loan: 1,416.17 @ 0% (monthly payment of 80)

Navy Federal Credit Card: 2,949 @ 14% (will be paid off in full this week when our tax return clears)

Monthly Bills: 

Rent: 1,300 (all utilities, cable, internet included)

Food: 400

Gas: 250

Phones: 70

Car Insurance: 50

Laundry: 40

Netflix: 10

Our tax return will be ~6,600, almost 3,000 of which will be used to pay off the credit card with an interest rate.  Before that I was making significant monthly payments while also building an emergency fund.

In June, my wife will receive job placement from her school (100% placement, never any issues) and the G.I. Bill will stop.  I have a job offer starting at the end of April (when I graduate with my associate degree) for $32,000 annually, with no 401k.  However, I plan to attend University of Connecticut starting in the fall to begin my double bachelor program.  At this point it will probably be back to delivering pizza or something similar so I can keep up with Toby and schoolwork.  We will need a second car in May (I plan to buy a used Civic, Camry, or Forester for ~3k, just for local driving for school/work).  

I'm having trouble developing a plan of action for the next few years.  There is so much uncertainty with the upgrading of my discharge, my wife's success starting out in a new career, and the constantly evolving needs of our son.  I'm looking for advice about where our excess income should be going during this time.  The variables make me terrified to invest in any sort of retirement fund, because our income and situation are tenuous until I graduate in 2.5 years.  

Should I just bank any additional money we make for security's sake and continue paying the 0% debts and interest on my student loans?  Should I put it in semi-liquid CDs so I can at least generate some kind of return?  I have been meticulously building my wife's credit score (~750), but mine is sitting around 500 from my stupid mistakes in the military.  What can I do at this point to begin rebuilding credit for the future?

* Is it taken out of our total gross income?

My specific situation per pay period is:

  * 401k: $164.19

* Fed withholding: $443.05

* OADSI/MED: $204.41

* State withholding: $94.04

I was under the impression that OASDI/MED was taken out of the gross income remaining after all pre-tax deduction were taken out. In my case:

* Gross income - before tax deductions = $2736.54 - $231.32 = $2505.22

* OASDI/MED * $2505.22 = 0.765 * $2505.22 = $191.65

* OASDI/MED currently being taken out: $204.41

personalfinance,"(US) - Friend and I had a financial agreement that he no longer wants to honor after two years, what can be done?","Friend and I had an agreement that he would pay me back starting two years after I loaned him money and let him crash rent free on my couch for a few months while he was getting back on his feet.

We didn't physically sign a document together, but we saved an electronic version of exactly what you'd expect in a rough financial agreement. We didn't decide upon exactly how he had to pay it back (amount of installments, or interest rate, but we decided on a number). 

It's now almost two years later, a few months after he was originally supposed to begin paying back and he at first made it seem like he would start paying back and then now he's acting like it was really a gift and I shouldn't expect it to be paid back. 

I knew there was the chance I would not get paid back, nor do I necessarily need the money, but I feel entitled to it. We are in different states. Florida and New Jersey/New York (not entirely sure, it seems he has moved). Originally we were both in New York until my parents moved to florida and I eventually followed them down here after they retired. 

I've been told I would need to file in the city that they are living - I don't really entirely know what i should be doing. The amount is over 5k which is more than can be filed in small claims court in both Florida and New York.

I was in a bad situation when I needed a new vehicle about a year ago. I had no down payment and a medical bill in collections.   
Naturally, the only place that would finance me gave me a ridiculous interest rate of 14.5% 
I've since had that medical bill (one of the only negative items on my credit reports) actually removed from at least 2 of my credit reports (EQ and EX).   
Now I'm currently looking to refinance. I've talked to my local credit union and they'll be getting back to me about it tomorrow morning.   
Are there other places I should look at? Other options I should consider?   
I'd like to keep my loan length mostly the same (five more years) and not have large fees for paying extra each month as I currently have a fee of $12.95 for any additional (over minimum) payments as well as a $12.95 fee for ""convenience"" if I pay online or over the phone.  I'd prefer to avoid those as well.   
Now, that medical bill hasn't been paid off, just removed from my credit reports, it will be paid in full when I get my tax return so I'm not worried about it regardless.

Any suggestions? Tips? Things to watch for or avoid?

personalfinance,"Claimed 0, but not enough tax was withheld?","So, with the advice of this sub, I decided to use TurboTax this year instead of going to H&amp;R. My husband and I always were told by our H&amp;R accountant that we were close to owing taxes, but school credits always ended up getting us a refund. We didn't exactly know why that would be, but we didn't really know how to look into it further. With TurboTax, I saw exactly what was putting us into the red, but I still don't understand it. 

I put in my tax information first, and the federal refund came up to around $1400, state around $700 (I know it's a lot, but I am more afraid of owing at the end of the year than anything else). Then I put in my husband's w2, and the refund went down to -$700 federal, -$300 state. I had him check with his HR department, and they confirmed that he claims 0 dependants. We are both w2 employees, no extra income anywhere. 

At the beginning of this year, he was bumped up at his job from around $40k per year to about $61k, so we wondered if it could be a different tax bracket? I know nothing about how this works, but I still can't wrap my head around how it's possible that he has the highest amount possible being taken out of his check week to week and he could still owe around $2000 at the end of the year. Again, we were spared having to owe anything this year because his school credits and my student loan interest evened it out, but this is his last year in school, and we really don't want to owe next year.

 The other thing that is weird is that his job gave him a tuition reimbursement for both semesters. I can look up exactly how much it was if it will help, but I'd guess around $2000 for the spring semester 2015 and $3800 for the fall (which wasn't paid out until January 2016). I don't see this added to his w2 anywhere, unless it was directly added into his salary. Does that seem right? I BELIEVE that his salary on the w2 was correct without the added tuition, around $61k, but this was his first year after getting the raise, so I'm not 100%.

personalfinance,Isn't maxing a Roth IRA better due to capital gains?,"I understand all the simple explanations comparing the two, and the impact of current vs. future tax brackets on each option.

What I can't seem to find any info on is the tax effect of maxing out each fund.  It seems like, all else being equal, it is better to max a Roth due to capital gains.

A simple example:

* Assume John Doe makes $60k and wants to max his IRA

* He does not have access to any other tax advantaged accounts

* He is in the 25% tax bracket now, and will be in the same bracket in retirement.  Assume only Federal tax for simplicity.

* His investments return 7% per year for 30 years, until he retires and withdraws.

If John chooses a Roth IRA, he ends up paying $9,219 in tax.  After his $5,500 Roth contribution, he is left with $45,281.

If he chooses a Traditional IRA, he ends up paying $7,844 in tax after his $5,500 contribution, due to the deduction.  He is is left with $46,656, or $1,375 in tax savings (25% of the $5,500 he did not have to claim as income).  John now invests this money in a taxable account.

After 30 years, the Roth IRA would have $5,500 x 1.07^30 or ~$41,867 which he gets to keep, since the original contribution was after-tax .

The Traditional IRA would have $5,500 x 1.07^30 x .75 or ~$31,400 after tax.  If he paid no tax on the $1375 in his taxable account, he would have ~$10,467, which when added to the $31,400, is the same amount as the Roth ($41,867).

*However*, since this money is in a taxable account, he must pay long term capital gains (15%, since he is in the 25% tax bracket in this example).  He then is only left with ($5,500 x 1.07^30 x .75) + ($1375 + (1,375 x 1.07^30 - 1375) x .85) or ~$40,503, which is ~$1364 less.

The bears recognize that while the stock market always goes higher over the long haul, it can take decades for it to reach new highs, all the while sinking to unexpected lows in a deflationary environment. They realize that an economy based on prolonged record low interest rates leads to excessive debts and is not sustainable, especially in a world where the largest economies are all suffering from aging populations, which slows consumer spending.

Positive side, I rarely see my boss probably once every few months and I start and finish whenever I please as long as everything gets put onto the shelves. But the main issue I have with the job is that I have to use my own car to drive to one home depot a day and stock shelves (I put on an average 1800km per month) so as you can see I put a ton of wear and tear on my car and this doesn't count personal driving. I like this job and all because of all the freedom and awesome people I work with but I can't see myself doing this job full-time for another few years, part time possibly do while I go to school.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR; I'm not 100% convinced that I want to go back to school right now, now that my father is trying to look for our own place which would possibly mean we would need a bit more income to help pay for house, rent, groceries, necessities, possibly loan plus on top of that my current bills mentioned above.

I will also be graduating with ~85K in student loans, 50K of which are private loans with high (9%) interest rates, and the remaining is government loans with ~5% interest rate. By my estimations the monthly payments will be roughly 1,200$ a month, which is steep, but manageable with a mechanical engineering job.  

The issue lies in that I have competed throughout college in athletics, and have qualified for a sub-elite program which provides housing, food, and athletic gear, and most importantly the chance to train for the Olympics. To chase this dream is a once in a liftetime opportunity, however it doesn't seem possible with the size of my monthly student loan payments. While training for the Olympics, I would be able to work 20-30 hours at a part time job, which would provide a small source of income, and I would have very little living expenses. 

My question is how can I best consolidate my student loans to get a smaller monthly payment that would be maneagable for a couple years on part time jobs. I have no idea where to start or look for more information, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1454430174

Because when I plug in my wife and my incomes, they're WAY low, which would result in a huge tax amount due come next April.

Here's the gist, for married filing jointly:

* Combined fed wages: $140,000

* Itemized deductions: $16,200

* Taxable income: $115,800.

* Tax due: $20,537.5 (taxable income x .25, minus 8,412.50, [from the 1040 instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi/ar02.html#d0e35417)

So withholding would be fine if the tax were what the calculator spit out, but we'd actually be looking at a $3300 amount due.

It was the first time I had a high deductible insurance plan and I hadn't started an HSA yet so I racked up a few K worth of bills.  I paid them down as quickly as possible but one went to collections even though I had paid the amount in full by that time.

It's a couple of years later and the debt is the one blemish remaining on my credit.  I've reached out to the OC multiple times and they have told me to talk to the debt collector, saying there is nothing they can do.  I sent a goodwill letter to the OC a few months later, explaining everything, and was rebuffed again (though they were very polite about it).

The debt collector shows that I owe under $100, down from a high of a few hundred.

I've spoken with the debt collector over the phone and they refuse to do a pay for delete.  I've written a PFD letter offering to pay the amount in full even though I don't owe them anything, and gotten a validation letter back.

personalfinance,Repairing credit and reducing debt,"Hello,


My goal is to reduce debt, repair credit, and get myself out the hole I dug myself into.  I am 30 years old now and I am done with debt.


I was recently approved for a loan modification.  It restarts my home's loan from having 28 years left, to moving to 30 years.
I reduces my interest on the home loan to 4%, and I get to wait till April to start payments.  No home evaluation was required.


By the time April gets here I will have saved at least $13k with my Q4 bonus, taxes, and paychecks coming in.


Debt that I owe
- Mortgage ($155k) worth ($190k)  
- Student Loans ($15k)  
- Credit Cards ($5k) Interest rates avg 25%  
- Legal ($1k) no interest rate  
  

Assets that I have  
- 401k ($7k)  
- Bank ($2k)  


Income: $3.4k per month after taxes  


Monthly expenses:  
Mortgage starting April ($1035)  
Car lease payment ($580) Could release new car for ($370/mo)  
HOA ($110)  
Credit Cards ($250)  
Food &amp; Gas ($300)  
Utilities ($250)  
  

So you have the math, and now please correct my thought process if you would be so kind.
Payoff all credit cards, and then start chipping away at student loan debt.  Keep a good 90 days of emergency funds in an account.  
I was going to slowly pay my legal fees since there is no interest.  I want to invest the money into the stock market since the value on my home is maxing out for the neighborhood.  I will fix it up to keep it strong and up to date though.  Only a 10 year old home.  


Thanks for your time and any suggestions would be helpful.
Any recommendations on how to repair credit with this situation?
Payoff all credit debt immediately will help me or hurt me in any way?

To start, I have 3 loans:


-One Private loan ~$6800, interest rate 9.125%

-Two consolidated government loans totaling ~$23,000, interest rate 4.5% 



I really just don't know where I should start. I just graduated from college in May and have saved up ~$4,000 in my checking and ~$14,000 in my savings account. About ~$4,500 of my savings account is my 3 month ""emergency fund"".



I'm not sure where I should be putting the rest of this money first. I was thinking the higher interest private loan and possibly paying it all off immediately. Is that a stupid idea? Should I be putting my money in long term savings accounts before I pay off all my loans? 


I read in the sidebar that loans above 4% interest should generally be paid off faster.  Initially I wanted to stay on a 10 year plan for these loans, but I'm finding that I have some extra money that might be useful to paying down my debt. Mostly, I just want to make sure I'm not making a mistake by throwing a lot of money at my loan right now.

I went back and looked at the 2014 1098-T, and they put the expenses for the Spring 2015 semester on that form. So on my 2015 1098-T, it shows almost twice as much financial aid than expenses (I'm lucky to get enough aid and scholarships to almost fully cover my education).

If this is just the oil issue, why is this causing such an uproar when it hasn't in the past? I know that many companies' financials rely on a high oil price, but many dont (or are the opposite).

In that case, my living expenses, i.e. the rate at which I withdraw from retirement savings, is unlikely to place me above the 28% bracket when I retire.

Doesn't that imply making traditional, i.e. pre-tax contributions now is a better better bet?

I have been lurking this sub for a couple years now and really enjoy learning from the community. My wife and I have been discussing starting to invest, however it's something new that neither of us have experience with nor do our parents I believe (they do not discuss finances really). 

We both 21, still in college until spring 2017 (on scholarships, so it's free) as well as work part time in our future professional fields. I feel that our budgeting is very under control so I am mainly looking for advice on what to do next (even after reading the FAQ over the couple of years). We have no outstanding debts, decent cars ('04, and '11, with the '04 having had the full transmission and radiator replaced completely). 

When we graduate, we will most likely move to whatever school my wife gets into for grad school. I believe that this will cost over 2k (renting a 2-3BR apartment/house UHaul for 14 days plus 2000 miles on it, the farthest we should move) but we should be able to save easily more than that until that happens. 

Right now we have 16k in savings with a terrible interest rate. I have been looking at Vanguard for a while and seeing what they have to offer. I haven't decided which plan we would go with if we went with them though (maybe the target date fund of 2055/2060?). It would be nice to retire early, however with so many changes to happen soon its hard to look far into the future. Anyways, onto my more precise questions. 

&amp;nbsp;

* First, I  wanted to confirm that we should go with a Roth to begin with. I believe we fall in the 15% tax bracket currently, but I believe we will go up another once we graduate.

* Second, how exactly does contributing work? A Roth is Post tax, so if I wanted to contribute $3000 does that mean I should really contribute $3000 x 1.15? I couldn't figure out how to phrase this when researching.

* How will this affect doing our taxes? We generally go to a VITA at our university. I believe that a form is normally sent out that should be included, so if we started an IRA, should we plan to do taxes later? I saw that you cannot deduct from taxes when [contributing to an Roth IRA](https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/roth-vs-traditional-ira), so does that mean just mention it but nothing else will really happen?
 
* If I were to go with Vanguard, should I be reinvesting or transfer to a money market settlement fund? Are there other options I should be sure to choose when creating an account?

personalfinance,Did My Dad Mess Up My Student Loans?,"Hi Redditors,

First off, my dad is supposedly good with personal finances. However he does not much like to explain anything to me, but expects me to understand what is going on. That's why I'm asking you, I cannot be sure that advise my dad gives me is good because I don't know anything!

Anyways, when I started off college, my dad recommended/ demanded a 13,000$ Loan with Wells Fargo in my name and then another 6,000$ loan in the summer of my freshman year. Before today, I knew very little about it (I stupidly could not figure out how to navigate the site). It seems to me now that the interest is compounding at 6.7% a year WHILE I am in school. What little I learned in my time is that you want the unsubsidized (not compounding in school) loan, which it seems I do not have. 

The total raw seems to be 12,077$ initially for the first one, and 6339$ in the second one, totaling 18,416$ (theoretically raw amount). Since I started the loan, I paid off 1,050$ of it because of a gift from my grandparents (that was 1 year ago today). Currently, the first one that got the 1,050$ payment is at 13,050 (973$ ""Outstanding Interest"") and 6,589$ (250$ ""outstanding interest"") for the second. This totals as a current amount of 19,639$.

My question is, did I mess up? If I did, what can I do now? Also, how tf do taxes work? Jk about the third one.... :)

personalfinance,Graduate student stipend: Self-employment compensation or scholarship?,"I am currently a graduate student and each year I receive a fellowship that covers tuition/fees and a fellowship that is meant for me to live on (the stipend in question). There is a lot of ambiguity (and disagreement) about how this money should be treated, tax-wise, and I was hoping for some feedback from this thread. To be clearer, this stipend is my sole income, and each year I receive a 1099-MISC income tax form from my university that accounts for these funds. State and federal taxes are withheld each month but not anything else. 

When I use TurboTax software, I inevitably end up being classified as ""self-employed"", seeing as my income is coming from this 1099. However, I have heard from other students that since the stipend is a scholarship, I should not be considered self-employed but instead the income should be reported as a scholarship.

I've been looking at the Barclay's dream account for my emergency fund. I want to be able to build it up over the months, and then never touch it (unless I need to). If I never touch it, it's supposed to earn more per month. My only concern, since it's an online bank, I might have difficulties withdrawing the money, but since I can pay most of my bills online, I'm not sure if this would be an issue. I can also transfer money to one of the other accounts that I plan on opening.


* Long-term monthly savings:
I was thinking about opening an Ally account for this. Since they have a higher interest rate that compounds daily, I might benefit a little bit more than the other ones.


* Travel/Fun checkings account:
For this last one, I was looking at the Charles Schwab Checking account. If I plan to travel outside the country, their international ATM reimbursement seems like an ideal account. I'd probably only keep what I need on the account, just in case. An alternative to this would be a credit card that doesn't charge international transaction fees, but does this exist?

worldpolitics,Global manufacturing continues to fall - 'Too much capacity chasing too little demand' (2 Feb 2016),"https://archive.is/o7qFd By Nick Beams 2 February 2016

The deepening recessionary trends in the global economy, which saw stock markets have one of their worst openings for a new year last month, have continued into February. A series of data issued yesterday pointed to lower growth in China, Europe and the United States.

The Chinese statistics bureau reported that the official manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 49.4 in January, compared to 49.7 for December. This was the sixth consecutive month the index has been below 50, which is the border between contraction and expansion.

An economist with China’s National Bureau of Statistics, Zhao Qinghe, said the result was due to weaker global demand and moves by companies to reduce excess capacity. Production at larger factories was still continuing to expand, although at a slow rate, while output from small ones was contracting, he said.

The clearest expression of the Chinese slowdown is in the steel industry. More than half the major steel producers reported losses in 2015. China Iron and Steel Association member companies suffered losses of $9.8 billion last year, compared to profits of $3.4 billion in 2014.

Overall Chinese steel production, which accounts for more than half the world’s output, contracted for the first time since the early 1980s. Raw steel production fell by 2.3 percent, the drop since 1981.

China chief economist with the ANZ banking group Li-Gang Liu said the data indicated that “the contraction in the manufacturing sector became more entrenched.” He said year-on-year steel output had fallen 12 percent in both December and early January.

The slump is threatening major social consequences in steel and related industries, with the possibility of 400,000 layoffs if so-called zombie companies, which are being sustained by injections of money, are forced to close.

In Europe, a widely-followed survey by the firm Markit showed manufacturing slowed at the start of the year. According to a Reuters report, “incoming orders failed to show any meaningful increase, even though companies cut prices at the deepest rate for a year.” The Markit PMI for the eurozone dropped from 53.2 in December to 52.3 in January.

“The eurozone’s manufacturing economy missed a beat at the start of the year. Growth of order books, exports and output all slowed,” Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said. “If the slowdown in business activity wasn’t enough to worry policymakers, prices charged by producers fell at the fastest rate for a year to spur further concern about deflation becoming ingrained.”

The only “bright spot” was Britain, where output from larger manufacturers increased. But this was accompanied by the highest level of staff reductions in three years and a fall in export orders.

In the United States, the Institute for Supply Management reported yesterday that its gauge of manufacturing was still in contraction territory of below 50, rising to 48.2 last month, compared to 48 in December. The best that could be said of the figure was that, while the contraction was ongoing, at least it had not worsened.

Employment in US manufacturing fell again last month for the sixth consecutive month and manufacturers said the inventories of their customers were too high, meaning they were less likely to place new orders.

US consumer spending remained flat in December, after a 0.5 percent increase in November, with spending on durable manufactured goods such as cars falling by 0.9 percent and purchases of non-durable goods dropping by 0.9 percent. This tends to indicate that spending is being directed to essentials, including housing, health and education.

In an indication of longer-term trends, the US Commerce Department reported last week that demand for durable goods was down 3.5 percent for 2015, the largest annual decline since the official end of recession in 2009.

Summing up the world situation, Reuters headlined its article on manufacturing, “Global factories parched for demand, need stimulus.” It noted: “January surveys of global factory activity released on Monday showed the new year began much as the old one ended, with too much capacity chasing too little demand.”

The gyrations in financial markets are also continuing. Wall Street opened yesterday with a fall in the Dow Jones index. That was after the rally in oil prices of almost 30 percent last week petered out and they began to head back toward $30 a barrel. The price hike had been fuelled by reports that Russia and Saudi Arabia were possibly moving to an agreement to cut back on supply. Those reports have now been largely discounted.

Dominick Chirichella, a senior partner at Energy Management Institute in New York, told the business channel CNBC that it seemed like “every time market participants say prices have bottomed, they have been wrong. There’s nothing that says prices have bottomed—supply is still greater than demand by a lot, Chinese demand may be slackening, the global economy may be slackening and the likelihood of an emergency OPEC meeting seems very low.”

After dropping in early trade, following a near-400 point rise on Friday, the US market turned up again, largely on the remarks of Federal Reserve vice-chairman Stanley Fischer. Speaking to a meeting at the Council on Foreign Relations, he backed away from earlier comments that market expectations for two rate hikes were “too low” and three to four increases were “in the ballpark” this year.

Fischer said it was difficult to judge the implications of financial volatility and weakening markets, which could signal a slowdown in the global economy. Answering a question on his earlier comments, he said “in the ballpark” meant it was a figure that was being “talked about” but it “did not mean it is the only number that is being talked about.”

While the market saw Fischer’s responses as a sign that the cheap money flow will continue, they indicate the growing bewilderment at the Fed and other financial institutions. They have no overall policy but are increasingly reacting on a day-to-day basis.

Conditions for further financial storms are building up as the falling oil price hits highly-indebted oil-exporting countries. Azerbaijan, which depends on oil for 95 percent of its export revenues, is in discussions with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a possible $4 billion bailout loan.

Nigeria, also highly dependent on oil exports, has asked the World Bank and the African Development Bank for $3.5 billion in emergency loans to cover a hole in its budget. The government claimed that this was not an “emergency” measure but only discussions about the cheapest way to finance the budget deficit. An IMF spokesman insisted Nigeria was not in immediate need of an IMF program.

Yet there is no denying the impact of falling oil revenues. Nigeria’s foreign currency reserves have fallen from a peak of $50 billion a few years ago to $28.2 billion, and an emergency fund of $22 billion set up during the 2008 global financial crisis has fallen to $2.8 billion.

Overall there is a growing sense in financial circles that the period in which central banks could stave off some of the consequences of the breakdown that began with the 2008 crisis is rapidly coming to an end.

In a Financial Times survey of opinions in the City of London on whether the outlook was “doom and gloom,” Legal &amp; General chief executive Nigel Wilson said: “We are heading for a world of zeros: including zero inflation, zero growth in per-capita GDP and zero growth in productivity.”

Taking a longer route to arrive at the same conclusion, Helena Morrissey of Newton Investment Management, told the newspaper: “If ‘doomed’ is that the post-crisis experiment in attempting to use asset inflation to generate sustained growth is unwinding, and that confidence in the ability of central banks to always be able to do ‘whatever it takes’ to preserve the wealth of those that seek to front-run official liquidity injections, then the answer is probably ‘yes.’”

investing,The Fed Wants to Test How Banks Would Handle Negative Rates,"As interest rates turn negative around the world, the Federal Reserve is asking banks to consider the possibility of the same happening in the U.S.

In its annual stress test for 2016, the Fed said it will assess the resilience of big banks to a number of possible situations, including one where the rate on the three-month U.S. Treasury bill stays below zero for a prolonged period.

""The severely adverse scenario is characterized by a severe global recession, accompanied by a period of heightened corporate financial stress and negative yields for short-term U.S. Treasury securities,"" the central bank said in announcing the stress tests last week.

In that particular simulation, the unemployment rate doubles to 10 percent, the same level it reached in the aftermath of the last financial crisis.

Three-month bill rates have slipped slightly below zero several times in recent years, including in September after the Fed delayed rate liftoff amid global financial market turmoil, touching a low of minus 0.05 percent on Oct. 2.

But in the [stress test](http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/ccar.htm), banks would have to handle three-month bill rates entering negative territory in the second quarter of 2016, and then falling to negative 0.5 percent and holding there through the first quarter of 2019.

personalfinance,(AUS) Should we drop from 2 cars down to 1?,"Over the last 6 months, my wife and I have greatly improved our financial position (received a couple windfalls, paid down debts, started savings).  But we still have 2 cars.  They're both all paid for, one is a 2006 Hyundai Elantra, and the other is a 2005 Hyundai Getz.

I mainly use the Getz to get to and from work (30 min drive), while my wife has the Elantra to take the kids to school and go places during the day.   We haven't looked after the Getz particularly well due to our previous paycheck to paycheck living, so it needs a bit of work done (maybe $1500) and we're considering getting rid of it instead and dropping down to one car.  We live close enough to the kids school to walk them to and from, and there's shops within bicycle distance.  I currently do shift work where I do 4-5 days then get 4-5 days off, so worst case is my wife can drive me in if she needs the car during the day.

However, I'm hesitant to drop down to 1 car because my work situation can change drastically.  I work in the navy, and while my current job is ashore, I could be posted to a ship at anytime.  Obviously, I'm at sea having only 1 car is ideal, but when the ship is alongside the work schedule can vary quite a bit.  In addition, we also have no family support over here and not really involved much in the local defence community. My wife has said she's happy to deal with the inconveniences, but I worry that once the realities set in she'll get fed up with it quickly and we'll go back to 2 cars without getting to shop around properly.

Some of the friction that my wife and I are experiencing on this is that she is a ""do-er"" and once an idea is out there she just wants to make it happen ASAP.  On the plus side this means that stuff actually gets done, but sometimes she doesn't look ahead to see the potential consequences or downsides.  On the other hand I'm more of a ""thinker"" and like to examine things from all sides and make sure we're making the best decision.  The downside is I sometimes tend to spend so long thinking about things that nothing ever actually happens.

So after us getting frustrated at each other by continuing talking about it, here I am throwing it to all you wonderful people to help try and settle this issue (FYI my wife knows I'm posting this and has checked it to make sure I'm not being too one-sided)

TL;DR Currently have 2 cars, both paid off, and wife is considering getting rid of 1.  I work in the military and can have varied working hours and not so sure it's a good idea.",finance,1454500333

personalfinance,Convince me to pay off my student loans,"Here is our situation.

We are a recently college graduated married couple with about 120,000 of student loan debt. Our minimum monthly payments are about $400(interest rates from 4%-9%).

Our combined income is about $130,000 and I make another $25,000 in bonuses a year.

We can easily afford the $400 a month. Currently we are doing the minimum payments while saving about $3,000 a month. We also fully match 4% of our salaries into 401ks through our employer for retirement.

We could switch and be putting the $3,000 towards the loans but I cannot convince myself it is worth it. Yes, we would spend a lot less money doing it that way, but it would delay getting a house by years. It would limit the nice vacations we could take every year. It would delay being able to afford to have kids. All at the cost of saving a buck?

With our income, and our projected raises(her about 3% a year and me about 8% a year) the $400 a month will slowly matter less and less. Why not make that $400 a month just part of our lives, something we pay every month as the cost of going to college and the cost of a better lifestyle now.

Am I crazy thinking this way? Should we always be doing what would save us money? Even at the expense of a current lifestyle?

Edit: please don't downvote, that goes against what this subreddit is about. Inform me why my method of thinking is wrong, I am open for discussion.

When my bank details loaded, it showed my account had had over 5k  taken from it. I checked the bank account to make sure it wasn't something in error and started the wave of phone calls to straighten all this nonsense out.

So far I've called the bank, who says, yeah, you could certainly teleport from FL to TX overnight (during business hours, even though you're at work 7a-5p), to cash two huge checks two days in a row! Yay, call center in India! I went to the local branch and raised all the issues I could, because screw their call center. I can prove there was no way I could be in TX in the time span, and the checks are obviously bogus: they have my ssn on it, not the account number, so yay, identity theft; they are obviously written in the same handwriting as they were signed for, and the bank did not verify any of the information against my real account info, so there's also a shady teller involved in here somewhere. The bank never alerted me about the HUGE transactions in a different state, and it didn't post to the account until yesterday at some point.

In the meantime, I have frozen the savings account, cancelled my checking account, and ordered a new credit card.

When my s/o got home from work today I made us a couple of strong drinks and we had a very frank conversation about her mother and our options. We've decided burial insurance is too expensive, life insurance isn't an option and her mother has stiffed her for too much money for us to also absorb the cost of her funeral. We'll let her junky husband handle this and if he fucks it up, that's on him. Also, I'm a lesbian lady, not a him lol.

Hi all. If there's a more appropriate sub, I'm happy to move my post. PF has given me great advice to rebuild my credit and build savings in the past and I hope someone can point me in the right direction.

My partner and I plan to get married within the next year. Her mother has been abusive, manipulative and on drugs for her entire life. Before my partner and I got serious and moved in together, her mother would go on drug binges, run out of money/start fighting with her husband and she would move into my partners home to live for free and pretend she was single without her pesky (also addict) husband hanging around. My partner has finally realized her mother has been manipulating her for money and a place to stay and no longer allows her to visit or borrow money if she won't go to rehab and get clean. Her mother faked a suicide attempt three months ago, tried suicide by OD last month, and now is insisting that she has important news about her health that she won't tell us. We're fairly certain it's HIV-- she's switched from smoking her drug of choice to injecting it.


My partner estimates her mother has borrowed/stolen about 15K from her over the years. Her mother's husband is dead broke and my darling future MIL is jobless and without life insurance. My parents, our grandparents and her father have always stressed the importance of life insurance/burial insurance or savings so your family is a) taken care of after you die and b) so no one has to pay 10K out of pocket for a funeral. 


Is there a way my partner can take a small/moderate life insurance/burial policy out on her mother to cover funeral expenses? My job's benefits and the Army (we're both Reserves) will only allow life insurance coverage for immediate family like spouses and kids. I've noted that to purchase burial insurance, you need proof that you care for your parent/would have to absorb the cost of your parent dying. My partner has claimed her mother on her taxes for 6 years, but didn't in 2015 and 2016 because they're not on great terms. Will that be enough to show she's been financially responsible for her mother and show that we'll be the ones bearing the cost of her funeral? We don't want to pay out of pocket, her mother is a loose cannon and we feel that it's a matter of time before she's found (again) OD'd in an alley. We've researched life insurance policies for the past week or so, but most of the ""informational"" websites seem to be sales pitches for specific companies or insurance quotes. 


We're at the end of our rope. We don't want to empty our savings for a house or for future children on a funeral for an abusive addict, but she's still my partner's mom and my partner doesn't want her tossed in a state crematorium. We've offered her mother help, pulled together the funds to send her to a beautiful in-patient treatment facility near us, but during our last visit with her mother, she insisted that she's ""grown"" ""happy while she's high"" and ""sick of being here."" We've gotten her psychological help, we've called the police on her drug use hoping jail would get her clean, and we've pleaded, cried, threatened and begged her to get help or let us help her.

personalfinance,[Other] Difference between prepaying payments and paying directly to the principal?,"So I have used Navy Fed for all of my loans so far.  The way they handle paying extra is they just count it towards future payments.  I know the general school of thought is that you should make sure your payment is only going to principal, but  I am curious what the financial ramifications of this are.  Currently I am paid through 2017, and in all honesty I'll be done paying by May/April.  In the future though, with say a house, I would like to know what the potential long term costs could be.  I actually rather like this system because if I lose my job or something I am paid through 2017 on my car, so it's nice to know I don't need to worry about that bill.

personalfinance,Should I declare bankruptcy or just let the debt sit there or should I pay it off?,"Ugh. Okay, here goes. I am 24. When I was a minor, I got into a lot of trouble and was charged as an adult. As a result, it's very difficult for me to get a job since it is theft related and no one will hire me. I have moved back home to go to college for the first time. My parents are wealthy and have completely covered my college classes. Previously, I was living by myself. I was making horrible wages and was barely staying afloat. Got an EBT card in Washington state and then later moved back to my hometown in Texas. I managed to get 3 credit cards which total around 10k. I had moved into an apartment with my boyfriend. Tried getting on the lease, signed paperwork, and a month later received a letter in the mail saying my lease application had been denied because of failing the background check. I assumed I was not on the lease, broke up with boyfriend later, and he stopped paying for the apartment even though he was the only one living there. Turns out I was on the lease and now they are hounding me about the months he didn't pay for. This totals up to around $2000. So, anyways, my car broke down permanently and I no longer have a vehicle. Our household has 3 other people and we all share 2 cars. My brother and I are both full time college students. I go to school from M-Th from 8 am to 4 pm. My mom works full time, and so does my dad. I do have a job, but I'm taking home very very little a month. Less than a 1000 dollars. On a good day, I'm not finishing up with school work until 8 or 9 at night and the semester has just begun. My education is the most important thing to me and I don't think I can stretch myself too much more with how busy I am. I have two years left of college, and after that I am going into a career field which is mostly freelancing and most likely won't make superb money. On top of that, I will also need to get my record expunged, get a car, and eventually move out.

For a while I was paying more than minimum on every credit card but it seemed to hardly budge because the interest rates were so high. When I lost my job and my car broke down and I moved home, I stopped paying. I live in a very very small, rural town where jobs are hard to come by. I haven't made a payment in at least 8 months. I'm so overwhelmed. I don't know what to do. Total debt is probably around 12k.

Should I file for bankruptcy? Should I start working more hours at the risk of effecting my school performance? Should I just let the debt sit there and not touch it, like I've been doing? I have no assets, nothing that can be repossessed, etc. I get probably 5-10 calls a week from God knows who. I don't answer. I assume it's debt collectors. Thank you!",finance,1454516085

personalfinance,Opening Traditional Roth IRA to increase tax refund - Good idea? Will I be able to convert to Roth IRA later down the road?,"Howdy /r/personalfinance. Been lurking and absorbing info ever since this place became a default sub, and now I have a question I hope y'all could weigh in on.

I did a preliminary calculation on my income tax return for 2015, and it seems that my federal refund will be negligible (less than $20), but I owe Maryland $200 in taxes. Fair enough; I'm glad to be breaking even for the most part and having more money in each paycheck throughout the year, rather than a windfall at tax season.

I do understand that contributing to a Traditional IRA can increase my tax refund by deducting from my taxable income (or rather, by reducing my tax liability), but that the distribution would be taxed in the future.

I was discussing my income tax refund situation with my mother, and she, rather charitably, offered to give me cash to open an IRA so that I can get a larger refund, while starting to build up my retirement savings. **I was wondering would it make sense to open a Traditional IRA for the purpose of increasing my tax return now, or should I just place it into a Roth IRA, and maintain my current tax liability?**

I currently net about $2,000 a month, with $1,000 of that having to go to rent (damn you DC area rent!), so every cent in my bank account counts, but I'm worried about the short-term trade-off of some cash now at the expense of having to pay taxes later. My mother has offered to help me further contribute to my IRA for the next few years while I try to progress through my career, and although I feel it's a little shameful, I'm okay with that arrangement.

Would it also make sense for me to convert the account to a Roth IRA later down the road, once I am more capable of taking the tax hit?

personalfinance,Minor Success Stories,"I often see success stories on this sub where someone tells the tale of how they shoveled their way out of $20,000 in credit card debt, paid off their mortgage and now invest 40 percent of their paycheck, all while making $31,000, planning real well, never leaving the house and eating rice for every meal.  

Those stories are great, but their inspiration has always been limited, at least for me. Of course I want to be in control of my finances, but at times the road has seemed so long and steep.  

So I come to you today with a story of minor success. It's the tale of how I've been walking a moderate debt reduction road, and how I realized just today how far I've come. 

In August of 2014, I had a mortgage and student loans that I was paying. I wish they were less, but to date, I have done nothing to kill them off. They're on my list, though. At that time, I also owed about $2,500 on one vehicle loan, $9,700 on a second vehicle loan, $7,000 on one credit card (a balance I had been carrying for years) and $2,350 on a second card. That was more than $21,500 in debt that I had to stare down every day. I had $1,200 in my checking account. I was paying $500-600 per month, there was little to no disposable income each month, and I had spent years thinking about how I was stuck in this hamster wheel.  

I decided one day that I needed to get my shit together, and I started lurking in here, reading a few finance blogs, and actually paying attention to my money. This was the most important part. Once I started actively looking at my finances, things started to become clearer, and I started to gain interest in planning, budgeting and dealing with my money in a responsible way.  

I started off by building my own spreadsheet for budgeting and expense tracking, and I used that fairly religiously for a couple of months. This gave me a good idea of what I was spending and where. Early last year, I made a rough budget, and I started taking steps to eliminate debt.  

To start, I refinanced my $2,300 car loan and paid off the $7,000 credit card. This effectively lowered the interest rate on that debt from 19.9 percent to 3.25 percent. I then listed my other vehicle for sale, and wound up selling it last fall for slightly more than I owed on it. I then (literally) emptied my bank account to purchase a used car outright. At this point, I had eliminated a credit card payment and a car payment.

Then I started using [YNAB](http://www.youneedabudget.com/). I know it's not for everyone, but it's definitely for me. Using YNAB, I quickly had a real handle on my money, and a detailed budget. Around this time, I also started using a debt snowball spreadsheet, which listed all of my debts and planned payments and utilized a snowball plan.  

So here I am in February, a year and a half out from deciding I needed to get my shit together. I have one car loan, and I just paid my second credit card down to nothing. I use it for monthly expenses and bills for the large amount of cash back I can rack up, and thanks to YNAB, it never gets away from me. I now have a revolving credit line of about $35,000, and I'm utilizing none of it. Instead of $21,500 in short-term debt, I have $6,000, all on the car. I have $2,000 in the bank. Using the snowball, I'll pay off the car this summer, and will begin throwing money at my student loans.  

I don't own a mansion, I don't have $1 million in my retirement fund. But that's not the important part. The important part is that I'm not yet 30 years old, and I know what my money is doing. I know how unlikely it is, but if I kept on the snowball plan without any deviation, I will have paid off my student loans in two years. At that point, I will have freed up $1,400 of monthly cashflow since August of 2014 -- money I used to pay toward debt. If I kept going, I will have retired a 30-year mortgage in 9 years.

My wife and I haven't changed our lifestyles much to make this happen. We've just started paying more attention to our money. If we're nearing our budget for clothing, we don't buy clothing, or if we must, we take some cash from our restaurants budget to fund the trip. We don't do crazy vacations; we just drive a few states over and stay with friends for a few days.  

Your mileage may vary, and your road may be shorter or longer (Mine will continue for years). You may want to eat rice every day to guarantee your millionaire retirement. You may want to pay minimum payments for 6 years to maintain the ability to eat out twice a week. Those are personal choices and they're all fine. But it's important to remember these journeys are less about the steps, and more about the mindset. You have to change the way you think about money.  

If you get a wide and detailed look at your money, you'll see where it's going and what you're really paying for. Then set your priorities, whatever they may be, and start your own journey. Go get your shit together.",finance,1454517363
btc,"I, For One, Welcome Our New Blockstream Overlords","Let the dream of a decentralised bitcoin die, and with it too our principles and ideals, for the most mighty of gods, who wrote 80k lines of code, who are smarter than everyone on earth and heaven, who can do no evil for they are utter angels, have now declared themselves kings and emperors. 

In a decentralised world ideas are more important than anything. Socrates had certain ideas, but the people in power found them undesirable - jesus had certain ideas, but he was crucified for them by centralised entities. Galileo of course declared e puo si muve in the face of the priesthood. 

That is why any manner of central control over bitcoin, whether in development by for profit companies or otherwise, is dangerous to bitcoin's existence for that entity will most certainly face the same treatment as the previous ideas.

There are fundamental reasons why bitcoin must be decentralised in all ways and any person or entity who moves towards centralising it, in any way, in my view, is doing nothing but attacking bitcoin itself, whether they know it or not, and placing it in great danger. Look at what happened to e-gold, what happened to liberty reserve..... if one man or company can be held responsible they will be held responsible.

It is now the duty of the miners to impose decentralisation when the development layer fails as it most certainly has right now with some 12 core developers, and almost all of the more influential current core developers, employed by one entity who is most certainly bound by american laws and regulations (the millions of laws and regulations that are selectively applied) who by their sheer numbers and wealth can impose their will upon other developers, but not the miners. 

There are layers in bitcoin. Layer 1 - the developers - always the weakest, has failed. Now it is for layer 2 to react by upholding bitcoin's principles of decentralisation, or, of course, turn this into yet another FED run currency with 12  (board members/core developers) ordering everyone about. 

And if the miners fail, I suppose layer 3 would come in whereby the users decide by buying or leaving to perhaps the facebook of bitcoin's myspace. 

The fate of the future is being decided right now. I hope we all find the strength to prove that its decentralised ways work and do not give one entity centralised power over bitcoin.",cryptocurrency,1454518047

About $300 was withheld in Federal Income Tax for that year. Because I was lazy (and didn't really understand filing at the time), I didn't file for a return for that year. 

Today, I'm a little more up to speed on filing a basic W-2 with the Standard Deduction (as I filed for 2014 and am in the process of 2015's). However, I found out today on the [IRS Website](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;-Self-Employed/Filing-Past-Due-Tax-Returns) that I'm able to claim this $300 refund because it's within 3 years of the due date (April 15th, 2014).

 My question is simple: What's the easiest way to go about filing for the 2013 tax refund on a very simple W-2? No itemizations,  just wages. Because I made so little, I'm certain there wouldn't be any consequences as the Standard Deduction for that year would have covered it.

I live at home, and have very few expenses.
When I got my job 6 months ago I signed up for a checking and saving account through Chase bank.
When I signed up for my checking/saving through Chase 6 months ago, I also applied for a Chase credit card, and was denied.
I have no existing credit.
I have 1000$ in savings.
My mother co-signed for an automobile loan for me, and I currently owe 12K on this loan.
I am looking to move out on my own, and before I do so, I need to be able to get the car loan in my name, and I have a bunch of questions surrounding that.
Since I have no credit, only been employed for 6 months, and was already denied a credit card, I feel my chances of getting the automobile loan solely in my name are very slim???
I accept the fact that any loan I do get would be at a very high interest rate, but where should I be looking/shopping for this loan? Who might offer someone like myself this type of loan with the best chances of approval?
Since I got denied a credit card from Chase, should I just get a secured credit card?
It seems like secured credit cards that report to all the credit bureaus charge annual fees, have a lot of restrictions on min/max deposits, and more importanly result in a hard inquiry on my credit report.
If a secured credit card is going to require a hard inquiry, am I better off just trying to get one of the easier to obtain REAL credit cards?
If so, it has already been 6 months since I was denied, and 6 months since I have been employed, how much longer should I wait, if any?
My plan is to save 2000$ over the next 6 months to be used towards car loan in some fashion...
Would it be better to put this in savings, so it shows any potential lenders that I have liquid assets?
Would it be better to pay off 2K of the loan, so I am asking for a 10K loan instead of 12K loan, or whatever remaining loan balance is 6 months from now?
I am just trying to be realistic in my timeline and goal, and approach this from the best financial angle to assure that I can get this automobile loan in my own name, and continue building my credit.

investing,Basic investing principle: Think about the stock market as you would a bond.,"Reading the posts here in the past few weeks, I think a quick comment might be appropriate for how expected stock returns vary as prices change. My sense is that too many people here are focusing on the wrong thing hence my suggestion to think of the aggregate stock market as you would a bond.

What is the value of a bond? We know what the cash flows will be (the promised coupons + principal assuming no default). So given interest rates, it's simple to calculate the bond value as the present value of the cash flows.

Now what happens when the price of a bond goes down? The cash flows haven't changed so the expected returns from holding the bond to maturity must have gone up. So **Price Down =&gt; Returns Up.** The opposite (returns down) is true if the price of the bond goes up.

The very same concept applies to stocks. The value of a stock is the present value of cash flows (in this case, dividends and other distributions instead of interest payments). Suppose for a moment that the dividends are more or less fixed, but that the price moves around. If the price of stocks fall, then the expected return for stocks goes up (just as in the bond example).

*But hold you on, I hear you say.* If stock prices are going down, doesn't that mean that expected earnings (and hence dividends) are also going down. Yes, that's likely true as well. However, the key insight (which earned Robert Shiller his NP) is that **stock prices are too volatile compared to changes in fundamentals like dividends**. So when stock prices go way down, it's signaling that future dividends are likely to be lower. But since prices generally move more than is justified by the fall in dividends, the expected returns are still higher. This is a big part of why aggregate stock returns are predictable.

**TL;DR: When stock prices go down, expected returns generally go up.** (Note: the focus of this comment is the aggregate stock market, not individual stocks. And I'm not saying to buy every small dip.)

[For people who are already familiar with all this, keep in mind that this is an empirical observation. It doesn't necessarily need to be the case that discount rates are too volatile. In fact, in pre-WWII data in the US, changes in stock prices were driven more by changes to cash flows than changes to discount rates. This is also true if you look at non-US data going back several centuries. In other words, the relative importance of discount rate news is a pretty new phenomenon. One possible explanation is that equity duration has increased considerably in the past several decades due to fewer firms paying dividends. The implication for all you budding market timers is that thinking about discount rates might be more useful than poring over financial statements and forecasting earnings.]

This was the catalyst needed which resulted in massive selling of USD. Usually, ISM non-manufacturing or ADP does not cause this kind of a reaction.

personalfinance,Keeping Student Loan Account Open for Future Loan?,"Hi PF, 

I'm in a bit of a tug of war with myself. 


To start, here's some background: I'm down my student loan debt from ~40k to ~2k right now within 2.5 years. WOO! right? I have a very solid emergency fund of 8 months saved up, no other debt to report, matching my company's 401k, and now saving my on a down payment for a car. 


Now, my car, which is a 2002 Ford Focus is starting to be on it's last legs of it's life. According to KBB it's only worth about 1k. I'm going to drive it and keep fixing it up as long as there's no huge problems (e.g. transmission or engine failures).  I'm guessing it might start really falling apart in the spring or summer, depending how rough the rest of the winter is. 


I don't want to spend 5k on some beater that will get me through the days, I've decided my next car is going to be a nice, new(er) reliable coupe car. After having years of clunkers, it'd be nice to have automatic windows for a change. I know /r/pf is against buying new cars, and I'm considering going a few years used, if I can find a good car at an appropriate price. I've looked around and a 2013 car with 35,000 miles will be 16k, while the 2016 version will be like 18k. Worth the difference in my eyes. Of course, if my current car does fall apart soon, I'll still need a loan to help with this new car. 

My dilemma: My current student loan is my oldest account at 8+ years. Once this account goes away, my credit age is going to be the lowest possible bracket, bringing down my score. I'm finally in the excellent rating according to the free services I use, and I know that they are usually not as reliable, but it seems like it's at a good place. Every part of my credit is at the highest rank that it's ever been before. I want to use this in my favor.


So, should I pay down my student loan to like $10, and apply for a car loan while I have my ""great"" credit score, or pay off my student loans completely, let the score drop down a bit, then apply for a car loan? I'd love to have the best interest rate possible whether it's through banks or the dealership, as I'll shop around. And keep in mind, me paying off the student loan and my car breaking will probably be at the same time.

My wife and I owe about $4700 this year in taxes after working through our tax return, which obviously really sucks.  Last year we owed about $1300 and I noticed on our existing W-4 that we each had 1 allowance and I think one of us didn't have the single vs. married status correct.  We updated our W-4's last year such that both of us are set at 0 allowances and with the ""Married"" status.  We thought that would be all we had to do, but for whatever reason the government is still not taking out enough through federal income tax in our paychecks.

I'm now working through the IRS' W-4 calculator for 2016 so I can avoid this situation again.  My wife and I both work, we both contribute to a retirement plan (401(k) and 403(b) respectively), and have a combined estimated 2016 income of roughly $195,000.  We have no kids, no dependents.  I understand about the whole marriage penalty situation, but the numbers I'm getting back from the calculator still seem really high.  And in fact, are actually much higher than the roughly $4700 I owe this time around.

I'm hoping you guys can double check my numbers and make sure this is right.  

I'd also like an understanding of why the government is unable to take out the correct amount of tax on its own?  I.e. why do I have to go through this and estimate the additional tax I need taken out?  Why can't it ""Just work""?

personalfinance,Buying A Home: Should I pay off car or put more towards home down payment?,"I am purchasing a home for $480,000.  

The interest rate I may be getting is between 3.7 to 3.9%, but let's say worst case is 4.0%.

20% of that 480k is 96,000.  So for this discussion, let's say that's the money I have to work with.  If I was to put less than 20% on this loan, I will have to pay PMI, which is about $80.

Now, I do have a car loan, with a balance of $15,974.66.  That car loan has a interest rate of 4.5%

The question I have is, should I pay the full 20% on the house, without PMI and continue to make the payments on the car, as usual?  OR, should I pay off the car in full, given the higher interest rate, and then put the remainder into the house, and pay the PMI until I've put more than 20% equity into the house later down the road?

I'd prefer not to spend any more of my additional money for the first 3-6 months in order to retain a nest egg in case anything happens with the house.  So, working strictly with the 96,000.  (I know, closing costs, etc, but leaving that out for now).

I am new to the idea of amortized payments, etc, and I think this deals with it.  So, if you have an answer, if you could provide a brief explanation on how  you came to that conclusion, that would be extremely helpful.

Thanks in advance!",finance,1454552581

personalfinance,Mom (60) unexpectedly died and dad’s (65) finances are a mess,"Hi Reddit,

My mom recently passed away (at 60) very unexpectedly and it has been devastating to our family.  My parents were married for over 40 years.  My parents have always shielded me from their finances, but after spending this week with my dad it has became very apparent that my parents were not very financially literate.

I am in my late 20s and live half-way across the country (USA).  I am trying to craft a financial plan for my dad moving forward, but all of my personal financial knowledge I have had to learn the hard way as an adult.  My parents taught me how to be a good person, but not how to manage money.

**General Info:**

* Dad is a 65-year-old cross-country truck driver
* Mom was a stay at home mom
* 16-year-old brother who is a sophomore in an online home school
* No retirement savings (all 401k accounts and previous savings were cashed out at some point)
* No other savings, he has probably &lt;$1,000 in cash and maybe another $2,000 incoming in checks, but mortgage still needs to be paid this month
* Mom had a “deals” shopping problem.  The house is full of junk that she got on sale.
* Dad’s credit is 650~.  Payment history is 99%, but it is being dinged significantly for high credit utilization (90%+).
* Mom had a tiny life insurance policy that is being used to cover the cost of the funeral services and there’s going to be nothing left over.
* Emergency response came to the house when my mom passed (dead on arrival).  I think there might be a bill for this at some point.

**Debt:**

* $13,000 in credit cards and a personal loan, interest rates 19.50% - 29.99%
* $130,000 mortgage @ 4.6%
* $2,000 on truck vehicle loan @ 5.25%

**Notable Assets:**

* House - 2000 sq. ft. 3/2 - I am very unsure about how much his house is worth.  The Zillow value is around $175k
* Pickup Truck - $? - 12 years old.  He has been using this as the primary family transportation, it gets around 16 MPG
* Car - $? - 20 year old beater.  It runs but it needs some work (&lt;$500) so he hasn’t been driving it.  25 MPG~
* 5th Wheel RV - $? - 15 years old.  He could live in it if needed.  They haven’t used it in quite a few years and the 5th-wheel plate is not installed in his current truck.  He has stated he is concerned that he thinks hauling the 5th wheel caused the transmission to blow on his last similarly sized truck.

**Income:**

* Truck driving - $0 at the moment.  He will probably not be able to resume his current job because he needs to be home every night to take care of my brother who is 16.  His income has been variable due to payment by truck “load” and he really doesn’t know how much he has made.  I estimate he was earning about $40k/year.
* New Job - $? - He has some leads and is going to look for a local job that will enable him to be home every night.  He is very well respected by all of his previous employers so I think he should be able to find something.  I think he should be able to find something that will pay ~$15/hr.  He is in great physical condition for a 65-year-old.
* Social Security - $0 - He has not started to collect social security yet.  He was wanting to wait until he was 70 to “get the maximum.”  I have educated myself on this subject this week and I think he should start collecting right now.  His full retirement age is 66, so if he starts now he should get 95% of his full monthly payment.  He thinks his payment should be around $1900/month, but we are going to check on the exact amount soon.  The average life expectancy of someone his age according to the social security website is 84.  It is my understanding that he will get the same “lifetime” compensation whether he starts now or starts at 70.  What I think this means is that if he were to die before age 84, then it would have been better to collect as soon as possible.  If he were to live past 84, that’s the only case where waiting for the higher monthly payment is advantageous.  Because of the above reason, his need for the money now, and the ability for me to make up for the deficit personally should he live past 84, I think he should start collecting now.

**Monthly Bills:**

* Mortgage - $960/month (including escrow)
* Electricity - $200-$400/month (average bill seems to be around $200-250, but this month was exceptionally high at $400 for some reason.  They live in a very cold area and it is around 30-35 F degrees outside at the moment. $0.10/kWh )
* Car Insurance - $125/month~
* Vehicle loan for truck - $260/month
* Medicare - $120/month
* Verizon Cell phones / Internet - $200/month
* Gas - $? - I suspect he has been spending A LOT of money on gas driving around in the truck.   He cashes his checks physically at the branches and then drives around to pay the bills at each financial institution.
* Food - $? - I have no idea how much they were paying
* Discretionary/Other - $? - Because he’s in debt this should be nearly $0, but I need to provide a realistic plan for him so the plan I create might not be able to be as aggressive as I would personally do.  They have a cat and I don’t know how much food for that is, but they definitely spend money on it.

**Miscellaneous Expenses:**

* Garbage (paid yearly)
* Water rights (paid yearly, they use a well)
* I’m sure there are other small bills he hasn’t told me about, but they should be small compared to the major expenses.

**Current Plan:**

* Create a budget and put him on a cash-based system with no credit card usage.  This should help address the cause of his debt.  My mom was the one who spent a lot of their money on junk, so a large portion of the expenditures should be gone.
* Get a HELOC for $15k to pay off the credit cards and personal loan.
* Establish a  $1,000 buffer in his checking account.  He has been keeping a $0 balance and paid $800~ in overdrafts and fees last year.  I think he should save up a couple thousand and then throw excess money at the HELOC (which would pay off the CC debt)
* Dropped RV from insurance
* I am paying to get the car fixed so he can drive that and save money on gas
* Shop around for car and house insurance.  I suspect he is overpaying.
* Reduce electricity bill.  They already keep the thermostat at 66 F and use a fireplace, but maybe I can find some ways to keep the bill under $225/month.
* Reduce cell phone / internet bill.  They have internet through an LTE/4G hotspot with an expensive carrier (Verizon).  They need internet for my brother’s internet schooling.  I have looked into getting a local internet provider for &lt;$50/month, but the earliest install times are 3-weeks out.   I can then move the other two cell phones to other prepaid providers for &lt;$30-50~/month each.  He might be in a contract, we still need to check.
* My dad has had a truck his entire life and is very against getting rid of it and he also wants to be able to use the RV if needed.  He lives out in the country a little bit and wants to be able to haul wood, etc.  He actually had tentatively planned on getting a bigger truck this year after he paid off his current truck to haul the RV.  I have convinced him to forget about that for now as it is a really bad idea.  For now we’re going to make the car his daily driver.
* Sell stuff / downsize.  His house is full of crap that boarders on hoarding.  I don’t think they have thrown away anything in the last 40 years.  None of it is worth very much but he doesn’t need 99% of it.  Selling the house would be a monumental task right now because it would take weeks and weeks to clean out everything.  He doesn’t need 20 frying pans, etc.  I think it might be in his best interest to sell the large house and downsize into something smaller, but for numerous reasons I don’t think we could do that right now, so instead I want to get him slowly prepped for that possibility over the next year.  I think after my brother moves out in a few (?) years he would be willing to sell everything and move closer to me and live out of the RV.

I realize it’s going to be impossible to solve this perfectly especially with not knowing his exact income, but this is what I have to work with right now.  I have just got my personal finances in order in the past few years so I can help him out a little bit, but I think with the combination of his social security and a modest paying job he can make it work.

**Proposed budget:**

* Mortgage - $960/month
* Electricity - $225/month
* Car Insurance - $100/month
* Vehicle payment - $260/month (should be paid off later this year)
* Gas - $150/month
* Medicare - $120/month
* Cell/Internet - $200/month (because my brother needs internet I can’t cancel this right away, but this should be reduced eventually)
* Food (including eating out) - $300/month
* Discretionary/Other - $200/month
* TOTAL: $2,515/month

Since he has never followed a budget in 65 years I need to make this as foolproof and simple as possible for him.

With $1900/month (minus taxes) of social security + $1600/month~ post-tax income from a $15/hr job, he should have a total post-tax income of $3000-3200/month.  This should leave him room to pay the bills and start paying off the HELOC.  Hopefully this should get him in a stable position right now and then over the next year I can help him further reduce expenses and eventually sell the house.

I cash-flow enough to give him up to $1,000/month in support, but I have only been working for a few years and am just getting to the point where I can start leveraging my own money instead of paying off student debt.  I am on track personally to have all of my debt paid off this year, but my dad is important to me so if this has to wait then so be it.

personalfinance,CO State tax discrepancy: refund is less than withdrawn money minus owed taxes?,"Hi pf,

I'm a bit confused by my CO State tax results. I've been using myfreetaxes.com to file federal and state taxes for 2015. 

My AGI is 18,968. I've taken the standard deduction (6,300) and according to the software I have exemptions totaling 4,000. Which brings my taxable income to $8,668. 

According to my W-2s (I had 3), I've withheld $603 for state taxes. However, the summary that myfreetaxes provides for my state tax return states that I withheld $616, owe $216, and that my return is $216. This makes no sense to me. My W-2s are entered correctly into the software, so that's not the problem.

What did I miss? I didn't have any special deductions or taxes added to my colorado taxable income. Something must be missing. Or is this a bug in the software?

Here is what it looks like in the state summary:

Colorado taxable income: 8,668

Total tax due to Colorado: (216) for some reason this is in parentheses

Colorado credits: 0

Colorado total payments: 616 (Should be 603 according to my W-2s)

Colorado refund: 216

personalfinance,I'm living at home with my parents to save money as I pay off my loans. My mother's thrown a few suggestions at me concerning how to file taxes/pay off loans and I'd like some input.,"Quick facts:

* I recently accepted a job offer in another state and will be commuting.

* My salary is more than both of my parents combined.

* I have a sibling currently enrolled in community college.

* I have 30k in student loan debt.

* My mother may have somewhere around 80k in savings

Assumptions you can make:

I am of south asian descent and can be pretty traditional. I will continue to live with my parents, probably even after I get married. We have an excellent relationship and share our income. I'm 22 M, this is my first job. My sibling just started college and will have 3 more years, I just graduated last year.

Questions:


* 1) My mother suggested she pay off my loans in full with her savings so instead of me trying to fight the high interest rates, I just pay her back at my own pace ($1000/month) so I don't have to worry about minimums/missed payments/interest/etc. I thought this made a lot of sense given high rates of loans vs low rates of savings accounts but a friend advised against it. Can someone weigh in?


* 2) My sibling is currently a dependent under my mother. She suggests I take them instead as it can only help us as a whole since I'm in a higher bracket than her. I checked the rules and they are eligible but it sort of feels like I'm using some kind of loophole. Is it really okay to trade dependents around the family? I guess what I'm trying to say is it sounds too good to be true/too easy a decision to make.

* 3) My sibling received a lot of financial aid while I was away at college but now things are obviously different. I imagine they will not be getting as much financial aid as they did (they ended up profiting actually). The question is, how would their financial aid package differ if I were to take them as a dependent from my mother?

* 4) My employment comes with ordinary full time benefits. This topic I have very little knowledge about. Would it be better for me to use my employer's health insurance or to try to get into my mother's family plan as I am under 26?

* 5) This is more of a personal preference question. I drive a 2015 camry and my commute'll cost me almost $25 daily to have a commute of 40 minutes. I can save $10 for an extra 30 min of traffic. What would you do? Alternatively there's a public transport option that is 90 min long including a one mile walk to the location.

* 6) I have only used a debit card all my life. Is building credit really just as easy as switching all debit card use to credit card use and paying off the balance on time?

personalfinance,I need a short term personal loan for a period of about 6 months. Is it possible without getting ripped off?,"Hi guys!
I'm currently a college student nearing the end of my undergraduate degree (I will graduate in May 2016). After graduation, my plans are as follows:

* A yearlong co-op with Intel (I have already interviewed and accepted the offer)
* Graduate School 

A bit of background:

Over the past couple of years, I have been supporting myself through low-paying jobs around campus. This semester, however, I want to spend most of my time getting experience in researching micro/nano-electronic devices. As you can imagine, this will consume most of my time and I will not have much left over for other work. On the other hand, it will also greatly increase my chances of getting into my graduate program of choice.

My problem:

As an undergraduate student, I don't get paid to do research (this is pretty standard). After doing some back-of-the-envelope calculations, I've determined that I would need about $1400.00 (plus my current savings) over the next four months to cover all living expenses. I also know that I will be receiving $5100.00 from Intel about a month before I start working to cover moving and initial living expenses. Since $5100.00 will more than cover my moving expenses, apartment deposit, and first month's rent I was wondering whether it would be possible to get a loan for $1400.00 and pay back in full when I finish school.

My question:

Is it possible for me to get a loan for $1400.00 without charging me an obscene interest rate? I know that relying on future income is always risky, but I personally feel that the benefits here outweigh the risks. 

Other information:

* Federal Aid (FAFSA/Pell Grant) is not an option for me.
* I've already talked to my school about this. They can only offer me a few hundred dollars for only a period of 28 days.
* Yes, I do have other student debt (tuition related).",finance,1454596301

Forex,USDJPY - the trade that really annoyed me!,"As I stated earlier that I got stopped:
    long USDJPY @ 120.65, s/l  118.65

This is my rationale:
Whenever BoJ cut interest rates there has always been a 200-300 pip move. I look forward to BoJ cutting rates event as I always bank about 200+ pips each time. So, when BoJ decided to go negative interest rates I could have not been more excited. I wasn't the only one expecting a huge move, BNP Paribas forecasting 124.27, Deutsch bank forecasting USDJPY reaching 128, GS speculating the pair to hit 130 by the end of the year. So, what the hell happened? There are three reasons why this time it did not work out. The treasury yield fell sharply, stock dropped 300 points intraday trading, and with low oil, yield, and stocks, investors are concerned about Fed's decision to tightening unlikely. Next fed's meeting is six weeks away. Rate high is now almost an impossibility by Dudley's comment yesterday. Dudley is a FOMC-voting member, so, his comments counts. However, this Friday will be interesting. I still think USDJPY is too low. There is no way Japanese economy can survive in these conditions without excessive easing or further going negative on interest rates. What do you guys think?",finance,1454600007

investing,Gold Keeps Rallying; Russell 2000 Up 1.5%,"**Equities:** The MAR16 SP500 is up .5% on continued belief that global central banks will support financial markets with low interest rates. This is especially after NY Fed governor William Dudley’s dovish statement earlier this week. We are watching the MAR16 mini-Russell contract, and we believe it could travel higher to the 1050 range, an important prior support level. That would be a 3% rally from here.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds are down 8 ticks to 162’04, after a massive buying wave struck the market earlier this week. Tomorrow’s government issued jobs report may  provide a catalyst for another big bond move. If the jobs # is much weaker than expected tomorrow, we would not be surprised to see more bond buying.

**FX:** The MAR16 USD collapsed this week, breaking below the 200 day moving average yesterday and more so today. This shows you the acute volatile nature potential of FX. Central banker statements can rock FX markets in the blink of an eye. The MAR16 Euro popped above its 200 day moving average, and is up .7% to 111.80.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI crude oilis up 2.4% to $33.06, after a 9% rally yesterday. If this contract can stay above $34, we believe it is headed to $37.50. APR16 gold met our initial target of $1140, and is now at $1151. It has been supported by strong buying over the past 3 weeks. MAR15 Coffee has rallied from a key $1.15 level as well, and is now up to $1.23. We believe it may continue to rally from here.

stocks,Apprenticeships?,"Here me out /r/stocks.

I know you guys hate the ""Hey I'm young and poor and want to get rich, I have less than $10k, how do I do?"" posts. This isn't one of them.

Let me start by saying I'm 31 years old. I have a job in management that pays around $60-$65k a year (depending on bonuses), so I am by no means well off but I have a better than average income for my age and cost of living area (Minnesota). I am nearly debt free, plan to be completely in the black by June 2016. I have about $7k in my 401k and other than that, pretty much 0 in savings (paying down debt has been priority #1).

I've been interested in the market for a long time. A few years ago I took $1000 and dabbled in penny stocks, mainly Fannie Mae and made about $400 when they rebounded after showing a profit and paying back the Fed. Then I got greedy a lost a little on other penny stocks (FNMA was an obvious fluke but my success made me blind to that). Ended up with about $900 of my original $1000. So I noped out of penny stocks really quick after being ""burnt"" (I know $100 isn't a lot to lose but after being up 40% it made me very gun shy). I know I am very lucky not to have lost more, I was reading all the pumper newsletters and listening to that famous short-seller (I forget his name, kind of a pompous young guy who was featured as a child market prodigy on TV), watching his videos and got pretty enamored with it all until my common sense kicked in and I pulled out completely.

That was my first time trading, and now I'm starting to get into the meat of it all, the wise way to invest. Looking at different industries, financials, doing my research on ""actual"" companies, etc. I have a few hundred dollars that I'm playing around with on Robin Hood, but nothing serious yet. I own a little Microsoft and Sirius XM. Was thinking getting into the ""sin stocks"" because we appear to be in a bear market.

Honestly though, I'm clueless still. I just want to learn, and someday (not tomorrow, not next year, probably not till I'm 40 or older) I'd like to be able to be good at this so I'm not working till I'm 70. Like I said, I'm 31 with almost no savings. It's not too late for me yet but if I don't start soon, it will be.

I see people on here say ""no one knows how to use Google"". Well every time I Google I get inundated with swaths of articles from hundreds of publications, I have no idea if they are legit, I have no idea where their interests lay. I try to go to Yahoo or TheStreet and look at financials, I sort of know what I'm looking at but defining whether something is a ""buy"" or not, in my own terms, is seriously overwhelming.

And, I'd like to be able to do it myself. I know someone is going to say ""Invest in mutual funds or bonds, or get a broker when you have enough money"" and I understand that logic. But I want to go high risk, I'm not scared of losing money. I am ready to rock.

So, I guess what I'm asking is where to go to learn for someone like me. Are their apprenticeships out there that a guy like me who has no financial back round or schooling could do? I know a degree in finance or economics would be helpful, but I also know there are a lot of people out there who learned on their own. How did they do it? Who helped them? I know everyone likes to tout about like they did it all themselves, but seriously, everyone needs a mentor. Who was yours?

Any advice would be great. I have read article after article, Googled a thousand ticker numbers, I've been listening to Investor's Edge religiously, so now what.

Since Japan has a negative interest rate right now and the US raised interests rates despite the lack of inflation, wouldn't it be a relatively safe bet to say the US may see deflation/low inflation and Japan will see inflation? 

If that is the case, wouldn't it be a good/sure investment to borrow from Japan to invest in US bonds? You could borrow the Yen while it is at peak buying power, and exchange it for dollars which will likely increase in buying power, then earn interest on the bonds. The exchange rate would be favorable at the start and then due to the central banks influence and some time, favorable the opposite direction down the road. Finally you get to collect interest on the bonds as well.

I know that there is no such thing as a free lunch and I'm not sure if I can even feasibly do this  as an individual investor but the news about Japan's negative interest rates got me thinking about this. I fully expect to be told why I'm wrong, but I'm curious to know why.",finance,1454628986

The only lender I can find that will finance a private party and that I qualify for is State Farm. Their quoting me a 7 percent interest. That sounds really high to me. Then again, I'm new to all this.

1. is 7 percent actually high? Or is it reasonable for a private party trade to a guy with ""fair"" credit?

2. My agent said that if I get a larger loan, I can get a lower interest rate--roughly 5.75%. Is there a drawback to getting for example a 21k loan at that rate and then immediately paying back 4k? Are there cons to doing that?

3. Is it bad go go into this with the assumption that I will refinance later? My credit score is fair because I don't particually have any accounts. I just got my first credit card today.

When that's done, my next goal will be setting myself up with a Roth IRA and maxing that out for the year (and that would be an annual goal for myself in the future). 


Then, my next step was going to be tackling my next highest-interest, highest balance student loan and work my way through all of them that way. But I was wondering if it would be worth it for me to consider consolidating my student loans to get a lower interest rate? I've looked into some of the interest rates at local credit unions, and the best seem to be around 6%? Would it be worth it to first tackle my two lower interest student loans then refinance the other 2 to lower my rate from 6.55% to 6%? Or is that too little to make a change. Also, am I risking any student loan benefits by doing that?

Also, I saw another post where someone had a 3% checking account interest rate at Lake Michigan Credit Union. I live in California so if possible is it advisable to open a checking account with that credit union and transfer my emergency fund there to earn even more interest?

If I do have to file with MD, is there a way to signify that the reason no MD taxes were withheld from my income was because I wasn't working in MD and that my income was taxed by another state?",finance,1454654046

personalfinance,Approved for card but not lowest rate?,"I wanted a credit card with a 0% interest intro rate to transfer and pay off a $2,800 debt and for convenience vs debit card when renting cars, staying in hotels, etc. And obviously having a low rate after that debt it paid off is better than higher, just in case. I can't say I care about any other perks.

I was approved for the Citi Diamond Preferred card, but with a 15.24% interest rate after the intro period, instead of the lowest 12.24% they offer. My credit score on their application is 785, so I'm surprised I got the higher rate. I asked them to lower the rate and they said no, which admittedly Irritates me.

should I keep the card, use the introductory rate for my balance transfer, (hopefully) have debt paid off by then, and then decide whether or not to keep it? Or ditch it now and apply for a different card with an intro rate and see if I get a lower long-term rate?",finance,1454675034

personalfinance,Should we pay down the mortgage on our rental property?,"We bought a rental property and managed to finance it entirely by re-mortgaging our own house. This allowed us to get a lower rate (2.49%) but we can still claim tax back on the interest against the rental income.

I'd like to re-mortgage to get a lower rate of 1.99%, but there are fairly steep solicitor and mortgage fees (close to £2,000) involved in switching over, and it'd save us (as far as I can tell) £570 per year based on the 0.5% lower interest rate. My girlfriend has suggested that we could be better off avoiding the fees and just paying down the mortgage aggressively.

I'm not sure what to do - I love the idea of eventually becoming debt free, but I'm also worried that a time will come soon when we can no longer max out our ISAs and we will regret not passing up a chance of borrowing money at such a low rate (it is a tracker, but only 1.5% above base rate).

personalfinance,"I am 27, and my finances and lifestyle are not any better than when I was 17. Please help me, how do I change this?","**Intro:** The first thing I want to say is that I have taken a huge interest in making my financial life better for myself in the last four months. Reading advice I got here, I paid off debts that were in collections, got my student loans out of default, got my first secured credit card, wrote letters to debtors and had just about every derogatory mark taken off my credit report. My credit score has gone from the mid 400's to the high 600's. I moved my cellphone from $100 a month AT&amp;amp;amp;T to $40 a month Google Fi, pay all of my bills on time and other than my student loans (about $9,000) I no longer owe anything to anyone. This all happened after my divorce and I am trying to take care of my life and improve every day. When I was married I had a much different lifestyle, with our combined income I made enough to live very comfortably, but she made about triple what I did which was the cause of it. Now that I moved out of state and started over, I seem to have dropped down to the standard of living of when I was still a teenager: I have 2 roommates, no car, and I am living paycheck to paycheck. 

**Income:** I work in a call center doing basic technical support for $9 an hour. The wage is not very high, but I live in a very poor southern state in a small town where cost of living is cheap as well. I get 40 hours a week, benefits (which helped my finally afford the braces I needed), 401k, and the work environment is very nice. It is one of the better jobs I have ever had, but that is comparing it to fast food and coffee shops. After all my deductions are taken out I am taking home roughly $600 a paycheck assuming I am not working any overtime. There's a $575 monthly bonus, I seem to earn it most months, but it is also taxed at a higher rate, 40% I believe, so again it's not adding a ton to my take home pay. 

**Bills:** I pay 260 in rent and utilities. I live with my brother and his girlfriend, I am not really happy with my roommates or the actual house, but moving out on my own seems impossible with how tight my budget is, and a car has been my priority anyway. $40 for a cellphone bill, I see this as a necessity. $25 for gym membership, this does get used, I lift 3 days a week, and do cardio 6 days a week, this is money well spent. $110 monthly for orthodontist, I never got proper dental care when I was a kid, my work insurance covered $2,000 towards braces so I pulled the trigger on it, I'll be paying the rest of the amount off for 2 years. $200 for student loans. $240 for groceries, I live and eat frugally and healthy, I am not going out often, I make tea and work and only get the occasional coffee or smoothie when it is a social thing. So granted that is about $875 in monthly bills, in a given month I will probably also spend $25-50 on a video game books or movies for entertainment. 

**Goals:** I feel like a car is the next thing I need. I have never owned my own car, and there is no such thing as public transportation in this city. I rely on my brother to drive me to and from work but that gives me no flexibility to go anywhere I need to, I definitely cannot go out on a date or to hang out with friends or coworkers, and on several occasions I have been stuck at work for more than an hour because he is too busy to pick me up. I know conventional wisdom here states to buy the cheapest craigslist beater you can afford, but I do not trust anything like that, and want to go for a used Corolla from a dealership with my tax return as a down payment. Even assuming a decent interest rate though, I am looking at a huge chunk of my monthly income gone to a car payment, insurance and gas. And this definitely prevents me from moving out and getting my own place. 

**tl;dr:** Actually after writing this all out, I don't think I am having problems budgeting, I can see I just need more income, which sucks because I have less control over that other than getting a second job and having no freetime.

**edit** I will be asking my direct supervisor how I can start the process of a promotion. I have direct, provable stats and metrics that I am performing better than all my peers. This call center employs around 250 people, so I am certain there is something more I can do.

**edit 2** thank you for the reality check Reddit. I get it, i am poor, and will probably be poor for a much longer time. I'll pick up the pieces tomorrow, I am going to cry for a bit and then go to the gym .",finance,1454686535

We recently moved out of an expensive state to a state that has no income tax (yay!) so we are excited about the extra income, though living in a very expensive state comes with it some residual debt (approx. $35k, doesn't include cars; minimal savings for other reasons). Homebuying was not an option for us in prior state due to ridiculously high cost of real estate and high monthly daycare costs among other things, so no equity to carry over. However, we are eager to buy a house this year as the real estate here is more affordable, though getting more expensive by the minute.
I am using Dave Ramsey's plan to pay off all the debt and expect to have it all paid off by September but on Ramsey's plan, we are not putting any cash in savings until the debt is paid off. I want to have a sizeable (ideally 20%) down payment, which means having around $60k towards a home. My partner, on the other hand, wants to put down a minimal cash investment (think FHA) to get into a house quickly due to appreciation rates and lowish interest rates. We will still be able to afford a larger mortgage if we put less down, and could probably refi in a couple of years to get rid of PMI.
I am lost here on what to do - should I be aggressive with paying off debts while saving a portion of our income, thereby extending out the debt payoff plan in an effort to have cash for a down payment, or should we singularly focus on debt? Would it be better to just ""get in"" the housing market due to the 9% annual increase in appreciation and pay off the remaining debt during the first year of home ownership to free up cash for investing and applying extra against the principal? I am definitely more FI-focused whereas my partner is more ""act now, adjust later, enjoy life."" I want to make the right decision and HATE debt like the plague, but I also want to get into home ownership as I feel like we are being out-paced by saving vs. the appreciation rates here.

Starting this year I've made a commitment to getting my shit together financially. Started avalanching using undebt.it, actually using Mint to keep an eye on my budgets, and disputing boo-boos on my credit report. I know that PF can be against refinancing/consolidating in that it becomes easier to bang down loans individually, but here's what I'm currently dealing with:



Credit Card (eliminating this month) $992.34 - 21.55% int. CL:$5500

Private Loan 1 $46,282.93	- 10% variable int.

Private MEDCAP Loan $22,631.00 - 7.25% fixed int.

Private Loan 2 $40,369.77	- 6.5% variable int. 

Federal Loan 1 (Graduated Plan w/ FedLoan) $16,138.69- 5.88% int.

Car Loan $4200 - 0.0% int

Expected Zero July 2020.


My question: which of these should i refinance besides the obvious double-digit bastard up there? I attempted to refi SL 1 with MEDCAP 1, declined by SoFi for reported late payments, even if i was pre-approved initially (longest one 90 days). Since SL 1 and SL 2 were from the same lender, I was able to successfully dispute SL1 late payments with CreditKarma. SL 2 is currently pending (5 more days!) I didn't try Earnest or any others, and after 1 hard pull by SoFi, I don't wanna take any more chances until credit report fuck-ups are off the record.



Additional numbers:

Salary: bi-weekly is $2477.27 locked in take home w/o overtime

Savings: $25 i have no emergency fund until my credit card is at $0

Invest: 2% contribution 403b with no employer match, in lieu of Pension Plan (7% automatically out of paycheck pre-tax)

personalfinance,"Should I contribute the full amount to a new IRA to reduce my tax burden, or should I take a tax hit and continue to build up my emergency fund?","My tax burden this year, without contributing to an IRA, is $4,789 owed to federal and $1,186 owed to the state (or $5,975 total). However, if I contribute the maximum to a traditional IRA by the April 15th deadline, I can reduce my tax burden down to $3,491 for federal and $798 for the state ($4,298 owed in total) and start saving towards my retirement. Is this the smart thing to do?

A little background:
I’m completely self employed, 28 years old, filing single. $0 dollars currently saved towards retirement as I was putting it all towards credit card debit for the past year and a half. That debt is now gone (yay!), and my emergency fund has 3k in it. Based off the wonderful information in PF, I know that I need to increase my emergency fund to be at least 6 months of expenses, but since I’m self-employed I’d rather play it safe and make that a years worth of expenses. I took in around 38k last year, and around $25k after deducting my business expenses. 

Business has been up since the start of the year so I should be able to make that $5500 if I keep my spending down, and if I don’t quite make it I would just amend my return to reflect the amount I was able to put forth. However, that money would otherwise go towards my emergency account and provide me some stability should I ever need it. But sending that extra $1,677 to the feds really stings. 

Also, I’d eventually like to save up for a downpayment on a house, get married, and hopefully increase my business to retire in a higher tax bracket (so perhaps a Roth IRA makes more sense, in which case this is no good anyway?).

**TLDR;** I owe $5,975 in taxes without contributing to a traditional IRA. Reduced to $4,298 if I max my contributions. Should I max out and reduce my burden or take the tax hit and put more towards my emergency fund?

Right now I have roughly $14k remaining in student loans. Some of those are subsidized (and are at roughly 4% interest) but the majority are unsubsidized at 6.55%. I pay about $70/month just in interest, and about $160 goes to the principal.

Now, I received a credit card offer in the mail for an introductory 0% interest for 12 months. I understand that you get that interest rate ONLY if you make required payments each month, otherwise you have to pay the interest back even retroactively. Is this a good idea to paying off a, let's say, $2500 loan over a year interest free? Or am I setting myself up for something stupid?

Background: I have a degree, full time job that pays so-so, only debt are my student loans. I have roughly $4.5k in savings. 

EDIT: Turns out the big limiter here is having a student loan servicer that accepts credit card payment. Apparently mine does not. So now I know... Thanks for answering my dumb question!",finance,1454706980

We're both recent graduates with a fair amount of student loan debt and no retirement as of yet. We're in major debt reduction mode. We both work, live off of less than one full income, and are throwing everything else at our student loan debt. We have the savings set aside to pay the $2,500 tax bill, so that's not an issue either way.

Out of curiosity, I did some math and discovered that opening up Traditional IRAs would net us an immediate 20.4% ROI in the form of a tax bill reduction. Currently, our highest interest student loan has an interest rate of 5.41%. Am I correct in thinking that it would make more sense for us to open up IRAs for each of us and throw a few thousand dollars into them prior to April 18 than to pay extra into our student loans in that time-frame? 

I know that opening a Traditional IRA is just deferring those taxes into the future, but can't I roll it into a Roth IRA sometime in the future, thus preserving the immediate 20.4% ROI? Am I missing anything?",finance,1454712634

personalfinance,How I went from a 563 credit score in October 2013 to a 781 in Jan 2016 by using things learned in R/PersonalFinance,"Since my post is a long winded, [here's the photographic timeline of my little journey](https://imgur.com/a/nNdnb )

As the title says, I was highly irresponsible in the past and in general did not pay my bills.  I grew up in the good ole days of receiving unsolicited credit card offers in the mail that came with active cards that you could apply for and instantly start using.  I didn't get a great financial education so by the time I was 19, I had 4 CC's that were maxed out.  I didn't realize the importance of making payments, so I just didn't.... and so my credit cards quickly became charged off accounts.  Still I was just a kid, what did I care?  But I never changed.  I let utility bills go to collections, I let medical bills go to collections, anything that had a bill that could go to collections, it was all the same to me.  But then, I entered in a serious relationship and realized it was time to quickly get my shit together.  Enter October 2013.  I knew we wanted to move in together and a landlord would want to pull my credit.  I didn't want my poor credit to be the reason we couldn't get a place so I got to work on it ASAP.  

The first thing I did was utilize Credit Karma to see what was reporting on my credit and also what my score was (spoiler, it was awful).  The next thing I did was open a secured card through my credit union.  Actually, the person who helped me was kind of a jerk and told me I shouldn't get a secured card and instead I should put my money towards paying down my debts.  Well I knew I was serious, and I was going to tackle this from all possible angles. So I opened my secured card with a limit of $250 and always paid it off in full every month.  I was still a beginner so sometimes I maxed it out, but I always paid it in full every month. I wasn't going to pay interest OR get back into my bad habits.  

One helpful thing my credit union did was give me the number for transunion to dispute items.  So I started disputing, but I also started to payoff the ones that I felt like I legit should pay (like utilities.)  I used some of the tactics you can read about in here, trying to make settlements with the creditors and have them still report it as paid in full.  I also continued to dispute them through the credit bureaus even after they were paid.  I was trying to get all the derogs off my credit.  I read through the wikis here on debt and credit, and even started day dreaming about saving for retirement.

July of 2014, I got an offer from capital one for the platinum card specifically made for people rebuilding their credit.  Yes, the interest rate sucked, but like I said I paid off my card in full every month so that didn't matter.  I preferred to keep my account with my CU so I applied for a regular card and a credit limit increase, but I got declined so I opened the Cap 1 account, and started with a credit limit of I think $1000.  It was low, but I was just excited I got approved.  I kept doing what I was doing, paying off both my cards every month and also I had started learning about usage ratios from you fine folks, so I kept things at 30% or less.  Then I got a credit card offer from Discover in Dec 2014, and I took advantage of that offer to get a card with a measly $600 credit limit. 

The story is kind of boring around here.  I just kept using my cards a little and paying them off in full every month.  One day capital one increased my limit to $3000.  Later they increased to $6000 and upgraded me to the quiksilver card.  Discover increased me to $2200.  Plus the advantage to both of those cards is that they offer free credit scores so I had those to compare to Credit Karma. Things were looking up!  I had disputed almost all of the collections off my report except one medical collection that was due to fall off in March 2016.  Well Christmas came early, and in January the medical collection fell off my report.  I now have zero derogatory accounts on my credit limit.  

I knew things were getting better, and so in anticipation of getting a mortgage in 2017, the final thing I did was apply for a new secured personal loan through my credit union.  The reason I went with secured is because I have the cash reserves so I don't mind the cash being on hold and the interest rate is 3.10 so I'll only pay $8 in interest to have the loan for a year and add a different account type to my portfolio.  I applied online last night, and anxiously waited today to see if I would get approved.  Well this morning I got an email that I was instantly approved for the loan unsecured or secured and that my credit score is 781 through Transunion which is considered A+ at my CU.  I also used the same credit pull to convert my secured card to a regular CC and get an increase to a very reasonable $1000.  

So I want to say a big thank you to R/PersonalFinance for the crash course in credit 101, and helping me to go from feeling irresponsible to a **real adult**.",finance,1454727999

I am getting married (go me!) in July and I would like some advice related to debt and joining our financial lives together. We are both 23 and we both make 50,000$ - 60,000$ a year. I am relatively debt free. I own my car without payments or a loan, I don't have any credit cards, and I am almost done paying off my school loans. I have about 5,000$ left on those. 

My fiance on the other hand has alittle more debt to her name. She has roughly 20,000$ in school loans left and a car loan. Thankfully, no credit card debt. I'm stumped on what to do with the car. 

The car is 2 years old and she bought it new with a loan from the dealership. She got a pretty good interest rate on it at 3%. There is 12,000$ left on that loan. Kelley blue book tells me we could sell it for roughly 9,000 - 10,000$. She doesn't like the car but I don't know if we're ready to sell it, pay off the remainder of the loan, and drop 5,000$ on a used car for her. 

Would it be best to just sell the car before it depreciates even more? Or would it be best for us to just hang onto the car and the loan until they start to even themselves out? What about the school loans? Should we just pay mine off as soon as possible?

Let me get this straight. I claim 0, the option to have THE MOST taxes withheld, and out of the $114k I made, they only held 18902?

Me and all my coworkers live in northern va / dc where you get boned in the ass with $1500-2000 rents and mortgages ~2500.

Long time lurker here, first time poster. I want to hear some advice from you guys!

I'm 23 and I have about 15,000 in my bank account, and as sketchy as this is, about 30,000 in cash that I feel weird depositing in a lump sum (don't worry! I have claimed this on my taxes and have paid my dues!). Currently, the only major debt I have is student loans. I owe about 11,000 in private loans with an interest rate of 10.75% (ugh!), and about 9,000 in federal loans with 4.5% and 6.8% interest rates. I am currently paying between 400-800 between the two of them a month, but every once in a while I will throw in a 1,000 payment to my private loan to get that paid off quicker.

I'm hoping to get these paid off in the next year or so (at least the private loan! that interest rate kills me!) but I don't want to cut too much into my emergency fund, as I am planning on moving across the country in May (from NYC to Seattle) with my boyfriend.

Until then, I am working my butt off at my current jobs to make as much money as I can to save for the move.

I want to hear everyone's advice / experiences!

Legal Fees for Whistleblower and Gun Rights Violation 

My name is Taylor Johnson. I’ve been a Special Agent for over a decade with the Department of Homeland Security, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. 

In 2013, I blew the whistle on high level agency officials and politicians who jeopardized the security of our country for their own personal gain. The core of my whistle blower disclosures revolve around the Agency’s preferential treatment of Chinese, Middle Eastern and other foreign nationals from terrorist countries of interest. I am the agent who was investigating the SLS casino in Las Vegas Nevada under DHS’s E-B5 Visa Program (Green Card for Cash), until high ranking USCIS Directors and Senator Reid’s office made threats of Congressional complaints to my local management.

I was responsible for investigating and indicting suspects for fraud, money laundering and potentially their ties to organized crime and foreign governments related to the EB5 project. While reviewing EB-5 applications for a Las Vegas Casino venture operated by a syndicate controlled by an infamous nightclub and casino operator, I identified national security threats justifying denial or further investigation of EB-5 applicants, the regional center and the US investors. My findings caused problems for the investor syndicate, who was represented by Senator Harry Reid’s son, Rory Reid. 

The Director of USCIS at the time, Alejandro Mayorkas, pressured USCIS employees and later agents, after he gained control of DHS investigative branch, ignoring EB-5 regulations and endangering the general public. The Office of the Inspector General in a March 2015 report, sighted specific examples of favorable treatment and ethics violations related to mine and two other EB-5 regional centers, each Regional Center was and is connected to high ranking officials and politicians. Mr. Mayorkas routinely met with Senator Reid’s office regarding the EB-5 program and now these very same EB-5 applicants and US investors are giving a significant amount of money to specific political parties. As I testified to Congress in June of 2015, these EB-5 visa applicants who paid $500,000 for their green cards, came into the United States, and were approved in as little as 16 days, with little to no background investigation from Russia, Pakistan, Malaysia and China. 

Not only are some of these applicants making considerable contributions to certain party member’s private charities, but they are also making them directly into political campaign funds. More recently, it has been discovered that some of these applicants, have now committed crimes against U.S. citizens and had previously committed crimes prior to leaving their own countries. The EB-5 program is being badly abused and will ultimately hurt the U.S. economy, in addition to creating a gateway for criminals and terrorist to enter and remain in the US. 

The Office of Inspector General initiated an investigation into these issues and unequivocally found that Mr. Mayorkas violated the law and personally benefited by granting special favors to investors and politicians. Certain members of congress with the help of my agency (DHS) and its management, have allowed this to continue to gain promotions and millions of dollars from lobbyists and private companies. Knowing further abuse of this program will come at the expense of American Businesses and public safety, it still continues. Over 30 million dollars was recently spend by Manhattan Real-estate lobbyist to keep the EB-5 pilot program operating for just 10 months. The EB-5 program was not originally designed to help the wealthy get wealthier, it was designed to assist with employment and small businesses in the U.S. 

This program as it’s currently being overseen is helping large firms get a discount to create bars, casinos and other disruptive projects that make law enforcement jobs more difficult, while also making it impossible for the hard working business men/women to compete for contracts. Many of these regional centers and projects are being run by foreigners or citizens with suspect backgrounds, and not the legitimate US business owner. The funding of these projects are thru the EB-5 program (USCIS &amp; State Department) which is primarily promoted overseas in Asian and the Middle East. It’s an outrageous loophole that criminals and terrorist can easily use if they can produce $500,000 to buy their green cards. 

The Agency retaliated against me for making these disclosures, in addition to showing the links to the politicians and high ranking agency officials involved. Disclosures that myself, the FBI, CIA and the SEC had previously discovered in other similar investigations. I joined after 9-11, to protect the U.S. and provide a better future for my family; I took an oath to uphold the law and protect our borders. With the approval of my chain of command, I opened a criminal investigation into the US investor, the regional center and the EB-5 applicants, because of the potential money laundering found, the ties to organized crime and watch list countries involved. However when my management got complaints from USCIS Directors running the EB-5 program and later Senator Reid’s office, that case was closed and I was put on “super-secret probation,” for an administrative internal investigation. To date, my agency against our firearms policy and our duty to report policy, has violated my due process and constitutional right to bear arms. 

1. The agency overseen by Mayorkas made up charges against me from a 2011 operation conducted 5 year prior to the SLS investigation. These charges are completely untrue and the Office of Special Counsel has acknowledged that fact. The agency after I disclosed corruption, made a false allegation that I had an inappropriate relationship with an informant. They stated I had contacted this informant over 2000 times and produced telephone toll records to support a termination proposal. The telephone number they used was my 50 year old mother and daughters car-pool mother. Both US citizens with absolutely no ties to organized crime or criminal history. They placed both numbers, along with my 10 year old son’s telephone number into a government database as drug cartel informants. This violated 2 US citizens right to privacy and abused a minor child. 

2. The Agency took away my right to use my gun in making arrests. They have violated my right to bear arms at work, where it’s needed most and have placed me in a dangerous situation, in complete violation of the agencies firearms policy. In December, 2015, I was working at the Agency building just blocks away from the San Bernardino terrorist attack. I remained unarmed throughout the event, unable to properly protect myself or others. I continue daily to work in one of the highest homicide counties in the US, in a building that houses inmates and where parolees and even the San Bernardino terrorists and accomplices had entered on numerous occasions.

3. I was told I couldn't even carry or own a personal weapon, which is a Second Amendment Constitutional gun rights violation. After being admonished for causing a congressional complaint in 2013, my ASAC and SAC issued a memo stating I couldn’t carry a government or personal weapon on or off duty. Even after the agencies false allegation had been acknowledged by the Office of Special Counsel, the agency has still not returned my weapon or full duty. 

4. I almost lost my 1-year-old-child during the adoption process because an agent had told CPS I was terminated for a criminal offense, a rumor that had been spread by management to my colleagues. This was entirely untrue. I have not been terminated and I have not committed a criminal offense. In fact, I have received some of the highest awards within my department and there isn’t a single black mark in my employee file. This has been a smear campaign aimed at making me and my family so miserable I quit and give up. The rumors that have been allowed to continue through my management and my executive leadership is malicious and false, making the ability to do my job extremely difficult. It has cause irreparable harm to my reputation and a significant amount of joy and happiness has been stolen from my family and me. 

5. Those involved in this ugly business of false allegations and who have supported the retaliation of a federal agent doing her job, should be fired or held in criminal contempt. Ultimately, my chain of command, has destroyed evidence, obstructed justice and been negligent in their handling of the investigation, all in order to gain favor and promotions. I should not have to sacrifice my life for my livelihood. My management is fully aware of the organized crime members and extended family, who could cause further harm to me and my kids.

My attorneys are wonderful and they are taking this case on a legal fee contingency, meaning they only get paid if they win or settle the case. In this instance, I am only suing to regain my full status and compensation for the financial loss I’ve suffered as a result of the agencies bad behavior. I am responsible for the costs of the case, mostly deposition transcripts and travel. My attorneys estimate that I will need about $30,000 for these costs. My attorney will maintain a record of the cost associated with this on-going legal battle and any remaining funds will be directed back to others in need at GoFundMe. 

I have fought this battle against corrupt officials and a monster of an agency, who has unlimited resources on my own for over two years now. I will continue to do my very best to fulfill the oath I took as a federal agent to protect the US and its citizens, but I am at a point where I very much need the help and support from America. The battle I am up against includes lobbyists who throw millions at the EB5 program, my own agency with a surplus of OPLA legal representatives and corrupt politicians who are strongly supported by the current administration. I know that one voice can sometimes change things; we’ve seen it happen throughout history. If the policy surrounding USCIS and my agency don’t change, the US will continue to be vulnerable to terrorist attacks and criminals who wish to exploit America. Thank you all for the support you’ve shown following the Senate Hearing and going forward. My family and I are grateful for the kind words and encouragement.",finance,1454770768
personalfinance,Taxes: Health care costs and unemployment periods,"So I've received all of my tax documents and have filled out everything according to the site I've chosen this year (H&amp;R block is running free federal and state filing) but I've come across an issue I'v never encountered before. I actually owe taxes this year.

Apparently, I was given too much of a discount on my monthly insurance premiums through the Marketplace and I owe $700. I'm wondering how this came to be and if there is anything I can do to alter it. I started a plan in Jan last year where I paid approx $1370 ($114 per month) per year while the gov't covered the remaining $1400($117 per month). It was a more expensive plan but I wanted something that I would actually be able to use for more than just emergencies. I should have gone with a cheaper one though since I ended up not ever using it.

Anyway, I didn't bring in much money last year. I had three main contracts and some side projects and was unemployed, although not on unemployment, for roughly 3 months (April, Aug, Sept). All total I brought in less than 30k. 

I'm not trying to get out of paying taxes if in fact I do owe them, I'm just trying to understand more about how these things are considered and if there is a way for me to lower the amount I owe. I wasn't counting on owing anything this year and it is coming as quite a shock. I was hoping y'all might have some advice.",finance,1454772994

&gt;You know, there is no doubt about what they're doing and who the players are and what they're trying to achieve.

**When she describes the people influencing ""the republicans"" she is describing her self:**

&gt;And, look, these guys play for keeps. **They want to control our country.** They want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer, they could care less about income inequality.

&gt;They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy, and, you know, **[getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to.](http://i.imgur.com/Aw0GdHh.jpg)**

-Hillary Clinton, [Democratic Town Hall, 2/3/2016](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/03/politics/democratic-town-hall-transcript/)

She's also taken money in the past from:

 - The private prison industry 

 - The pharmaceutical industry

 - A slew of different banks that played roles in the financial collapse

I'd also like people to take into account the influence the president has over the SEC and other federal regulatory commissions who are responsible for going after businesses that violate the law. The president picks the people who head many of these regulatory commissions. 

When Goldman Sachs was charged with lying to investors by the SEC no one went to jail, instead they paid a fine and continued to live lavish lives and turn record profits. 

&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and one of its vice presidents for defrauding investors by misstating and omitting key facts about a financial product tied to subprime mortgages

https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-59.htm

Billionaires pay fines for destroying the economy, then they get to make record profits. Meanwhile if you and me get caught with a few grams of marijuana we get a criminal record and may never repair our lives. 

Sure Clinton will regulate these industries, she'll also let them know they're in an environment where if they screw over millions of people they can just pay a fine and continue to rake in billions in profits.

Finally, I'd like to point out that **in most other industries including major news media, commentators are not allowed to take speaking fees:**


&gt;At NBC, there’s a rule that if anchors give a paid speech to a for-profit enterprise — the kind they may be covering in their role as journalists — they have to give the money they receive to charity. It’s not a secret rule. It’s been in place for nearly 20 years to prevent conflicts of interest.

http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/13/msnbcs-joe-scarborough-is-he-violating-a-network-rule/

If you think the fact that Hillary takes money from these industries is irrelevant you are not reading the writing on the walls, you are disagreeing with the mainstream and aligning your self with the fringe. 

You have to distort your reality to not realize taking money from the sector you're regulating represents a huge conflict of interest.",finance,1454774285
personalfinance,Computer Engineering debt-possible to pay off?,"Hi all

My boyfriend is getting a Masters in Computer Engineering--he has $150K private debt (variable interest) and $175K federal debt. I don't know the terms (he hasn't told me) and around $10K credit card debt. He makes around $75K a year now before completing his degree. I don't work in the tech field--is paying off this amount possible? I've never heard of $325K in debt except for doctors. It is almost frightening to me. Thanks.


UPDATE:: A commentor below asked for both our financial pictures (basically). Here it is.

Me:(27 y/o F)

After tax earnings/month: $3000-4000 (depends on overtime, etc)

Emergency savings: $5000  

1 checking account (bills only): consistent $2000 balance to cover bills

2nd checking (play money): I only allow $300-$500 per paycheck to cover eating out/etc.

Credit card debt: $2500-on 0% interest until July-paying down around $650-800 per month. No other debt. No car, no student loans (worked 2 jobs throughout school to graduate debt free)

ROTH IRA: $30000- I deposit $5500 each January for max benefit

Company 401K: ~ $8000 (I contribute 4-6% but max the company benefit of 4% match)-I have been working for less than 2 years.

Boyfriend:(32 y/o M)

$4000- monthly take home after taxes

$155000 private loans (variable interest)

$180000 federal loans

$10000 credit card debt

~ $10000 401K


No savings that I know of. 

Jointly we would make around $7000-8000 per month. This assumes I would support us while he uses all his money towards his debt. I'm assuming no vacations, cars, house, and probably no kids....I know I'm in for difficult decisions ahead, but I feel guilty for wanting more, but also angry and hurt that I am in this position. It feels brutal to me so I cannot even imagine how he really feels. It feels devastating.

Debs, received 6 percent of the popular vote before becoming a political prisoner for a speech that encouraged draft dodging a war of profiteering. This was their platform.","Mostly seems like things we enjoy today and take for granted, or wish we had today.

None of it seems to ""radical"", besides the collective ownership of distribution and their wish for an almost horizontal government.

List below, with some of what we have today in bold.  
There's some I missed or are wishy-washy, like how we once had the inheritance tax but it was recently removed. We also have municipal ownership in some states, but not others, so I didn't bold those.


**Collective Ownership**

*    The collective ownership and democratic management of railroads, wire and wireless telegraphs and telephones, express service, steamboat lines, and all other social means of transportation and communication and of all large scale industries.
*    The immediate acquirement by the municipalities, the states or the federal government of all grain elevators, stock yards, storage warehouses, and other distributing agencies, in order to reduce the present extortionate cost of living.
*    The extension of the public domain to include mines, quarries, oil wells, forests and water power.
*    The further conservation and development of natural resources for the use and benefit of all the people . . .
*    The collective ownership of land wherever practicable, and in cases where such ownership is impracticable, the appropriation by taxation of the annual rental value of all the land held for speculation and exploitation.
*    The collective ownership and democratic management of the banking and currency system.

**Unemployment**

*   The immediate government relief of the unemployed by the extension of all useful public works. All persons employed on such works to be engaged directly by the government under a work day of not more than eight hours and at not less than the prevailing union wages.
*    The government also to establish employment bureaus; to lend money to states and municipalities without interest for the purpose of carrying on public works, and to take such other measures within its power as will lessen the widespread misery of the workers caused by the misrule of the capitalist class.

**Industrial Demands**

*    The conservation of human resources, particularly of the lives and well-being of the workers and their families:
*    **By shortening the work day in keeping with the increased productiveness of machinery.**
*    **By securing for every worker a rest period of not less than a day and a half in each week.**
*    **By securing a more effective inspection of workshops, factories and mines.**
*    **By the forbidding the employment of children under sixteen years of age.**
*    By the co-operative organization of the industries in the federal penitentiaries for the benefit of the convicts and their dependents.
*    **By forbidding the interstate transportation of the products of child labor, of convict labor and of all uninspected factories and mines.**
*    By abolishing the profit system in government work and substituting either the direct hire of labor or the awarding of contracts to co-operative groups of workers.
*    **By establishing minimum wage scales.**
*    **By abolishing official charity and substituting a non-contributary system of old age pensions, a general system of insurance by the State of all its members against unemployment and invalidism and a system of compulsory insurance by employers of their workers, without cost to the latter, against industrial diseases, accidents and death.**

**Political Demands**

*    The absolute freedom of press, speech and assemblage.
*    **The adoption of a graduated income tax** and the extension of inheritance taxes, graduated in proportion to the value of the estate and to nearness of kin-the proceeds of these taxes to be employed in the socialization of industry.
*    The abolition of the monopoly ownership of patents and the substitution of collective ownership, with direct rewards to inventors by premiums or royalties.
*    Unrestricted and equal suffrage for men and women.
*    The adoption of the initiative, referendum and recall and of proportional representation, nationally as well as locally.
*    The abolition of the Senate and of the veto power of the President.
*    The election of the President and Vice-President by direct vote of the people.
*    The abolition of the power usurped by the Supreme Court of the United States to pass upon the constitutionality of the legislation enacted by Congress. National laws to be repealed only by act of Congress or by a referendum vote of the whole people.
*    Abolition of the present restrictions upon the amendment of the Constitution, so that instrument may be made amendable by a majority of the voters in a majority of the States.
*    The granting of the right of suffrage in the District of Columbia with representation in Congress and a democratic form of municipal government for purely local affairs.
*    The extension of democratic government to all United States territory.
*    **The enactment of further measures for the conservation of health. The creation of an independent bureau of health, with such restrictions as will secure full liberty to all schools of practice.**
*    **The enactment of further measures for general education and particularly for vocational education in useful pursuits. The Bureau of Education to be made a department.**
*    **The separation of the present Bureau of Labor from the Department of Commerce and Labor and its elevation to the rank of a department.**
*    Abolition of an federal districts courts and the United States circuit court of appeals. State courts to have jurisdiction in all cases arising between citizens of several states and foreign corporations. The election of all judges for short terms.
*    The immediate curbing of the power of the courts to issue injunctions.
*    The free administration of the law.
*    The calling of a convention for the revision of the constitution of the U. S.

I'm not for total worker ownership myself, but we've definitely gone way too far in the other direction and toward oligarchy - the oligarchs being those with the most capital in our capitalist centered system.  
90% of their initial proposals largely seem like a pretty sane middle ground between capitalism and socialism even though they considered it the ""first step to worker control"", which I think is what scares a lot of people.

I had come back today to see what progress she had made, turns out that they had figured everything out but wanted $380 to file my taxes!

So here's my question to you, beforehand when I was attempting to file my own taxes I hadcome up with the following numbers. Compared to H&amp;R Block's numbers mine are VERY close. Would it be safe to save the $300~ difference between filing online vs. their outrageous pricing?

The difference in returns is as follows:

•Federal Return: H&amp;R Block (+8) |  Turbotax (+24) = $16 difference

•State Return (MO): H&amp;R Block (+71) | Turbotax (+74) = $3 difference

•State Return (NY): H&amp;R Block (owe $369) | Turbotax (owe $367) = $2 difference


Would they really hunt me down for dollar amounts this small?

edit: Okay, so now H&amp;R Block is saying that they were playing around with the numbers and instead of owing NY $369 they're saying I will now get back $185 which seems fishy. I'm unsure what to do...

personalfinance,"First Time as 1099, Confused about quarterly taxes","Hello, I have been reading around a lot, and haven't been able to find some answers, so sorry if this isn't appropriate to post here.

This is my first time as a 1099 (started January 2016) and I didn't work last year (2015) so I don't have a 1/4 of 90% of last year's tax estimate to go off of to pay quarterlies. I will probably not be working the entire year/income will fluctuate, so I don't know how to estimate a yearly income. However, I estimate I will probably make around 20-30k total, so not that much. I live and work in Rhode Island (temporarily?) if that makes a difference.

1. For the quarterly tax should I just pay 25-30% of what I made during that quarter, since I don't know what my yearly income will be?
2. From my understanding, as 1099 I have three taxes I need to pay: FICA, federal, and state. Do I only need to pay FICA quarterly, or federal and state as well?
3. Do I send payment for state taxes to the IRS or to a different place?
4. If I pay quarterly, but end up underpaying, and I pay the rest at the end of the year, is there still a penalty? On the flip side, if I overpay, do I get a refund at the end of the year?
5. Since I'm not a business per-se, my schedule c deductions will probably only come up to around $100, should I buy more things to increase my deductions, or does it not really matter?

Again, sorry if these are simple questions, I'm very new at taxes in general. Thanks a bunch for your time!",finance,1454780580
personalfinance,Renting in a HCOLA. How does this plan sound?,"In the process of getting my financial house in order.  I would like a review of my current plan for housing. 

I live in Irvine, CA. 

I share an apartment with a good family friend.  My portion of rent is 29% of my take home pay.  I don’t own a car. I walk to work. My transportation cost run between 5 and 10% of my take home pay per month.  

I have 24K in student, medical and CC debt to pay down with an interest rate no higher than 6.5%. 

I’m currently saving 13.75% of my gross salary for retirement. I’m 29 years old.  

What would you do to improve my housing situation if you were in my shoes? If I move to another part of the city, I lose the flexibility to walk to work which would increase transportation costs and additional time commuting.  I feel I would be trading paying increased rent for increased transportation costs.  

I really do not enjoy driving at all or commuting via driving.  

Everyone says I’m throwing money away renting. I staunchly disagree. Especially in the high cost of living that is Southern California, South Orange County nonetheless.  

A comparable good entry level condo starts around 350-400K with HOAs and roughly 2% property taxes.  Add just property taxes and HOA fees a year and that’s pretty close to what I pay for my portion of the rent. 

Once I’m debt free I’ll consider buying a condo, but it seems money would be better spent renting cheaply and investing more in the stock market via retirement and tax advantaged accounts.  

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I have learned a lot already from this sub. 

Thank you and have an awesome day!",finance,1454780860

Because of you guys I luckily had enough money to cover my community college courses out of pocket, and I was ok when a few days ago I learned that my car needed a $600 repair out of the blue!

Bitcoin,The Bitcoin Lightning Network is intended to work like a digital Hawala network; have we solved the regulation problem?,"Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala

The idea is that once channels have been set up between entities in the network, value can be moved through these channels from one node to another.  This allows two individuals to use the network to route payments.

While I have no problem with that in the slightest, I have not seen a discussion about how businesses can participate given the regulations around Money Service Businesses and Money Transmission Businesses.  After all, each node along the route must be willing to transfer value from one party to another.

Hawala networks were banned in many places for this reason, though like Bitcoin they are distributed and autonomous, so effectiveness of such bans is pretty hard to determine.   The Lightning Network though must recruit a wide range of participants to work as a decentralized autonomous agent for Bitcoin transactions.

I am a big fan of lightning networks.  But I can't be the only one that is a little worried about the potential for a regulation problem.  Hopefully there is an easy answer.

personalfinance,"27 years old, single in NYC, making 200k/year, close to paying off my student loans--now what?","So, right off the bat: I get that I'm in a fortunate position. I hope some of my choices and missteps are helpful to others out there and I hope that some of the bright people here can give me a little guidance going forward (I already owe a bit of thanks to the community from lurking).


Here is my situation: I graduated from law school in Spring 2014 with 120k of debt; a lot to be sure, but considerably less than a lot of my classmates. I was lucky enough that my mother's house was paid off and so she took out a 120k line of credit that I would begin paying off as soon as I started work. I traded my 5-6% interest rate with the feds for 1.9% for a year and then prime afterwards. Fast forward 20 months, and I'm down to 23k on those loans after putting about 4k a month towards the loans and putting my entire bonus towards it each year. I expect to have them paid off by August. 


I know it's not entirely rational to have paid off such low interest loans in such a hurry, but there is really something I find invaluable about the peace of mind that comes with being free from student loans (especially when it's my mother I'm indebted to). 

So come August, here I will be: debt-free, making 200k, paying 2500, in rent and having no real expenses aside from that (a lot of my meals are expensed when I'm working late). Assume I'm starting with just a small emergency savings of about 6k. So what should I do? 


* I'm willing to take some risks with investments, but I'm sort of at a loss on where to begin. 
* Maxing out my 401k seems like a prudent move, even if my employer doesn't match at all--I'll be honest, I won't really miss the 18k a year after departing from 4k/month for 2 years. 
* ETFs and other pooled investments? 
* I don't plan on staying in New York more than a few years and eventually hope to return to Florida. How much in savings is really too much to have tied up in anticipating a down payment a few years down the road?

personalfinance,"$20,000 left in student loans at 5% interest rate -- should I take out an auto equity loan at 2% to help pay it off?","Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm a recent engineering grad and I started with $40,000 of student loan debt (at the start of 2015). I've paid off my highest interest (6~6.5%) loans and am left with one remaining $20,000 @ 5% interest. I want to reduce the amount of interest I have to pay so I was looking into various options. I own my car flat out (2011 toyota corolla) and saw that FedChoice credit union will offer auto equity loans starting at 2% apr (https://www.fedchoice.org/loans/clear-title-auto-loan/). 

Overall, my finances are in check (I'm able to put $1k + towards my loans every month, while contributing my max employer match to my 401k) and I have a 12k emergency fund and have good credit (credit score of ~750). I do plan on reducing how much I put into my loans so I can max out a roth IRA each year too now that my higher % loans are payed off. 

I know the auto equity loan won't be enough to fully pay off the student loan, but if I take out a $10,000 auto equity loan and use it towards the student loan, I'd be left with $10k @ 5% and 10k @ 2%. Also, this is assuming I am approved for a 2% loan, if not then my choice would have to be reevaluated. I assume there would be a credit score hit for the loan application too.

Are there any downsides to taking out the auto equity loan in this situation?",finance,1454791549

The interest rates are not that different but I'm not sure if I should allocate more to certain loans or not, it's kind of overwhelming.  Currently, I am doing IBR and my payments are 0, until I have to re-certify next year in January, but I do not anticipate my payments being more than 1k (Standard repayment would be $1,986 per month).  I currently make 42k a year (until July, then I will start another job making ~50k for the next 3 years but my monthly expenses might go up, slightly, but I still want to pay 1k a month).  


I have ~5k in savings.  I am thinking about putting that to pay off one of the 4k loan.

I have family that will protect me in an emergency situation, so I am not too concerned with an emergency fund.  I own nothing besides my car that is 3.5 years old with 38k miles (and a bumper to bumper warranty for another 2 years or 60k miles) and I put money aside each month for maintenance, which is not included in my 5k savings.  
   

I am tempted to put $50 on each of my 14 loans ($700) and then using the remaining $300 to pay extra on the lowest balance loan that way I feel like I am making some dents.  

Or pay $71.42 on all 14 of my loans.

I have never used financial aid because my parents were always reluctant to provide me with their SS and income information and offered to pay in full. But since I am 24 now I believe I am independent and do not have to use their information. So I *did* work but for a few weeks when I was 24 before I quit. So I have been unemployed and living off my parents since then.

I am a full time college student and I was wondering what I should put on the FAFSA which will grant me the most funds. As I said before I have been unemployed pretty much the whole time I have been 24 except for a couple of weeks before quitting my last job. I have continuously been a full time student though. Now the reason I ask is I have a friend who claims he simply lies throughout the entire application and gets maximum funding. I don't know about that though. I don't know how FAFSA works. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!

Edit: Also, going through the application now it asks whether I am registered in Selective Service System.

I will be getting an apartment this summer that will cost me around $500 a month including utilities and food. I do not own a car and don't plan on getting one anytime soon. 

So, my plan with the student loans: get my savings account up to $5,000 with my next paycheck and use the rest of my paychecks from here until summer towards my student loans and spending money. I will use money from my savings account for the down payment on my apartment and other new home necessitiets. From there, I will get my savings back up to $5,000 and continue to make student loan payments. 

To elaborate on this last point: at 40hrs a week and a wage of $10.00/hr I will be making $1,600/month. Approximately  $500 of that will go for the apartment and $200 for normal spending money which leaves me with $900.

This is not terrible, as I'd still love to have all of my schooling paid for like this, but I'd LOVE to be able to save some of this excess money in case I need it for paying for my Masters, and to pay off a few thousand I have in credit card debt from the last year and a half of schooling (TOUGH science classes, haven't been able to work much).

Anyway, is this normal?? I go to a public university on the West coast, and I've found other stories of [students who had this extra money refunded to them](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3xl1zd/17_years_old_looking_for_a_better_way_to_invest/?) (another [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/136jvr/just_got_a_refund_check_from_my_university_how_do/?) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/35aewz/just_received_a_3000_scholarship_that_will_be/?))? I even found an IRS posting that states that [scholarships are taxable if used for incidental, non-school related expenses](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc421.html), implying that this sort of money is often refunded to students for incidental uses, so how is it that my fin aid office is saying the $$$ can't be refunded to me?

**TL;DR**: Is it normal for public US universities to not allow any amount of any scholarships to be refunded to a student if they're in excess of their year's cost of attendance?",finance,1454816228
personalfinance,"No credit history, looking for answers","Redirected from /r/churning, mods indicated this was a better location. Was looking to start building credit, and hopefully doing so with rewards cards, if i could.

Mainly, I'm looking to learn about:

* Pros/Cons of having zero credit. Details of ""zero credit"" below.
* Rewards cards seem to all have some base line of credit, good or bad. Do offers exist that have no annual fee for someone with zero credit?
* My current bank mailed me an application for a credit card. No annual fee, interest rate is inconsequential; I never plan on carrying a balance. Ever. Do I take up this offer just to get *some* credit, any credit at all to qualify for the better cards? Am I guaranteed acceptance if they mailed me?

What I mean by ""Zero credit"":

* I've owned a savings and a checking account at each of the 2 banks I've used in my life. One, then the other, not concurrent. 
* I've also opened a single CD a couple months ago for a couple thousand dollars.
* Never attempted opening a credit card before.
* Payed for half of college tuition and associated college cost of living ($40k-50k roughly). Saved up money over time with job, and paid my parents for tuition every other semester. No matter who ""paid"" it went through them. So this is not on my financial record (But would it matter?)

personalfinance,recommendation for self-filing taxes?,"OK, so I'm thinking about self-filing taxes for the first time.


Nothing too complex....single, filing individually, in my early to mid 20's, living in a state with no income tax:
- I have capital losses (from stocks/options) piled up that I will be using for a while going forward
- income came from being a contractor/self-employed individual

I have 2 different priorities.

1. I had &lt; $40K in AGI as a sole proprietor/contractor in 2015; I need to pay federal and self-employment taxes on this income. I didn't pay anything out quarterly because I had no tax liability in 2014, which excluded me from having to pay quarterly. What's the best way to file this one? I read online there are some free ways to do it since my AGI was so low? Will I have to pick the paid version of H&amp;R Block or TaxAct because I'm a contractor/self-employed or can i go through the free version?


2. For 2016, I will need to pay my taxes on a quarterly basis (I assume this means both federal and self-employment ones). What's the best way to do this? Should I use any of the online tax software sites or are those only intended for the one-time annual tax payments as opposed to self-employed people paying quarterly? Estimated AGI for this year will be over $80K as a contractor (last year's was low because I started in August).

Up until now, I've been using my parents' accountant. She's not too expensive, but I think given the increasing complexity of my situation, I'd like to handle it on my own for once just to see.

personalfinance,Moving Emergency Fund to 3% interest bearing account at Lake Michigan Credit Union (LMCU),"I recently found that that Lake Michigan Credit Union (LMCU) has a checking account offering 3% interest on balances up to $15,000, so long as you jump through certain hoops.  Research online seems to suggest that this is legitimate and that the requirements are not hard to meet.  The requirements and simple ways to meet them are as follows:

1) Direct Deposit to the account once a month.  It turns out that you can simply schedule an ACH transfer from your own bank to the LMCU account.  I would just schedule a token monthly transfer of funds into my LMCU account.

2) Make ten (10) debit card transactions in a month.  This can be accomplished through purchasing 10 amazon.com gift cards at 50 cents each (a total of $5 a month).  I would have this automated by using the ""amazon"" allowance feature, which allows me to have my debit card be automatically charged, once a day, for the first 10 days of the month.

3) Login to the LMCU account 4 times a month.  This can be accomplished by simply linking my LMCU account to my Mint account.  I already check my Mint account once per day, so this would not be an issue.

4) Sign up for e-statements.  No problems there.

The only other issue is that to get a LMCU checking account requires a hard credit pull, which is done on your transunion report.

I haven't pulled the trigger on opening this account yet, but can anyone see any reason why I shouldn't move my emergency funds (which currently sit in a Capital one 360 account earning 0.75% interest).  The requirements seem easy enough to meet, reviews are positive.  Only issue is that hard credit pull, of course.

I am single and plan on having roommates in potential house, which would help pay some of the expenses. However, I'm not sure I will qualify because of my student loan debt. Here are my numbers:

* Salary $45,500/year with about $1000 increase each year. I'm a high school teacher and have been at the same school for 6 years. This raise pattern has been consistent. I also receive a few small stipends each year.

* Monthly pre-tax: $3,750

* Total student loan debt: around $65,000. Minimum payments each month: $830. 

* Credit card debt: $0  

* Car lease payment: $315/month, ending in July. I plan on buying the car at the end of the lease, since it seems to be the best bet financially. 

* FICO score: 790.

* Amount in savings: around $4,000 

Housing in my area is inexpensive, thankfully. Ideally, I'd qualify for a $100,000 loan. I do qualify for some Down Payment Assistance grants because I'm a teacher.

I got lucky this year and pay $300/month for rent and utilities, because I live with a family in their back room. If I were to rent an apartment, I would have to pay at least $600/month plus utilities. That's why I'm hoping to buy a house. Rent prices are so high when compared to the cost of a mortgage and such.

So, I've been bad with money in the past, but my new years resolution was to achieve financial security and move out of my grandparents house by the end of the year, but really I'd like to do it by the end of this semester (approx 3 months away). 

Right now, I have $265 physical cash to my name. I am expecting roughly $700 from my federal tax refund this year, and have an additional $700 squirreled away from last year's return. It is possible that I might get a bit of money from my dad to help me start out, but I'm not banking on it. My grandparents have also agreed to help me furnish a new place, and provide basic household items and appliances. 

I work full time. My first job is at a lumber yard, I make $201 per week (yes we are paid weekly) after taxes. My second job is as a workstudy, I make about $200 every two weeks from that. So I make roughly $1,200 monthly. 

Right now I spend about $50 on gas each week, but I spend about an hour on the road everyday driving from work to class. Just about everything else is paid for by my grandparents, including my truck insurance (My grandfather doesn't know how much he pays on my insurance, but he knows it's less than $200/month). My grandfather has agreed to keep my truck on his insurance and let me pay him the money until I turn 25. 

Where I live, you can rent a slightly dilapidated house for about $250/month, utilities not included. That is on the low end, and I'm not sure how much the apartments go for, but nicer houses and trailers go for $500/month. 

I am planning on switching jobs soon, which will come with a pay increase, but not a big one. I'll know more about that in a week or two. 

Also, I have a $500 debt to a local hospital, and another debt to a national gym chain which may at this point exceed $1,000. I really need to check on that, I know. To play it safe, let's assume $2,000 debt. 

So, now that I've typed it all out, moving out in 3 months sounds maybe possible, but unrealistic. End of year is fine, but really the sooner the better.

I've always been good at paying down my debts, but this is a bit daunting.  My income in Las Vegas is 77K before taxes, and I have a family (six kids under 11 and a stay at home wife).    My wife and I have recently had the discussion as to whether to aggressively pay off the student loan debt or sink it into retirement (of which we have about 11K).  And on top of this, there is pressure to do things like piano lessons and other personally enriching things for the kids.  I hate the thought of not being able to do all three- it just feels like I'm losing.  Having said all this, we know we need to start with several months of savings, and since the stock market seems to be tanking, I'm not too anxious to invest (although at 38 years old, I know I need to build the retirement more aggressively).  With the size of my family, the IBR is approximately 190$ per month.  If I went public sector as an Occupational Therapist, I could get the loans forgiven after ten years at the VA, versus the standard payment being about 807$ per month.

I stumbled upon Dogecoin a few months ago while researching cryptocurrency.  I saw the Jamaican Bobsled Team, Doge 4 Water, and the Dogecoin NASCAR.  Needless to say, I was very impressed.  The community's tomfoolery was only matched by its sincere generosity.  These charitable hijinks, along with the community's upbeat and positive attitude, really set Dogecoin apart from a lot of other cryptocurrencies.

Obviously, like any rational thinking human being, I immediately exchanged my Federal Reserve Notes for millions of Dogecoins.  Now all I had to do was sit back, get ready for my trip to the moon, and wait for the Dogecoin to overtake the archaic, decrepit, and obsolete U.S Dollar.

Not too much time passed before I happened upon some Dogecoin propaganda posters.  It was at that moment I realized I wasn't really helping the Dogecoin community by simply hording Dogecoin.  The posters got me thinking: “What can I do to help take Dogecoin to the moon?”  

By my reasoning, the best thing for Dogecoin would be if more people started accepting it for goods and services.  Considering this, I decided start a business that accepts only Dogecoin.  The product combines the charm and allure of hording precious metals, target shooting, and Atomic Era nostalgia.  I hope the product will be able to draw in new members and boost moral of those already involved!

personalfinance,"Hi all, I'm an 18 year old who wants to become wealthy one day, no matter what. I currently have one problem, my family.","**the sentences I bolded are the things I *really* want adressed.**

Well-actually a few problems, but family is a big one. Okay, where do I begin, I'm a student at college right now who's going to major into business. My dream, to be quite honest with you, is to become a business owner one day and make the money I desire. Regardless, I have a long way to go from now, but I'm happy and I feel blessed to have this mindset at a very young age. Every since I graduated high school last year, I've pretty much dropped most of my friends (exception of very close ones), my social life, and I have been grinding at my current $8.50/hour (under the table) job plus selling on eBay to save up some money. This is the first day in a while I've had free time for myself, and I hate it, I feel like every hour that passes by is a wasted one, because on my free time I keep on educating myself on finance, banking, and business. I'm making the most of it right now and seeking financial advice from Reddit, because not one article or video I see will address all my problems expect for this tread I'm creating, and I really appreciate all the replies I might get to help me through the stepping stones. As of right now, I live with my family and we're considered a low/middle class family. And the reason I say low/middle is because on paper, we're considered poor, but the lifestyle I have feels middleclass, all because my family isn't the type to keep all their money in a bank account, and I hate that. I've done plenty of homework before I turned 18, and I'm planning ahead to what I want to accomplish. Now that I'm 18, I decided to open up a college checking account on my own, this account has no monthly maitance fee for up to 5 years, which is a huge upside for me. After I saved a good amount of money, I'm planning to put a chunk in a savings account at a separate bank. The reason why is because I want to find a good bank that has high interest rate for savings. Not only this, but transferring money from checking to savings will stop me from the temptation of spending it, considering it'll most likely be a pending transaction going to a different bank. 


Now for the problem, my family. After I made my account, I told my dad about it, and he went insane (which I didn't find surprising, I only deposited $250, and I have another $1,000 right now on the side). He doesn't want me to put any more money into my bank account, which I found insane. His reason was because **if ""they"" find out about my money in my account, they will apparently take away my medicate.** Another one of his reason was because **I'm getting paid under the table, so the IRS will be questioning from where I got the money, right?** I doubted that reason, but I do appreciate answers. Unless I'm depositing/withdrawing 10k or more from the bank account, the IRS shouldn't care. But then it just leads to more things I keep questioning myself, like **what will happen if the money I keep on depositing adds up to 10k or more while I'm still getting paid under the table and selling on ebay?** To make it easier, I work at a gas station, so THAT job and ebay are currently my 2 source of income. And soon, my financial aid refund will by my 3rd source. **Honestly, I just want to feel safe depositing my income without any government problems** and my dad is pursuing me to a direction I don't want to take in life. I don't want to live off foodstamps and welfare money, I want to make something of myself and be very successful, but my dad scuffs at me when I say that because he doesn't believe I'm capable of making it one day. Honestly, he gets me depressed and ironically motivates me more to work harder, try to make my soul worth something, and then rub it all in his face after I proved him wrong. All this currency thing, capitalism, how money works, where it comes from, all that scares the shit out of me, because the most obvious path to success is the one where you see this world in a different perspective. I'm by no means trying to be the next Rothschild family, but I just want to be financially free. Regardless, after all these thoughts, I'm still as clueless as ever to know how I'm going to make it, and I still keep having problems. From privacy of my mail (I'm opening a PO Box soon or **planning to move out, good idea?**), to my mom and ask asking for money every week, I just want to make my life worth something.

Some questions I still need clear answers for
**1. Theoretically, who can touch the money of my bank account other than me?**
**2. Should I put the rest of my money, like a grand, on my account? **
**3. How long can I keep putting my current income in my bank until IRS or Medicate or someone notices this.**
**4. What do I do if they notice? Just file for tax and put self employment? Or will self employment get me taxed more?** 
**5. If I theoretically ""won the lottery"" tomorrow, will my parents know about it? I have paperless statements if that helps. So no mail from bank will come, or from anywhere, right?**",finance,1454912061

personalfinance,Social Security and Medicare erroneously withheld during internship from non-resident alien on F-1 Visa,"I'm a grad student on F-1 Visa in the USA. In 2015, I did a summer internship with a reputed Bay Area employer. I got my W-2 yesterday, and I was dismayed to find that social security and medicare had been withheld from my salary, even though F-1 visa holders are not required to pay it (for the first 5 years they are here). This assertion follows from this [link](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Foreign-Student-Liability-for-Social-Security-and-Medicare-Taxes), from which I'm quoting the following:

&gt; As discussed above, this means that foreign students in F-1, J-1, M-1, Q-1 or Q-2 nonimmigrant status who have been in the United States less than 5 calendar years are still NONRESIDENT ALIENS and are still exempt from social security/Medicare taxes.

So, in summary, my employer goofed up, and sadly I didn't look at my pay-stubs closely enough to catch it then. 

So, what are my recourses here? It seems that I can ask for a refund from the company itself, or ask IRS for a refund. Which of the two would you suggest? Here's an additional information - I'm going to intern at this company again this summer, which may/may not blossom into an offer later on. So, I'd certainly not like to antagonize the HR department. But, the amount in question is large enough for 2 months of rent - as a student, its hard to simply let go of that.

Please advise if I'm overthinking this! I'd also appreciate any input on whether the process of getting the refund from IRS is very time consuming or not.",finance,1454915321

investing,Four reasons the January jobs report is fishy,"Private education
The government said so-called private educational services eliminated 29,000 jobs — an unusually high number for a category of work that rarely gets any mention.
Some economists wonder if new federal rule changes cracking down on for-profit institutions triggered the decline. The Labor Department blamed higher than normal seasonal layoffs.
Whatever the case, the jobs report would have met Wall Street expectations for a 180,000 gain absent the odd decline in private-education employment.
Manufacturing mojo?
By virtually all accounts, U.S. manufacturers are struggling to grow amid a decline in exports and a big drop in demand among energy producers. Yet the industry supposedly added 29,000 new jobs in January to mark the biggest gain in 14 months.
Believable? Many economists are skeptical. And even if the job increases are real, some predict hiring will slow again next month. After all, manufacturers only added 33,000 jobs all of 2015.
White-collar woes
Businesses and professional firms that employ white-collar workers added only 9,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain in more than two years.

Quite a comedown for a segment of the economy that has led the way in job creation during the recovery. These jobs increased by an average of 52,000 a month in 2015.

The poor performance can be blamed on a sharp decline in temp jobs after the end of the holiday season — they fell 25,000 last month. But it was still a surprisingly weak number that will raise eyebrows if it persists.
Retailer rebound
Retailers didn’t add as many workers as expected for the holiday season. No surprise. Sales at most traditional retailers such as Macy’s M, -1.18%   have been surprisingly soft as consumers save up or seek better deals online.

So how to explain a whopping 58,000 gain in January that led all industries? That was the biggest gain in almost four years. Even more surprising, department stores added the most new jobs in the retail sector: 15,000. The last time they hired that many people was at the end of 2013.

Every so often a monthly employment report is full of so many irregularities that it pays to discount the report. This might be one of those times.

Previous Thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/43vp6w/i_am_about_to_close_on_my_first_house_small_house/
&lt;/edit&gt;

The Estimate:  
http://imgur.com/a/Qp6vE

Additional Background: My wife and I have a contract-for-deed with our current home and the contract is almost up and we are looking to buy. We've had really no problems with the home for the last 4 years. Our credit history is 700-750, closer to 750.

The ""update"" to the post is as follows...  
I asked my loan officer the following questions:

* Why is a 5 year loan suggested? Could we possibly explore a 15 year loan with a lower interest rate?

* 4.9% interest rate - why this interest rate? After a little research, this seems kinda high for a 5 year loan when our credit is decent.

* At the end of the 5 years, the loan estimate says the balloon payment of $49k is due. You told us not to worry about it. Why were we not supposed to worry about it?

* About the escrow account...It kind of seems like we're being charged twice? We have to pay home insurance and property taxes up front into an escrow account, which is section G. But then it seems we are being charged for another 6 months of homeowner's insurance and property taxes in section F. Are we reading that right?

Here was his response:

1. Your home is considered a non-traditional home and would be very difficult to get appraised high enough to qualify for a secondary market loan.  Therefore, this loan is to be kept as an “In-house” mortgage and we offer these loans with a 5- or 7-year balloon loan. 

2. 4.95% is the best rate that we offer for an in-house, residential, real estate loan.  The reason for this is that we hold all of the risk in the loan and, therefore, have the loans priced with this risk in mind.  The standard rate for a loan like yours is 5.25%, but it was reduced based on your credit history.

3. At the 5-year balloon, we will do a mortgage modification for the remaining balance.  You will not be expected to come up with the cash for the balloon payment. 

4. I do not have a copy of the escrow statement in front of me, but I will explain the basic premise of escrow and how it is calculated.

a. The Early Disclosure form is regulated by the government and the layout and contents of it are not controlled by the bank.  I believe that Section F is a detail of “prepaid” expenses which are typically items that you are currently paying on your own; i.e. taxes and insurance. 

b. You are required to pay for your first-year homeowners insurance up-front. 

c. Your starting balance of your escrow account is determined by the first payment due date and the dates that the bills are to be paid.  We are to maintain a two-month cushion in the account at all times.

i. In this case, your first mortgage payment will be April 1.  Your 1st half property tax payment is due in May.  Your escrow account needs to start with seven months’ worth of tax in the account so that it can be paid in May and still maintain the proper cushion.   As for insurance, we will make your payment next year in the month before it is due.  This means that we need to make a full payment in January of 2017.  Your escrow account will start with four months’ worth of insurance escrow to cover this February and March, which have no payments, and also account for the two-month cushion. 

d. Escrow causes the most confusion for both the customer and the lender.  The disclosure forms we use are constantly amended to make the information more understandable to the consumer.  Unfortunately, these changes have done nothing but further confuse an already complex process.

To elaborate on the ""non-traditional"" aspect of the home, it's a fairly normal home but the non-traditional part is that one of the walls is a shared common wall with a business next door.

My wife and I have also been asking multiple mortgage broker's their opinion on the situation and I've only gotten one response so far, but the response was ""at first I thought we could do better than your local bank, but after review of all the details, it actually seems like your bank is giving you a pretty fair deal regarding the circumstances"". If anyone is interested in reading the full response to that mortgage broker, I'd be happy to post it.

Does everything look okay? My wife and I are barely hanging in there trying to understand what we are getting into and getting through all the jargon, so please, any advice that you have, we'd love to hear it!

personalfinance,First steps to homeownership?,"Hey guys,

I've checked out many of the resources in the side bar, read many articles and done some online calculators from them, but still things seem a bit dicey in my mind. Never been too good with accounting and financial jargon, though I'm doing my best to slowly understand everything before making any sort of move. Anyway, on to why I'm here.

My GF and I have been debating back and forth about continuing to rent or making the move to ownership. We make about 100k combined income annually, though I've just started my job recently so my savings for a down payment is slightly lacking. Still, we could easily put together a 10k down payment or so if we do decide to pursue home ownership.

So my question is really about approaching a financial institution to get pre-qualified for a mortgage. Obviously this is step #1 to figuring out if it's worth it for us to buy vs. rent and seeing what we can afford according to a bank. I've done some calculators online to get estimates - but really - what is the best bank to approach about this? I'm really looking for advice from other experiences, I know that every situation will be different and banks in different places will be different. But do we approach a big bank like Wells Fargo? Do we go to a bank that we currently have a checking/savings account with? Or do we go to a local credit union?

I suspect the answer is 'all of the above' to figure out who will give us the best deal, but even then what constitutes the best? The intersection of the lowest interest rate with highest offer for our needs? I'm really just looking for a place to start and get my bearings with this monumental decision looming in front of us.

personalfinance,Liquidating stocks to pay off tax &amp; CC debt?,"Some basics about our situation, though I'm sure I'm going to miss some pertinent detail(s):

- Married, no kids (yet). I'm 30, the wife is 33. I have ~$8k in a company, non-matching, 401K. The wife is public school teacher paying into a pension plan.
- I have a securities (stocks only) account worth $26,500. Not performing well at all the past couple years. MAYBE 3%-5% per year. In fact, it's lost about $6k in value over the past six months. Invested in pharmaceuticals &amp; oil. I didn't pick these stocks, our family has used the same advisor for years and I believe these were his picks.
- The wife is getting a savings account distribution from her old employer in the next month or so, worth about $4k.
- Net monthly household employment income of $4,280. The wife just started teaching this year, and took a bit of a pay cut to do it. Should increase by $400/month in August this year. I own a condo which I'm renting out. Condo pays for itself, but I don't draw any income off it.
- House mortgage is $1,557/month. Utilities, HOA, insurance, TV+internet, &amp; car payment are roughly $900/month.
- Combined, mostly from an expensive wedding (MISTAKE!), credit card debt of right around $26k. Combined effective interest rate of 19%. Minimum monthly payments are $720.
- I took the First Time Homebuyers tax credit in 2008, of which I owe $5k. Stipulation of that credit was that I would be responsible to pay it all back at one time if the home was no longer my primary residence. Which it is not. So, now I have around $5k to pay in taxes this year.

So we have very little left over at the end of the month to pay anything extra down on the credit cards, let alone put into savings. Best estimate we can come up with, it'll take 5+ years to pay off our CC + tax debt, thus 5+ years before I can feel like I can start really putting anything away for retirement.

I am leaning towards liquidating those stocks &amp; utilizing the wife's savings distribution in order to pay off most of the CC &amp; tax debt, in order to start from scratch. This plan would allow me to start putting away $300/month into my employers 401K, and still allow us to start putting together an emergency fund.

Am I nuts? I hate the thought of not having those stocks as a security blanket, but I feel like we're drowning in these credit cards, living paycheck to paycheck, and making no real dent in paying them off. Please help!",finance,1454948797

personalfinance,Move to California and need financial advice.,"I may be accepting a position in Santa Cruz, Ca in the next month or so. I would love advice on how much to save for retirement, how much to put away for emergencies (medical or unforeseen expenses, etc.) and how much I can spend on entertainment and travel. I will break down my expected salary, taking away Federal and State taxes. From there I will deduct my current bills and foreseeable bills such as rent, etc, so we can get a look at what funds I will really have available to me.

Let’s begin!

Salary is $46,368 for a 9-5 40hr workweek. No overtime will be necessary or asked of me.

1) Taxes-
Federal: I fall into this income tax bracket: 25% ($37,451 to $90,750) which is $11,592 leaves me with $34,776.
State: I fall into this tax bracket: $40,773-$51,530 = a tax of $1,408.24 plus 8.00% of anything over $40,773. So that leaves me with a CA income tax total of $1,855.84. So $34,776 - $1,855.84 = $32,920.16.

(There is also a 7.5% sales tax in CA but I’ll just pretend that doesn't exist in my budget until I move there)

2) RENT-
This one's a doozy. Rental prices in Santa Cruz for a 1 bedroom start at $1,200 for the most meager accommodations. I will likely end up paying 1,500/mo. to have a decent place with a working kitchen and hopefully dedicated parking. So let's just take $1,500x12 away from my 32,920.16 = $14,920.16. Yikes.

3) Insurance-
Since the UC system has excellent benefits, but I am not privy to the exact details yet, let's just ignore them for now and focus on other insurance. 
Car insurance: I pay 71.46/mo. totaling 857.52 yearly. So $14,920.16 - $857.52 = $14,062.64.

4) Phone Bill-
I currently pay 60/mo. In phone bills with T-Mobile, so $60x12 = $720.00. So $14,062.64 - $720 is $13,342.64.

5) Utilities-
Looks like X-finity offers 25mbps for 39.99/mo. Which I think would be enough for streaming movies, playing online games and what not. Rental utilities like electricity and maybe gas or water (depends on the rental agreement) will probably be in the 30-40 dollar range per month. So $40 utilities + $40 cable internet = 80x12 = $960.00. I’m going to round that up to $1,000 just because I feel like this is a conservative estimate. So $13,342.64 - $1,000 is $12,342.64.

6) (Possibly) Savings-
So, all in all, it looks like I will have roughly $12,342 dollars on had per year. I know that a good goal to have is to save 20% of your income each year for retirement, which would be $9,273.60. 
That would leave me with $3,068. Not a whole lot.

So, any advice on where to trim costs? Any advice on how much to put away each year in savings? Any other thoughts? All advice and opinions are appreciated.

These costs could be anywhere from $100,000 to $200,000 overall. By looking at Federal Loan Repayment Plans online, I found that if I qualify for the Pay As You Earn Repayment Plan (PAYE) then my payments each month should be 10% of my annual income and after 20 years my loans are forgiven. My question is this: Why would it matter if I had $100,000 in debt or $1,000,000? My payment will be 10% of my annual income either way. Is this a viable way of paying for law school?

&gt;Interest rate:4.5%

&gt;Original Principal Amount: $4,500

&gt;Current Principal Balance: $3,829.36

&gt;Statement Date: 1/13/2016

&gt;Previous Statement Date: 12/13/2015

&gt;**Accrued Interest on Next Due Date**: $23.11


In my conversation with the representative, the following was sad:

&gt;Her: Interest accrues daily based on your principle balance of each loan and their respective interest rate. So per loan, it's calculated by the following: Current Principle Balance x APR (interest rate) divided by 365.25 times the number of days, we'll say one since that would show what one day of interest looks like per loan.

&gt;Me: OK, I made that calculation myself and got $14.62 (assuming 31 days of interest)

&gt;Her: It's currently about $12.77 per month, about $0.41 per day.

&gt;Me: Then why does my statement say $23.11 

&gt;Her: Depending on the number of days between the payment determines how much interest has accrued

&gt;Me:My last statement was 31 days ago

&gt;Me:The only way to get even close to $23.11 is using 49 days

&gt;Me:That doesn't make sense

&gt;Her: Right, but you've been choosing to pay off certain groups while other groups with advanced due dates haven't been paid as recently as others.

&gt;Me: Excuse me? I pay on time every month and I overpay 

&gt;Me: I am only looking at one loan. All of my other loans have been fully paid off

&gt;Me: Though, now I'm starting to think that I have been overpaying the interest on all of my loans

&gt;Me: I'm open to being wrong, I understand that sometimes these interest calculations can be more complicated than they seem. But I would like an explanation as to why my accrued interest shows up as 1.5x my most liberal calculations

&gt;Her: At this time we show your balance is correct with the interest accruing at the correct amount.

investing,Advise on a 250k Cash Out Refinance,"I own a condo in LA that has more than doubled in value in the last three years with high potential to increase more in the coming years. It is currently being rented out but only making $300/month is profit. With interest rates so low I am thinking about taking a 250k cash out refinance. (Right now I am locked in at a 4% interest rate for the refinance, this is the same interest rate I have for the current mortgage of the place) 

My thoughts on this are: 
I get to free up equity that would be otherwise doing nothing by keeping the condo. I am siding with keeping the condo to see how high the prices will increase in the next few years and a part of me wants to see if I can keep it just in case I move back to LA (the condo is in a very ideal area). With only a 4% rate, I am going to spread the cash in rentals with a better rate of return (right now I am finding places in my area for 150k that will rent out for 1,500/month) and put some of it in stocks which should potentially average 7.5% in the long haul. 

My current situation: 
This is not my primary residence. I have a stable job (so far, never know) which can carry the cost of the refinance with still more to spare.  I also have a safety net of reserve cash currently in stocks and money market. This would be able to carry any cost if I lose my job or renter of the current place for multiple years (knock on wood, this will never happen) I am willing to risk this money for gain.

personalfinance,How best should I utilize a $50k gift with my existing debt?,"I recently received a $50,000 gift from a close elderly friend whom I tend to regularly. He recently liquidated his investments, and wanted to provide me with a nest egg / emergency fund to give my partner and I some security and peace of mind. I feel horribly awkward accepting the gift, but he would not take no for an answer, and I can tell he takes immense pride in being able to do this for us. There are no stipulations on the gift - his advice, as I mentioned, is to put the money away for security - but he wants us to use the money as we see fit. We have told no one about the gift.

Here are our income/debt specifics:

* My partner and I are both 34 years old. We are getting married later this year.
* Combined, we make $115,000 per year (before taxes). 
* We currently owe $121,000 on our house, and would like to sell and buy a new place within the next 2 years. We estimate we have approximately $20,000 in equity.
* I owe $97,000 in private student loans (8.5%), on which my partner is a co-signer. My monthly payment is $860.00. I deferred repayment for 3 years after finishing school, so approximately $18,000 of the balance is from capitalized interest, if that makes a difference.
* I owe $8,300 in federal student loans (5.875%). My monthly payment is $86.00. 
* I have approximately $6,000 in credit card debt.
* We have $9,000 in a Synchrony HY savings account (1.05%).
* We both have good credit (~750 credit scores).
* We are both contributing 8% to our 401k plans. 

My knee-jerk reaction is to make a principal payment for the full $50,000 to my private student loan, as that is my biggest debt payment currently ($890 per month). I'm currently paying double the minimum payment on the credit cards, and will have those paid off within 2 years. 

Is this the most financially sound thing to do? Or would we be better off investing and/or splitting payment up in some way?

In addition, he has given this to us in the form of a personal check, which we have not cashed or deposited yet. I've done some research and understand that he would be responsible for paying a gift tax on the contribution, not us, but is there anything I need to be aware of before depositing this check?

Found a loan through our [credit union](http://www.onpointcu.com/personal/mortgage-loans.html#fees), offering no money down on approved credit, higher interest rate (currently 5.069%), no mortgage insurance necessary and $330K max loan amount. I keep second guessing myself on whether we should go for it or wait.  Our area is a sellers’ market right now and homes in our price range are selling within a few days of listing (unseen even).

Here are the stats:

* combined gross annual income ~$105k
* net take home ~$6300 a month
* Have ~$5,000 saved at the moment
* ~$2210 a month in reoccurring bills (likely will not change anytime soon)
* Food/gas/entertainment $850 (family of three with two cars)
* Currently renting home for $1335 a month, which increases 5% every July when we renew lease for year
* we are saving about $1500 a month right now, but that will increase to $1900 in 3 months when we pay off our remain Credit card bills (no interest payment plan)
* Estimated Mortgage payment would be $2,182 (including Taxes)
* Portland, OR Area housing market, which seems to be pretty hot right now, believe home prices increased ~8% last year and are on track for %6 increase this year…no sources avail so could be off. But if we are only able to save $1500 a month currently I feel we won’t be able to get ahead of the market up here at this rate for a decent down payment.
               
I am really struggling with this decision. Part of me feels like we need to just go for it, and accept that we will have to put in a dozen offers before we find something. At the same time, I also can’t help but wonder if this is a bubble that will pop shortly. I have been reading that a big problem with the current market up here in Portland is a shortage of inventory.  We are both secure in our current jobs, but we all know how that can change for just about anyone. Sorry for the plethora of information, any advice would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1454968465

personalfinance,Pay mortgage faster to get out of PMI?,"Hola, ya'll. I bought a house 2 years ago under the Rural Development program under the USDA. 0% down payment loan, 3.75% interest rate, $114,795. I have a 401k with 50% matching up to 4%; ergo, I put in 4% and get an extra 2% equaling 6% of income saved per month.

I'm aware of the argument I should take any extra money and invest it instead of paying down the mortgage as the returns will almost assuredly beat out the 3.75% ""return rate"". There is also the fact that investments are generally more liquid and accessible in an emergency than money paid towards principal; once it's gone, it's gone. 

But! I had to take on PMI as a result of my 0% down payment loan. According to an amortization schedule I got off of the internet, I'll reach the 20% equity mark around 2025. 

So, should I pay more into my principal to not only get 3.75% ""returns"", but also work towards getting out of PMI? 

As it turns out, figuring out exactly what my PMI is isn't easy. I pay 783.82/month in total costs to my mortgage lender. After removing principal / interest, that is 252.19. That number is PMI, home owner's insurance, and taxes. Taxes are 757 a year (I think) so take 1/12 of that and subtract to get $189.11. I found an old quote for my home owner's insurance for $74.76. **That leaves $114.35 a month for PMI.**

I included all of the math because most of it is based on documents that were *estimates* of those costs before finalization were done, I said yes, and they were all wrapped into a monthly payment to the mortgage holder. Maybe someone would see something ""off"" or something that ""couldn't be right.""

So, that's all the numbers I have on hand. Should I go for PMI elimination or start an IRA fund in addition to my 401k?

Long time lurker and first time poster. Approx 2.5 years ago my father passed away and left me his house in his will. After a long process of probate I finally have the Deed and all is well. Well when I called the mortgage company they stated I had to do a re-finance to put the mortgage into my name (strange since I had been paying this thing for 2 years and figured they would just put my name on it)

I contacted my brother who does real estate and he gave me a mortgage brokers number that he has used personally and gives to his clients. Originally they said my income alone made me eligible for a re-finance. Awesome I thought, first thing in this entire process that will be easy. Not so much.

When I started this the stuff they asked for all made perfect sense. Copy of pay stubs, copy of bank accounts, 401k, etc. These all seemed normal to verify my pay and crap (I have a glorious credit score so that isn't an issue). Now it has been 2-3 months and I still have not even seen an interest rate.

Every time I send them the documents they ask for they come back with a new list of stuff they need. I have 3 renters who pay me cash and I deposit it every month. I have written a letter of explanation for this and now they are asking me to make them get a cashiers check or whatever from banks with a note on it stating what it is for. They are also asking for a bank statement from Janruary 2015 until current time showing all the payments I have made to the current mortgage people.

My question here is: Is this normal? I feel like something not right is going on. If they are professionals how come they keep coming back with new and weirder stuff they need from me and not just give me one flat list? (this also casuses me to have to get new pay stubs, bank statements, the whole 9 yards every time)

Given I would be a new government employee, I would be subject to FERS-RAE requiring me to pay 4.4% of my salary post tax into the Annuity or 4400 per year.

The Annuity pays a benefit of 1.1% of the averaged 3 highest pay years multiplied by the years of service (more than or equal to 20 years) Assuming a 1.5% pay raise per year I would end up near 185k after 30 years or 61k annually. 

I want to give my spouse benefits if something happened to me so I would pay 10% of my payout and my wife would get only 50%. There is really no way for children or others to get any benefits from the Annuity.

Now let's say I take a different job paying the same ( most likely not true, it would be higher) but instead I would take the post tax money equal to the Annuity and roll it into a Roth IRA. I estimate that I would have about 450k saved after 30 years.

I feel as though the Roth IRA provides more benefit over the Annuity because it allows my spouse full access to the benefit and I can pass it on to children. However, if my genetics serve me well, I would see 30 years of retirement.

personalfinance,[Taxes] W2 Includes Unexpected Travel Expense Income,"Hi all-

I need just a little help getting pointed in the right direction here. Quick history:

I live in State A. After several years working here in State A for MegaCorp, I worked for ABC company for about 18 months:

* Mar 2014 - Apr 2014: Living and working in State A
* Apr 2014 - Oct 2014: Living in State A, flying to State B 1,100 miles away 4 nights / week to work at a client site
* Oct 2014 - Sep 2015: Living in State A, flying to State C 1,000 miles away 4 nights / week to work at a client site

I then left ABC company in September after 341 days working in State C to work for XYZ company. My final paycheck from ABC showed $(X) wages for 2015. I just received my W2 from ABC and my 2015 wages are $(X+45,800) but no change in Federal Income Tax Withheld (though, curiously, increases in Social Security, Medicare, and State A and State C Income tax withholdings). That $45k perfectly correlates with my travel expenses for the year.

My understanding is that since I earned an income in State C for less than one year I qualify as a temporary assignment and my travel expenses should not appear as income.

Did my former employer screw up and they need to back out those expenses from my wages, or do they owe more money on my behalf to the IRS, or is it even a different solution than that?",finance,1454994164

This subreddit scoffed and continues to scoff at my legendary prowess, but I don't mind.  In fact, last May I told you all that Bitcoin's return over the next 12 months would more than *double* the best performing Vanguard index fund, and **it certainly has**, soaring from $230 to $370.

-------  
  
So, many of you (including top investment professionals at major firms) are probably wondering: ""Pegasus, *wow*!  What's next?""  
  
Well, I'll tell you again, like I always do.  2016 is going to be a crazy year folks; you better buckle up.  
  
**This market isn't going back up until it goes down a lot more!**  
  
I'm calling for a major crash to really punctuate this recent spiral, and I mean something nasty.  I'm expecting a spring time frame, probably in March (yes, as in next month!)  
  
Oil isn't going anywhere.  Expect capitulation to occur as we finally hit $17 a barrel, and possibly lower.  Only then will we go back up, and even then it will take a while to recover.  Bottom line: people trying to catch the falling knife in oil are gonna get burned.  
  
I expect talk of QE4 to begin after the crash though, and it won't be able to come soon enough!  Without QE4 we may see a bottom of 1100 in the S&amp;P by this time next year.  With Q&amp;E?  Well I can't foresee how much magical pretend money the government will print into the stock market, but the reckoning we will face will be the same.     
   
It's simple math: hard assets are going to be precious luxuries soon.  The paper gold market is in for an upheaval as we collectively discover that paper gold is currently a major sham, but the world isn't going back to precious metals... No, the way forward isn't shiny rocks but decentralized digital networks.  
  
This R3 thing the banks are working on?  Because they have so fundamentally misunderstood what a decentralized blockchain is, it will falter and fail.  The banks will use it, of course, in order to try to justify the millions they will spend making it.  But they will eventually abandon it in favor of a true decentralized alternative.  
  
Speaking of which, for a year now I've been intrigued and 'infiltrating' the world of new *private* digital financial networks.  These use protocol level cryptography for financial privacy.  Along with Bitcoin and Ethereum, Monero and Aeon are likely to become very big deals in coming years (but I am invested in them, and represent them, so don't take my word for it - check out the cutting edge Cryptonote protocol they are based off of).   
  
The stock market isn't going to implode forever, and I expect a new mega bull run to kick off before 2020, but it's not going to start without some pain first.   
  
Money itself is going to experience it's 'uber moment' and we may even begin to see regulated crypto-securities.  If R3 ever finds a real world niche, it could potentially be here, but I still wouldn't bet on it.  
  
Anyhow, I wouldn't be fucking with anyone at the moment, especially not the 50 - 200 P/E companies that boast 'lots of users'.  You thought LinkedIn's mega crash was news?  More are coming.  
  
You'll know when this tech 2.0 bubble has fully crashed back to Earth because we will be considering the long term viability of even juggernauts like Facebook and Amazon.  And here's where you buy back in.  
  
It's easier said than done now, because when the time comes to buy back in we may truly be in the throes of a major economic crisis.  People will scoff at owning Facebook, Google, or Apple stock but that is where you must go.  
  
The big winners in the next bull run?  The sci-fi tech of tomorrow: virtual reality, self-driving cars, digital money, 3D printing, and AI.  
  
Anyway, I've said enough.  I'm happy to see this crash finally get underway because I know that on the other side of every crash lies opportunity - I just would caution against trying to catch this one on the way down.  You may say to ""buy fear"" but I would argue we haven't even seen fear yet - we're just getting started here.  
  
As always, note that this is all my own opinion and I am not an investment professional.  I am not licensed to give financial advice to anyone, and have no current market positions, long or short.  I only own 100% cryptocurrency at the moment, which I plan to hold for the foreseeable future, and partially diversify from once this market is much lower.

personalfinance,Considering Bankruptcy to Free Up More Money For Student Loans. Not Sure Where to Receive Unbiased Advice.,"Hi r/personalfinance, I feel saddled by debt and am not sure what to do. I just graduated from college and have about:
 ~20k in credit card debt 
 ~65k in student loans (40k are federal)

I have been seriously considering filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy because I worry when my student loans kick in, I won't be able to make progress on both my student loans and credit cards. Just paying my minimums on CC's is around $500 per month, but I have been able to manage that and apply the snowball method for the last few months. However, since I was doing this with a student job, I still didn't make much progress and my efforts feel pretty futile. 

I recently found work in my field, which is an internship paying a flat rate of $2,000 per month. Additionally, I do web design work, which rakes in an extra $200 per week (though this isn't steady income since I freelance). I live with my parents, so my living expenses are very minimal besides my credit cards bills and $100 phone bill. 

I have already met with one bankruptcy lawyer, who is of course advising me to file. I am scared of having Bankruptcy on my record for ten years but even paying these credit cards has been a struggle for me while living at home, I shudder to think how much more difficult it will be when my loans kick in. My attorney insists I could pay off my loans much faster without my CC payments and that I would be better off in the next 10 years financially that way even with the BK. 

 I was also thinking about going back to school for an associate's in Web Development (I have a liberal arts degree but enjoy development and know that's where the money is) just to defer loan payments, continue to work and pay down my cards and just pay interest on student loans. 

I'm very confused and would like to figure this out while my loans are still in the grace period until June. Thanks for reading, and any insight is appreciated.",finance,1455024871

I read that private companies such as SoFi and DRB could effectively transfer the account into my name. 

&amp;nbsp;

The story for me is I'm trying to pay off these loans as fast as possible (less than 3 years). My mom can't afford to help me in any way with the parent loan, so I've been paying monthly into it for about a year now. I graduated May 2014 and started working in my field since September 2014. Since then, I've been paying $2500 a month into the parent loan (easy to do with no other bills since I still live with my parents). I'm not concerned about losing out on any of the federal protections, lowering minimum payments, and what have you; all I care about is getting a lower interest rate. 

&amp;nbsp;

Right now, my parent loan is broken into 3 smaller loans varying between 6.4%-7.9% interest. In my situation, is refinancing a good idea as long as the consolidated loan interest amount is less than 6.4%? The only reason I want the name on the loan transferred to me is for tax benefits (and maybe improving my credit score? still a financing novice). My mom is retired, so I don't know if the deductible interest I've been paying helps her substantially. I feel the $300 a month in interest I pay should benefit me since I have a higher income than her.

The job only pays $10/hr, but they offer the option to live on property with full room and board for only $200/month.

I was lucky, and got a Real Job right as I graduated (with benefits and tuition reduction and a 68% increase in wage over my previous job). Due to the sweet tuition benefit, I'm planning on re-enrolling part time for my masters, thereby going into deferment on my loans and pausing the interest on my subsided federal loans - to the tune of like $200 out of pocket per year.

My credit score is okay, 700-710 depending on who you ask. According to Credit Karma (and my bank) - the things that are hurting me are a low age of credit history and a small total number of accounts.

With all of this said, I am anticipating a pretty fat check from my tax return, which will be enough to cover one of my student loans (which has both the lowest principle and the highest interest rate). However, it's also one of my older loans. If I have the goal of making my credit score better, should I pay off that loan (lowering my number of accounts and age of credit history) or spread it among all of my loans (meaning I'll still have the one hanging over me)?

I am a senior in college and have accepted an IT position (non-union) with a major railroad company in the US when I graduate. I am trying to plan out and even understand how these crazy Railroad taxes/retirement stuff works. I know that I pay a Tier 1 RR tax, a Teir 2 RR tax, and Medicare RR tax, but I am confused as to what the rates are. I had heard that the Tier 1 RR tax (I don't know what the rate is) is modeled after the traditional social security tax, and rolls over to SS if I chose to work in the railroad industry for less than five years, but after five years it will stay as a RR retirement. I have also heard that the Tier 2 tax (4.9% a year) is supposed to be modeled after something like a 401k, and that I will only be able to keep that money if I work for the railroad for more than five years, I will lose it if I work less than that. Sorry I am totally clueless, but I have read the Railroad Retirement Board website backwards and forwards and none of it makes sense to me- I was hoping for a much more clear and concise explanation from someone here. 
With that out of the way, I have several questions:

What is the tax rate for the Tier 1 Tax?  
Does anyone know how many years I have to work for the industry to keep the Tier 2 tax?

How much more should I expect to pay a year than a normal person paying standard taxes, now that I have to pay State and Federal Income taxes, Tier 1 RR tax, Tier 2 RR tax, and RR Medicare?

But if a hard fork is coming *anyways* - then they might as well join in the fun (and profit), instead of dying a miserable death on the shorter chainfork.

So now, we can all just sit back and be patient. 

2016 is shaping up to be a horrible year for debt-backed fiat [1], and it's very likely we will see a major flow of cash seeking ""safe havens"" in hard assets like Bitcoin, physical gold, property, etc.

So all Bitcoin needs to do is keep on chugging along, secure and error-free, as it has for the past 7 years - and also be ready for an increase in transactions due to an influx of cash.

Bitcoin Classic (and the other 2MB+ clients such as XT and BU) all provide this. And they're all up and running on 1/6 of the nodes already, fully compatible with the Core nodes, all on the same network, working in harmony. 

This in itself is a major achievement. And the longer people get used to this state of affairs, the more confident they're going to feel about running ""alternate"" repos.

So don't worry if the 2MB+ clients have so far achieved coverage of ""only"" 1/6 of the network in these first few days (which is still a pretty remarkable achievement in such a short period of time, if you think about it).

**Over the next 2 years, fiat is going to start to fail - and Bitcoin is now ready to scale.**

That's all that matters.

- new rules for bank bail-ins in Europe effective January 1, 2016

etc.

Also: 

Recall that the *last* time debt-backed fiat started to fail was right *after* the US presidential election of 2008 - around November 2008. 

This suggests an interesting theory: the powers-that-be sweep all the dirt under the rug during the 8 years of the US president's typical two 4-year terms in office. 

And then, at the end of those 8 years, all the dirt comes out again - around November, once the new president has been elected and the old president is a ""lame duck"".

So, if this theory is correct, we can expect to see a lot of financial ""dirt"" getting exposed late in 2016 - just like it happened in late 2016 (when Timmy Geithner ran to Congress saying there would be ""blood in the streets"" if they didn't immediately give Wall Street 700 billion USD in freshly printed debt-backed fiat cash - which eventually ballooned to around 21 trillion USD since then).

---

And finally:

The halvening.

It's scheduled for around August 2016.

So in order for miners to maintain their current level of profits, they would want the price to double around then.

Which means that volume (transactions on the blockchain) will also have to double around then.

We have already seen (during 2011-2014) that when price and volume are unconstrained by any artificial limit on the blocksize, they have tended to march in lockstep together, tightly correlated:

&gt; This graph shows Bitcoin price and volume (ie, blocksize of transactions on the blockchain) rising hand-in-hand in 2011-2014. In 2015, Core/Blockstream tried to artificially freeze the blocksize - and artificially froze the price. Bitcoin Classic will allow volume - and price - to freely rise again.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44xrw4/this_graph_shows_bitcoin_price_and_volume_ie/

So, in order to double the price after the halvening, the miners are going to be highly motivated to double the volume (ie, the blocksize) as well.

---

This all means that the stars are in perfect alignment: 

- Classic and several other 2MB+ clients (BU, XT) are already humming along quietly and compatibly on the network;

- Debt-backed fiat is starting to show major warning signs of cracking - and this time, it'll be worse than 2008 (Deutsche Bank collapsing would be 5x the size of Lehman; private central banks have all shot their wad with the last 8 years of QE and 25% of the world's GDP now under NIRP; new rules are in place to do bail-ins robbing depositors instead of bail-outs robbing taxpayers, etc.); 

- Miners will need Bitcoin price (and hence Bitcoin transaction volume - aka blocksize) to roughly double around the halvening; and 

- The 8-year term of the current US president is about to end.

And all these ""interesting"" events are scheduled for later this year!

personalfinance,Should this person take out the loan to refinance existing debt?,"This is a repost from what I asked in the mfwtk subreddit but thought I'd throw it here for clearer decisions without the scathing remarks. Clearly the person knows they've fucked up with their spending habits and ultimately, no one besides then knows what put them into this financial situation besides them.


I'll try to keep this short yet have all the pertinent information at hand. My friend has numerous debt obligations that cause her to take home less than $200 a month from her checks. She cannot live off of that amount (not enough for to utility and rent and food)  She went to the bank to take a loan and they qualified her for a $5,000 loan at 8%   She has not agreed to taking the loan and these were her options  

Her biggest sources of debt are her car which has 1 year of payments left on it -- which she pays $550 a month on. (2.4% interest rate)

The second largest obligation is her credit card (17.8% interest) and which is maxed out at $5,000. She pays $200 a month towards that. 

If she uses the money to the car loan, she will pay off her car in 2 months and free up $550 which she could theoretically use to help alleviate her liquidity situation. However, it would still leave her with a Rough credit card debt which only solution would be putting more money monthly into that -- putting her back at square one (she'd be using a more expensive interest loan to pay back a very low interest loan almost at maturity and still be left with the credit card )

If she opts to put the money on her credit card, if she closes the card she free herself of the largest debt obligation interest wise, but will still have to pay the high monthly of $550 for another year (however, she escapes the higher interest rate of the credit card, can close the credit card in light of a monthly payment half its size ) 

**Which option is best?** These aren't the only debts she has, but the most necessary to be paid off. It seemed obvious to me that paying the credit card off was ideal and that getting the loan to refinance was smartest, but I think the liquid cash situation is worth looking at so I wanted to ask someone more knowledgeable. She could always not take the loan and hope she gets a better job or someone to help her while she tries to make ends meet 


**adding this segment regarding total debt obligations for a better picture of their monthly budget**

Her take home is roughly $800 every two weeks. 
These numbers I assume are minimums 

Car loan $550 a month

Credit card $200 a month 

Loan 1: $200 a month

Loan 2: $200 a month 

Student loan: $150


That leaves her with roughly $300 to survive. I might be missing some other debt or am using wrong numbers for one of the loans. Those are personal loans. Her issue is a very unique issue as why she had to take out the loans in the first place but I'm not trying to make excuses for her. The situation here is dire and I'm trying to see if refinancing for the credit card is even a legitimate option.

I'm now 23 and $12,000 in debt between 2 credit cards + 1 store card.

Since I discovered this sub I've read it daily, religiously even, to find any tips tricks and read the success stories of others to help inspire me to get out out this hole. I'm finally taking control of my finances and cutting as many excess costs and unnecessary fees out of my life.

I want to share what I've done so far and what steps I'm taking to get out from under this.  
  
&gt;What I have
&gt;  
RBC  
- Chequing Account(Monthly Fee: $0.00 up to first 12 debits)  
- Savings Account (No fee)  
-TFSA (No fee)  
-Credit Card (Interest: ~$60/mo)
&gt;
CIBC  
- Chequing Account (Monthly Fee: $3.90 up to first 12 debits)  
- Savings Account (No fee)  
- Credit Card (Interest: ~$100/mo)

1. I reviewed my chequing and savings accounts and identified that one(CIBC) had fees on moving any money from any account to any account except for deposits and was costing me $10+/mo both the chequing and savings accounts are being closed this month.
2. I started reviewing lower interest rate cards for RBC(changing the card type on my CIBC card is not an option for extenuating circumstances) and found they had two options one with 4.99-7.99% interest and another that is 11.99% so I called up inquiring to get my card renewed and before I can even bring it up ""You're pre-approved for a lower interest card"" and it's the 11.99% one even though I wanted the even lower card they said I wouldn't need a credit check to get it because it's approved already so I took it because I did 4 last year in the span of 6 months. I estimate this is going to save me ~$300 in the first year alone.
3. This part sounds a little crazy and it is but in about 3-6 months or so when I have the store card paid off and the overall debt is around 9-10k I'm going to open a MBNA Platinum Plus Mastercard because they offer 0% interest for the first 12 months on all balance transfers done in the first 90 days and transfer up to $3000 from the CIBC card to this new card and pay it off before the 12 months is up.
4. I'm looking into jobs that pay 150%+ of my current wage and moving back home to help cut costs drastically even more.

These are all huge changes that I've only come to realize thanks to the help of this sub and I plan to be debt free by the end of 2017 if not much sooner.

personalfinance,Sound financial decisions vs hopes/dreams/normal life,"I posted several months ago about being unable to find an affordable house, facing a tough choice over refinancing vs moving, and now I'm back with an update and a question.

The update is that we've had no luck whatsoever finding a house. For me, hope of finding what we want at a price we can afford, in the current market, has died.

During that time, we've gotten to the point that we can actually refinance our current house and cut our interest rate in half. However, the expenses to do so will knock us out of the housing market for the next year. Looking 2 years out, refinancing will put us in a better position to buy a home. It will save us thousands a year in interest. By the numbers, this is the way to go.

Weighed against that, though, is the desire to get a bigger home to be able to start a family. It isn't impossible: between draining the emergency fund, cutting down retirement contributions, borrowing money from family, making the smallest down payment allowable and borrowing every penny the bank will lend us, we could bump up our price to the point we should be able to buy a decent 3 bedroom house, maybe even a low-end 4 bedroom house. But it would mean living right on the edge. Paycheck to paycheck. Depending on getting a raise in the future to rebuild any emergency fund, and then hopefully resume funding retirement.

The sound financial advice, of course, would be to wait, but my partner has been expressing more and more concern that, at our age, waiting 2 or 3 more years is pushing it. If everything goes smoothly it could work, but any bump in that road could put us into expensive procedure, high risk, or even down right impossible territory.

Its been really tough lately; as all I hear is that we must be doing something wrong, everyone else finds/found a way to do this, etc. In individual cases, I can see that some people got ahead of us because their parents paid for their college, they inherited a large sum of money or a house, they lived rent-free with their parents until they could buy a nice house, or it is clear that they are buried in debt and that the slightest thing will (or already has) pushed them to bankruptcy. But on the whole, I can't explain how our peers are able to afford the 3 bedroom house and the 2 car garage and put their 2.6 kids in daycare. I'm left with the conclusion that either we're simply failures, or that having some kind of safety net or cushion is too much to ask.

So how has everyone else dealt with these competing pressures? Is the cold hard logic that says ""we can't afford this right now"" enough?",finance,1455053816

mining,How crowd-funding could accelerate mineral discoveries [x-post from r/geologycareers],"[Australian junior miners may soon be incorporating a crowd-funding element in their exploration efforts](http://www.mining.com/australias-junior-sector-turns-to-crowdfunding/). ^^^1
 





  

 
  
Details from [another article](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/mining-executives-turn-to-crowd-funding-for-junior-miners/news-story/75c7fdf44f69aec07e83bca2dc44c459)^^^2


&gt; Early-stage explorers typically tap networks of industry insiders and connections for their initial funding, with those entry-level investments often enjoying significant returns if those ventures ever make it to the Australian stock exchange.
Mr McLean told The Australian he hoped crowd-funding could eventually allow much smaller retail investors to tap into those early-stage seed-investment opportunities that have historically only been the domain of the well-connected and deep-pocketed.
“With crowd-funding, if someone has got $500 and wants to get in at the ground floor of a mining asset, they can,” he said. “Typically, it’s only been open to people who with a nod and a wink and a handshake who knew that an asset had IPO potential and could get in at 7c or 8c in the knowledge it would IPO at 20c. Crowd-funding can open up the market completely.”
The move towards crowd-funding comes at a time when traditional methods of raising capital for early-stage exploration ventures have dried up... 
  
  
 
  
  

  
  
Another snippet from [a different article](http://www.reuters.com/article/mining-australia-crowdfunding-idUSL3N12X1VF20151102)^^^3,  
&gt; ""The lack of equity finance continues to be the most significant business constraint for mineral exploration and mining companies,"" said Simon Bennison, chief executive of the Association of Mining and Exploration companies, representing many of Australia's smaller miners. 
  
  

  
  
I linked these articles just to show that there are murmurings out there that crowd-funding might be able to play a part in the future of financing mineral exploration, not because I necessarily endorse the views or approaches of the people and companies named in the articles.  
  
Here in the US, [the SEC has recently approved equity-crowdfunding rules, which allows an average investor to make modest investments in private companies](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html). ^^^4  
  

The way I think crowdfunding should work for early stage exploration would be analagous to the way an artist's retreat works. Various artists apply for limited spots in the retreat. They submit samples of their previous work and produce an [artist's statement](http://www.gyst-ink.com/artist-statement-guidelines/). ^^^5  
  


&gt; Full-Page Statement: This statement you will use most often; it speaks generally about your work, the methods you may have used, the history of your work, etc. It may also include specific examples of your current work or project.  
  

  
  

So the geologists would submit their proposal before each field season and the community of users (lets imagine for the sake of discussion the userbase as the ideal community of geologists, engineers, mining professionals, and sophisticated investors) evaluates the merit of their proposals and allocate funds accordingly.   
  
By this method, geologists are accepted into the program, and are fully funded to conduct their proposed scoping studies. Both the geologist and his investors are stakeholders in any discoveries the exploration efforts might unearth.  Everyone knows the odds aren't very good on any single project, but if investors use a scattershot approach and fund multiple scoping studies, the likelihood increases that one of their investments will make a discovery and amortize the losses of all the others.  
  
**Question:** What about this “retreat” would appeal to a geologist who has the option to find employment within a larger company or to become a consultant for hire? 
  
1. Experience (acquiring rare abilities and a broad skillset not learned in traditional settings).
2. Prestige (Many apply. Few are funded).
3. Equity (assume more risk, claim greater rewards).


Taking all three incentives together, it seems likely that ideal ""geology-retreat"" applicants would be recent graduates. Young people have greater freedom at the beginning of their careers to benefit from grinding their skills and tolerating risk. And even though their prospect might not prove economically viable, at least the research could still be of academic value to the geologist in pursuit of his or her Master's or PhD.
  
The concept might even appeal to seasoned exploration geologists wanting to explore a prospect on their own.
  



**Question:**  It's crowdfunded, how would shares work?
  

Each project is divided into corporate stock with the explorer granted the most shares. The investors get shares in proportion to their investment... and *the geologists of every other project are also granted a small share of each prospect* so that in effect, *every explorer has a stake in everybody else's projects*. This way, all explorers benefit when any one of them makes a discovery. That's an incentive for the community to collaborate in interpreting each other's findings). If a geologist fails to find an economic deposit (as statistically he is wont to do) he still profits when one of his thousands of colleagues makes a discovery.   
  
And so long as the community has vetted his work as rigorous and scientifically sound, he will easily raise funds for his next prospect. When a project fails, it's best that it fails fast. So that the explorer can get on with the Sisyphean task of discovering an economic deposit. This gives an explorer the freedom to be wrong as long as his workmanship is excellent.  
  
This not only mitigates the sting of a failed prospect for the vast majority of unlucky geologists but, crucially, *it gives each geologist an incentive to interpret his colleague's data as well as his own*. The sum total of the collaborative effort might generate better hypotheses and drill targets down the line  (which might very well be the biggest value add).  [The wisdom of crowds can be a powerful force](http://born2invest.com/cdn/open-source-data-might-be-the-future-of-mining-exploration/)^^^6   
  
In summation, my TLDR pitch is for a, “Crowd-funded prospect generator where each explorer has a large stake in his own project and a small stake in everybody else's projects. In this way, each explorer is incentivized to collaborate on interpreting prospects. So long as both the quality of talent and the quality of proposals remain high, I think this model may have potential because it:  
  
  
1. Gives geologists a lot of freedom to explore where they want.  
2. Maximizes collective brainpower.  
3. Mitigates risk by spreading it around.  
4. The investment dollars would have a bigger bang for the buck because they go directly to exploration instead of G&amp;A costs that over-encumber so many juniors today.  
  
My last link is to [a short cinematic with Dave Lowell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huJ4LGX6YdI), a geologist who has discovered 17 mines and developed a theoretical approach contributing to 20 others ^^^7. He's the most successful prospector in 100 years. When I listen to him talk, I think we'd see a lot more explorers like Dave Lowell if others had the kind of freedom he's talking about.     
  
The smartest people I've heard speak about the industry describe it as being all about intellectual capital, like a Silicon Valley tech startup. What could be a bigger boost in brainpower to the industry than a confederation of exploration geologists peer-reviewing each other's projects? I suspect it would greatly reduce exploration expenses if it ever managed to scale.

personalfinance,I could really use some help with paycheck withholding for state income tax,"I live and work in California, and unfortunately I have a tough time truly understanding the DE4 form (state counterpart to the federal W4). 

I'm married and my wife works, so we are a dual-income/two-earner household. For tax year 2014 our paychecks were underwithheld by a lot, so in 2015 we adjusted. After using the IRS calculator we went down to 0 exemptions plus an additional amount of money withheld every paycheck. My understanding is that by default California employers use the same withholding info from the W4 if the employee doesn't file a separate [DE4 state form](http://www.taxes.ca.gov/de4.pdf).  That's what happened this past year, but I changed jobs and ended up owing money again now (both Federal and State) for tax year 2015 due to underwithholding.

We don't itemize all of our expenses, so we just get the standard deduction. The worksheets on the California DE4 talk about various deductions and totally confuse me. Can someone please walk me through what our withholding amounts should be? California state doesn't seem to have any online calculators the way the IRS does, and you can see the confusing worksheets at the link above.

Job 1 (me): Annual gross income between $56-62K (eligible for merit bonuses)

Job 2 (wife): Annual gross income between $45-50K (eligible for merit bonuses)

Total gross income for both could be anywhere from $101K to $112K

personalfinance,Seeking some advice regarding my HSA with HSA Bank.,"I have an HSA at HSA Bank, which was set up through my employer. They contribute $1,200 a year in to the account, and I am contributing about $89 per paycheck, which will get me  close to the $3,350 maximum. 

Now, I planned on using the HSA account as a retirement account and investing it. I know HSA bank has commission free Vanguard ETFs available through TD Ameritrade that I would be investing in. However, they have a monthly service fee ($2.5, waived with a $5,000 balance) and a monthly investment fee ($3, also waived with $5000 balance). The employer is looking in to taking care of the service fee (they didn't know about it when they set by the account). If I invest, I would invest pretty much all of it and will not be keeping the eventual $5,000 in the bank to avoid the fee as the interest rate is very measly. 

I was looking for some advice to see if its still worth investing this money in ETFs with so much being eaten up in fees ($66 a year if the service fee is not paid by the employer). And that fee is being eaten from the pre-tax money so I'm losing potential tax free growth there. Any similar experiences from those who have HSA accounts? Do you think it is worth it? 

I have some medical expenses I could spend it on, but I was really hoping to add another vehicle for retirement other than my IRA and 401k since I have enough savings for my medical expenses. Any advice or opinion is appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1455058853

personalfinance,Best way to pay off UK student loans from abroad?,"I live in the USA and have a UK student loan of approximately £10,000.  A large portion of that is in arrears since I have not been paying the full amount due for quite a few years now. Long story, doesn't really matter at this point.  I have the cash to pay off the loan in it's entirety but want to make sure to protect myself since it's a large sum of money going overseas and once it's paid I want to be finished dealing with it for good.
&amp;nbsp;

My questions are:
&amp;nbsp;


 - What questions should I ask the UK Student Loan Company (SLC) prior to transferring the funds?
&amp;nbsp;

 - What documentation should I be looking for from the SLC?
&amp;nbsp;

 - Should I tell the SLC that I prior to paying off the balance?

 - Do I need to notify my bank?

 - Best method to transfer funds?
&amp;nbsp;

 - Should I pay it off all at once, or in installments? Interest rate is low at 1%
&amp;nbsp;

There are likely some additional fees tacked on to the loan from having the arrears in place, but I have not received a breakdown of the charges yet.  Is there likely any opportunity to negotiate on the fees if I pay all at once?

Can anyone explain why we owe this amount? I thought that getting married, filing jointly, and having 1 exemption was good?

After paying 7 payments, the lady who did my mortgage emailed me saying I could save $100 or more per month if I do a no cost refinance.

I don't see a problem with a no cost refinance (all the closing costs and appraisal fee) so I was hoping you guys can provide some insight.

personalfinance,"$137k in Student Loans (still in deferment), but need to strategize a a small windfall. Please Help!","I am about to graduate from Law School and will soon need to start making payments on my student loans.

The loan principals total $126,610.48, with currently $11,672.78 in unpaid interest. The total amount is the sum of several small loans that break down like this:



Loan Amount | Interest Rate | Date Issued |
---|----|----
$20,500.00 | 5.84% | 08/26/2015
$10,000.00 | 6.84% | 08/26/2015
$20,000.00 | 7.21% | 09/03/2014
$20,500.00 | 6.21% | 08/19/2014
$6,000.00 | 6.41% | 05/30/2014
$20,471.18 | 5.41% | 08/21/2013
$14,978.91 | 6.41% | 08/21/2013
$8,647.95 | 6.8% | 10/14/2010
$5,512.44 | 6.8% | 08/26/2009

The loans will stay in deferment until August 26, 2016. They accrue interest based only on the principal amount until that date (I believe). 

I inherited $17,800 from an Uncle about a year ago, and used $5,500 of it to start a Roth IRA. I was thinking about maybe using the remaining $12,300 to pay down the principal on the highest interest rate loan, but also like having the ""rainy day"" money.

I am currently employed, but not making too much since i am still a student (Approx. 500 a month). Further, the nature of the legal market is shaky, and my current employment cannot guarantee to give me full time employment, so I am seeking other options.

I have a little over $2000 in my own savings and no other debts/payments (no rent since I live at home, car is paid off). While it would be good to have a little savings since employment is not a guarantee, I also wonder the value of paying down loans. 

Any strategy suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I just turned 18 and this is the first time I'm going to be filing my taxes. I worked at company A from January until about September (making minimum) and then switched to company B making the same wage. I just started getting federal taxes taken out the last two months of 2015.

What is this going to do to my taxes? I know you do not pay any federal on a certain amount of money you make, until it breaks certain criteria (if I'm not mistaken, if I am please correct me). I earned around 3,000 from my first employer and 1,000 from my second. I have yet to receive my W2 from my employers. Will I receive one or two W2 forms? And will I owe money simply because I switched jobs?

I apologize if these are stupid questions, but I have yet to learn enough about taxes and my parents aren't much help. I did take personal finance at school this year, but it was a complete joke. I did google my situation but there are a lot of factors such as my age and wage that I don't know if they have any impact on my situation.

If it makes any difference, I did not turn 18 until January of 2016, after I quit my second job. Federal taxes are very intimidating to me and I haven't a clue what to expect. Most of my friends get a pretty small return, but I'm afraid since I switched employers I'll owe an exorbitant amount. Any information is *greatly* appreciated. Thanks",finance,1455072416

&gt; Car salesman will do multiple hards hits with ONE permission trying to find a company that wil give you a deal. They do not tell you that. Applying for any credit card, to get the free T-shirt or book bag, will be a hard hit on your score. Never go more than 50% of your credit limit of your scores goes down. If your limit is $1000, do not put more than $499 on that card. Also, when the credit card companies see you getting into higher debt with them and other companies. they suddenly start to raise your interest rate even though you were not late on your payments. They see you are struggleling with your  finances and go in for the kill because they can. If ever you get a call from a collection agency, tell them to wait while you start your tape recorder and ask them permission to record the conversation. They will either hang up or properly handle the situation. They are not allowed to threaten you with a lawsuit, call you at work, call you too early or too late at night, or mutilple times a day. They may leave a msg with their name and number to return their call. However,  not about them being a collection agency on an answering maching or voice mail that says why they are calling becuase anyone could hear the message and that would be a break of confidentialitey and a potentional Liable suit. If you are in trouble seek out a not for profit agency to help, not one that takes monthly payments from you and then says they will pay your creditors. That story always ends badly. I found HUD and Chatholic Charities very hellpful with No cost to me after I was in a car accident and unable to work for three years. Do not talk to anyone over the phone for more than an minute, tell them always do it by U.S. Postal mail, not emai either. In the event they harass you or do anything else the Fair Credit Bureau allows. you have an address to send a Letter or Sheriff to. Also, never admit to any debt until they prove you owe the money. Many times these debts get sold over and over again to another collection agency and the original paperwork is lost, so they can not prove you owe the money. I had ATT harass me for six years for a debt they said I owed of $30. I never had an account with ATT and asked them to prove . Every six months a new collection agency called saying I owed ATT but the amount kept going up. It wasn't until my lawyer handling my car accident sent a demand letter asking for proof of the debt, that the calls stop. Also, regular installment payment like a car or mortgage are good for building your credit, but they like to see revolving payments too as in Department stores, one month $213, pay it off, one month $399 pay it off, one month $29 pay it off.

I'm trying to determine if, in my situation, it makes sense to refinance our home so we can get rid of our mortgage insurance.

I know we could sell this place today for over $350k. I think that gives us enough equity that we could drop mortgage insurance if we were in a conventional loan.

With the fees involved in refinancing, and possibly a higher interest rate for the conventional loan, is it worth it to eliminate the $230 per month in insurance?

Also, we're probably going to end up renting this place out beginning in winter, and may end up doing so indefinitely. Not sure if that's relevant, but it'd be nice to kill the mortgage insurance so we were pulling more in from the rent each month.

Should I put a downpayment on a house to avoid paying rent forever to someone else and save on taxes owed next year?,"So for the first time in my life I have a real savings account. I received about 40k for my small business Feb 5th. I'm worried about having to pay taxes on this money next year and I've always wanted to own a house and finally have the money for a downpayment. There are some details though about my financial situation that may not make the answer easy. Here are the specifics: 

1. I have about 35k in student loans on 6% interest
    - I qualify for the debt forgiveness program and will have my loans forgiven after 120 payments due to my past service in the Peace Corps. I also qualify for $0 monthly payments (which counts as a payment) which I have been doing for over a year based on my 2014 taxes. I rough guess would be that I've made 20 payments so far. I'm guessing that next year I will not qualify for the $0 payments because of my income this year so I may need to pay more for awhile but here is the thing, and I'll explain more below, I'm disabled and pretty much know for sure that I will not be working too much in the future. 

2. (This Part is a Little Muddy) In the Peace Corps I contracted a very rare and not well studied virus that has left me unable to work. 
     - I originally had planned on going after disability benefits and started the paperwork. That was until I tried to get seen by a doctor and speaking with other returned Peace Corps Volunteers along with the Peace Corps Office. Its been in the media, but currently Returned Peace Corps Volunteers have to get all medical done through the Fed Workers Comp and there are no doctors that accept it. I mean none. I've gone through their ""list"" and called every one let alone them even having a doctor that can diagnose and treat a rare virus that causes strange and debilitating symptoms. So I had the choice of trying to get money from workers comp and not being able to see a doc or seeing doctors that are trying to properly diagnose and treat me. I'm currently doing that at Stanford under Medical. Note that The insurance companies and Medical will know if you have a workers comp claim and if you try to use their insurance with a claim they will not cover it. This happened to a person in my same situation. 

I have no other debts, no credit cards, and don't even own a car. I have no credit either as you aren't allowed to have debt in the Peace Corps and I didn't get a credit card after I got out. My score is mid 600's as I haven't had even a contract on a phone for the last 4 years. 

Thank you all in advance for the help and I know this one might be a little complicated. I've gone through some of the scenarios but I know very little about taxes but did think that if I want to keep my medical I will need to show that I had significant expenses to outweigh the bump in income. I would love to own a house and feel as if this may be my only opportunity in my situation. Thank you all for the advice.",finance,1455092490

“We agree with Google its (self-driving car) will not have a ‘driver’ in the traditional sense that vehicles have had drivers during the last more than one hundred years,” the NHTSA said. “If no human occupant of the vehicle can actually drive the vehicle, it is more reasonable to identify the driver as whatever (as opposed to whoever) is doing the driving.”

That possible interpretation of “driver” could have major implications in California, where Google has been testing autonomous cars for years, and which in December released draft rules that call for driverless cars, to, ironically enough, have a licensed driver. Those proposals caused dismay among driverless-car proponents; on Tuesday, a number of tech industry groups called on the state to rethink the driver requirement, saying it “misses the point” of the technology.

The NHTSA letter asks Google to answer a number of questions certifying the safety of its systems, and while numerous legal hurdles remain, the door to autonomous driving may have been pushed open.

Janet Yellen
Tightening financial conditions driven by falling stock prices, uncertainty over China and a global reassessment of credit risk could throw the U.S. economy off track from an otherwise solid course, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said on Wednesday in prepared testimony to Congress.

In testimony that combined a steady-as-she-goes account of Fed policy with an acknowledgement of intensifying risks, Yellen said there are good reasons to believe the United States will stay on a path of moderate growth that will allow the Fed to pursue ""gradual"" adjustments to monetary policy.

Family incomes and wealth are rising, domestic spending ""has continued to advance,"" and business investment outside the oil sector accelerated in the second half of the year, she said. Yellen said she expects the labor market to continue to improve and inflation eventually rise toward the Fed's target despite a recent drop in inflation expectations cited by some policymakers as particularly unnerving.

But Yellen acknowledged that some of the weaknesses in the global economy have become self re-enforcing, with weak growth in major manufacturers like China and oversupply on commodity markets rattling the world's oil and mineral exporters. A broad sense of a world slowdown, in turn, and uncertainty about the depth of China's problems, has tightened financial conditions for U.S. businesses.
The Fed ""expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labor market indicators will continue to strengthen,"" Yellen said.

technology,Virgin Media and International Peering (90% Speed Throttling),"**Summary:**


I own a personal server which is located in Paris, France. This server is on the OVH network, on a shared 1Gbps line, with a guaranteed 250Mbps up &amp; down. At home, I have a NAS enclosure which I mount over NFS on my personal server. I'm on the 200Mbps package Virgin package.


**The Issue:**


To put it bluntly, I'm seeing an over 90% speed drop on my download speed to my OVH server. Currently around 17-18mbps in off-peak, but around 4-5Mbps in peak times. Upload is completely fine! This is known by doing various monitoring with the tools:

* nethogs (Unix network monitoring tool)
* iperf (Performance benchmark tool)
* iotop (Disk IO monitoring, including NFS)


**iPerf Results:**


[iPerf Download Test](http://community.virginmedia.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/65037i03BE850E50429935/image-size/large?v=mpbl-1&amp;px=999)

﻿

The download test which I've screenshotted above is the best I've ever received! Last night, I was getting a bandwidth result of around 4-5Mbps. Notice upload is completely fine and dandy.


**Tests on other Lines:**


* BT Fibre (80/40): Full speeds
* Three 4G: Full speeds, around 50Mbps/40Mbps
* BT ADSL: Full speeds, around 14Mbps/2Mbps


These tests above confirm that this issue is Virgin specific. I have NEVER been able to reproduce the same results as I get on my Virgin line on any other internet connection. Unfortunately, I don't know anyone else who owns a Virgin internet connection, so I can't test that.


**Trying to Solve the Issue:**


I've been pulling my hair out over this issue. I upgraded the internet purely for the addition of my NAS drive at home to get a better upload speed. To know that the download is 90% slower, but upload is fine, is absolutely infuriating.


I've done the following to try and solve this issue:


* Mounted over WebDAV (http): Same issue, still as slow.
* Mounted over CIFS (SMB): Same issue, slow.
* Mounted over FTP: This is a weird one, and really throws me off. When I first mounted over FTP, I was seeing speeds in the region of 90mbps-200mbps. I was absolutely chuffed when I first saw this, thinking I found a way around the issue. Although, incompatibilities between the FTP mount program and the FTP server cause the connection to abort, and it only allows one connection at a time, which is unfeasible for my application. Also, when I ran over FTP last night to see if I got the same speeds as I did prior, I got the same slow speed as I'm seeing over NFS. I don't know if I just got lucky at the time when I was transferring over FTP at the start.
* iPerf Testing on Different Ports: I wondered if traffic management policies were heavily shaping traffic routed on different ports. So I tried running iPerf on port 80,21,443,2049,3074 and got the exact same results each time. This of course, would make sense if Virgins DPI system tag by protocol rather than port.


**Contacting Customer Service:**


I've been contacting customer service constantly for the past week. The first time I got to 2nd line support, and he mentioned that their peering links to France are poor, and if I got a different IP it may re-route and I may get better speeds. That didn't work unfortunately.


When I've re-rang explaining the issue, I've been completely disregarded and are flat out denied to talk to anyone in 2nd line as they're stating this is my issue, even though I can prove it isn't. I then got redirected to a premium support line, like, really?


I escalated this issue as a complaint and was told I'd be in touch by a CSC manager on Tuesday the 9th of Feb. Although, I'm still waiting, which is ridiculous in itself.


**Another person stating the same issue:**

This issue was also discussed on here over a year ago [in this thread](http://community.virginmedia.com/t5/Community-Natter/International-Peering-amp-Virgin-Media/td-p/2794174) on Virgins community, when I saw this, I was glad someone was seeing the same thing.


**Overall**


I've shamefully re-posted [my Virgin post](http://community.virginmedia.com/t5/Speed/Over-90-Speed-Throttling-on-International-Peering/td-p/3038398) and placed it on here. Does anyone else in the UK who are on VM see the same issues to what I'm facing? Virgin themselves are ignoring my post even though their reps have been active on the forums ever since I posted it.

If I don't receive any response from them after bumping my thread later, it'll result in an OFCOM complaint from me.",technology,1455113053
business,Yellen Signals Fed Rate Path Hinges on Whether Turmoil Persists,"Chair Janet Yellen said the Federal Reserve still expects to raise interest rates gradually while making it clear that continued market turmoil could throw the central bank off course from the multiple increases that policy makers have forecast for 2016.
Yellen, 69, kicked off two scheduled days of testimony on Capitol Hill by also telling lawmakers that uncertainty over China’s economic prospects and exchange-rate policy had “exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth” and contributed to the latest drops in oil and other commodities. The risk for the U.S. economy is if the commodities bust triggers stresses around the world that threaten demand for U.S. exports, she said.
With her testimony on Wednesday, Yellen joined Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer and other senior Fed officials in declaring it’s too soon to tell whether sharp drops in stocks, oil prices and some bond yields represent passing volatility or reflect worsening global economic fundamentals that will dampen growth and inflation in the U.S.

personalfinance,Pay off Private or Federal Student Loans First??,"I currently have approximately $65,000 in student loan debt. I have been paying these loans for roughly 8 years and have another 12 to go. They are the bain of my existence and i get sick every time i calculate how much interest i will have paid over the course of those 20 years. Breaking them down in simplest form is $45,000 in private loans (this is the sum total of 8 individual loans, all variable rates currently between 3.16 and 5.16%) and $20,000 in federal loans (single loan with a fixed rate of 7.25%). I am tired of paying for them and have come up with a plan to pay off ALL of this debt over the next 2 years. I am starting that journey by making a large lump sum payment of approximately $20k, im just unsure of whether i should put it towards private or federal. I consider myself to be somewhat financially savvy however this has given me pause for the following reasons. 

My private loans are all variable rates which makes me lean towards putting the $20K lump sum there, however over the course of the last 8 years, even through the ups and downs of the economy, i have never seen these rates fluctuate to the point where my monthly payment has changed by an alarming amount (if anything, my monthly payment has decreased over the years, currently about $400/mo.)

My federal loans are a higher interest rate and my current monthly payments go towards interest only, the monthly payments for this loan will gradually increase over time (with my current plan, this debt will be paid off over over the course of the next 2 years so im terribly worried about an increase in monthly payment). Because of the higher interest rate and the fact that none of my current payments are reducing the principle amount, i can see how this may be more beneficial to pay off first. 

The facts tell my gut to pay off the federal loan first but there is some hesitancy there with the variable rates of the private loans. In either scenario, my overall monthly payment towards my loans should decrease by approximately $200.

investing,"Oil - Why I believe this is the bottom, and if it doesn't bottom out within a day or two, then it will be $22 in a month on the dot and that's it. That's right, I'm calling it!","I made a post on another sub yesterday, but I'm copying it here for all of you guys. I'm an oil trader and I love doing serious oil analysis and would love to share my opinions with you guys over at /r/investing. Standard disclaimer stuff of course (invest at your own risk, not a broker, yada yada!)

To clarify what I consider a bottom is where the fall stops. Usually a fall happens in stages, then there's a little profit taking, and then either flat, reverse, or more falling from there. A bottom is *not* calling for bullish oil, this requires news of fundamental changes in the current environment. At these bottoms is where I'm covering my short and looking to trade the pop up long, then finding the right spot to get back in short. All those posts I have in another sub, but since self promotion is against the rules so I'm going to leave off the links. 

[This is the path to the bottom](http://i.imgur.com/yLlsfbD.png) to start my short near the $34.00's. Look at an hourly chart now and check out the consolidation at  the prices I showed a week in advance: 30.27, 29.40, 27.56. And even called out a ""likely a hiccup day"" on the Tuesday which all seemed to play out as anticipated. I use a mathematical model based on the a modified Cauchy equation (similar to Navier-Stokes) to predict the ebb and flow of price momentum decay and energy loss, the same way you can show water flowing through a bending pipe. And I have it all wrapped up into an algo that points out these targets. It's been spot on almost to the day and price as the chart shows.

Well I just cashed out yesterday. Now I'm using similar methods to attempt a long trade on the short term. If that fails I'm back to shorting and trying a new long near $22. [Bull and Bear case here](http://i.imgur.com/bLn7s7k.png)

Disclaimer number two: Now the way that TA works, is that in light of no major news these things hold. If some crazy news event or major liquidity event happens, you scrap the chart and make a new one based off the new sentiment. But you might go weeks without news from the Saudis or OPEC, so TA guides you in between these major events. 

Oil has fundamentals averaging it in around $32 right now and over the last week I've started to see the OVX lead the VIX, and accordingly the SPX lead WTI prices. Despite what CNBC or other talking heads are saying, oil to me is not dragging the markets down--the markets are instead dragging oil down.

The oversupply is practically the same via the IEA report, and world demand is set to grow over 2016 (bullish), although the rate of growth has been projected to decline from 1.6 to 1.2 mmbpd (bearish). In addition to this, the S&amp;P has downgraded the credit ratings of close to like 50 E&amp;P's today. Bearish outlook for them, but that also is based on the well valuations of oil at this price.

The latter bearish flags today has shot oil downward in the short term toward the 52-wk low, coupled with what is now the looming crisis: banking, credit and monetary policy (just like it was leading into the 2008 crash) things look very bad. According to the chart, $22 oil bad at minimum if the markets were to crash. That is the bear case. So my eyes will be on banking, especially with Japan over the next few days. If I am looking for longs now, and stop out, I'll be short for the ride down instead.

However... there is a silver lining. Things always look the absolute worst before the end of a trend or even a reversal. The sky is not just gray, it's dark black and raining fire and brimstone. With the SPX leading WTI prices in the ticks intraday, what I believe oil is now is a proxy bet on the overall state of the economy more so than a fundamental trade on supply and demand in this oversold short term. Which makes sense because by proxy people are betting on economical health leading to higher demands. 

So in light of the obvious bearish case, there is a chance for a correction. Firstly: the March contract is quickly expiring, and CL is trading to test the previous 52-wk low. It is the path of least resistance. However think of this... if it fails to fall significantly lower than that, and the SPX rallies and there is no market crash / bear market scenario, commerical producers who usually hold a net short position will need to actually be locking in low prices for actual delivery oil (a lot of these mini rallies we see on the way down this last year can be explained by this sort of activity). It leads to a classic W-shaped reversal and buying spree near or slightly after the expiration of the contract. With looming contango in prices and the economy starting to teeter on total collapse, producers are going to need to be pinching every penny they can get, so if there is just the slightest hint of covering, it will cover hard...

OVX at 74 and a bollinger band squeeze on the dailies, volatility is the new name of the game and any moves to the up or downside from here will be swift. ESPECIALLY to the upside!

Which of course we'd overshoot to the point oil fundamentals will take over to bring oil back down toward the $32 level until bullish news on the supply/demand side leaks...but that's next quarter's short trade, so we'll worry about that then :)

Until SPX fails 1830's, I'm looking for dips and pecking at the long bet personally. Have my stops set of course, so I'll lose little attempting and only miss out on short profits. But a lack of a loss is still a gain in my book and worth a shot-- that juicy OVX 74 and climbing--I wouldn't want to miss half of a 20-40% move in oil after all!

""Here is a cost estimate for you to review.  This assumes that you make your minimum payment for February on time.  The goal would be to close March 15th so you can avoid making a March and April payment.  Your first payment would be due on May 1st.  The payoff of your loan would also include all of the shortage that you are currently catching up on in your escrow account.  To me this is a no brainer as you will not only lower your rate to 3.75%, lower payment from $1857 to $1728 but you also get caught up on escrow and skip to payments.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  This would start your loan over for 30 years and the rate would be fixed.  If you are good with everything I will lock in the rate tomorrow and order the loan disclosures for you to sign.  Thanks for taking the call and I look forward to saving you guys some money!""

My husband said the mortgage company will pick up the closing costs and we get to skip two house payments. Obviously that sounds too good to be true to me. What's in it for the lender? Just that they get to resell the loan and retain us as customers?

I did a small amount of work for this company during 2014 and a few days of work must have crossed over into 2015.

My question - Do I need to amend my return over the additional $82 in wages? What would happen if I didn't amend this? Would the IRS just send me a bill for the difference in taxes/wages plus a fee for not paying/filing accurately or is the penalty more severe/different?",finance,1455128299

Last summer I was lucky enough to bag a really well paying internship. My last paystub showed approximately $22,000 gross. On top of that, I made about $3,700 working at my school, $25,700 in all. After state and fed, I would be left with ~$16,000 which is around what I was planning on. I would still need some Fasfa (pell grant) to pay for school and I was planning on that as well.

This week my W-2 from the internship arrived showing my gross at $45,000!! I called HR who said that they grossed up around $12,000 for housing and relocation and another $10,000 for taxes on the housing and relocation. I expected some gross up but $12,000 for three months in a two person apartment split by four people and a $1,700 relocation stipend?? Not to mention the tax portion of the gross up being around 95%. My with-holdings were proportionally increased but because of the new tax bracket I am essentially left with slightly less net income than before and with no Fasfa.

Am I not understanding, this correctly? Am I somehow going to get paid the $23,000 difference that I would be taking home I had truly made $48,000 gross? Payroll is going to call me eventually (it's a slow process) to discuss this, but I don't want to necessarily tell them to change it if I am going to make the $23,000, which would more than compensate for the pell grant.

personalfinance,W-4 mixup,"Background:
I started a job on July 21, 2014 making 16/h and was bumped to 18/h in may of the following year after my employee review. I filed as a #2 on my W-4 (I didn't know any better / I didn't know I was ""doing it wrong"").

Fast forward to today. I received an email from my uncle who does my family's taxes and he is saying that I owe $2,133, I only withheld 4% on my federal withholding. 

During my stay in high school, I never learned how to do taxes, budget anything nor any other *life lessons* that I've had to suck it up and deal with in life. I have no idea how to properly read my pay stub so I don't know how much social security is supposed to take or my federal withholding. 

I built up a savings account and its at about 2600$ right now from just putting in random tid bits of money + 75$ every month. This tax refund/payment is going to basically wipe my savings account dry and that worries me heavily. I live with 2 roommates but it is 100% me. I'm single, no kids, I have a loan on a motorcycle with 3100$ left on it.

What are my options? To have 2k just taken from my account terrifies the living hell out of me.

Edit: I just got an email back from our AP.
My error was that another employee sent a W4 change and I inadvertantly changes your exemptions in error. Bi change yours from single and 2 to married and 4. I sincerely apologize for my error anon. I wish more employees were diligent about checking their pay stubs because I am not perfect and I so make mistakes I looked back and on your 1/23/15 paycheck you were still claiming s-2 so the federal withholding was 130.52$ but then on your 2/6/15 paycheck it has been changed to M-4 and your federal withholding was only 47.38$
At the end of the day though there is nothing to be corrected on my part as you were still paid the correct amount of wages throughout the year. It's just that in your case, there was just less federal tax withheld all year. Which is why you are having to pay more at tax time. The IRS gets what they have coming to them based on your wages earned. So whether you are giving them more or less throughout the year from your pay checks, they get it all squared up on your tax return.",finance,1455134329

investing,The Case for Buying BAC - Stock Analysis,"Hey r/Investing! I've been following BAC (Bank of America) for the past month or two trying to determine if it's worthy of going long in for at least a few years. After doing some reading and some personal analysis I've come to the conclusion that it is.

**NOTE: This isn't a post specifically telling you to buy BAC, but rather an exercise for myself in making well thought-out investment decisions.**

Continuing on, let's first look at the risk currently associated with buying banking stock:

 **1. BAC's exposure to oil.**  With the oil glut investors are scared about investing in bank stocks in general because they are worried about the associated risk of that bank having to deal with defaults on loans given to oil and natural gas ventures. If we take a look at BAC's loans (and the wider banking industry in general), this kind of debt only makes up roughly 3% of their loan portfolio, meaning exposure to this kind of risk is fairly minimal.

**2. BAC is a well capitalized bank.** This is an important factor when I consider both BAC's resistance to toxic debt and it's ability to continue capital disbursements^1. If we take a look at BAC's capital ratios we find that it beats every regulation placed upon it by at least a percentage point. To be defined as a well-capitalized bank it must have an asset-to-capital ratio of 10% of Tier 1 Common Capital (defined as common equity, retained earnings, goodwill, etc). It has 11.6%. Article 1 explains this concept further. This means that it can continue capital distributions (dividends, bonus pays, etc) and is not subject to additional restrictions by banking regulators.

**Aside:** While considering point number two under risk analysis we must consider the fact that having high capital-to-asset ratios also means that BAC has to operate with essentially less leverage which potentially harms it's long term earnings prospect.

Now let's talk about how BAC stock is currently deeply discounted compared to it's potential growth, keeping in mind that we are talking about a 2-3 year hold horizon at the minimum, current shares are trading at around 54% book value. Couple this with a P/E of 9.20 (roughly 1 less than the industry standard) and a PEG ratio .86 indicates that, fundamentally, BAC is a value buy^2.

Now we know that value traps are a thing to look out for. It's not enough for a stock to look under priced. It has to have a real, tangible, convincing probability of growth in the future that doesn't justify this low price. I think this probability exists when we consider that the economy is at full employment and real wages are finally start to see an increase (even if it's modest). BAC's primary earnings come from a strong domestic presence which means is stands to gain from improvements in the aforementioned metrics. Not only does high employment (currently pegged at around 4.6%) and higher wages mean more saving, but it also means more spending. In an economy such as this, people can justify car and home loans that they couldn't a mere five years ago. Furthermore, despite international turmoil, the Fed has indicated it's continuing it's plan to raise rates. This stands to improve BACs earnings even further.

All in all, this analysis, to me, justifies taking a long position in BAC. I myself am considering picking up 100 shares this week. (I have very little capital to work with currently, so I'd grab more if I could)

What are your thoughts? Are there things I have overlooked?

personalfinance,Should I stop investing in order to pay off my debt (29M),"I take home around $3100/month and put $50/month into a Roth IRA and save $200/month into an emergency fund.  I contribute 6% of my income to my 401k (my employer matches 3% of annual income).  The rest of my money goes towards fixed costs of living expenses and debt repayment.  I currently have $1700 in savings.

Debts:
Card 1 (1500$ @ 0% APR until December then 29.99%) Minimum payment of $55
Card 2 (1500$ @ 0% APR until May then 12.99%) Minimum of $50 but paying $300/month
Card 3 (7000$ @ 3.25% APR) Minimum of $100

Federal Student Loan (33k @ 5.25%)  Payment of $240

I'm going to use the avalanche method to pay off the high interest credit cards with 0 APR first.  Now I have a couple questions:

1) Should I stop saving $200/month into savings and only keep $1000 in an emergency fund while paying off debt?
2) Should I drop my 401k contribution to 3% (which will add $100/month to my paycheck) and withhold from investing in my Roth IRA ($50/month)?
3) After paying off the high interest credit cards which debt should I focus on next, the higher interest student loan or the low APR credit card?
4) Do I focus on aggressively paying off my debt until I don't have any more? How long to I keep being aggressive (meaning, how long do I only keep $1000 and not put anymore into an emergency savings).

Notably is the section on Roth conversion:

&gt; The back door Roth IRA contribution strategy first became feasible in 2010, when the income limits on Roth conversions were first removed. Previously, those with high income could not make a Roth IRA contribution, nor convert a traditional IRA into a Roth. With the new rules, though, it became possible for high-income individuals ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA to instead contribution to a non-deductible traditional IRA and complete a Roth conversion of those dollars – effectively achieving the goal of a Roth IRA contribution through the “back door”.

&gt; Arguably, completing a backdoor Roth IRA contribution was already at risk of IRS challenge if the contribution and subsequent conversion are done in quick succession, but the proposal in the Treasury Greenbook would crack down further by outright limiting a Roth conversion to only the pre-tax portion of an IRA. Thus, a non-deductible (after-tax) contribution to a traditional IRA would no longer be eligible for a Roth conversion at all (nor any existing after-tax dollars in the account).

&gt; Notably, a matching provision would apply to limit conversions of after-tax dollars in a 401(k) or other employer retirement plan as well, limiting the “super backdoor Roth” contribution strategy that was made possible by IRS Notice 2014-54.

&gt; If enacted, the new rule would simply prevent any new Roth conversions of after-tax dollars after the effective date of the new legislation.

I’m trying to get my finances in order and would love some help. Without boring you with the details of my corporate zombie life, I:

* am a 27-year old male with few living expenses (~$1000)
* made some mistakes in college
* graduated with $50,000 in federal loans
* and $8600 in 12% ‘loan’ / overdue account from the University
* got a salaried job recently, paying $43,500 / yr
* have $1300 unspoken for after $300 / mo in loans


I hit two milestones today. As of midnight, I have three months’ expenses in my emergency fund. Also, after a year of using a secured credit card, I was approved for a big boy credit card. I chose a Chase Freedom, since I read that my credit (699 / 690 @ Credit Karma) is the low end of acceptable for them and I have successfully banked with them for 6 years. The card has 0% interest for a year, 1% cash back, and a $2500 limit for me.

Here’s the question: How do I get that damn 12% loan off of my back fastest? Do I:

* Use $2,000 of my security fund today, and pay my $1300 a month directly to the loan?
* Use my $2500 limit CC and 1% (and $150 opening bonus) to pad the 2.75% credit card transaction fee from the university? I believe I have 0% interest for 12 months.
* Get a private education loan at 8, 8.5% for the remainder of the balance [if I can?]
* All of the above? Combinations of the above?

As of right now, the $8600 to the university is not reported on my credit. If I get a private loan, it will report that I have more debt. Also, putting that amount on my credit will do the same, but only to my credit limit. That shouldn’t affect me for the near future.

Every time I pay the minimum, it doesn't seem the balance is getting smaller. With those interest rates, it only looks higher. I feel like I'm becoming enslaved by the debt I idiotically ended up having. What are steps I can take to pay this off quick? I know the obvious answer would be to pay way higher than the minimum, but that would be really hard with my measly income. If you all have any options that I can take to get rid of this load a little quicker, please let me know. I am a little desperate at this point, as this is hurting my credit score quite badly.

investing,Can't wait until the Bernie Sanders fans find out the fed is paying money to the big banks.,"Since they can't manipulate excess reserves anymore (because there is too much in the system), the fed literally has to pay the big banks on their excess reserves. It's been happening for a while, but at 25 bps it wasn't that much money and not many people noticed. Now that they have started to raise short term interest rates, by offering a higher rate on excess reserves... the amount they pay could start getting up into the tens of billions. I joked with a coworker a couple months ago about how politicians will love this, and sure enough in Yellen's testimony today we saw those pesky politicians start to grill her for it.

It is now in collections and I got a notice that my state tax refund will be relinquished to be applied to that loan. I was told by my university that I can either do $50 payments for 9 months and get the loan off my credit report or consolidate that loan into my other loans. I have some with student assistance foundation as well. My first question is whether I can consolidate with student assistance foundation?

Also, in 2017, I want to apply for a student loan but was denied in Feb 2014","I want to improve my credit score as a safety net when I get into nursing school at a local community college and apply for a private student loan (estimating that I'll need $10k). I have no one to co-sign for me or give me cash on the whim. I'm doing this all on my own and I am worried as hell that I will get denied again.



I'm going to need a student loan in August 2017 or possibly January 2018 but I was denied in February 2014 (private loan with Navient). I was super broke so I made some late payments on my credit cards. I had to withdraw in the middle of my program because I had no funds. I don't want to repeat that again. So, I got a whatever job to pay the bills and haven't missed a credit card payment so far. Also, I have hella student loans that I don't even want to talk about. But I am in deferment.




Current credit card debt:

*CC1: $1645 / credit line $2000 / 15.24%V interest

*CC2: $3180 / credit line $5000 / 14.49%V interest

*CC3: no balance / credit line $450 / 23.49%V interest

*CC4: $1300 / credit line $1500 / 0.0% promotional interest rate (which ends in July 2016 and would then be @ 23.24%V)



My current take-home monthly income: $1900

Bills &amp; living cost: $1300



I've contacted my credit cards and they said that at this time they cannot lower my interest rate and cannot tell me exactly why and that they will be mailing me info about that.




I will be eligible to apply for the program in the summer but I want to give myself time to save up and pay for my classes ($8k), bills, and living cost ($24k for 18 months, but I'm planning to get a part-time weekend job once I'm in).
I hope to save around 10k by August 2017 but we all know that shit happens so I'm thinking I'll need the loan to be about $12-14k.




*Will paying off one of my credit cards ($1300 before the 0.0% promotional rate ends) improve my credit score (currently at 686) and get me approved for a student loan in the future?

*What will get me approved? I have no one to co-sign for me. I'm doing this all on my own.

personalfinance,Interest rates,"This was brought to my attention in a earlier post. I thought I had a good idea, and looked at the per month expense of interest rates. For example:

* Credit Card 1: $1,000 x 25% apr = $250/year = aprox $20.8/month
* Credit Card 2: $5,000 x 20% apr = $1000/year = aprox $83.3/month

Now, seeing this (assuming we are using the credit card, the interest rate stays the same, and we are paying a little more than the interest rate) wouldn't it make more sense to start putting more money to card 2 because it is costing more per month until the cost of interest per month is roughly the same as card 1?

This is only looking at it as the most efficient way to pay, not ""avalanche"" or ""highest interest rate first"", I'm just looking for hard, cold, money facts!

Eventually I was able to turn into his parking garage but before I could dial his number into the callbox to open up the garage he met me at the entrance and jumped into my car. Now this is where I honestly messed up, instead of having my brother open up the parking garage and going into the garage and making a u-turn, then driving back out on the road I saw a small gap between two cars on the road in front of the garage and thought I could drive through it. I put my car in reverse and started driving back very slowly. Unfortunately I didn't have enough space and I tapped bumpers with the driver of a 2000 Camry. I immediately got out and assessed the damage of both our cars and everything looked ok. No bumps, scratches or anything. As soon as the driver of the Camry got out I started apologizing profusely telling her that I didnt mean to hit her car but everything seemed ok. She responded by screaming at me and calling me stupid and an idiot. She then pointed to a small discoloration on her bumper and said ""look at what you did to my car!"". I honestly didn't see the small discoloration on her bumper and really don't know if it was there before or after I tapped bumpers with her. She threatened to call the police and then offered to make me a deal. She said she could take her car somewhere and have it ""buffed out"" but it would cost about $150.

I have recently been having problems with my Hydroponic System. It was constructed in June 2015. Its Water fed with a 3100 Litres an hour Pump from a twenty gallon water tank. In June 2015 it was having three feeds every 7 hours. Each feed lasted 10 minutes. I was checking the Ph every day and Changing the water once a week and using a Organic Sea weed food. As well as small amounts of Ph Down when needed. 

&amp;nbsp;

The frame is  constructed out of box steel. On top of that lies a Ply wood back. Followed by PVC pond liner. Onto that is a layer of Felt ( Recycled Clothes ). Followed by a leaky Hose as shown in the Photos.
Then the final Layer of Felt. 
Finally i cut small 5 -10 cm slits into the first layer. Which is where the plants with as little dirt as possible where placed Then staples into position ( like little pockets )  As you can see from the photos.

&amp;nbsp;

Thing is its now it's February. Winter in London and the wall has currently moved house. In the last month and half i've had some major problems concerning the healthiness of the wall.
I have obviously drastically changed watering times to once every 2 weeks to a month. If that. Normally just when the root mass seems dry. 

&amp;nbsp;

My leaky hose too seems to be filled with algae as it does not appear to be as porous as it once was. ( but that seems easy to clean up with some ATA Clean irrigation additive )
I have seen  few small black bugs flying about and red up about Fungus Gnats but i am not sure its them yet. ( Even if it was can they change the wall so drastically and that quickly )

&amp;nbsp;

My window is Pretty much South Facing so i get Sun during the morning. I then Have Three Fluorescent Grow friendly lights form 20 - 40 Watts as well as a small 30 Watt L.E.D Grow light. 
So i do boost there light in take when i can but they also get a full eight hour sleep like i do. 

&amp;nbsp;

In the walls prime i took out three Pothos plants and two Calethea Due to the wall over crowding and to give space for others to flourish. 

&amp;nbsp;

In the last few months due to the wall slowly deteriorating i toke out  three Hedra Helix Ivy which never did too good and where dyeing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Two maidenhair ferns  where also taken out due to them being hard work and never looking as good as when they where bought. 

&amp;nbsp;

There are three Sword Tongue ferns  which too are looking like there on there last legs and still on the wall. 

&amp;nbsp;

The wall pretty much consists of Calethea Stromanthe, Pothos and Horse Tongue ferns. 

&amp;nbsp;

My room also is between 12 - 18 Degrees Celsius but 
I have fern's,  Potho's and Calethea's in my house and there doing fine.  

&amp;nbsp;

So now thats over. Can anyone Help me with suggesting what could be going on ?

stocks,A Bird in the Hand or Two in the Bush?,"I wrote a lengthy email to a friend, and I thought I would share it with reddit since it took so long to write. Please feel free to comment regarding any errors or disagreements. The initial purpose of this was to communicate my general concerns to her. The content reflects my opinions and should not be considered investment advice.

The basic concept is elementary. Are you familiar with the saying, ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?"" Let's change the saying to ""A dollar in the hand is worth two tomorrow.""

Put it this way, if you had $1 today, how much would I have to pay you next year for you to lend me that $1? The price you name will (or at least SHOULD) include two variables. The interest you require should include compensation for waiting and for risk.

Let's say you were willing to charge me 2% for waiting (roughly the 10 year treasury yield) and 8% for risk (considered risk premium relative to treasury yield). So the following year I would pay you $1.10.

Let's go back to the analogy of the birds.

If you had a bird in your hand, and I had two birds in a bush in my back yard, would you give me your one bird for a chance to catch the two birds on my property?

This isn't a trick question. The answer requires an evaluation of risk, just like before.

The saying, ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,"" assumes risk of roughly 50%. If you were an average bird hunter, and consistently captured 50% of the birds you attempted to catch, then any quantity in the bush is worth 50%. Therefor 50% of 2 = 1. Isn't that an exciting concept?! Haha hang in there. This is an important concept, and it might be priceless for you in the future.

Now let's say you were Tarzan, and you had a success rate of 80% when trying to capture any bird. The two birds in the bush would be worth roughly 80% of their value. Roughly 1.6 birds. Now, the birds in the bush are worth more than the single bird in your hand. In this case it would be wise for you to give me your one bird, so you could capture more than what you gave me.

The inverse is true. If you are a terrible bird catcher with a 20% (80% risk) success rate, the two birds in the bush are worth .4 birds (20% of 2). Now the bird in the hand is worth more than twice the birds in the bush.

The basic idea is that risk changes the value of the birds in the bush. Low risk favors the bush, and high risk favors the hand. A low risk economy favors future earnings and growth, and a high risk economy favors cash in the hand.

The problem with calculating risk is that we can be wrong or it can change once we have made our calculation. If you thought you were an awesome bird catcher, but you weren't, you might surrender your one bird and receive less than 1 back. Or let's say you surrender your one bird and trip on something and break your leg before you can catch the birds. Now risk has changed and your birds in the bush are worth 0.

Going back to the market. If investing in the economy becomes more risky after you've already invested your $1 in the hand, then the value of $2 next year goes down (This means that stock prices go down. Remember, buying stocks is buying the future earnings of those companies). If investing in the market becomes very risky, cash today becomes more valuable.

Interest rates and corporate bond yields reflect risk. That's why it's called ""risk premium."" So if corporate bonds or junk bonds or the bond market as a whole demand a higher risk premium due to high losses or uncertainty, the current price of stocks should go down.

Warren Buffett says that high interest rates makes stocks worthless. “If interest rates were 10 percent, all of our stocks would be worthless. Everything is a function of interest rates. Interest rates are like gravity.” Here's a link to the article if you're interested in that. http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141007-warren-buffett-says-high-interest-rates-make-stocks-worthless.ece

It's important to make a distinction between waiting and risk. The US treasury sells 10 year securities, commonly called 10 year treasuries, and this is considered 0% risk. If an investment requires 0% risk, then the interest paid is considered payment for waiting. Now it's important to also subtract the 10 year treasury yield from any loan or corporate bond when calculating the risk premium. Remember, the risk premium is what you get paid for taking risk. The 10 year treasury yield is what you get paid for waiting just like in the example I gave earlier when I borrowed $1. So if your neighbor Joe borrows money at 10%, you subtract the 10 year treasury yield since it's the only risk free instrument.

The Federal Reserve has tried to suppress all bond yields (corporate, government, and other loans or bonds) artificially to promote investing in the economy. The problem with this is that risk has not really changed. Remember, interest rates should reflect two variables, time and risk. The Federal Reserve can't decrease risk to lower interest rates. But it can control treasury yields (through quantitative easing [QE] and .5% fed funds rate), the price for waiting.

If you wanted to invest with a goal of 10% a year for retirement or other purposes, different market conditions offer different options. If the price of waiting offered to you was high, let's say 8%, you would only need to adopt risk premium of 2% to achieve your goal. If the price of waiting was low, let's say 2%, you would need to adopt a risk premium of 8%. So, in effect, changing the price of time changes the risk implied by your goals. That's why stocks have done so well and lower risk bonds have yielded much lower than previous years.

So the market environment today is hungry for yield. This has pushed investors and companies to take on more risk. And I think that this risk is being underestimated. Remember, if risk is miscalculated, you can pay 1 bird and get less than one bird back.

We'll see how everything unfolds. Take care for now.",finance,1455195620

So its pretty funny that the Fed Bought all those zero value MBS and weird stuff at top dollar, rated AAA of course, then kept the payment on its own books and did not allow the Banks to withdraw that money, but paid an interest greater than its fund rate, and the banks got to declare that as reserves and pocket the interest, all going towards their so called Capital Adequacy Ratio . . .oh Yeah . .told you so :D

Pretty cool.

But I will bet the Fed has over leveraged that and wound it up a bit so that $2.3 trillion is appearing multiple times on various banks books and if you were to total the declared reserves of all the banks at the Fed, it would add up to  whole lot more than what the Fed is good for. ;D

Which is ok, so long as a single bank goes pop, but when another sector wide shock crystallizes, like oil or some goobly gook loans, thats when that leverage becomes a pretty big problem.

I've recently opened an account with Navy Federal Credit Union and am considering switching and doing my banking with them. I am unable to find much information online comparing the two banks (I'm likely looking in the wrong place). 

So I would like to know if anyone could share their experience with Navy Federal or give insight of which bank is the better option. Also would it make sense for me to keep my Wells Fargo account open?",finance,1455207451

personalfinance,PSA about overdraft protection - maybe my mistake can help someone!,"Hi all. I don't know if this is specific to Chase bank, but I wanted to share my recent mistake in the hopes that it helps someone else. So I have a checking account at a bank where I also have a CC. Apparently, my CC is my safety net in the occurrance of an overdraft. I don't remember signing up for this, so I imagine it was in fine print somewhere. First example of me being an idiot. 

Second instance of me being an idiot: I use venmo and transferred 400 dollars to my roommate. It took it from my Chase account, and not my other checking account. I overdrafted in the amount of 300 dollars. So Chase now transfers that 300 dollars to my CC debt, considers it a cash advance, and even though I have 0% APR on my current credit, that 300 dollars has a 25% interest rate. 

Third way I'm an idiot: that CC has $2000 in debt on it. The lovely r/personalfinance sub is helping me get out of that stupid debt, but it's a reality. That $300 overdraft protection amount is now at the proverbial ""end"" of my debt. I have to pay off that $2000 to get to the $300, otherwise that $300 racks up 25% interest every month...despite the $2000 racking up $0. 

So now, my options are to pay off the $2000 immediately to pay off the $300 or eat the interest. I have the cash and I'm going to pay it, but it is a huge dent in my emergency fund. 

1. Read the fine print 
2. Maybe don't use venmo, in general 
3. Don't rack up credit card debt you can't pay off 
4. things that sound great, like overdraft protection, maybe aren't the best. I would have preferred the card being declined and/or a smaller fee.",finance,1455208676

I'm sorry if that sounds silly, but I wasn't sure if my residency would throw something off.

personalfinance,Convince me that Bank of America is not the best place to keep my money,"Bank of America receives poor reviews and most people around here prefer Ally, Schwab, Fidelity, or a credit union.  I have researched all of these options and have concluded that Bank of America is still the best bank for me, but I am open to being convinced otherwise.

I think it is best to evaluate a checking, savings, and investment account as part of a complete financial package and not in a vacuum.

Checking advantages of Ally, Schwab, Fidelity, etc.:  reimbursed ATM fees, no maintenance fees, free checks.

These advantages are matched from Bank of America through its Preferred Rewards Platinum Honors.  The disadvantage is that I have to keep $100,000 with Bank of America, but Merrill Edge counts so I could keep my IRA and taxable accounts there.  Platinum Honors also gives up to 100/month free equity and ETF trades.

When taking into account the 75% rewards bonus it creates a very competitive credit card for general use: BankAmericard Travel Rewards Visa Signature ($0 AF) - 2.625% back on everything.  I could then supplement with one additional card such as one of these:

 - BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Signature ($0 AF): 3.75% gas, 2.75% groceries.
 - Bank of America AAA Member Rewards Visa Signature ($0 AF): 3.75% AAA/travel, 2.75% groceries/drug store.
 - Barclay SallieMae ($0 AF): 5% online shopping, restaurants, online travel.

In order to exceed these benefits it requires using multiple cards for fairly specific categories of spending or paying attention to rotating categories.  My monthly spend is not that high so micro-managing more than two cards is not worth it to me.  I would be open to any combination of two cards that has a better overall value.

The advantages of this setup:

 - Easy to transfer funds between accounts.
 - Physical branches if I ever need it  (notary, etc.).
 - Cash ATM deposits.  I realize I could keep $1,500 at Bank of America to avoid the monthly fee and then transfer the money into another checking account, but there has to be an advantage to the other account to make this frequent inconvenience worth it.
 - Convenance of having all of my major accounts at one financial institution.

Disadvantages:

 - ATM fees on foreign transactions.  However, the Travel Rewards card has no foreign transaction fee and I’ve never traveled internationally.  Schwab checking has no foreign ATM fees and no minimum balance so I could keep an empty account and transfer money if I plan to travel internationally.
 - Poor interest rate on savings for emergency fund.  If I kept $20,000 in an Ally savings account I could earn 1% ($200/year).  However, I am at the point where I don’t think I need to keep that much in an FDIC-insured account.  If I invested my emergency fund in a conservative ETF I could earn more than 1% and still liquidate quickly if I needed $10,000+ in cash.  I have a charge card I could immediately use for $10,000+ while waiting on the transfers.  I can’t think of a scenario where this would cause a problem.

I think this setup is extremely convenient day-to-day while still retaining competitive rewards.  Am I missing anything that would make other options a superior choice?",finance,1455209907

investing,Gold Explodes Higher on Sweden Negative Rate Move,"*See us on the Fox Business channel today to discuss the currents markets today during the 5pm (ET) ""Risk and Reward"" show with Dierdre Bolton.*

**Equities:** The MAR16 SP500 is down 20 points to 1827.50, after spiking lower to 1802.50. The 2 major news points in the past 24 hours seem to be Janet Yellen’s testimony and Q&amp;A yesterday in front of Congress not inspiring confidence in the markets as well as the Swedish Central Bank bringing their rates further into negative territory. 1800 still seems to be a key support level, but 1760 looks like a more important support level. Technically, the market clearly seems to be downtrending.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds exploded higher overnight, hitting an intraday high of 170’26. Currently, the bonds are down 2 points from the high at 168’26. As we have been noting, it looks like we could be in a type of bond bubble.

**FX:** The MAR16 USD is down .3% today to 95.65. One would think if other central banks are lowering rates, the USD should rally. That is not actually happening though. This may be because the market may be starting to price in the Fed going into negative rate territory. The MAR16 Euro continues its rally above the 200 day moving average.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI is down another 2.7% to $26.70. There is seemingly no end in sight for this oil bear market. All major support levels over the past several months have been easily breached. The real big story of today’s commodity markets is gold. Gold continues its blistering rally, up $48 today to $1242. The negative interest rate policies of various central banks is really stoking demand for gold. $1220, once a key resistance level, may now be a key support level.

I've had lots of student loans to pay back, but they're all well on track, so my savings are up to about $12k now. I can save about $1,000 additionally a month. I already contribute to my 401k to receive my employer's maximum match as well (6% from me, 3% from my employer).

personalfinance,Leasing a Car vs. Buying,"Hey, guys. I was just wondering your thoughts. Generally, as I do my homework, it seems like leasing is frowned upon (I see the word ""scam"" tossed around a lot).

What I don't see mentioned a lot are maintenance discussions. If I buy a cheap $3,000 car it will probably last me 2 years before I am putting in $1,000 - $1,500 in repair costs (for whatever reasons). Maybe buying $3,000 cars is my problem, but going out and spending $30,000 is not an option.

Every time I'm dropping a lump-sum payment of $400 - $1,000 at a repair shop because my distribution cap wore out (or whatever the problem may be), I kick myself for not leasing for $150/month flat (assuming I do my homework on mileage, interest rate, gap insurance, etc).

Assume I can go out and buy a decent car for $3,000. Or I could take that $3,000 and lease a car?

I'd just like to hear some feedback. Specifically when taking into account the cost of maintenance on owned vehicles.

personalfinance,Regarding mileage deduction for a sold vehicle- Turbo Tax did not inform me they were changing my filing,"Hello Reddit!

I work as a sales representative. I drive 30kish miles a year. 25k of those are business miles. 

I sold a vehicle in December 2015 (trade in in purchase of new vehicle to use for work). I owned the vehicle in full prior to selling it. 

In the past I've always used the standard mileage rate for deducting non-reimbursed miles.  (.56 this year). 

I went through Turbo Tax and it let me deduct my miles like usual and when I clicked through to submit my return it told me I would get a combined $5200. I then checked the status of my return a week later and noticed that number was much lower and didn't include the mileage of my vehicle that I sold. Before I clicked submit it showed the $5,200 refund amount. After you get far enough the $ amount disappeared from the screen and they changed it after the fact. I double checked it on my return before clicking submit too and it showed the full amount. I have it documented. 

Apparently when I told TurboTax I sold the vehicle (12/15), it went back (with no notification) and changed the ownership of the vehicle to that I never owned it, not that I owned it and sold it. It did not change the ""refund amount"" to adjust for this.  

First Question- Am I still allowed to use the federal mileage deduction for a vehicle I owned but sold during the year? Or do I HAVE to use actual $ spent on gas, oil changes, tolls, etc.  

Second Question- After spending two hours on the phone with Turbotax and then getting disconnected they told me they would ""reimburse"" my filing fees. I now need to amend my return. I put alot of depreciation on my car and the extra 3 grand helps pay down my new car payment for the mileage I put on it.

I owe $700 on a charge account (used for emergency dental procedures), on a $3,300 limit. Before today, I was utilizing just under 60% of my available credit, all added up. 

2. I got the credit card this past June, when my credit score was about 690, according to creditkarma. I planned on being responsible with the cc and using it as a credit building tool, but I got incredibly stupid/spend happy. Now I have next to nothing to show for it, and that's all on me. Since then, my credit score has dropped from about 690 to less than 620. I am assuming this is because I was utilizing 60% of my available credit.

3. Today, I received my tax return money. I received about $2300. I made a monthly payment for my dentist charge account, and then paid $2200 toward my $3000 cc balance. As of now, I owe about $800 on my cc, and my interest rates increase to 22.9% on the 18th of next month. How fast do you think my credit score will rise since I've cut down my 60% credit utilization to about 24%?

The reason I ask, is that I want to make as little a monthly  payment as possible since this is a financially busy next few months for me, because I want to knock that $700 charge account balance out asap, I have my brother's wedding go to out of town in June, and I need to get my driver's license back as soon as financially possible (about $700 for reinstatement fees). I want to get approved for another credit card to transfer the balance to, so that I can hopefully buy time and keep payments on that balance to around $30 a month or so. 

Does anyone have any idea on how fast my credit score will rise? Also, how about a credit card that will be good for me to transfer an $800 balance on? Any and all advice or thought is so much appreciated. Thank you for reading.

Until now we have relied on megabanks to set monetary policy for the world but there are signs that a titanic meltdown may be happening within that furnace.

It's use of a public ledger and necessary transition to a deflationary and fee-based economy has caused criticism, but there is likely a bright future ahead of it (cue the trolls badgering me about sidechains).  
  
**Ethereum**: a Blockchain purporting to use its tokens as programmable nodes in a cloud computer.  It's value has been on a tear lately, and despite having initially sold as an IPO (something many in the community find distasteful) it has been publicly supported by both Nick Szabo and Microsoft.  
  
**Monero**: The largest current Cryptonote implementation, it was the first major Blockchain to add privacy and anonymity into a decentralized and digital Blockchain.  It is tiny at the moment but arguably has the most advanced financial technology in the entire world.  
  
**[Tangle-based Ideas]**:  there are some new currencies that are aiming to work via a new method that doesn't use a Blockchain at all, but I have not fully reviewed them and they are very new concepts.  
  
**[Zerocash]**: the strongest form of cryptocurrency that we have ever invented is actually a little too strong as currency destroying bugs might be undetectable, a non-zero number of trusted parties is required at Genesis, and it is untested cryptography.  Nevertheless research into this continues.  
  
**[R3]**:  Blythe Masters, JP Morgan, and everyone else involved in this are attempting to take Bitcoin and turn it into a 'shared spreadsheet' which is a catastrophic waste of time and money.  A reversible Blockchain that uses trust is the same thing we have now, and defeats the entire point.  They are basically marveling at the Internet, and have decided to reinvent cable television based off of it.

*Income

*Growth and Income

*Growth

*Aggressive Growth

Under each category there are different options for a percentage of investment. I've seemed to come across the idea that if I'm younger and planning to retire around the average age - I should be placing a majority of my investments into Income. I've also found that spreading yourself a little bit is better to reduce your chance of risk. 

I'm also curious how many distributions some people might make - there is a $50 fee for each distribution. 2-5? 10-15?

A few other things that may influence.

* I am 22 years of age

* I imagine retiring around 60

* I may not be with my current company within the next 5 years

* (Edit) My company is matching up to 3%

So last year we decided that we needed to look into buying a home at some point. These are the steps we've taken.

In April we desperately needed a car as one of ours died. We had no emergency fund at this point as I lost a job a few months prior and we burned through what we had just surviving until i got a new job. Credit score was around 520's. Credit Union told us to take whatever we could get if we absolutely needed it, and refinance later. Best we could get is 17%. We chose a cheap but reliable brand new car with a good service warranty. All used cars we saw would have put us in the 25% rates and would have cost us the roughly the same as a new. But we needed the reliability. 

I'm currently renting a home for $1100. I have a stable job as does my wife. As you see above we have one car payment with a high interest rate. Our credit cards are used for food, gas and utilities only, they are paid off monthly completely. My wife has 2 cards, I have 1 but I am a authorized user on one of her cards. We started getting the cards in October and have now had a nice credit limit increase. meaning our Utilization is now under 10%. That's where we will keep it. 

* Bankruptcy in 2011, all debt discharged
* Bought a new car w high interest rate in April 2015
* Credit union offering to refinance the car to a much lower rate (sub %5) 
* Got first credit cards in Oct 2015 with a low limit, Now it's 10x higher.
* Misc debt is a credit loan rebuilder program via Credit Union. $1K CD which I make monthly payments to. 



So our rental lease is up in September and we can't renew it. So either we rent, again elsewhere, or finally buy a home. Obviously credit score helps with the home buying process so we've been frantically trying to repair what we can.

    Credit Questions : 

What would you do to continue rebuilding my credit? If I refinance that car I potentially get a dip in credit score for a time period (Unknown how long). But my payment would go down drastically, meaning more money saved per month, and reduces my debt/income ratio.

I'm considering getting another card with better rewards? I'm unsure how this will help but it should help with my utilization. I'd prefer to spread my bills over multiple cards. Credit score simulators show maybe a 2 point gain. 

    Home Buyer Questions : 


In August I can withdraw $2,000 from my Credit Union's CDs. I'm counting this as my ""down payment saved"" But in reality I might have to move July/August and might not have access to these funds. 

I would rather not burn through my emergency fund again for a down payment. My wife's job offers an Employer Homebuyer Assistance program which provides forgivable loans (grants after a period) towards a home purchase. According to a coworker they covered all closing, down payment, misc costs in the home buying process. 

I gain roughly $2200 back from security deposit when I move out. I have not counted this month anywhere. 

We were looking at FHA loans, with the possibility of a down payment grant but then we would be dealing with PMI fee's. I'm going to be spending a lot of money this year regardless of what I do. I have to move. Rentals keep going up in price. 

**What would you do?** What steps should I take? Do I start talking to the Realtors/assistance program now, or two months from now. Do I refinance the car as soon as possible, or wait it out. I'm receiving offers for %7 right now, CU tells me they'll give me much lower if I wait out the whole year which is in April. 

I'm plan to look for homes in the $150k-$280k range. Just unsure what my next steps are.

My husband and I have kind of hit a stand-still where he wants to start trying for a baby, and while I wouldn't love anything more, I'm scared because of all the debt we have! That being said, I'm also afraid to wait too long to start trying and that we will NEVER be debt free. This is sort of a two-part question. 

I'm pretty familiar with the debt-avalanche/debt-snowball and hope to use that to start paying down some debt but I'm just hoping i'm not missing something. 

**Our Income/Our bills**: Our monthly after-taxes/retirement/health insurance income is approximately $7500 
We have a mortgage which is $2150 per month
Monthly payments (gas, electric, cable, etc) totals $400
I have 3 student loans with interest rates 5%-6.5%, totalling 30k with monthly minimum payments total $350
We also have approximately $900 in minimum credit card payments (see next)

**My Big issue, CREDIT cards**: We have 3 credit cards which i'm sorry to say have higher balances that I could have ever imagined. One has a $4k balance but a 24% interest rate and for that reason is my priority to pay off. The other two total about $36k and have interest rates of 14.3%. 

**My question!** is, should I try to transfer the two credit cards (36k) to a different account with a lower interest rate? I dont know if this is important but they are both pretty way over their credit limit. So I dont even know if thats possible. Should I/ Can I add these balances to my mortgage instead (3.5% interest rate) ? Right now I have over 900$ a month in minimum card payments. Would it be irresponsible to try to have a kid right now?

btc,2016-02-10: I qualified as an expert witness on Bitcoin in federal criminal court in the USA.,"A public defender, for whom I have worked in the past, called me late the week before, asking if I could explain Bitcoin to the judge and jury in a case being tried in federal criminal court in West Palm Beach. (I have not read the government's complaint, but I gather that the case involved alleged drug importation and distribution, paid for with bitcoins.)

This is in addition to a different state criminal case in Miami involving the selling of bitcoins via LocalBitcoins, for which I was hired as an expert witness last year. That one is still awaiting trial.

I was particularly impressed by how well the prosecutor understood Bitcoin. I had expected the usual *Sturm und Drang* that one fears in such situations, but he knew about Gyft, Newegg, Overstock, etc., and was generally positive. Of course, he asked during my cross-examination, whether Bitcoin could be used for illegal activity, and I acknowledged that, like bottles of [Liquid Tide](http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/news/2012/03/15/thieves-stealing-tide-detergent-for-drug-buys.aspx), Bitcoin can be used to purchase illegal goods.

I was fascinated at how interested the jurors were in my testimony. While I was waiting for the IT expert witness for the prosecution ahead of me to finish his testimony, most were reasonably attentive, but some seemed to be a bit distracted. However, once we got past the preliminaries during my testimony, I noticed that they were watching me closely, and nodding as I invoked metaphors like boxes of poker chips that cannot be counterfeited and unimaginably wide spreadsheets that get updated every ten minutes, and described some of the work that my students and I do with Bitcoin entrepreneurs in Africa through Conscious Entrepreneurship Foundation.

All in all, it was pretty straightforward.

personalfinance,How do I calculate ROI on mortgage prepayment?,"I bought a home about 3 years ago. Looking at my monthly statements I'm realizing that my payments are mostly interest at this point (duh). Right now it's about 65:35 (interest:principal). My interest rate pre-tax is 3.75%.

I'm considering doing monthly prepayment for a few years until the payments are closer to 50:50. From what I've read about prepayment, I don't think it makes too much sense if I hold onto the house for the full 30 year mortgage because I can most likely find better than a 3.75% return elsewhere. But if I sell the house in, say, 6 years, I will have paid off a ton of interest and not have that much equity to show for it. In this case it feels like prepayment would be a good move. I do not have a prepayment penalty. I'm just trying to figure out how to calculate the real life ROI on this prepayment ""investment.""

Ripple,Final Settlement with Jed over XRP,"""We know many of you closely follow and have a vested interest in Jed’s XRP holdings, so we want to update you on a new agreement we came to, which fully extricates Jed from Ripple. In summary, the agreement ensures distribution of his XRP holdings against a timetable in service to a healthy, growing Ripple ecosystem with Ripple custodying the holdings itself. Jed has also agreed to sell all of his shares in Ripple, the company.

Jed exited Ripple back when it was OpenCoin in June 2013. He has played no role in the strategy or operations of Ripple since then. He has, however, held significant stakes of XRP and company shares. In August 2014, we shared the terms of a lock-up agreement that dictated timetables and limits within which Jed could sell XRP. The purpose of the agreement was to ensure distribution of his XRP in a way that would be constructive for the Ripple ecosystem. Since April 2015, Jed has been party to ongoing legal action related to alleged violation of the 2014 agreement.

The following are the key points of the new agreement:

Ripple will release any claim it has on the funds currently deposited with the federal District Court for the Northern District of California and Stellar will take possession of these funds.

Jed will donate 2 billion XRP to a charitable donor-advised fund (""DAF"") of his choice. The same limits are placed on the ability of the charity to sell the XRP as are placed on the Jed's ability to sell his remaining XRP. 

All of Jed and his children's remaining XRP, approximately 5.3 billion XRP, will be placed in a custody account at Ripple. While Jed retains full title and ownership of his remaining XRP, Ripple will control the release of his XRP in a manner consistent with the settlement agreement. Specifically, Jed will be allowed to sell his remaining XRP in the following manner:

- for the first year of the agreement Jed and the DAF will be able to collectively sell 0.5 percent of the Average Daily Volume of XRP for each day of the week, including weekends and holidays.* 

- for the second and third years of this agreement, Jed and the DAF will be able to collectively sell for each day of the week 0.75 percent of the Average Daily Volume.

- for the fourth year of the agreement, Jed and the DAF will be able to collectively sell for each day of the week 1.0 percent of the Average Daily Volume.
for any time after the fourth year of the agreement, for each day of the week Jed and the DAF will be able to sell 1.5 percent of the Average Daily Volume.

We at Ripple are pleased with the outcome of this agreement. It provides predictability and clarity about distribution of the largest individual holding of XRP in a way that fosters good health and growth in the Ripple ecosystem. 

*Under the settlement agreement, Average Daily Trading Volume is calculated by dividing the Weekly XRP Trade Volume for the week that commenced two weeks prior to the week at issue by seven (7). Weekly XRP Trade Volume is defined as the total amount of XRP traded on the Ripple consensus ledger during a given week between Sunday midnight Pacific Time through the following Sunday midnight Pacific Time. Significantly, this definition excludes XRP traded on third party exchanges, unless in Ripple's reasonable judgment, the XRP market has changed so that the majority of legitimate XRP transactions have occurred off the Ripple consensus ledger during the prior 365 days.""

personalfinance,Really want to get things right with taxes this year,"Hey there, a little background about me. I'm 25 yrs old and just started to really tighten the belt on my finances. I have 2 student loans that I'm paying along with a car payment. In November, I started taking home 23k after taxes. It's not much but I'd like to make the most of it.

I just used the 2016 Withholding Calculator and it says I'm overpaying by about $2,200 (which I'm guessing is about how much I'll get in the refund). In order to lower that for next year, it says to change to ""7 allowances"" and the refund would be around $620. On my W-2 it's set to have my allowance set to 1 on both Federal and State. Is this calculator suggesting that I set the '1' to 7? If so, that seems like a huge jump in numbers so I thought it better to ask more knowledgeable people that to blindly jump into that.

I guess, my questions are
-
1. Is 7 to much of a number? Will it mean I get paid more throughout the year (I'd prefer that) without having to pay back anything/much.
2. Is there another number that would be better for me? I'm 25 years old, single and never married, live with my SO and no one claims me as a dependent.

That comes out to a total of $40k paid.... 


I don't understand. 7.4% interest for 7 years surely doesn't over triple the original loan amount? ELI5 please


Edit: What I failed to understand is that although that's what the trade in appraised at, she didn't get that towards the price of the car since she was upside down on that loan. That still makes it a 22.5k loan though as the sale price was 26.5k. The dealership is slacking on finalizing the paperwork (it's been 2 weeks already...) but when they do get it to her I'll be sure to take a look. Because even then the payments still seem high. 


The original estimate was $418 in payments but the dealer said something about an adjustment after the fact (he was very vague) and the payments went up to $476.

personalfinance,Pay down loans or CC in 0% promotional balance?,"It's tax refund season and for some that means we will get a decent refund. I personally try to apply my refund directly towards debt as if I didn't make any additional money. I never really thought about it, but to me it always made sense to clear out credit cards even if they are in the 0% grace period because if for some reason I cannot pay them off in the remaining 14 months in this case that interest would be worse than the loans I have. After pondering on this for quite awhile I'm not sure that's necessarily the best approach. Here are the loans and their interest rates:

Student Loan #1 $11,483 @ 5.99% fixed w/$170.41 payment

Student Loan #2 $10,566 @ 6.00% variable w/$111.01 payment

Student Loan #3 $14,808 @ 6.625% fixed w/$157.16 payment

Car Loan $13,971.78 @ 3.74% fixed w/ 375 payment

CC debt 0% until 4/2017 w/ balance of $3300

Now my refund this year is $3050 and I am trying to figure out whether it's best to clear the credit card debt or apply the $3k to one of these loans accruing interest. The credit card debt can be paid off with my normal income in seven months, I typically have about $500 extra to apply towards debt. 

Follow up question, I know the snowball and avalanche approach to reducing debt, but would it also be worth attacking the loan with the highest payment to free up more money to be applied towards other loans. For instance, my car loan has the lowest interest rate, but the highest payment. If I spend all extra money on this loan I would free up almost an extra $400 (with changing insurance maybe a little more) a month that would mean I could apply closer to $900 a month towards other debt making their demise quicker. 

I already have two months in savings for an emergency fund and still allocated $200-300 a month to savings. So what do you guys think? Thanks /r/personalfinance",finance,1455287394

personalfinance,[DEBT]Consumer loan [NO],"Hi, all.    
    
Me and my partner live together and one evening I borrowed her iPad while I was in the toilet. I wanted to check my email, but when I typed gmail.com it entered her email inbox (automatic login) and I saw that she had received emails from one of those ""quick-loan"" (aka loansharks) agencies - I could not unsee what at first glance seemed to be what it actually was so I opened the email and saw that she had taken up a loan.    
I do not know when she took up this loan, but I am guessing it is some old stuff. There was about $1000 in unpaid bills, so God knows how much she had initially borrowed from these leeches. And I opened a new email where I saw a conversation between my S.O. and one of their customer service employees where she asked them if it was possible to extend deadline and pay (approximately $200) a week later; of course, they said no and she said that she'd have the money by Monday. Then, it struck me: she borrowed those $200 from me on the Friday of the previous week stating that she ""had no money to buy food and stuff"".    
I was (and still am) very angry about the whole matter, but I don't know if I am more upset about the fact that she is going behind my back or that she owes these guys money.    
I have offered myself to lend her money, without interests, of course, should she need it to buy something. I also told her that would refuse to lend her money if she were to buy things she actually does *not* need.    
I am a very economical person: I have never had one of these types of debt (I only have a mortgage), as I would never buy something I cannot afford on the moment - f.ex. I bought a computer on what you could call a ""delayed payment"" (which, in my case, means that you buy it now and pay on a later date for no extra cost, but should you fail to pay the debt by given date, they will be automatically converted to one of these ""quick-loans"" who have something exorbitant interest rates) - I had the money to pay it on the spot, but I preferred to delay the payment just in case a more urgent matter should arise. And, in fact, having the amount I owed always locked in my account, I paid in time.    
    
I am yet to tell her that I know about it, but I thought I should ask you guys how to approach her beforehand so that I do not do one of my usual ""tirades"".    
What do I say to her? How do we get rid of this ASAP? She has lied to me about something that, in my opinion, is quite a big deal... I mean, who knows what else she is hiding from me?

Instead I've been putting extra money into a Roth IRA and am on track to max it out for the year. I'm already putting 10% into my 401K, which exceeds the amount I need to put in to get the full company match.

I have a few thousand dollars extra saved (on top of my emergency fund) and I'm trying to figure out what to do with it. I could pay the car off today. OR I could go ahead and max out my Roth for 2015 and put in about half toward 2016. 

My 401K and Roth are both down like 10% for the year. I normally split up the Roth contributions and do it once a month over the year... but my thought process is that I should max out the 2015 and 2016 Roth as soon as possible since the stocks are ""on sale"".

personalfinance,Refinance student loans a second time (Or just lower your interest rates)?,"A bit of background - graduated with ~$130K in student debt in May 2014. Most of it was private loans through Sallie Mae with egregious interest rates (I think the 4 loans ranged from about 8 to 9.75). I was fortunate enough to get a job right out of college making $65k, and immediately turned to start paying down the debt. In April of last year, I refinanced the $94k worth of Sallie Mae loans with SoFi and got an interest rate somewhere in the 4% neighborhood, which was just a huge sigh of relief.


[Here's an unbury.us link with my SoFi loans and the culmination of the federal ones that I received. I generally pay the minimums on each one and then add an extra thousand each month to the SoFi loan.](
http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=2208.95&amp;name_0=sofi&amp;balance_0=79551.45&amp;payment_0=910.78&amp;rate_0=4.43&amp;name_1=sub 1&amp;balance_1=5161.53&amp;payment_1=56.79&amp;rate_1=3.61&amp;name_2=unsub 1&amp;balance_2=1912.74&amp;payment_2=21.05&amp;rate_2=3.61&amp;name_3=sub 2&amp;balance_3=5134.77&amp;payment_3=55.45&amp;rate_3=3.15&amp;name_4=unsub 2&amp;balance_4=2133.83&amp;payment_4=26.37&amp;rate_4=6.55&amp;name_5=sub 3&amp;balance_5=4130.28&amp;payment_5=44.61&amp;rate_5=3.15&amp;name_6=unsub 3&amp;balance_6=2262.79&amp;payment_6=27.96&amp;rate_6=6.55&amp;name_7=sub 4&amp;balance_7=3234.82&amp;payment_7=36.52&amp;rate_7=4.25&amp;name_8=unsub 4&amp;balance_8=2380.99&amp;payment_8=29.42&amp;rate_8=6.55&amp;)

Now, according to my Discover FICO score (which I'm sure is slightly inaccurate, but probably a decent gauge), my credit score was about 722 when I had applied for the SoFi loan, and is now about 770. Since this is such a marked increase, I'm wondering if I could drive my interest rates down even farther which is where this post comes in. Does anybody have experience with this? Would it be a matter of applying for another loan (either through SoFi again or someone else), or could I just contact SoFi and ask for a reevaluation of my rate? On their site it says that interest rates can start as low as 2.13%, so I know I'm not currently at the lowest I can be.

While such programs may be available for free directly by various government agencies, our services are fee-based and focus on application and document preparation. We do not charge fees for access to such programs, only to prepare and counsel application to these programs. Services may be fulfilled by a third part processing agency.

So i figured, what the hell, my monthly payments are over $500 a month, why not call.

I asked a lot of questions.  The lady on the phone said there is a law firm (David Mayans out of Pheonix AZ(i havent googled yet)) who is suing individual banks holding student loans.  I'm not entirely sure on what grounds they are suing.  She said it does not cost me anything if the suit is lost.  She did some math based off of my current loan balances and told me that they could sue to absolve my private loans only, and that following a successful lawsuit, i would owe the law firm $20k paid over 48 months, coming out to 422$ a month.  Which is less than what i am currently paying on my two private and one federal loan.  

I dont know a whole heck of a lot about finances, but i know a little about civil courts.  It seems to me that the law firm sues on my behalf, settles for a percentage of the money i pay to the lawyer, the lawyer keeps the extra money.  It makes sense to me, and is pretty similar other lawsuits ive seen.  

this seems like a good plan to me because ill have my loans cut in half, similar monthly payments, and a 2 year payoff time (which is very doable).  But it sounds like a scam of some sort.

I didnt agree to anything and told her i would need more time before we continued, which lead me to this post.

I'm thinking about putting the smallest loan on a credit card balance transfer offer I have and paying it off with a year and a half to take advantage of the 0% interest since my credit line is just big enough to cover that.

personalfinance,"[Debt] Got a settlement offer on a student loan that is in collections, but need some advice on how to work this without getting shafted.","Just some background. I make a comfortable salary now, this loans is from 5 years ago when I did not and was unemployed. They refused to offer me deferment, forbearance, etc. because it is a private and not federal loan, so in the 4 months it took me to find a job it went into default. Then the job sucked ass, then I went to grad school, and just now I finally have good income and am trying to get back on my feet.

This loan is basically the last thing I have to resolve, and I need to do it soonish because my old beater car is about to die, and I am going to need something else to drive before I've saved up enough cash to buy one outright, which means I need a loan. 

So that leads to what my primary goal is: whatever will improve my credit score the most, the quickest. I don't care about what is ""right"", though in general I do not want to and never have shirked my debts or responsibilities. In this case I just need it gone.

So, first to the offer letter I got. The loan itself is about $5k, and was originally held by Navient. It's now with a debt collection agency, which I guess is contracted with Navient for collections and has not actually bought the debt but I don't know if that is relevant. 

The exact wording of the letter I got is as follows:

&gt;now is an opportunity to resolve your outstanding account balance for less than you owe: OFFER YOU PAY ONLY $1557.08

Sounds good, but I have concerns. So back to the thing about mostly just wanting my credit score to improve as much as possible as quickly as possible. I'm aware through google etc. that pay for delete agreements are a thing, but I'm also aware that they kind of a grey area and not something to be counted on. Paying this settlement right now is no issue for me, but let's assume I don't get a pay for delete, what happens to my credit report?

I know from pulling my report that this particular entry disappears in slightly less than 2 years, thus removing the only bad mark on my credit report. 

If I pay this settlement now, do I have to endure another 7 years of ""settled for less than full balance"" on there? Will that be really any better than the current charge-off in collections that shows up?

Basically I'm afraid that actually doing the responsible thing and paying my debt will screw me over for nearly a decade, whereas just letting it slide will still leave me with my current predicament of no credit to get a much needed car but on the other hand my credit will be clear very soon in comparison. 

And on top of that, this letter doesn't exactly look like a binding contract. Without hiring a lawyer (the amount is small enough I don't feel it's worth it when the alternative is to just not pay and it's gone in two years) is there anything I can do to make sure the papers I have will prove in the future (at least to the credit reporting agencies) that this debt really is resolved? I was thinking of just keeping a copy of the letter and my check, but is that enough?

Anyone been through this before, or understand enough about how this stuff works to offer me some insight? 

edit: After reviewing my credit report it looks like this may be a bit more complicated than I thought. The charge off is still on there as Navient, even though the debt has been sold to a third party collector. The third party has not reported the debt (at least not to Experian, who I checked because that's who my banked checked when they denied me for a loan). So a pay for delete wouldn't do me any good, right? The company that owns the debt seems not to have reported it at all, and if Navient put it on there as a charge-off they're not going to care if I pay off whoever bought it from them, right?",finance,1455306803

Option 2: A condo, similarly nearby. $50k list price. I have nearly enough money in my bank account to buy it outright, although I wouldn't because I don't want to dig into my emergency funds for that. $185/month HOA fee.

Normally, this would be a no-brainer, right? Throwing away $600/month for a 1-bedroom vs ~$485/month for a 2-bedroom and getting $300 of that back as equity. (Not that I'd use the second bedroom for anything. Hell, in my current apartment I sleep on the couch in the living room most nights, so I barely even use the first one.)

But...

I hate it here. I'm only here because it's close to my job and I'm commute-averse. The second a better offer comes along, I'm gone. And as far as I'm concerned, ""better"" means ""located in a more metropolitan area, even if it means a pay cut or a rise in cost of living."" And condos are notoriously difficult to unload.

So... is it still worthwhile to switch to a condo? I could be here another three months, I could be here another 3 years. But I don't want to be, and I'm hesitant to put down roots—especially roots with a $185/month pricetag even once it's paid off and the prospect of having to sell without a physical presence in the area.",finance,1455307968

personalfinance,Why is my federal tax deduction going up every paycheque?!,"I live in Canada. 

In 2015 my gross pay per period was $5416.67. After a slight raise, in 2016, my gross pay per period is $5580.  I get paid semi-monthly, so on the 15th and 30th of every month (or thereabouts). What I don't understand is why my Federal Tax deduction has been increasing during the new year.

personalfinance,Selecting one of 4 possible income-based repayment plans for school loans. Is the new REPAYE one the best?,"To keep this post short, I'm looking to switch my federal loans over to an income-based payment plan.  I have 4 options listed: Income-Sensitive Repayment (IS), Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), Income-Based Repayment (IBR), and Revised Pay As Your Earn (REPAYE).

Now my understanding is that REPAYE is by far the best repayment plan.  I have had this saved in my open tabs for 2 months now in anticipation of making the switch.  Based on what's written, is this information still correct/accurate which would make the REPAYE option the best one?  http://imgur.com/gallery/h0Gc6pv

Without going into too many personal details, my situation is that my income varies month to month, and some months there is no money at all available for loans.  My understanding is that 1) switching to REPAYE will make it so the payment amount drops dramatically 2) if I can't make any payment in a month because the income isn't there then I don't have to make a payment AND that ""no payment"" still counts as a payment towards forgiveness 3) the interest I end up paying is reduced significantly as well.  As a secondary question, how does the monthly determination work?  Do I contact them with the paychecks (or lack thereof) for the month?

Thanks, and thanks to user SlomoErectus for the initial information I found on REPAYE.

EDIT - In case I wasn't clear, is REPAYE the best option for me that will give me the smallest payments and save me the most amount of money in the end be it through less interest or repayment over the life of my loans up until the forgiveness period?",finance,1455310137

personalfinance,Planned Budget Critique--First Full-Time Job!,"Hi everybody,

I've been waiting a long, long time to be able to share a planned budget for my first full-time job (and I just submitted my signed offer letter today!). I've done as much research as possible (I am very familiar with the sidebar info) and tried to closely evaluate my current spending/needs, but you don't know what you don't know, so I thought I'd see if there was any feedback on my plans. I’ve heard PF likes a good ol’-fashioned budget critique.

**Where I am now:**

No debts.

~$6500 across retirement accounts

* $4500 contribution to CO’s public employee’s pension plan

* $800 in 401k (was started in 2015)

* $1200 in Roth IRA (was started in 2015)

$7500 in emergency/savings

I keep my checking at about $800 at all times

2008 Mazda3 with 48k miles I paid cash for last November (current market value ~$8k). This car should last me a long time.

**Goals:**

 * Max 2015’s Roth IRA (will take $4300 out of e-fund, leaving about $3200 at my lowest)

 * Rebuild e-fund to $10k

 * Buy a house in the next 3-4 years (with husband's income factored in)

 * Create a significant retirement base

**What I’m going to make:**

 * $49,000/year (up from $21,000 last year between two part-time jobs). I do not expect increases in income due to my field--this is already a very high salary and raises don’t really… happen.

 * $4083.33/month gross


**What I’ll do with it:**

Retirement/Long-term (~$1080/month):

 * 8% pre-tax to CO’s public employee’s pension plan, which kind of replaces SS, since I don’t pay into SS at all ($~326/month)

 * 4% pre-tax into 401k, no match but I wanted another retirement account (~$163/month)
 * 3% pre-tax HSA contribution (~$122/month)

 * Post-tax Roth IRA contributions ($458.33/month)


Estimated taxes after pre-tax contributions; includes Fed, CO, and Medicare but no SS as my employer is non-SS ($690/month, about 17%)


Expenses (about $1290-1430/month):

 * Rent ($625/month)

 * Utilities ($110/month including internet)

 * Phone ($46/month)

 * Car and rental insurance ($79/month; $68 and $11 respectively)

 * Food, including restaurants (~$150-$200)

 * Care for 1 dog, including food, medicine, vet appts ($70/month)

 * Car care, including fuel, washes, maintenance ($50/month)

 * Personal care (~$20-40/month max)

 * Clothes (~$40-60/month max)

 * Fun money (~$100-150/month)


Leftover (~$880-1020/month)

Throw at e-fund, then house down payment. Expect to have ~$25-28k in house fund by end of 2018. 3 bed/2 bath houses in my area start at 280k (needs some work) to 320k (reasonable) to 350k+ (very nice). Between my husband’s income and mine, we expect to put down 20%, but that might mean we wait until 2020 for the house.
Will plan for a 15-yr mortgage as well, but that’s too far in the future to need to discuss.

**Questions**

 * First, what am I missing? Does this seem feasible?

 * Given that I will not have SS, does this seem like a reasonable amount to be putting into retirement? I expect the pension plan will provide me with about 2/3 of my income in retirement, but no cost of living increases so I really want a solid backup plan of Roth and 401k where I can basically live off the interest of those+pension. Retirement scares me to death because it doesn’t seem like having a $1million nest egg in 40 years is really going to be that much.

Note: Additional $1051 is available on the 31st check. However since I work on a sales job and it’s a 70 salary/30 commission split, I don’t ever account for it and when I do get it (most of the time) I put it into savings.

I realize by now this should be a lot higher, but I’ve been helping my family through some things in the past 3 years and I’m just now able to truly commit to saving.

Here are my current goals:

1) Expand liquid savings to 3 months monthly expenses (3x$2260 = $6780)

2) Pay off all debt - trade car in for cheaper one to bring payment+insurance down to $300 hope for total amount borrowed to be around $15k. Free up that income to pay down student debt since it is higher interest rate

3) Save up for down payment on property (house or condo)

4) Increase retirement savings from 6% to 15% through either increased 401k contribution or Roth IRA/Traditional IRA

5) Expand liquid savings from 3 months to 1 year necessary expenses

The Gold Standard Act made ""the dollar consisting of twenty-five and eight-tenths grains  of gold""  (roughly $20 an ounce). 
The dollar was ""as good as gold!""  Because it was nothing more than a receipt for your gold!

See this image: http://www.panix.com/~clay/currency/2400-002.jpg

As you can plainly see, the money says ""This certifies that there have been deposited in the treasury of the United States of America ten dollars in gold coin payable to the bearer on demand""

1913 - Federal Reserve Act passes, creating the Federal Reserve and ushering in an era of fractional reserve banking!  (fractional reserve banking = printing more receipts than you have gold to back it up.).  The Federal Reserve was only required to hold a FRACTION of the RESERVES, the reserves being gold.


February 1933 - The continual inflation of the money supply is causing gold to be traded on the open market for significantly more than the set 20 US Dollars per ounce.  Anyone with good business sense is running on the US government to exchange their USD for gold.

April 1933 - The government responds with this executive order:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#/media/File:Executive_Order_6102.jpg

Yes, you read that correctly.  The private ownership of gold is now illegal! You must surrender all your gold to the Federal Reserve, or go to prison for 10 years.  But don't worry, they'll give you 20$ an ounce for it.

1934 - The "" Gold Reserve Act"" is passed.  The Gold Reserve Act makes the above executive order a law and sets the new price of gold at 35 USD per ounce.   Individuals are excluded from this exchange of 35 USD, considering they are barred from owning gold.  This exchange is only for forigen and domestic banks.

The charade of fractional reserve banking continues on for several decades.

1969 -  The money supply is again inflated to pay for the Vietnam War and other countless expensive and egregious blunders.  Gold is once again trading higher on the open market than the set exchange rate.  Once again, banks, foreign and domestic, see the writing on the wall.  The banks run on the United States government to redeem gold for the worthless paper the government has printed.

1971 - ""The Nixon Shock""! President Nixon responds by ending the direct convertibility of USD to gold.  Now, silver and gold certificates can only be exchanged for Federal Reserve Notes!  What's a Federal Reserve Note you ask?  Look in your wallet, or see this image:  http://marketshadows.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Silver-Certificate-v.-Federal-Reserve-Note.jpg

1971 was the year the US Dollar became a fiat currency!  Fiat currency is defined as 
""Currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of.""

1972 - One year later, gold is trading for 65 USD on the open market, almost twice what it was only a year before.

1974 - $180 USD per ounce

1980 - $670 per ounce

2016 - $1200 per ounce!!!

And this is how the Federal Reserve stole everyone's precious metal and gave them worthless paper in exchange. Paper that becomes more worthless everyday!  There's no wonder it's refereed to as ""The biggest scam in the history of mankind!""

The implications of this policy have been disastrous!  The value of the dollar has fallen 97% since the creation of the Federal Reserve

This is why coke used to cost a nickle, and now it costs 1 or 2 dollars.  It's not because the coke got more expensive to produce, it's because the currency is worth significantly less.

So I may have made a mistake (or two) with my taxes because I was in a rush to file and this is my first time doing it with more complicated expenses. I just got my tax refund and now I'm wondering if I just did something profoundly stupid.

**Problem 1:**
I consolidated my student loans for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The multiple loans that I started with from Lender A consolidated into a single loan from Lender B. I got a 1098-T statement from both lenders. 

* The 1098-E from Lender A said I had paid ~$10,000 in interest. This did not come out of my pocket but, presumably, Lender B paid Lender A.
* The 1098-E from Lender B said I had paid ~$300. This was payment from me to Lender B.

I deducted the full $2,500 allowed. Did I make a big mistake? How can I fix this if I did?

Another potential (but more minor?) mistake: I got hired in mid-2015 and took advantage of a monthly pre-tax benefit. I paid into it $50 more a month than the federal limit allows.

* $400 auto loan payment
* $900 - $1,000 student loans per month, depending on other expenses

Without any major disruptions, I can be debt free in under three years.

-------

The reason I'm at a crossroads right now is because I'm leaning towards investing in a house instead of killing off my debt. Reasons:

* I'm tired of paying someone else's investment by renting
* The rental market in my area (Denver) is absurd even though it softened a bit last quarter
* The real estate market is becoming more friendly as I'm reasonably certain I can get 4% or less on a fixed interest loan, and I don't have to make offers thousands of dollars above asking price
* Market projections of home values in the Front Range area are predicting a huge real estate value increase over the next 10 years
* My long-term retirement goals include owning and renting out a variety of rental homes and living off the revenue 
* I've found a down payment assistance agency willing to give me a shared equity loan of 20% of the value of a home - no PMI!
* The tax breaks for purchasing a home and paying the interest on the mortgage payment are *substantial* - I'm unsure how to use those monies yet, but I'm eyeballing throwing it at student debt or at more investments

--------

If I had to guess, I imagine the first advice I'll get here is to build up a six(ish) month emergency fund. Which is absolutely legit; I just get suuuuuuper twitchy seeing a big savings balance and knowing it's earning almost no interest, while my student loans are growing by ~$175 per month. But once I do that, I'll be back to the same place I'm at right now, wondering whether to invest or bide my time and pay off debt.

Any suggestions on optimizing and choosing and hopefully retiring before I'm 80 would be MOST welcome. Thank you, lovely people!",finance,1455338793

politics,Civil Service in the Corporate Age (Feel the real Burn),"You want to feel the Burn?  Well some of you may very well be looking towards Bernie Sanders as a pressure release valve, ready to let out all this hot air being produced by the democratic establishment candidates.  

Its remarkably similar to the grass roots hysteria that pushed Ron Paul's name into the spotlight of the many conservatives who were revolting against the Republican establishment candidates. Now they have Donald Trump who is an entirely different (than Ron Paul) kind of anti-establishment.

So what is this Burn we are feeling?  Is this the fabled ""revolution of the mind"" sweeping in like tidal surges? Each surge pushing a little further inland than the last?  We can only hope that it is. We can only hope that the establishment doesn't figure out how to outrun it before it catches them and rip tides them all out into the sea where they will eventually sink into the cold depths and return to the loving arms of Cthulhu.

20 years ago a candidate like Bernie Sanders wouldn't have even gotten a mention. The simple fact is that people, our
people, are changing faster than the establishment on both sides of the isle can make us forget how ridiculous and fake they are.
Faster than they can figure out how to pretend to be one of us.


I'm not claiming ""we the people"" are all the same, or on the same team... I expect that we will never be truly homogeneous
like that.  But a step in the right direction would be for ""we the people"" to make our own teams that aren't sponsored by
huge multinational corporations or religious interest groups that seem narrowly focused on profits and prophecies.

The truth is that we can't really know if Bernie Sanders is really the far left dream he seems to be, We can't know if Ron Paul is the far right dream he seems to be.  We can't know if Donald Trump is the ""I don't give a shit, no nonsense center right"" person he seems to be.  We can't know these things because they study us year round, they measure our reactions and responses to every little news blurb that is released and they are constantly trying to craft the perfect politician that is going to capture the energy of the people just at the right time to get elected.

We the people, are just a bunch of helpless passengers on a titanic being sailed through the riskiest water ways they can find.  The corporations, the banks, the federal reserve... they profit if the risk pays off, and the only one who stand to lose if we crash into that iceberg is the people.  

Remember the 800 billion bailout, remember the endless wars and all the premium contracts attached to them.

Remember that our politicians are going to tell us whatever we want to hear, and then they will do whatever they are paid to do.

We need to evolve faster than they can adapt.  We need to shake up the two party system so badly that it doesn't survive.  We need to put an end to these political dynasties like the Bushes and the Clintons.

I won't tell you to vote for Sanders or Trump, to vote left or right.  You'll vote for whoever you want and that is how it should be.  But I will ask you to please make sure you aren't voting for a puppet because of a catchy slogan or name recognition. 

Lets do something completely different instead of banging our heads against the wall by continuously putting these establishment autobots into the highest offices of our country.

Our civil servants should belong to us, not some corporate boardroom.

How do I calculate what I would need to change to optimize my 401k/HSA contributions, reduce my taxes paid, and keep a similar amount coming to my checking account?

The reason that I ask is that some people have told me that I should do it through the dealer, but I have also been told that going to the bank directly for a loan could get me a lower interest rate, and that it would be smarter than financing through the dealership.

When you are with a group of nine people, the highest court in the land, you can’t pretend to be king or queen. **If I had may way, there would be no death penalty.** But the death penalty for now, is the law. But I can say, I won’t participate in those cases, then I would not be an influence.”_  -Justice Ruth Joan Bader Ginsburg

_""I think that [Breyer] pointed to evidence that has grown in quantity and in quality. He started out by pointing out that **there were a hundred people who had been totally exonerated of the capital crime with which they were charged** ... so one thing is the **mistakes that are possible** in this system. The other is the quality of representation. Another is ... **yes there was racial disparity**...""_  -Justice Ruth Joan Bader Ginsburg

_**Clinton has been a longtime advocate of the death penalty.** Clinton cosponsored the Innocence Protection Act of 2003 which became law in 2004 as part of the Justice for All Act. The bill provides funding for post-conviction DNA testing and establishes a DNA testing process for individuals sentenced to the death penalty under federal law. **As first lady, she lobbied for President Clinton’s crime bill, which expanded the list of crimes subject to the federal death penalty.**_

_“Look, there are people who commit horrendous, horrendous, horrendous crimes: we all know that. And we are furious at them, we can't understand their barbarity. But I think, as with so much violence in this world today, I just don't think the state itself, whether it's the state government or federal government, should be in the business of killing people. So when you have people who have done terrible, terrible things they're gonna spend the rest of their lives in jail, and that's a pretty harsh punishment. But I'm against capital punishment.”_ -Senator Bernie Sanders

What you’re asking for when you ask people to vote for Bernie is to support a labor that women like Justice Ginsburg have devoted much of their lives to; An end to an inhuman punishment which almost all of western civilization has rejected.

What you're asking for when you ask people to vote for Hillary Clinton is for us to perpetuate the barbarism that is capital punishment. Something that, in western society, is practiced only by United States, Japan, Singapore, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis and Taiwan.

Hillary thinks Capital Punishment even within what she admits to be an error prone and discriminatory system, is Okay™.

Bernie Sanders and Justice Ginsburg do not. Bernie Sanders thinks the practice is barbaric and should be abolished.

It's one thing you might want to consider as you decide who you want to support, considering that the next president will get to appoint two Supreme court judges, and the supreme court is where the decisions are being made which disallow the death penalty in specific circumstances.

&gt;Scalia said death penalty decisions from the court have made it “practically impossible to impose it but we have not formally held it to be unconstitutional.” Earlier in his remarks, Scalia said “it wouldn’t surprise me if it did” fall, a comment that drew scattered applause in the mostly full, 2,700-seat auditorium.

&gt;He said the high court has increasingly made it difficult impose the death penalty. He said rulings have added mitigating circumstances that must be considered or made it impermissible to automatically sentence people to death for certain crimes, such as killing a police officer.

&gt;The Supreme Court this month began its latest term and has already heard one death penalty challenge out of Kansas. While that case is limited in scope it was the first high court hearing on death penalty cases since a bitter clash over lethal injection procedures exposed deep divisions among the justices last term. The court intends to consider a case from Florida that questions whether judges, rather than juries, can impose a death sentence, especially when the jury is not unanimous in recommending death.

Although finally permanently abolishing Capital Punishment may require legislative change it is within the power of the SCOTUS to render Capital Punishment impossible to practice. If, for example, there is no method of death penalty which is not found to be cruel and unusual punishment, (including experimental methods,) then it would follow that to impose the death penalty be banned as it violates 8th amendment.

What the Supreme Court understands to be cruel and unusual punishment may not be exactly the same as what you or I might understand to be cruel and unusual punishment, though. (In Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63 (2003), the Court upheld a 50 years to life sentence with the possibility of parole imposed under California's three strikes law when the defendant was convicted of shoplifting videotapes worth a total of about $150.) This, of course, is only one of so many reasons why consideration of integrity and character is so important in choosing the candidate who, if elected, will appoint two new Justices.",finance,1455369605
personalfinance,Recent grad - Recently hired for my dream job. What are my next steps? More info inside.,"Some background: 23M, recent graduate (May 2015) with a degree in Biochemistry. Following college, I pursued medical school, but I left because I ultimately knew that I didn't want to work with patients and I wanted to be happy in a career rather than waste 4 to 8 years of my life training for something I'd end up feeling miserable about. I did research in medical school and realized that I had a much stronger passion for working in the lab and felt that a career in forensics aligned better with what I wanted out of life.

Today: After moving back home in December, I spent the last couple of months unemployed and had an offer as a lab tech lined up that I was supposed to start, but recently got my dream job as a forensic toxicologist at the local medical examiner's office. This is a government job with really good benefits (health insurance, dental, 401k, 12-15 days off  per year, etc.), and I'm set to make around 38k after my first year and nearly 80k after my second year, and the potential to go higher than that exists. I realize that I've been dealt an *extremely lucky* hand and I want to make the most out of it. Which is why I've come to /r/personalfinance

Financial situation: Thanks to my brief stint in medical school, I now have 33k in loans to pay off (approx 25k in medical school loans and around 8k in undergrad loans) at a 5.7% interest rate. I also currently live with my (very supportive) parents. This means I do not have worry about rent, groceries, gas, car insurance, etc. I don't drink, smoke, or go out to bars and generally don't like to spend money frivolously to begin with. I currently have a checking account that has only $771 as well. Essentially, other than these loans, I do not have any other pressing financial obligations. 

With all of this said, I have a plan in place that I've devised based on my reading of this subreddit, but I'd still like to get some feedback anyway. 

1) Wipe out my debt as quickly as I can. 

2/3) When I become eligible, contribute as much as I can to get the maximum match with my company's 457b

2/3) When I make a significant dent in the loan repayments, I want to open up a savings account and essentially start splitting my money between paying off loans and building maybe 3 to 6 months worth of savings (you never know if shit will hit the fan)

4) After loans are paid off, start putting a lot more into savings and then post again to /r/personalfinance to ask about investing.

That's all I got. I'm (admittedly) not very financially literate, so I've based my above plan based on what I've read through this subreddit. Thanks again!",finance,1455370548

My wife and I have student loans that are strangling us financially. We pay close to $800 per month on student loans, more than our mortgage payment!

Here's the situation:

We have about $15k in federal loans, which is no biggie. They have really low interest rates and we will have them paid off in short order. We don't plan on doing anything with them except paying them off as planned.

On the other hand, we have about $48k in private loans. Fuck you Sallie Mae / Navient. We have another 19 years left to pay, and the interest rates are about 9.5% on average. The payment for those loans is about $450 per month. 

We each earn about $30k per year, so we're not swimming in money, despite our expensive ass degrees. Our budget is already maxed out. Between student loans, our mortgage, gas, groceries, utilities and insurance, we have very little wiggle room in our finances. 

In researching this topic on this sub, all I've found is anecdotes of people living in cardboard boxes for a year and paying of their loans. That's nice and all, but we're already at that point and we're just treading water. Our cars are paid for, we are as cheap as possible on groceries, we hardly dine out or spend money on entertainment, we only buy new clothes when absolutely necessary, and our house payment is cheaper than renting a one bedroom apartment. I say all that to say, we've already shaved our heads and donned our sack cloth robes, and we're barely keeping our heads above water.

That leaves us with a few options. My wife went to Wells Fargo this morning to speak with a loan officer about refinancing her loans. They say they have 15 year student loans with rates between 6 and 10 percent fixed on their website, which would be nicer than 9.5 percent and rising variable. We ought to be able to score a decent rate because we both have 800 credit scores. Even though the term is shorter, with a lower rate, the payment should still come out a little lower. However, the loan officer at Wells was useless. How about a HELOC? 5 year personal loan? How about a credit card? Open an account? My wife left exasperated.

I received no notification that I had been approved for a 3rd loan, or anything like that.  In fact, if I hadn't randomly decided to check my interest rates this morning, I might have gone the entire semester without seeing it.


I haven't done anything about the loan yet.  I checked my MPN and it says I have 120 days from the date of disbursement to cancel any loan and return the money to the borrower.  So I have plenty of time to sort this out.  But still. 


This is especially odd because I am only eligible for up to $5,500 in total loans this year, and only $3,500 subsidized.  This exceeds both of those limits.


So, what do I do?  I'm going to call the loan servicer and see what they say, but has anyone experienced this kind of thing before?  Is it a clerical error?  Can I be approved for additional loans without my knowledge?  It doesn't say anything about that in my MPN.

Some tips I have received are to borrow only what I need and to try and pay off the interest as it accumulates so it does not get added to the principle after I graduate. I have also recently submitted my financial information to FAFSA.gov, but I have not received any information about potential university/government contributions yet.

One option I am considering is applying for military tuition payment programs where they cover my expenses, and for every year they finance my education, I work for them for a year. However, I am worried that I might be ineligible for these programs for health reasons (asthma). The other option would be to borrow the entire amount. One way I could possibly lower my debt would be to apply for resident status after the first year, but I have heard that this is very difficult.

What I would like to know is how I should go about financing my education. My parents are unable to help me pay my tuition fees, but fortunately they are able to cover my living expenses and book costs so I will only need to worry about how to pay the $68,000. Some helpful information would be what sorts of loans I should apply for and what I can do to obtain the most favorable interest rates. Any information/advice would be greatly appreciated, especially from dental students who have had experience with military programs. Thanks.",finance,1455399945

personalfinance,Help understanding how my Schedule E hurt me so bad this year,"I just wrapped up my taxes and I didn't quite follow the logic on something... hoping someone can help clarify it for me. 

Using just our personal income/expenses, we were *due* a ~$300 refund.

Then I added in our Schedule E (Rental Property) and it swung the opposite way, and we *owed* ~$1000.

The rental property breaks down to: 

 * Income: $13,850.00 
 * Expense: $11,549.62
 * Depreciation: $4,105.00

In my mind, this is a net loss (13.8 - 11.5 - 4.1 = -1.8)... but it sounds like the Feds see it as a net gain, since my tax liability went up. 

So, here's where I am lost...

Why is it a net gain?  Does the depreciation not count towards net? If so... that's kind of a raw deal, how do I spread the cost of that asset out?

Why did this swing our taxes so hard in the other direction? Even if you back out depreciation and treat it like a net gain of $2,300.38... taxes of $1,300 seems outrageous. 

Edit: We use TurboTax and I'm able to pin point it on the Schedule E because I had taxes complete except for that. Spent this morning wrapping it up.",finance,1455402364

personalfinance,"Should I use my extra student loan money to pay off a credit card? If I hang onto it, would it put me over the SSI resource limit?","Sorry for asking what may be dumb questions. I'm kinda new to the nitty gritty of personal finance and am under a lot of stress, and taking the time to look into this on my own has been tough when I have a child to look after and lots of homework to do.  I've seen this sub help a lot of people though, so I'm trying to reach out in an effort to understand what my best options are.

I'm a single parent who lives on SSDI down to the last dollar, and I've been attending a tech school full time since last fall in an effort to change that.  The federal loans I received were larger than my year of tuition, and the difference was given back to me (I have another FAFSA application pending for the 2016-17 year and then I'll attempt to find a job through VR upon graduation).  I paid off a credit card with some of it since the interest is lower than the rate on the card (4.29% vs 22.99%), and I've just been keeping the rest in my savings account (which was previously empty) in case of an emergency, figuring the low interest rate was worth it to have that cash on hand.

Well, the person I had a child with was very damaging to my finances this past year, and although he can no longer do any damage and has repaid over 50% of what he owes me, I still have a credit card with a $2k balance that he can't pay off any time soon, and its interest-free introductory period expires this month.  The loan money in my savings account is $2,800, and I have an upcoming vehicle registration and inspection next month as well as some parts that need to be replaced, so I'm wondering if it would be wise of me to use that money to pay off the credit card, and have the remaining $800 or so go toward my car (otherwise I'd have to put that expense on a credit card as well - my ex was supposed to cover the parts and service since he caused the damage, but I can no longer count on him for that money in time).

This would leave me with nothing in savings, BUT in the event of an emergency, my credit line would be completely open.  Plus I figured if I don't pay off that credit card debt, I'll be paying 22.99% interest on it on top of the 4.29% on the $2,800 sitting in my bank account, so to me it makes sense to pay off the card.  I don't have anyone to discuss finances with though, and the one friend I can confide in about these issues just told me to pay the money back to the student loans instead.  What's the right course of action here?

Because I have to reapply for disability this year, I'm also worried that what I have in my savings account puts me over the resource limit as stated in [this document](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32279.pdf).  I hadn't even considered that until hearing NPR discuss it and mention something about my state proposing a special savings account for disabled residents to avoid that issue.  However, when I had to reapply for ""Extra Help"" on the SSA website last week for Medicare (after discovering that my prescription was suddenly $170 instead of $4... too much to keep on top of I guess), it gave a different resource limit that was higher than the $2k mentioned in that doc.  Sadly I do not remember the figure and I haven't heard anything from the application yet, but now I'm second-guessing what the actual limit for eligibility is (or if it would even apply in my case since I'm just borrowing that money from the government anyway).

Any advice on these two issues would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading my long message and for any financial tips you might have for someone in my position.  I'm trying to learn as much as I can to create a secure future for myself and my daughter.",finance,1455411207

Second, my MAGI is looking like its in the range where I have a reduced Roth contribution. I still want to take advantage and contribute all $5500 for 2015 so should I just backdoor $5500? Or should I contribute my calculated amount into the Roth and then backdoor the remaining amount to add up to $5500 for the year?

personalfinance,Purchasing Land From Parents,"My parents have purchased a 5 acre piece of land to build their new home, that process is underway. There is a second 5 acre plot next to the one they purchased, almost identical. They are also interesting buying that land, and encouraged us to consider buying it at one point. They proposed to my wife and I (because we showed interest before) in buying the land and signing the deed over to us, and then letting us make payments to them. The idea here is that it would enable my wife and I to build a home through a homebuilder and not have to deal with a combined land purchase/construction loan and rolling it into a mortgage, which as I understand is a difficult task. 

We were in the market to purchase an older home, but we think this may give us an opportunity to avoid having to build equity at the onset to purchase land and then build a home. I have a lot of home building experience and worked with my parents growing up building our houses (3 in all). 

They have already paid off their 5 acres and are now starting the building process, they proposed that after their house is complete, they will purchase the other 5 acres and pay it off within 1 year, then setup an agreement with us for payment of 10-15 years depending on cost - at an adjusted interest rate so we pay no more than they did. After they sign the deed to us, we would begin the process of finding a home builder (Fortunately they're already working with one and we love the design the builder has come up with). 

We have a great relationship with them, they are close with us and we are all employed and I don't expect this to end up in drama at all. My parents are smart and good people who want the best for us. I think this could be a good opportunity because we will be next to them which would be great, and have a combined 10 acres of land to homestead on. With the added benefit that when they pass, I would inherit 5 acres next to mine with a house on it.

Why? I'm looking for a pragmatic leader who understands the obstacles of politics. I disagree with attacks on her that say accepting any money from any wall-street sources is bad.  She understands the damage that Citizens United has caused. In fact, Citizens United was a decision that was brought in front of the Court in order to give a group the right to show an ANTI-HILLARY CLINTON video.  She despises the ruling. However, that's the world we live in today and she's smart enough to know that in order to battle the GOP infrastructure, she needs to have as much money as they do. The GOP is going to spend $1B+ on this race.  Hillary needs that much to counter.  And so I don't feel that her accepting donations from Wallstreet is a bad thing in this case.

As it stands now myself and my SO  have a checking account with $5,010 in it set up for automatic payment of bills. We each have our own personal checking account for personal bills, (none mutual bills like car insurance, phone bill etc...) 

Our combined income after taxes is $3,700

Our monthly expenses(including food) add up to $1,050(ball park) 

My main bill is a college debt that is now in repayment with multiple interest rates from 3%-6.8% and a total amount of $49,890. I have allocated over $1k per month to paying it down as soon as possible starting with the top 3 @ 6.8%.

What worries me is that this debt is a huge allocation of my monthly income ($2400 is my personal income after taxes) and I'm not exactly sure what will maximize my return when I do invest. 

Long term investment, I'd love to invest in real estate. My logic, people will always need places to live, and with proper upkeep it can appreciate in value. 

Short term wise, I just want to put the remainder of our money into a safe place that can accumulate as much profit as possible within a five year period. 

I say five years because around that time I would like us to either invest in an apartment building (duplex or four family) or have our own house.

personalfinance,Need help getting started with taxes!,"Hi all,

I am a current college student with a moderately complex (or perhaps not; I guess we'll find out) tax situation. Before I explain, I'll start with what I've tried. I've spent quite a bit of time on 1040-ES, and I've tried working through the filing process on TurboTax. I know I don't need a PhD to use TurboTax, but I still have some questions, and it would be quite reassuring to get advice from actual humans, so here goes:

I am a legal resident of GA, but I attend school in TN. My parents still claim me on their return. I started an internship in January 2015 that pays me as an independent contractor. In 2015, I made &lt; $10k. I also have a job on campus, but I work very few hours. When I started on campus, I filled out a W-4 and an I-9. I made &lt; $500 from this job in 2015. I also made &lt;$500 in equities trades that took place in November and December of 2015, but I haven't netted a profit because my holdings dipped in January. I've also made &lt; $1 from interest on my savings account. Yay interest rates! Those are all earnings I can think of.

To date, the only documents I have received from either employer are deposit notifications. I have not received a 1099 from my internship, and I haven't received a W-2 from school.

I have not paid any taxes so far, and I feel like I should have. At some point last year, I sat down with my parents and tried to figure out what I would owe in quarterly estimated taxes, and we determined I didn't make enough money, so I didn't owe anything.

Here are some of the short(ish?) questions I'm hoping you guys can help me answer as a first-time filer:

1. Should my employers have given me a 1099 and a W-2?
2. Do I owe estimated taxes? Let me know if I need to provide more specific income figures to calculate this.
3. Do I owe penalties on potential estimated taxes that I haven't paid?
4. Do I owe taxes on my capital gains even though I didn't make a profit?
5. How are the 1040 and 1040-ES forms related? Do I need to file both?

And these are some of the longer questions I have that require some explanation:

1. TurboTax says I don't need to file for state taxes in TN. Based on a few minutes of reading, this is because TN only has an income tax on interest and dividends, not wages. First, is this correct? Secondly, do I then include my TN income on my GA state taxes?

2. This question is tangentially related to the one above. Based on my reading, since I'm paid as an independent contractor for my internship, I have to file self-employment tax. While searching for how to calculate/pay estimated taxes, I landed in a few places: The business owner section of TurboTax as well as Schedule C (Form 1040), which I was routed to from 1040-ES. All of these forms asked for things such as my business name, business location, and when I acquired my business. As an intern, I don't really think of myself as owning my own business. Did I land end up on the wrong forms, or am I a ""business owner"" in the eyes of the law since I'm paid as an independent contractor? If I am a ""business owner,"" how should I fill the fields on these forms?

Thanks in advance for the help, and I apologize if some of these questions are too basic. I know there's plenty of documentation on what all these forms are for, but I'm feeling overwhelmed by the specificity of my situation. Every time I look at FAQ or tips on the IRS and TurboTax websites, I feel like they don't apply to or don't cover all aspects of my situation.

personalfinance,Please help me convince my wife that we can't afford a house right now.,"Throw away just because. Also I don't know how to format this post so.. My bad if I do it wrong.
My wife thinks that because house prices/mortgages are going up (I don't even know if this is true or not, its based on something her dad said because he is a realtor) that we should buy a house right now instead of wait until we have enough for a 20% down payment. 
She just signed with a company and will be starting a month after school gets out. She will be ~65k a year. I currently work full time making ~45k with a raise that is NOT guaranteed to happen hopefully coming soon up to 50k. We only have 8k in savings with a 3.5k tax refund on the way. We luckily have zero debt because I have paid for her schooling in full from my salary and we only have one crappy car that we paid for cash for. We pay 800 a month in rent and utilities. Our credit score is 744.

This is what she wants to do:
She has been looking at houses at about 280-290k. Her realtor dad talked to some friend of his that does mortgages and this guy said that because we have an ok credit score we could get a loan for like 10k down but our interest rate would be higher than if we had 20% to put down. My wife and my father in law are arguing that by the time we could afford 20% down, interest rates will be that high anyway but the prices of homes will be higher as well. So they are saying that it is smarter to buy now. But I'm not willing to drain our savings because I know that there will going to be hidden costs and lots of other things besides a down payment that we will have to pay for.
I legit can't see how she thinks this is smart.

This is what I want to do:
I want to live off of my salary (like we have been doing for 3 years) for at least a year after she starts her job and save every penny she makes plus save the money that used to go towards her tuition. This way we will have money for a down payment and extra costs of a home and money left over for our emergency fund. 

And maybe my way isn't smart either that is why I'm here looking for advice.",finance,1455436392

personalfinance,"LPT: It i better to usually rent and save up for a down payment, then buy a house on mortgage.","**DO NOT TAKE THIS ADVICE WITHOUT CALCULATING WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL WORK FOR YOU**

So this is a little known fact and many people seem to think ""Better to buy than rent because when you rent, you don't own anything"".  However, this logic fails when interest is added because just like rent, you don't gain anything long-term when paying interest.

What you should do (in most cases) is to budget like you did buy a house and are paying mortgage.  However, instead of buying the house, you simply rent for a lower price and put the rest in savings and buy a house later using the savings as the downpayment.  

You should use this strategy **IF AND ONLY IF** 1) your rent is less than the mortgage payment and 2) You are paying more in interest than in rent

**Calculating if this affects you**

To caulate if you are paying more in interest than in rent, use the following equation.  

Let P be the amount you would need to borrow (Principal) and R be interest rate as a decimal, (4% = 0.04, 0.5%=0.005)

If your rent is **less** than P*R/12, you would be paying more in interest than in rent and you **Should** rent and save

(Example: Cost of house (P) = 100K, Rent = $100, APR = 6% = 0.06.  100,000*0.06/12= $500  $500 &gt; rent so you should rent)

If your rent is **More** than P*R/12, you would be paying more in rent than in interest and you **Should NOT** use this tip (you should buy a home).

(Example: Cost of house (P) = 100K, Rent = $1000, APR = 6% = 0.06.  100,000*0.06/12= $500  $500 &lt; rent so you should buy the house)

If it is cheaper to rent and save, you also need to calculate when you should by the house.  To do this, you need to set your rent (We'll call is C for cost) equal to P*R/12.  

So C = P*R/12 =  12C/R = P  Therefore, when the amount you need to borrow is equal to 12 times monthly rent (annual rent) divided by the interest rate (Remember to keep it a decimal here), you should stop renting and buy the house.  Therefore the amount you need in savings is the cost of the house - P or the cost of the house - (annual rent divided by interest rate).

(Example for calculating loan amount:  Required loan = P, Rent = $100, APR = 6% = 0.06.  P =12($100)/0.06 = $20,000) 

(Example for calculating amount needed in savings: Cost of house = 100K, Amount needed in Savings = S, Rent = $100, APR = 6% = 0.06.  100K-S = 12($100)/0.06    =     100K - S = 20k    =     S = 80k)

personalfinance,"Negative interest rates, good moment to get into debt?","Long time lurking around here, first time posting. I would like to ask the collective intelligence of this subreddit to help me find the best way to handle this situation. If I got the philosophy of Personal Finance right we should be saving as much as possible in order to prevent debts, so we would be in a better position to face the financial troubles that we, probably, will encounter in our life. I understand and try to live following these principles.

My problem (I live in Europe) comes with the latest moves of the european central banks. Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden are already on negative rates. The problem is not limited to Europe, other developed economies follow the same policy (I am thinking of Japan). It might be that even the ECB (Euro) will reduce its already ridiculous rates.

In this circumstances the saving and avoiding debt philosophy is still the best strategy? Should not be a good moment to enter into strategic, long term debts (mortage7business debts)? Any opinions welcome.",finance,1455444325

personalfinance,Massive Loans worth it to leave US?,"I'm contemplating the idea of immigrating to Australia. I will begin the process by studying for masters qualifying degree in social work.

Before I start with the money.... I've been up and down the east coast, spent about a year accumulative in the country (over 3 visits), and traveled/studied there.
My best friend resides in Australia, and another is planning to do the same as I am considering. 

The cost of tuition alone will set me back 45k in loans (2yr masters program). The university I am interested in is covered under federal direct loans that I can take out in the US.

On campus accommodation including meals is about 360/week. This will set me back another 40k in possible [private] loans.

I'd also need to figure in books, light entertainment and necessities, and mandatory health insurance.

I can work up to 20hrs a week while studying, but I would not rely on this as it's not a for sure thing. Although the awesome minimum wage for the country will allow 20hrs/week to cover at least half of living costs.

So overall  this endeavor will set me back close to 70-90k in possible loans. I would have a masters degree in a needed field that would give me a much better chance at a work sponsorship; leading to the eventuality of a permanent  residency  within the country.
[That is if I can't find some bloke to get hitched to; saving me a lot of money! Haha]

At this time I make 31k a year working for a university in Missouri. I plan in the next year and a half to undertake an accelerated course for a secondary bachelor's degree to supplement my first. This is included with my work benefits and would not cost anything aside from books.

My current bills allow me to save 700/month. After February of next year I could move back home before i leave, which would allow $1,500 in savings each month.

I have just finished  off my credit  card debt, and have no student loans to pay off. If shit hits the fan, or I'm in a bind; I have my father as a financial help. Although, I do not want to rely on him at all for this since he already paid for my bachelor's. But he is still available to help without hurting his lifestyle.

If this idea is plausible  or worth it, February 2018 is my goal to begin the masters program. I would be 27 by that date.
If nothing unexpected happens by that time I could  have over 20,000 saved up.

If I obtain a job in the social work field, I would be looking at a beginning salary around 35-45k a year from the information I've found. The median salary for the country  being around 70k.

I still need to inquire about Federal loan forgiveness  for public service jobs and if it applies to overseas. That would allow me to only make the minimum payments and forgive the rest after 10 years.


I guess my question is - is this worth it? 
Are there any ways to save more money (outside of scholarships).

&gt; When you lend somebody money, they usually have to pay you for the privilege.

&gt; That has been a bedrock assumption across centuries of financial history. But it is an assumption that is increasingly being tossed aside by some of the world’s central banks and bond markets.

&gt; ...

&gt; **What are those downsides?**

&gt; The global financial system is built on an assumption of above-zero interest rates. Going below zero could cause damage to the very architecture by which money and credit zoom through the economy, and in turn inhibit growth.

&gt; Banks could cease to be viable businesses, eliminating a key way that money is channeled from savers to productive investments. 

&gt; **So what are some of the weird things that could happen in a world in which negative rates become routine?**

&gt; Might new businesses sprout up that allow people to securely store thousands of dollars in bundles of $100 bills, or could people buy physical objects as stores of value that the banks can’t charge a negative interest rate on?

BG:

I promised myself that I can spend freely until 22 to cope with the stresses of school and keep my sanity. It worked and now I'm in a comfortable place and know I will finish the degree. Worst case scenario is I will be making around 80-90k with benefits or hate my life and make ~100k with some limited progression options to make a bit more. Now the tricky part. I will graduate with an estimated $250k in debt. Once I land a FT job, I plan on maxing out my 401k, roth, and any and all pretax retirement offerings I can get into. The rest will go into monthly expenses, a car, and my family's mortgage. I also want my parents to have nothing to do with paying off my debt. They've given me more than enough and deserve to retire in paradise.



Stats:
Part time at $16.50/hr +10% on evening shifts every other weekend, bring home a little more than  $100 every week

Waiting to hear back from another job for $20/hr to fill up the other weekends

$2500 in stock market with $22 quarterly dividend, plan to use this to day trade as my schedule frees up

minimal savings, usually in the lower hundreds depending on my spending.

 $500 cc debt which will be paid off by the end of the month.


current loans:
fed sub/unsub: 27k @ 4.29% fix

discover student: 42k @ 4.99 fix

I also have a parent plus loan that I cannot check atm but I'm sure it's in the 30-40 range with a fixed 6 - 7%

future loans: my final two years will cost over 100k total because scholarship can't be applied to these years since they are considered grad years. I plan on taking them out of discover at the fixed 4.99%


Plan

I'm going to start to cook at home again and stop eating out all the time so I will save a lot on that, I'm going to save more by not purchasing $400 headphones and shopping for new clothes all the time, etc. I will also start learning about the gov't and private student loans I have and see if I can start paying interest on them now.

Question:

Other than the obvious stop spending like an idiot and saving how should I prepare to burden the debt once I graduate? 

What can I do to make my income work for me now?

Also: I realize it is unwise to be financially irresponsible for so long, but I really needed to use the money to destress because my sanity is important in my line of work.

Also I will update information as needed.

If my fiance and I both have limited credit histories (almost 2 years for me, 1 year for her) and scores in the very high 600s, low to mid 700s, would it make sense for her to cosign on a loan with me or should I ask a family member with a more extensive credit history?

The dealer I am looking into has a financing program that gives a 500$ discount to recent grads (Honda), but should I look to get my loan from a bank I have a history with (Wells Fargo) or even joining a local Credit Union since they give the lowest rates? 

Also, if it helps, I am going to be making about a 20% downpayment depending on how much I can afford later this year (already have a good portion saved in a separate account) and I am aiming for an OTD price of $30,000 - $32,000 when I begin negotiations.

personalfinance,(FIN) Worked the summer in the U.S. as a J1-student and need clarification with my tax returns!,"I have no other place at this point to ask from. If anyone can help me, I will be very grateful.

I worked this summer in America for 3,5 months. I worked as a J1-Visa student. I am filling the 1040EZ form for my taxes from this summer. This Tax Return Form has been recommended to me the most, and my fellow Finns who worked at the same place have been using this form. Here are the instructions : https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040ez.pdf

I have done everything according to the guidelines / instructions that I have been given. In the form on line 15 I am asked for my Tax. The only place I can find this is in the instructions that I posted above. 

Line 15 also equals Line 17 in my case -&gt; Line 17 = Total Tax(823).

Line 21 = Total Payments, also equals -&gt; Federal Income Tax withheld from W2 = 787,26

Line 22 is where I have my problem. It says: If line 21 is more than line 17 (which in my case is not)-&gt;(Line 17=823 vs. Line 21=787,26) Subtract line 17 from 21. This is the amount you overpaid. 

For me line 17 is more than 21. The form gives you advice when it is the other way around but not when it is like this. I am thinking should I now leave it blank then, or should I come up with some number there. Line 22 is the first line in the Refund-part.

My friends from Finland who worked the same place as me, have had their numbers the way the form suggests but I have not. I believe the reason for all this is that I had a higher position than them, got paid more during the 3 and half month span, and worked more hours.

stocks,Mini Flash Crash? Or Glitch?,"So on December 16, 2015 when the Fed increased the interest rate, something weird happened which made me lose a lot of money. I'm not sure if it was an isolated incident with either the stock I owned (SQQQ) or the brokerage firm I belong to (Robin Hood)... 

I had a stop loss on my shares of SQQQ to protect myself from a loss greater than 5%. Immediately after the interest rates officially increased, there was something that I can't describe any better than a sharp downward spike in the share price, followed by a notification that my shares had all been sold (for a price below my stop-loss)...

This happened in a matter of seconds, and **when I refreshed the chart, the downward spike wasn't visible-** in fact, the shares were increasing.

How can a greater than 5% decrease in stocks happen but not even get recorded on the chart? I saw it on the chart in one second, and in the next it wasn't there...

To date, the stock market investments must have just about broken even. Capital value is at a loss but I have received a few dividends which probably breaks it even.

&amp;nbsp;

I searched and read through several posts on this very topic, and the general consensus seems to be that student loan debt and/or credit card debt should be paid first.  That being said, there are a few things specific to my situation that leave me in doubt as to the best choice of action.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the general lay of the land.  My wife and I have 23k in savings.  This amount does *not* include our 6 month emergency fund, so the 23k can all go toward a down payment.  We recently had a CD come due and have 6k to put toward student loans, credit card debt, or add to our savings.  My wife, coincidentally, has a student loan with a 5% interest rate that's currently sitting at around 6k, so we could pay it off.  This is the only loan either of us currently have that's in repayment.  Our other loans are all still in deferment because we are actively enrolled (she's in grad school and I'm finishing a bachelor's).  Total loan debt is currently at roughly 50k (including the 6k we could pay off).  Credit card debt is at 3k, split between two cards, but I should note that virtually all of that debt is not currently accruing any interest because it's on a newly opened card (Dec 2015) that's still well within the 0% APR promo period.  Total credit line is 11.5k, so we have 8.5k available.

&amp;nbsp;

We are looking to buy a home in the 200-250k range.  We want to purchase within about 6 months.

&amp;nbsp;

Both of us have good credit scores.  Mine is 766 and my wife's is 744.  My wife's was actually 777 prior to opening the new card in Dec 2015, and we expect it to rebound by the time we would actually apply for a mortgage.

&amp;nbsp;

Which option makes the most financial sense?

&amp;nbsp;

1. Pay off wife's 6k student loan (with 5% interest rate)  
2. Pay off 3k credit card debt (not currently accruing interest, but affecting overall credit line usage)  
3. Pay 3k toward wife's student loan AND pay off 3k credit card debt  
4. Save all 6k to be put toward down payment

personalfinance,[Help] (US) Should I have converted my entire traditional IRA to Roth? With many other words and considerations (Married filing separately),"I am trying to wrap my head around my/my wife's tax situation, and I think that I am close, but I am hoping to get clarification:

**First, why do we file separately?**

(tl:dr answer): In order to to use and stay eligible for the federal government's income-based repayment program/Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and pay about $10,000 total on a $50k loan with 6.8% interest instead of paying the whole thing, which with interest, would cost about $70,000.

(stl:dr): skip this part and go to: **Anyways**

* My wife has about $50k in student loans. I have $0. 
* With her income, she qualifies for [Income-based repayment of $70/mo](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action#view-repayment-plans) (saving us about $500/mo vs. not being on IBR)
* With our combined income, we **do not** qualify for IBR (if we file jointly)
* Therefore by filing separately, we take a tax hit, but still save more than the $2500 max student loan deduction each year.
* We also miss out on a lot of other tax breaks, but the $50k loan will also be forgiven after 120 consecutive payments (she has 36 down, 84 to go, but who's counting).
* Her total payments from now until the end of the program, let's just assume $100/mo average (7 years left on loan IBR program) will roughly total $8400.

**I have not run a detailed scenario of cost/benefit of filing jointly vs. filing separately, but I do know that being on Income-based repayment is extremely important for us with our incomes, and that if we filed jointly that we would not qualify due to our combined incomes.** 

I'm not a tax expert so go easy on me if I am totally fucking something up:

**Anyways, (holy shit that 1st part was super long) in 2014 Tax Year, I:**

* Contributed $3250 to my Roth in 2014
* Found out at tax time, that filing separately made me ineligible to contribute to a Roth
* I Recharacterized 2014 contributions as Non-deductible Tradional iRA Contributions

**2015 Tax Year, I:**

* Contributed non-deductible $1k to traditional
* Converted contributions to Roth

**My Questions:**

* Since I recharacterized my 2014 roth contributions as non-deductible, should I (or should I have) convert them to Roth?
* Do I owe tax on my 2015 $1k conversion?
* Should we get divorced on paper? :) 
* Is there a case for filing jointly?

**Other considerations:** 

* We have no kids, yet.
* Her income is roughly 31,000, mine is 45,000
* We own a home (mine is the only name on the mortgage)",finance,1455492291

I just got my tax return for 2015 back, and it was a little over $7k, so I put all of that towards my private student loans (interest rates were 7.74% and 8.49%), and got them completely paid off!!

I still have ~14k in federal stafford loans ($7.3k @ 3.61% and $6.9k at 4.41%) with a combined minimum payment of $150 a month.

Should I focus on paying these off first, or should I start putting more money into my 401k? Or should I even potentially open an IRA? Right now the market is obviously not doing that hot, so my initial thought is I should put as much as possible towards the loans to get them paid off asap. But if the market starts to recover should I put more in my 401k if that return is greater than the 4.5% interest I'm paying on my loans?

My employer matches 50% up to my first 8%, plus an additional guaranteed 3%. Right now I'm just doing the 8% into a Roth 401k, and I'm pretty sure the 7% my employer puts in isn't in the Roth, but just a traditional 401k.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!",finance,1455497101

personalfinance,First time business owner in U.S. Questions about personal Taxes.,"Hello all, thank you in advance.

Last year (June 1st) myself and a few partners started an IT company. So far, we have done pretty well and have already turned into a profitable company. 

We have a bookkeeper who's been doing our books and filing our taxes quarterly since we first opened. However, I have been drawing an un-taxed, ""guaranteed payment"" since May of last year as my only income source. I have some set aside for paying my taxes, but I'm still not clear on what the tax procedures are for someone like me. Here are some questions and general info about my situation. Any and all advice is welcome and very much appreciated.

I grew up poor and have never made a lot in my adult life. That is starting to change. I was never taught money management skills and now I'm 30 and just now learning how to budget, set goals, etc... I'm taking strides to better my financial situation and learn how to better manage my money. 

I'm not married (yet), no kids, no mortgage (rent), 2 financed cars, and a decent amount of credit card debt (~$10K). I worked for someone else from Jan - Apr of last year so a small portion of taxes have been withheld there. I'm also a student with a decent amount of out-of-pocket tuition, student loan interest, and my fourth and final year of my ""Hope Credit"" to write off/deduct this year.  I've been told I can write off my home internet (I'm in  IT and frequently use it for work), my vehicle which I use frequently for work, part of my rent due to my home office, etc... What are some other things that I can write off or deduct to lower my tax liability?

Also: 

Question 1:  Should I be filing my taxes quarterly?


Question 2: In Nevada my only tax liabilities are federal and SS/Medicare (no state taxes). I understand that I pay both of these, but when I look at online calculators, there is a ""deductible amount"" for the SS/Medicare portion. Could someone explain that to me? 
 
Example: 

- Social Security = $3,000
* Medicare = $1,000
* Total self-employment tax = $4,000
* Tax-Deductible Portion = $2,000
 
Which of these numbers do I expect to pay? 

Question 3: What else is there that I should probably know?

My income was ~22,000 and ~1,800 was withheld via federal tax (I have no state tax)

On my 1098-T it said i was awarded $11,000 in scholarships and was billed nothing for tuition. This is because my tuition was billed for in 2014 but paid in 2015. It asked if I had a 1098-T from 2014 and I did which was $22,000 in scholarships but $40,000 in tuition (part of the tuition that was for the 2015 year).

I know I paid $20,000 for that semester and received the $11,000 in scholarships but because my 1098-T has a 0 for billed tuition, I think it is acting like i received $11,000 and had to pay none of that for school.

Using Turbotax right now but i tried Tax act and the questions are basically the same and I had the same result.

Was wondering if there is anything I can do, I don't have the means to pay in 1,300 and I think that earning 22,000 and being a student paying 10k over what I received in a scholarship isn't right.

personalfinance,"Going back to college (or wanting to, at least)","So I've made the decision recently to go back to college. I'm 23, working in a job that isn't sustainable that I dislike (teaching preschool).


I know what I want to go back and do (accounting), I'm motivated enough to make it happen. The advice I need is whether or not I should wait to go back or just go all in.


Stats:
I'm debt-free, except for a minor credit card. I have no student loans from my first time through college.


I was killing it in my last job and making a solid amount of money. 
Because of this, I decided to save up and finally bought my first car. When my boss learned about my new car etc., he started (over a week or so) seriously moving in on some sexual harassment and it got to the point that I felt I had to quit for my own safety. So I have car payments still but no longer the income that would've supported it. With the insurance as well (bare minimum to meet state requirements) + car payments, $500/month. I know it was dumb. I had no idea this would happen.


Income: Not great. I'm working a preschool teaching job that I managed to get so it's obviously better than nothing, but it's significantly lower pay than my last job (half).


Part of me wants to wait and save more before I go back, but I've seen quite a few people who waited forever because there's never enough money and eventually life happens, etc, and they never go back. I don't want to be that person.


I'm not saving much each month, and I'm scrimping by (cut my eating costs as low as I can and I essentially only pay my bills (no expenses on going out) and barely break even each month).


Should I pull out student loans? Wait to go back when I'm hardly saving at the job I'm at? I don't want to live like this forever.


Oh, and I also will owe money when taxes come through. I was working real estate this year in Washington and so I'm paying a lot of federal taxes. So far I've gotten it down to about $1,500 that I owe. That's exactly how much I have in my emergency savings account.

personalfinance,(Spain) Need advice on the best way to pay off mortgage asap by selling another property,"Hi reddit,

I have a decision to make in the next months and would like your collective wisdom and help, because I think it is critical that I don’t mess this up.

If you think that this is not the right subreddit to post, please let me know.

I am open to creative ideas also! And please ask me for any thing that you would like me to explain in more detail.

-----------------

I live in Barcelona, Spain, in a flat with my father, 64, he’s chronically sick and receiving a pension from the state. A few years ago, my father asked for a mortgage totalling 107,000 €, to be paid in 20 years. We have a low interest rate of 1.35% + current Euribor rates (which is reevaluated every 6 months, I think).

The reason why he asked for that had multiple factors (an inheritance, taxes, flat renovation… a bunch of things are clubbed in there), to keep things simple, let’s just say that this mortgage is to pay for the flat we’re living in.

Now remain to be payed 77,741 € (+ compound interest, which I estimate to be ~ 7,000 € at current interest rates). And we pay about 550 € per month.

I have been paying for it for the last 5 years, resulting in hardly increasing my savings at all.

My top priority is to get rid of this expense, either by fully paying the mortgage upfront, or by having some source of income that covers for its cost of about 7,000 €/year, without having to spend my own hard earned money (you may argue with this, but I believe me having to pay this mortgage that I never really chose to get into is unfair).

This mortgage is our main major expense, besides a small loan that we will pay fully in a few months and that I will ignore.

Right now, me and my father together have savings for a total of 34,000 €. We are willing to use some of this money, to pay for the mortgage, but keeping an emergency fund of at minimum 10,000 €.

In the other hand, my mother (56) is paying two mortgages: one for the flat she’s living in in the same city (my parents are divorced, my mom got married again), and one of a “vacation flat” near the border with France (a place called Roses).

On the first mortgage, for the flat in Barcelona, it doesn’t concern me now. I know she’s paying around 900 € per month and remains something like 90,000 € to be payed.

On the second mortgage, for the flat in Roses, remain about 60,000 € to be payed. I consider this flat a waste, because we can only rent it during summer, and the rest of the year it is sucking money. Mainly property tax, and flat rates for electricity and water, which amounts to about 140€ per month, when no one is living in the flat. So this a quite dead asset. We can rent it during July and August for 3,000 €, but that’s pretty much it. I tried to calculate how much we could earn by renting from March to November, but I think it probably wouldn’t be worth the hassle for the money. And due to the place, it would be difficult to find tenants in the first place.

So I am thinking about selling it, and with the profit then paying my mortgage upfront, removing this expense.

I was told by a person working in real estate business in Roses, that I can sell this flat for at least 130,000 €, if I do some reparations that maybe would cost 3,000 €. This would result in 130,000 (price) - 3,000 (reparations) - 60,000 (amount of mortgage due to pay) = 67,000 € in cash.

Since the flat is my mother’s property, the money would also be her property. I could use this money to pay for my mortgage, but she would have to donate me the 67,000 €. There are also some other taxes for this kind of transactions, such as the fee of a notary and what not.

We concluded with a financial advisor that from selling the flat to me paying the mortgage, the cost in fees and crap would be something in the range of 7,000 to 10,000 €.

Thus, we are left with 67,000 - 10,000 = 57,000 € from selling the flat in Roses and making this money usable to pay for my mortgage.

If I pay my mortgage upfront, there is a tiny fee of 0.25% of what is payed, in this cause it would be just 200 € so I will ignore it.

Considering that me and my father have 34,000 € in savings, we could pay for what remains until covering the mortgage in full. This would be:

77,000 (remaining of mortgage, rounding down) - 57,000 (from selling flat) = 20,000 €

In theory we would end up with one less asset (Roses flat), one less mortgage (enabling more savings, better financial health and increased choice), and 14,000 € in savings.

I think this would be an immediate solution, and I don’t really trust my mother that much so I would prefer a plan that doesn’t require her consistent cooperation during years and doesn’t require me being a slave...

Paying 550 € / month while living in Spain is not a small amount. Here average salary (for 40 hours /week) is something about 1,500 €/month, or less.

Also, I am putting aside the financial situation of my mother, because I don’t really know the details.

Since this is a very important decision, and I understand that mistakes can be very costly, I would like reddit’s views of this problem. Do you think my plan is correct? Do you see flaws on it? Do you have some advice or a better idea?

Thanks!
Luis

PD: you may think that this is 'not right' or 'unfair' in some way. As my family situation is a bit complicated, I would prefer that answers stick to asset management considerations and practicalities, however feel free to ask anything.

---------------------------------

tl,dr:

I (M 31) live in Barcelona (Spain) with my dad (chronically sick, 64). I want to get rid of a mortgage (to my name) for a current value of 77,000 € and interest rate of Euribor + 1.35. I estimate remaining interest at about 7,000 €.

We also have savings for 34,000 €.

My mother (divorced from my father and remarried, 56) is paying a mortgage for a flat in Roses, near France, due to pay are 60,000 €. This flat, if sold would yield about 130,000 €. It can be rented, but only yields about 3,000 €/year because outside of summer it is difficult to find tenants.

I want to consider selling the flat in Roses and using the profit to pay for my mortgage. We estimated incurring fees for the full operation at about 10,000 €.

This would give a ballpark estimation of our total balance, after the operation (to be brief, I removed cost of renovation of the Roses flat to be able to sell it):

+ 130,000 € (sell Roses flat) - 77,000 € (my mortgage) - 60,000 € (pay Roses flat mortgage) - 10,000 € (total fees) + 34,000 € (our savings) = + 17,000 € (that we would keep as positive balance)

Please let me know your opinion and what you would do different, if anything.

In terms of investments, I have an RPP, an RRSP, and a TFSA, with balances of $71K, $64K, and $25K, respectively.

My total debt is $380 on a credit card with an annual interest rate of 20%.

I own no property and currently rent an apartment at $1250 a month. Other expenses include the usual: food, utilities, car/life insurance, etc.

Every year, I max out my RRSP using my company bonus. My employer allows for direct deposit of my entire gross bonus into my RRSP account. My RPP contributions come directly off of my paycheque, for which my employer matches every dollar.

After everything is said and done, whatever disposable income I have left, I contribute into my TFSA.

Given the state of the market right now and how it's affecting my investments (some of my investments are in equity), continuing to contribute to my TFSA seems futile. In other words, I put money in and it just disappears when the markets take a tumble. I can justify RRSP contributions because of the 'tax deductible' nature of the account, which always saves my a** when it comes time to file my taxes. As for the RPP, who can say no to free money from the employer?

I've heard from several people that we should consider investing in a home or in maxing out our Roth IRAs. I'm nervous with taking on more debt when we already have more debt than our income, but with the zero interest and income based repayment well meaning people keep telling me to reconsider. 

 We are going to be in this area for the next 5-7 years and with our savings and this settlement we could put on a good downpayment, which even with taxes, fees, etc., would still be better than our current rent (university town, more like university county).

Also, we'd like to reduce our tax burden for next year, so I'm thinking the Roth IRA option?

personalfinance,Is it worth cancelling my credit card to stick it to BOFA?,"The backstory to this is that I was very unhappy with Bank of America and decided to move to a credit union.  I closed my checking and savings accounts, but left my small credit card with them.  I only keep one credit card, however, so, I wanted to wait until I had a replacement before closing the BOFA credit card.  I have replaced the old credit card with a better rewards card with a better interest rate.  Then someone told me that I'd be better off keeping it open with no balance because closing a card dings my credit.

So, my question is this: Is there damage done by closing a credit card?  And if so, if I'm really upset with Bank of America and really want to close my credit card there, does the damage outweigh my persona vendetta against the bank?",finance,1455566602

I'm getting a Tax Refund back about $3000. I need $500 of that to pay off a personal loan from my mother and the rest is what I have a question about.

 I make enough to cover my monthly bills but not for anything extra/emergency fund. Let's call the money from tax that I can use to help myself at $2500. 

I have 2 accounts in collections right now both for Universities that I have attended previously. 

One bill is $1337.12 and I've negotiated them down to $1069 if I can pay it off all at once. 

The other bill is for $1422.08 and I can get them down to $1137.67. 

I have 3 credit cards: 

$739.78 at 23.15% interest

$440.68 at 19.99%

$455.61 at 22.49%

My thought is to pay off 2 of my higher interest cards and the lower amount collections bill (it's been in collections longer) and that will free me up to make bigger payments on the last credit card until it's chipped away and then make bigger payments on my other account in collections. 

My credit score is currently: 590 so I'm not really worried about this account sitting in collections as it's already done the damage it was going to do and if I pay off the older account (I think?) It will help offset that. 

My current phone bill is $116 for my partner and I (she covers my part of the water bill so it comes out) I can lower that to $71.59 if I pay off our equipment installation plan at $222.05.

investing,What is really going on in China,"China is on the edge of a currency crisis.

For the last year Chinese growth has been slowing. Confidence has been eroded with people starting to believe that the peoples republic has been falsifying economic data. Capital flight of Chinese citizens and business's are skyrocketing. The country is now burning through foriegn reserves at an unprecedented rate attempting to slow the downward pressure on the RMB. Another devaluation is a certainty.

Currently China is still reporting a economic growth rate of 6.9%. How accurate that is no one really knows. Some estimates have it as low as 3-4%. Meanwhile the money supply has grown by 14% in the same period. Over the last year Chinese business' and citizens have moved and estimated 1 trillion out of the country. Forcing them to burn through reserves to support the currency value. This is currently happening at a rate of about 100 billion per month.

Now China does still have a large current accounts surplus slowing the net outflow. Despite this surplus net capital outflow is still over  200 billion per quarter. At the same time they are slashing interest rates making it less appealing to keep savings in the country. Exports are currently down 11.2% while imports are down 18.8%. If this trend continues it will only accelerate the problem.

The biggest problem in this is China is attempting the ""Impossible Trinity"" of macroeconomics. Maintaining a fixed exchange rate, free flow of capital, and independent monetary policy together is not possible. This can't work it never has. The end result is almost always a full blown currency crisis.

personalfinance,To FHA or not to FHA?,"I was thinking of putting 5% down and getting an FHA loan.

but whenever I read posts on here, people seem to recommend against it.

Why is that? Is it really a such a bad deal?

And just to fill in some specifics on my situation.
I have no debt, but I do have bad credit (I spent the last year clearing up old debts, but there are currently several ""settled for less the full amount"" types of accounts, that had previously gone unpaid for years).  

I also have a fair amount of actual cash on hand now (about 200k)

so, no matter what, with my bad credit (my score is about 640, with the problematic items on there for another 3-4 years - it should slowly rise, but i don't see any drastic uptick in the near immediate future), and low income (about 30k a year) I'm sure that I'd need mortgage insurance anyway, 

...and as for the 3.5% rate, I don't think i'd personally beat that anywhere.

So, I am not even sure with my income and credit IF I even have other options.

I live in Los Angeles, so any decent home is about 600K.

My plan is to buy a first home that needs some work (I'm very handy with home repairs/construction) live in it, and fix it up, and eventually rent out all or part of it (after a couple of years).

and then, couple years down the line, buy a second house, and do the same thing (which is why only having to put 5% down on house number one is also attractive).

Anyway, to get the whole ball rolling, I was thinking that the FHA loan (with only 5% down would be my best bet).

Plus with many of the tax and other benefits offered to first time home buyers of a personal residence (especially here in Los Angeles and California as well as the federal benefits), it seems like a good decision.

But, as I mentioned, I see so many advising against FHA loans, that I wanted to ask those who know better, as to why this course of action might be a bad decision? (if it is).

Or, given my circumstances, I'd also ask those wiser in financial matters, if there was a better option than an FHA home mortgage?",finance,1455585788
btc,"Adam Back &amp; Greg Maxwell are experts in mathematics and engineering, but not in markets and economics. They should not be in charge of ""central planning"" for things like ""max blocksize"". They're desperately attempting to prevent the market from deciding on this. But it *will*, despite their efforts.","Adam Back apparently missed the boat on being an early adopter, even after he was *personally informed* about Bitcoin in an email from Satoshi.

So Adam didn't mine or buy when bitcoins were cheap.

And he didn't join Bitcoin's Github repo until the price was at an all-time high.

He did invent HashCash, and on his Twitter page he proudly claims that ""Bitcoin is just HashCash plus inflation control."" 

But even with all his knowledge of math and cryptography, he obviously did *not* understand enough about *markets and economics* - so he missed the boat on Bitcoin - and now he's working overtime to try to make up for his big mistake, with $21+55 million in venture-capital fiat backing him and his new company, Blockstream (founded in November 2014).

Meanwhile, a lot of the rest of us, without a PhD in math and crypto, were actually *smarter than Adam* about *markets and economics*.

And this is really the heart of the matter in these ongoing debates we're still forced to keep having with him.

So now it actually might make a certain amount of economic sense for us to spend some of our time trying to get /u/adam3us Adam Back (and /u/nullc [Gregory Maxwell](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42hl7g/greg_maxwell_admits_the_main_reason_for_the_block/)) to *stop hijacking our Bitcoin codebase*. 

Satoshi didn't give the Bitcoin repo to a couple of economically clueless C/C++ devs so that they could cripple it by imposing artificial scarcity on blockchain capacity.

Satoshi was against central economic planners, and he gave Bitcoin to *the world* so that it could grow naturally as a decentralized, market-based emergent phenomenon.

**Adam Back didn't understand the economics of Bitcoin back then - and he still doesn't understand it now.**

And now we're also discovering that [he apparently has a very weak understanding of legal concepts as well](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45k0kq/this_twitter_conversation_is_strikingly_relevant/).

And that [he also has a very weak understanding of negotiating techniques as well](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45rqb3/heres_adam_back_stalling_master_hei_gavin_lets/).

Who is he to tell us we should *not* do simple ""max blocksize""-based scaling now - simply because he *might* have some pie-in-the-sky Rube-Goldberg-contraption solution months or years down the road?

He hasn't even figured out how to do decentralized path-finding in his precious Lightning Network.

So really what he's saying is:

&gt; I have half a napkin sketch here for a complicated expensive Rube-Goldberg-contraption solution with a cool name ""Lightning Network""... 

&gt; which *might* work several months or years down the road...

&gt; except I'm still stuck on the *decentralized path-finding* part...

&gt; but that's only a *detail*! 

&gt; just like that little detail of ""inflation control"" which I was also too dumb to add to HashCash for years and years...

&gt; and which I was also too dumb to even *recognize* when someone shoved *a working implementation of it* in my face and told me I might be able to get rich off of it... 

&gt; So *trust me*... 

&gt; My solution will be much safer than that *""other""* ultra-simple KISS solution (Classic)...

&gt; which only involved changing a 1 MB to a 2 MB in some code, based on empirical tests which showed that the miners and their infrastructure would actually already probably support as much as 3 MB or 4 MB...

&gt; and [which is already smoothly running on over 1,000 nodes on the network!](http://nodecounter.com/)

*That's* his roadmap: pie-in-the-sky, a day late and a dollar short.

*That's* what he has been trying to force on the community for over a year now - relying on censorship of online forums and international congresses, relying on spreading lies and FUD - and now even making vague ridiculous legal threats...

...but we *still* won't be intimidated by him, even after a year of his FUD and lies, with his PhD and his $21+55 million in VC backing.

Because he appears to be just plain *wrong* again.

Just like *he was wrong about Bitcoin when he first heard about it.*

Adam Back needs to face the simple fact that he does *not* understand how markets and economics work in the real world.

And he also evidently does *not* understand how [negotiating](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45rqb3/heres_adam_back_stalling_master_hei_gavin_lets/) and [law](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45k0kq/this_twitter_conversation_is_strikingly_relevant/) and open-source projects work in the real world.

If he didn't have Theymos /u/theymos supporting him via [censorship](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc+bitcoin_classic/search?q=theymos+censor&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), and /u/austindhill [Austin Hill and the other venture capitalists](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/41c8n5/as_core_blockstream_collapses_and_classic_gains/) backing him with millions of dollars, then Adam Back would probably be just another unknown Bitcoin researcher right now, toiling away over yet another possible scaling solution candidate which nobody was paying much attention to yet, and which *might* make a splash a few months or years down the road (provided he eventually figures out that one nagging little detail about how to add the ""decentralized path-finding""!).

In the meantime, Adam Back has hijacked *our* code to use as *his* own little pet C/C++ crypto programming project, for his maybe-someday scaling solution - and he is doing everything he can to suppress [Satoshi's original, much simpler scaling plan](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3wo9pb/satoshi_nakamoto_october_04_2010_074840_pm_it_can/).

Adam is all impeding [Bitcoin's natural growth in adoption and price](https://imgur.com/jLnrOuK), through:

- his misguided attempt to [prevent the market from deciding on the size of blocks](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3xdc9e/nobody_has_been_able_to_convincingly_answer_the/);

- his misguided attempt to prevent the market from deciding on which software to run (ie, [his well-known and totally unjustified aversion to hard forks - because while they help Bitcoin, they hurt Blockstream](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43h4cq/they_coreblockstream_fear_a_hard_fork_will_remove/)).

**Transactions vs. Price graph showed amazingly tight correlation from 2011 to 2014. Then Blockstream was founded in November 2014 - and the correlation decoupled and the price stagnated.**

Seriously, look closely at the graph in that imgur link:

https://imgur.com/jLnrOuK

What's going on in that graph?

- Transactions and price were incredibly tightly correlated from 2011 to 2014 - and then at the start of 2015, they suddenly ""decoupled"". 

- This decoupling coincided with the attempt by Core / Blockstream to impose artificial scarcity on blocksize. (Blockstream was founded in November of 2014.)

So it seems logical to formulate the following *hypothesis*:

- *Absent the attempt by Core / Blockstream to impose artificial scarcity on blocksize and, and their attempt to confuse the debate with lies and FUD, the price would have continued to rise.*

**This, in a nutshell, is the hypothesis which the market is eager to test.** 

Via a hard-fork.

Which was not controversial to anyone in the Bitcoin community previously.

And the market probably *will* test this. [As soon as it needs to.](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44y8ut/be_patient_about_classic_its_already_a_success_in/) 

Because Bitstream's $21+55 million in VC funding is just a drop in the bucket next to Bitcoin's $5-6 million dollars in market capitalization - which [smart Bitcoin investors will do everything they can to preserve and increase](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc+bitcoin_classic/search?q=author%3Aforkiusmaximus&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

**The hubris and blindness of certain C/C++ programmers**

In Adam's mind, he's probably a ""good guy"" - just some innocent programmer into crypto who thinks he understands Bitcoin and ""knows best"" how to scale it.

*But he's wrong about the economics and scaling of Bitcoin now - just like he was wrong about the economics and scaling of Bitcoin back when he missed the boat on being an early adopter.*

His vision back then (when he missed the boat) was too pessimistic - and his scaling plan right now (when he assents to the roadmap published by Gregory Maxwell) is too baroque (ie, needlessly complex) - and ""too little, too late"".

**A self-fulfilling prophecy?**

In some very real sense, there is a risk here that Adam's own pessimism about Bitcoin could turn into *a self-fulfilling prophecy*. 

In other words, he never thought Bitcoin would succeed - and now maybe it really *won't* succeed, now that he has unfairly hijacked its main repo and is attempting to steer it in a direction which [Satoshi clearly never intended](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3ws6f8/serious_question_for_unullc_upetertodd_uadam3us/).

It's even quite possible that there could be a subtle psychological phenomenon at play here: at some (unconscious) level, maybe Adam *wants* to prove that he was ""right"" when he missed the boat on Bitcoin because he thought it would never work. 

After all, if Bitcoin fails (even due to him unfairly hijacking the code and the debate), then in some sense, it would be a kind of vindication for him. 

Adam Back has simply never believed in Bitcoin and supported it the way most of the rest of us do. So he may (subconsciously) actually want to see it fail. 

**Subconscious ""ego"" issues may be at play.**

There may be some complex, probably subconscious ""ego"" issues at play here. 

I know this is a serious accusation - but after years of this foot-dragging and stonewalling from Adam, trying to strangle Bitcoin's natural growth, he shouldn't be surprised if people start accusing *him* (his ego, his blindness, his lack of understanding of markets and economics) of being one of the main risk factors which could seriously hurt Bitcoin.

This is probably a much more serious problem than he himself can probably ever comprehend. For it goes to one of his ""blind spots"" - which (by definition), he can never see - but the rest of the community can.

He thinks he's just some smart guy who is trying to help Bitcoin - and he *is* smart about certain things and he *can* help Bitcoin in certain ways. 

For example, I was a big fan of Adam's back when I read his posts on bitcointalk.org about ""homomorphic encryption"" (which I guess now has been renamed as ""Confidential Transactions"" - ""CT"").

But, regarding his work on the so-called ""Lightning Network"", many people are still unconvinced on a few major points - eg:

- LN would be quite complex and is still unproven, so we actually have no indication of whether it might not contain some minor but fatal flaw which will prevent it from working altogether;

- In particular, there isn't even a ""napkin sketch"" or working concept for the most important component of LN - ""decentralized path-finding"":

https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3gjnmd/lightning_may_not_be_a_scaling_solution/

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43sgqd/unullc_vs_buttcoiner_on_decentralized_routing_of/

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43oi26/lightning_network_is_selling_as_a_decentralized/

- It is simply unconscionable for Adam to oppose simpler ""max blocksize""-based, on-chain scaling solutions *now*, apparently due to his unproven belief that a more complex off-chain and *still-unimplemented* scaling solution such as LN *later* would somehow be preferable (especially when LN still lacks a any plan for providing the key component of ""decentralized path-finding"").

**Venture capitalists and censors have made Adam much more important than he should be.**

If this were a ""normal"" or ""traditional"" flame war on a dev mailing list (ie, if there were no censorship from Theymos helping Adam, and no $21-55 million in VC helping Adam) - *then the community would be ignoring Adam.*

He'd be just another lonely math PhD toiling away on some half-baked pet project, ignored by the community instead of ""leading"" it.

So Adam (and [Greg](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44qr31/gregory_maxwell_unullc_has_evidently_never_heard/)) are not smart about everything. 

In particular, they do not appear to have a deep understanding how markets and economics work. 

And we have *proof* of this - eg, in the form of:

- Greg's [repeated idiotic pronouncements about markets and economics](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc+bitcoin_classic/search?q=maxwell+markets&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) - and [his on-going pattern of trying to exert undue control over open-source software projects](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/45ail1/wikipedians_on_greg_maxwell_in_2006_now_cto_of/); 

- Adam's failure to become an early Bitcoin adopter;

- their boneheaded insistence on imposing artificial scarcity on blockchain capacity - by failing to support a modest increase in ""max blocksize"" now, even though an implementation supporting such an increase is [already up and running smoothly on over 1000 full-nodes on the network](http://nodecounter.com/).

**Satoshi was an exception. He knew enough about markets and math, and enough about engineering and economics, to release the Bitcoin code which has worked almost flawlessly for 7 years now.**

But guys like Adam and Greg are only good at engineering - they're terrible at economics. 

As programmers, they have an engineer's mindset, where something is a ""solution"" only if it satisfies certain strict mathematical criteria.

But look around. A lot of technologies have become massively successful, despite being imperfect from the point of view of programming / mathematics, strictly speaking. 

Just look at HTML / JavaScript / CSS - certainly not the greatest of languages in the opinions of many serious programmers - and yet here we are today, where they have become the de facto low-level languages which most of the world uses to interact on the Internet.

**The ""perfect"" is the enemy of the ""good"".**

The above saying captures much of the essence of the arguments continually being made against guys like Adam and Greg. 

They don't understand how a solution which is merely ""good enough"" can actually take over the world. 

They tend to ""over-engineer"" stuff, and they tend to ignore important issues about how markets and programs can interact *in the real world*.

In other words, they fail to understand that sometimes it's more important to get something ""imperfect"" out the door *now*, instead of taking too long to release something ""perfect""...

... because time and tide waits for no man, and Bitcoin / Blockstream / Core are *not* the only cryptocurrency game in town.

If Adam and Greg can't provide the scaling which the market needs, [when it needs it](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44rm9e/the_1_thing_thatll_kill_early_traction_in_a/), then the market can and will look elsewhere.

This is why so many of us are arguing that (as paradoxical and deflating as it may feel for certain coders with massive egos) they *don't* actually always know best - and maybe, just maybe, Bitcoin would thrive even better *if they would simply get out of the way and let the market decide certain things.*

**Coders often think they're the smartest guys in the room.**

Many people involved in Bitcoin know that coders like Adam and Greg are used to thinking that they're the smartest guys in the room.

In particular, we know this because many of us have gone through this same experience in our own fields of expertise (but evidently most of us have acquired enough social skills and self awareness to be able to ""compensate"" for this much better than they have).

So we know how this can lead to a kind of hubris - where they simply automatically brush off and disregard the objections of ""the unwashed masses"" who happen to disagree with them.

Many of us also have had the experience of talking to ""that C/C++ programmer guy"" - in a class, at a seminar, at a party - and realizing that ""he just doesn't get"" many of the things that everyone else does get.

Why is why some of us continue to lecture Adam and Greg like this.

Because we *know* guys like them - and we *know* that they aren't as smart about everything as they think they are.

They should really sit down and seriously analyze a comment such as the following:

---

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44qr31/gregory_maxwell_unullc_has_evidently_never_heard/czs7uis

&gt; He [Greg Maxwell] is not alone. Most of his team shares his ignorance.

&gt; Here's everything you need to know: The team considers the limit simply a question of engineering, and will silence discussion on its economic impact since ""this is an engineering decision.""

&gt; It's a joke. They are literally re-creating the technocracy of the Fed through a combination of computer science and a complete ignorance of the way the world works.

&gt; If ten smart guys in a room could outsmart the market, we wouldn't need Bitcoin.

~ /u/tsontar

---

Adam and Greg probably read comments like that and just brush them off. 

They probably think guys like /u/tsontar are irrelevant. 

They probably say to themselves: ""That guy doesn't have a PhD in mathematics, and he doesn't know how to do C pointer arithmetic - so what can *he* possibly know about Bitcoin?""

But history has already shown that a lot of times, a non-mathematician, non-C-coder *does* know more about Bitcoin than a cryptography expert with a PhD in math.

Clearly, /u/tsontar understands *markets* way better than /u/adam3us or /u/nullc.

Do they really grasp the seriousness of the criticism being leveled at them? 

&gt; **They are literally re-creating the technocracy of the Fed through a combination of computer science and a complete ignorance of the way the world works.**

&gt; **If ten smart guys in a room could outsmart the market, we wouldn't need Bitcoin.**

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44qr31/gregory_maxwell_unullc_has_evidently_never_heard/czs7uis

Do Adam and Greg really understand what this means?

Do they really understand what a serious indictment of their intellectual faculties this apparently off-handed remark really is?

These are the *real* issues now - issues about markets and economics.

And as we keep saying: if they don't understand the real issues, then they should please just *get out of the way.*

After months and months of them failing to mount any kind of intelligent response to such utterly scathing criticisms - and their insistence on closing their eyes and [pretending that Bitcoin doesn't need a simple scaling solution as of ""yesterday""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3ynswc/just_click_on_these_historical_blocksize_graphs/) - the Bitcoin-using public is finally figuring out that *Adam and Greg cannot deliver what we need, when we need it.*

One of the main things that the Bitcoin-using public *doesn't* want is the artificial ""max blocksize"" which Adam and Greg are stubbornly and blindly trying to force on us via the code repo which they hijacked from us.

One of the main things the Bitcoin-using public *does* want is for Bitcoin to be freed from the shackles of any artificial scarcity on the blockchain capacity, which guys like Adam and Greg insist on imposing upon it - in their utter cluelessness about how markets and economics and [emergent phenomena](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc+bitcoin_classic/search?q=emergent&amp;restrict_sr=on) actually work.

**People's money is on the line. Taking *our* code back from *them* may actually be the most important job many of us have right now.**

This isn't some kind of academic exercise, nor is it some kind of joke. 

For many of us, this is dead serious. 

There is currently $ 5-6 billion dollars of wealth on the line (and possibly much, much more someday).

And many people think that *Adam and Greg* are the main parties responsible for jeopardizing this massive wealth - with their arrogance and their obtuseness and their refusal to understand that *they aren't smarter than the market.*

So, most people's only hope now is that the market itself stop Adam and Greg from interfering in issues of markets and economics and simple scaling which are clearly beyond their comprehension - ie (to reiterate):

- their misguided refusal to [let the market decide on the size of blocks](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3xdc9e/nobody_has_been_able_to_convincingly_answer_the/);

- their misguided refusal to let the market decide which software to run - ie, [their aversion to a hard fork, because a hard fork would help Bitcoin but would hurt Blockstream](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43h4cq/they_coreblockstream_fear_a_hard_fork_will_remove/).

And after a year of their increasingly desperate FUD and lies and stone-walling and foot-dragging, it looks like [the market is eventually going to simply route around them](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44y8ut/be_patient_about_classic_its_already_a_success_in/).",cryptocurrency,1455587670

personalfinance,25 female. Looking to pay debts and save .,"Hello everyone,

I am hoping this sub can help me. I just started a job in California that pays about $2,700 a month after taxes. I was living paycheck to paycheck before and I do not want to live like that anymore. I would love  to pay off debts as quickly as possible and save some money. I am terrible with finances and budgeting. I used my credit cards for emergencies and gas when I had nothing in my bank account. I usually take my own lunch to work.  Here  is a breakdown of my debts and expenses. 

Money I give to my parents- $100-200/month 

Car payment- $189 a month. In 12 months it will be paid off. 

Car insurance - $115 / month 

Credit Card 1 - $1300 total (22.99% apr) 

Credit Card 2- $400 total (18.99% apr) 

Credit Card 3 - $400  total (no interest until August 2016)

Student loans- $10,000. I will be paying $105 / month 

Gas -$100/ month 

Rent - $200 / month

Groceries- $200 or less / month 

Weekend spending - $50 or less  on dinner and drinks 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I just want to be out of debt. Thank you!

Edit: I live with my sister and she is kind enough to not charge me a crazy amount of rent. I do give money to my parents just to help them out. It varies month to month. I also added the interest rates on my credit cards. 

I am also looking into getting dental work done and finally getting my braces. My job offers dental and medical HMO. The dental office I went to is quoting me $1200 to get my wisdom teeth removed. With my dental HMO I should only be paying about $1800 for braces. I am looking into getting a second opinion for my dental work. I am wondering if it would be wise to pay off my credit cards first before getting any dental work done?

dogecoin,Of Wolves and Weasels - Day 768 - Beware BitVenus (and their Ilk),"Hey all, GoodShibe here!

So I recently had some red-flags raised my way in regards to the new exchange BitVenus.com (don't go there).  

I'd first heard of them a couple of weeks back when [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/4421nb/bitvenus_added_doge_trading_options_way_to_go/) went up, but didn't think much of it.

However, after reading the most recent posts by /u/ezone2kil

* [*Scam Warning* Bitvenus](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/45vp8x/scam_warning_bitvenus/)
* [Update on BitVenus scam](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/45zk0y/update_on_bitvenus_scam/)

It's now become pretty clear that this site -- that proclaims to ""Offer Instant Payouts!"" -- is one to stay far, far away from, especially after /u/ezone2kil received the following message from those behind the site:

___
Dear Customer,

Thank you for contacting us. Due to the big volume we are currently able to process only transactions which are over 5M Dogecoins. I've noticed that your transaction is for 1573980 Dogecoins, if you want you can reach the level of 5M with sending 3426020 more Dogecoins to the same address D9dtdHCyBthRXgM6oJg8YaPAkVrEB1GbT8 and your payment will be processed instantly. Or if you prefer we can start a refund procedure for you (please be aware that a refund procedure will take some time).

Regards, 

BitVenus
___

Of course there's no mention at all on the site that it's a 5 Million DOGE minimum to qualify for their ""instant payout"".

Instead you get: 'Send us more money and we'll release the money we already have.  Pinky swear!'

Unfortunately sites like this tend to pop up from time to time, offering the classic ""too good to be true"" sweet spot of ""Instant"" transfers, often of Dogecoin to some sort of 'real' money payout.

The [now-defunct](https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025700/https://dogesolutions.com/) DogeSolutions.com [did something very similar](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2xx3ei/competition_megagiveaway_by_httpsdogesolutionscom/) last year, though their trick was much more openly stupid (charging people $5 USD per trade).

They were also promising the holy trinity of Fast, Anonymous, Doge-To-Paypal (or Skrill) payments.

Simply put: Any time you see some website telling you that they can give you Instant, Anonymous, Coin-To-""Cash"" transactions... run away.  Don't walk, don't bother reading their ToS.  Run.  

**Especially if they're telling you that they can do Anonymous DOGE to USD transactions.**

So, why did I find myself bringing up DogeSolutions.com in regards to BitVenus?  Well, they have some very, very interesting hallmarks that would lead me to believe the same scammers are involved.  Not only do they hit that same 'holy trinity.

But, no, lo-and-behold, BitVenus is also advertising:
___
**Low fees per transaction**

**We have a fixed fee of 6 USD / 5 EUR / 4 GBP per transaction. This is the only fee, there are no extra and no hidden fees.**

They're also paying out to Paypal and Skrill (with the added bonus of ""bank account"" now!).
___

That's a pretty specific call-back, if you ask me.

Unfortunately, DogeSolutions.com is dead, but I've now [archived](http://archive.is/SqDJQ) BitVenus.com for future reference for the next time they decide to bring some similar site forward.  

Incidentally, you can catch a glimpse of the old DogeSolutions.com site in this ""[Review](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=956566.msg10466826#msg10466826)"" (totally not made by a shill account!) and in this [promo video](https://vimeo.com/121936421) that was made by /u/Zenturio98 as a contest entry... that DogeSolutions [never actually paid out for](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2xx3ei/competition_megagiveaway_by_httpsdogesolutionscom/).

DogeSolutions also blatantly [stole their logo](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2yq3mn/the_new_promoting_videos_for_dogesolutionscom_is/cpcxm45) - which also seems to be a hallmark of these pop-up scam sites.

Please be careful when choosing to use new exchanges, there is no shortage of [sock puppet accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2z56cq/found_a_new_bitcoin_exchange_near_my_workplace/?sort=new) that can and will pop out of the woodwork to tell you how amazing this new service is and how 'they just used it themselves' (Also a classic scam technique).

If it seems too good to be true - or is openly bragging about breaking US law (instant DOGE to USD conversion with zero ID involved is putting them head-first against FINCEN anti-money-laundering regulations) - it's not worth taking a chance on.

Stay safe out there my friends!

personalfinance,What is a healthy amount of CC debt for my age group?,"I'm 25 and work in Tech Support for a well-known consumer electronics company. I make $10.50/hr before tax, 40 hours a week. It's not much, but the cost of living in my area is pretty reasonable, so I'm usually able to get by and still have a little money left over. I have one credit card through my credit union with a $1000 limit. My monthly minimum balance is about $27. I almost always pay more than the minimum so as not to just coast along with it.

My roommate and best friend makes a bit more than I do, maybe a dollar more working 40 hours a week but frequently has to go into overtime, so I'm not sure exactly what she makes in a year but it's definitely somewhat more than I make. She has several credit cards. One is that same that I have (we bank with the same credit union), but while my limit on this same credit card is $1000, hers is $5000. She also has an AmEx with a $10,000 limit but I don't know what the interest rate is.

Last year, her father very generously paid off all her credit card debt (it was $10,000 at the time). She does pay him back a certain amount each month for this. In less than a year, however, she has amassed another $8000 in credit card debt. She shrugs this off as being normal but only pays the minimum balance each month.

In addition to this, she also has to start paying back her student loans and now has to pay for her own health insurance as well. I'm not sure how much these expenses will be each month.

I am extremely lucky because I have no student loan debt whatsoever and am still on my parents' health insurance through the 2016 calendar year. That being said, this is my first and only credit card so I'm fairly naive to what is considered a healthy amount of CC debt. Comparing my debt to hers, I'm kind of astonished, but I'm also kind of a newbie so I don't know if the amount of debt she has is reasonable or not and I don't have much else to compare mine to.

That would be a supervisor position, which my manager says I'll be getting within a year (hard worker, achieved a lot here in several months, etc). Not banking on moving up at this company to make a career out of it, though if I could get to assistant manager or co-manager, that's salries of 45k and 60k per year, respectively, but that ttakes a few years.

I buy some of my own food, say $150 a month. Car payment is $193 a month, though I'm hoping to make more payments to hurry it along. I've been saving about $500 a month, though I'll probably start funneling that to car payments instead. 

I'm shooting to try and find a no annual fee (requirement) card with cash back (preferred, not required). Interest rates don't really bother me so much as I plan on keeping up on payments.

personalfinance,FHA with cash assistance vs. Regular FHA,"Hey y'all. 

So here is the problem. I was eligible for a 4.5% (of home value) cash assistance loan. With the home I'm buying this worked out to be 7.5k Missouri calls this a loan, but you make no payments, and if you stay in the home for &gt;7 years, it essentially becomes a grant. 

I spent my first year out of nursing school paying off credit card debt/obligations, and was able to save up 6 grand or so when I put in an offer. (I've still got a month to closing and plan on working my ass off) 

So I had three choices for financing.

#1.  I could take the 7.5k, as well as the 4k in closing costs the seller agreed to pay, and this would have made my FHA rate 4.25% 

#2. Take my money I have saved to make the 3.5% required down payment for FHA, no cash assistance, but pay 3.25% for 30 years fixed, as well as the PMI until I refinance into a conventional. 

#3. Take the 7.5k cash assistance loan and go conventional and risk not being approved due to how tight my credit is (teetering on 700'ish, but rapidly improving due to clearing all debt but student loans) and paying 4.75% as well as PMI, but keeping my savings. 

The numbers make it pretty obvious that the cash grant and conventional is illogical as the rate being a full 1.5% higher than just a plain Jane FHA wipes out any benefit to that grant money in 7 years. 

But I'm hung up on options to yes, pay a bit of a higher interest rate, but get the cash assistance loan, vs. using my own cash and paying a lower rate. 

I think in the end, if I didn't make extra payments (which I plan to) and never refinanced, just taking the FHA with no cash assistance at 3.25% ended up being a better deal in the long run. 

If anyone is familiar with Missouri mortgage programs (I'm a first time buyer) I'd love to hear from you. 

Got a day or two to make adjustments to my financing options.

Forex,The Case for a Short-term US Dollar Rally Improves,"Talking Points:

- EUR/USD plagued by overzealous rates pricing for Fed, ECB.

- Bar raised for ECB action in March.

- As market volatility rises, it's a good time to review the ""Traits of Successful Traders"" series.

We've been very cautious - even outright bearish - on the USDOLLAR Index, but it's time to consider the opposite point of view. Rates markets on both sides of the pond may have gotten ahead of themselves, with a greater chance of a rate cut than a rate hike now being priced in for the next FOMC meeting in March.

With US economic data off to its worst start over the past 10 years (chart 1), there's really no where to go but up. A simple stabilization in the data, rather than an outright improvement, could dispell growing fears of a looming recession risk in H2'16. In turn, the repricing of even one rate hike in the first half of this year - as a reminder there are zero currently priced in for 2016 whatseover - would be a tailwind for the greenback.

My wife is disabled and receives $900/month from SSA.  I make around $85k/year and my take home is around $3600/month after maxing a Roth and putting 8% into retirement accounts (with 5% match on top of all of this)

The house is this:

* Offer: $225k - home needs about $20k in repairs/upgrades but after repair should appraise at $270k-$280k
* Taxes: $9000/year (disgusting I know, fuck NJ)

Assuming a mortgage of 225k for ease of math right now:

* 15 year @ 3% +/- = $2400/month = 53% of take home
* 30 year @ 4% +/- = $1925/month = 43% of take home 

In the past when I was a 22 year old dumbass I purchased my first home and my mortgage payment was roughly 60% of my take home.  It was struggle and taught me a lot on how to handle money. I am extremely frugal and managed to get by and still enjoy life.  I love the idea of being under 50 and having a paid off home.  I am disciplined enough to take a 30 year mortgage and make extra payments on it, but I feel that lifestyle creep and other things like cars and vacations could create convenient excuses as to why I don't have to make the extra payment that month.  

I'm looking for advice on what you would do in this situation.  My wife and I are always on the same page and want the financial security and freedom that sacrificing today's wants brings.  I just don't know if with interest rates being as low as they are that it makes sense to squeeze the budget towards a home.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks

**EDIT** Thanks for all of the advice.  I never really thought about the flexibility that a 30 paid as a 15 would give you.  That will be the strategy I'll shoot for.  Regarding take home %s.  This is an under-estimate and like optional payments I can always cut back on my Roth contributions if shit hit the fan.  I also have some stock options ($10k or so) and a couple other non-retirement vehicles I can cash out to use as down payment to lower my monthly cost.

personalfinance,"Maximizing Return Between 15-year Mortgage, 30-year Mortgage, and Student Loans.","Wife and I are about to purchase a house for around $300k. Have not gotten an interest rate quote yet but for this post's purposes, I am going to assume roughly 5% on the mortgages. We currently owe $70k in student loans at 6.8% interest.

I calculated the 15-year mortgage payment at $2400/mo.
I calculated the 30-year mortgage payment at $1600/mo.

The difference between the two is ~ $9600/year.

So here is where I want you to help me understand what I may be missing.

Lets say that the amount I have to invest is a static $2400 for example's purposes. I can either put all $2400 into the house (15yr) at 5%, or I can put $1600 into the house (30yr) and at 5% and the additional $800 into the loan at 6.8%

$1600 into the house at 5% with the extra $800 to the loan at 6.8% saves me about $170 per year in interest compared to putting all $2400 into the house at 5%. So it seems like the better alternative in this scenario. But I'm sure there is something I might not be considering.

Also, I'm assuming there is a tax calculation I'm not taking into account. Mortgage interest deduction versus student loan interest tax deductions. Obviously, at the beginning of the loan, the mortgage payments are going to be predominately interest.

Lets assume for these purposes that my spouse and I itemize deductions.

investing,Would removing the majority of cash from the US economy really have a large impact?,"There's been a recent spate of news about potentially removing a majority of the cash from the both the European and American economies. Some suspect that the main incentive the government has for eliminating cash is to allow them to implement NIRP (Negative Interest Rate Policy) without fear of a run on banks as everyone rushes to take their money out.

Theoretically, this makes sense to me. People don't want to see their saving decrease for no reason. But practically, would this actually work? Would even the slightest NIRP actually lead to a huge bank run? It seems a bit odd to actually prefer to have 5 figures+ in cash lying around that could easily be stolen. Not to mention, couldn't individuals put their money into other places like PayPal or Venmo (obviously not 7 figures worth of $, but still a substantial amount at least)? Or even BitCoin or an alternative crypto-currency (I understand that's technically an investment as well, but its still an alternative). Or am I missing something there. 

I'm no financial expert- this just seems like a lot of hand-wringing over the slow removal of physical cash when there are still digital alternatives, and when individuals might not all rush to grab as much cash as they can.",finance,1455634672

To be clear, the remodel isn't purely an investment -- the intention is to improve my quality of life as well.  I feel like I'm meeting my savings goals otherwise; my only monthly payments are $2000/month for my mortgage + escrow account and $100/month for trivial student loan debt (~$2000 remaining at 2.5% APR).

* The house is now worth somewhere in the range of $500-600k.  There is $300k remaining on the loan.
* The remodel is going to cost ~$200k.
* I have $140k in cash from savings and some stock sales.
* I plan on paying for the remaining $100k using either a cash-out refinance, a HELOC (3.00% is the current rate), or an equity loan.

The HELOC is tempting because the lack of closing costs and current low rates, but I read that there can be prepayment penalties which is a huge red flag for me.  Cash-out refinance seems pretty heavyweight with the closing costs, and my current mortgage rate is lower than anything available for the same term.  An equity loan is a higher interest rate, but the fixed rate offers some security.

It looked somewhat official and I actually believed it at first. Somewhere in the bottom of the letter it said it had been sent via FedEx so that threw me off since it came in a UPS package. So I decided to look it up online to check if it was legitimate and I found the following two pages which helped me realize it was definitely a scam:

[This one from ChicagoNow](http://www.chicagonow.com/running-with-a-book-cart/2016/02/we-got-a-scammy-mortgage-letter-in-the-mail/) &amp; [one from FicoForums](http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/forums/forumtopicprintpage/board-id/loans/message-id/167406/print-single-message/false/page/1).

&amp;nbsp;

Some telling signs for this particular letter were:

* Blurry and pixelated logos.
* Claiming reduction in premiums without refinancing.
* Including an official government memo
* Stated the letter came from FedEx when it came in a UPS package

&amp;nbsp;

The first site also [linked a site which included another list of what else to watch for](https://apelbaum.wordpress.com/2009/06/03/mortgage-refinancing-shysters/):
&gt; 
&gt; 1. **Disingenuous Claims of Previous Communication**
&gt;  * In order to lower suspicions and fake familiarity, the letter claims to be a follow up on an already established relationship and ongoing communication. 
&gt; 2. **Design to Deceive**
&gt;  * The letter contains what on the surface appears to be a legitimate application number, a ""second notice"" tag, a recognizable equal housing lender logo and acronyms of well known public and federal organizations.  In fact none of these details has any significance and are there simply to create the semblance of legitimacy.
&gt; 3. **Vague and Deliberately Confusing Language**
&gt;  * The letter states that ICG is ""unconditionally endorsed by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development"".  When I called the toll free number I heard: ""Thank you for calling the FHA application processing center"". ICG is certainly not a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) application processing center as the FHA neither issues loans directly nor has an application processing center. 
&gt; 4. **Skin Deep Corporate Internet Presence**
&gt;  * On the surface the company web site appeared to be fully functional, but when I tried to use some of its key functionality (login, change password, etc.) I quickly discovered that none of it worked

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I thought I'd share my experience and try to warn others here about this particular letter (&amp; I suppose, these letters in general). I know there's others and while I'm sure most people in this subreddit may have immediately known this to be a scam you may have friends or family which may not know if they receive these so please help them out too.",finance,1455640465

* If I shouldn't transfer my leftover £15000 into another ISA, how should I make best use of this money in terms of making interest?

personalfinance,[Debt] Enroll in lower monthly payments and put excess towards higher interest loans?,"35k in loans, all federal. I can enroll in lower monthly payment at ~$141 per month instead of the current ~$300 per month.

I plan to put between $1000-1500 per month towards the highest interest loans on top of my monthly payment. 

Should I take the lower payment option and add that ~$150 to the $1000-15000 I plan to pay every month on the high interest loans? I plan to take this approach on highest interest loans first and work my way down until I am out of debt. Anything more than $1500 a month is a bonus on my eyes.

I know the lower payment plan is higher interest in the long run, but if I stay on track I can be out of debt in 2 years or less. Makes sense to me to put that extra ~$150 a month towards the higher interest loan(s) principle, but I wanted to make sure I am not missing something? I would think that 2 years is such a short amount of time and I am putting so much towards principle balances I wouldn't lose out on the interest from lower payments?

personalfinance,I'd like to get a collections blemish removed from my credit report but I'm not sure who to write my goodwill letter to.,"When I was a freshman in college, I got my wisdom teeth removed. My mom didn't have health insurance at the time so I was on my own plan through school. My mom assured me the insurance would cover most of the bill and she would handle the rest... I didn't really think much of this at the time as I was in my ""no work, all school"" phase, aka, not anywhere near reality. 

About a year later, I got a bill from a collection agency that stated I owed $1482 for my oral surgery. I was shocked and confused as I thought my mom had taken care of this. I called the agency's number and they told me they'd settle the debt for $900 if I paid right then and there on the phone. It seemed scammy to me so I hung up and called the doctor's office. My account was in collections and my mom hadn't made a single payment towards my balance.

At this point, I was panicking because, again not in reality, ""I'll never be able to do anything with credit."" I told the doctor's office that I would talk with my mom and call them back the next day. After a huge screaming match with my mom, she said she couldn't afford the payment and that's why she wasn't paying it. We called the office back the next day and my mom would be making monthly payments that I would give her cash for.

Every once in a while, the collection agent would call but I would ignore her calls because I was paying the doctor's office directly. The woman at the doctor's office called the credit collection agency and updated my balance with each payment I made until it was $0, which was March of 2015.

Well, today, out of curiosity , I decided to look up my credit report. CRAP, it's there... 

After reading a few things on this sub, I know it's my best idea to write a goodwill letter... I'm just confused as to whom I should write it to.. I'm not sure if the doctor's office can do anything about this... I never actually paid the collection agency so I'm not sure if they'd be able/willing to help.. Do I go straight to the big guns and send a letter to the federal credit bureau? Need a little bit of guidance on this one.

personalfinance,Currently a junior in undergraduate school; due to some unexpected changes and irresponsibility of my parents I'm looking at a lot of loan debt post-graduation. Looking for general advice.,"Hey, r/personalfinance. I hope this is the right place to be posting this.

I'm going to go ahead and give the condensed version of my story for those who don't need/want the details. I am currently a junior undergraduate [20F] studying mechanical engineering at a private university, and due to changes in financial aid, lack of any parent help with tuition, and inability to transfer, I am racking up a lot of debt. I apologize if the way I explain it is inaccurate or confusing, please let me know if I need to rephrase something; I really have no idea what I am doing, and I'm very scared about the debt and how to handle it, which is why I am here for advice. I have been applying to as many scholarships as I possibly can, but this is also kind of difficult as I am in 18 hours almost every semester (and am currently), work two part-time jobs, and spend at least 70 hours during the week just keeping up with schoolwork. I can't really afford to pay anything myself either, I am a responsible spender and had saved up a lot from my previous internship and then had a breakdown with my car and had to do really expensive work to fix it :( So I have maybe $2100 to my name... So far I have only received one $2000 scholarship. I will say the one upside is that I have a solid, high-demand, decent-paying major for employment, and I am on track to receive a job after graduation (I had an internship last summer and will have one again this summer, and have a ~3.6 GPA). 

Looking at all 6 semesters it looks like my totals for loans are:

Federal Sub. Direct Loans: $13,500
Federal Unsub. Direct Loans: $6000
Federal Direct PLUS Loan: $29,226
SallieMae Student Loans: $16906
Discover Student Loans: $9200
Total: $74,832

At this rate, I am looking at graduating with over 100k in loan debt. I guess my question here is, how is the best way to handle this, either now (reducing next loans in any way, which loans to get next year, etc.) or post graduation? I will continue to apply for scholarships throughout the year and pray I will get one that is significant, but at this point I wish I had started looking into the best way to handle this much sooner. We chose to switch to a different company for our private loan this year, last year we had SallieMae, but after hearing how horribly most people thought of them, we switched to Discover. Now I am wondering how loan consolidation will work with the different private and federal loans; I'm afraid I already have a very loose understanding of how loan consolidation and forgiveness works. Can I consolidate ALL loans, federal and private, or can I only consolidate like with like (private loans with private loans and federal with federal)? What kind of payments will I be looking once I graduate? Is there any way this will eventually be forgiven?

Furthermore, when filling out the application for the Discover loan this semester, I discovered that my credit score is somewhere in the 600+ range, which just entirely blew me away. I am guessing this is due to the fact that I don't ever use credit (I have a debit card) and most of my credit is probably just tied to my loans/debt. I heard someone say that if you buy a store credit card at somewhere like TJ Maxx and just buy small things every month and pay the bills on time, this type of thing can help lower your credit score. Is this true/is there anything like this I can do to start getting my credit score under control? 

Thank you everyone so, so much in advance. Please help. To summarize: How do I handle/consolidate these loans in my best interest after graduation, how should I handle loans next year/should I handle them differently, what kind of payments should I expect, and any way to improve my credit score? 


*Long story* : Got into a top 20 private school as a senior in high school, in the financial aid profile (not official forms) they offered me about $54,000/year in financial aid for a ~$64,000 tuition. I was ecstatic, and accepted for attendance. Then my mom, spur of the moment (literally, pretty much) decided to get married before the actual forms were due, and my grant dropped to $50,000. Nothing too serious. So for my first year of school, in addition to my grant, I took out Federal Unsub and Subsidized loans, and also received money from Federal Work Study Program.  My mom helped me pay the rest for that year.

My second year, I again took out Federal Sub/Unsub and received Work Study, but my mom could not help me with tuition, so I had to take out Private Alternative Loans (from SallieMae) totaling to $16,906. 

My third year (this year)... everything went to shit. First of all, I should probably stress that my parents are the most irresponsible people on this planet. Months before the profile &amp; FAFSA were due, I sent them the forms to be completed (I was away and could not do them myself as I did not have the tax forms). They did not, and I almost was unable to go to school for the semester because the school received no payment. Once we finally got the forms in (BARELY before me not being able to attend), we discovered that because my mom could not afford to pay for my sister's college anymore either (and we could not put her on the FAFSA as a dependent because of this), my aid was reduced from about $50,000 a year to $13,531 a year.. I was crushed. This was literally less than two weeks before classes. I have a very technical major and it is very unlikely I would be able to transfer to another university without falling behind and staying in school longer (so transferring isn't really the advice I'm looking for, just ahead of time want to lay that out) due to the way my school formats the class progressions (ha.. probably do that on purpose).  As a result, we had to last-minute take out a Federal Direct PLUS loan of $29,226 to cover the cost of the semester so I could attend, and then once aid was added the extra amount of the loan rolled over to this (current) semester, and once this semester came around, I had to take out an additional $9200 to cover the rest of the cost for the year in addition to the Federal Unsub/Sub and Work study. I had heard that SallieMae was a terrible company for private loans, so for this year's private loan, we switched to Discover for the last $9200.  And that's how I am where I am.",finance,1455666587

personalfinance,Pay off student loans with lump sum and deplete bank account? Or pay off systematically over time?,"Hey guys, this is my first ever post on reddit so please excuse me if I break a rule or two. Long time lurker, but never posted. I've read the ""how to handle $"" article, but am posting here as it didn't cover exactly what I was looking for. 

I am 23 years old and have about $34,000 in student loan debt at a 5% interest rate. I currently live at home with my parents and have minimal expenses. I spend about $10 a day on lunch/coffee at work and maybe spend $100 on the weekends on girlfriend, drinks with mates, etc. My car is a beater and I owe no money on it. 

I am making $55,000 a year pre-tax at my job and currently have $20,000 in the bank. I will soon be getting an additional $19,000 as the company I work for was acquired and my options are being cashed out. 

I want to move out of my parents house, but don't know if I should prioritize my loans first. If I pay off all my loans tomorrow I will only have ~$5,000 in the bank. This means I will likely have to put off getting an apartment for at least another year. Or is it better to live comfortably and chop away at the debt systematically over the next 5-10 years?

Can anyone offer advice on how they would handle my situation? I recognize I am in a pretty decent spot as my assets &gt; debt, but I just have no idea what to attack first and how to allocate my funds. Thanks!

personalfinance,Do I need to fill state taxes from Puerto Rico for a forfeited 401(k)?,"Around August last year, one of my 401(k) plans that I had with a previous employer was forfeited, and I received a check in the mail with the balance. I decided just to go and deposit the check on my bank account, knowing that I will need to pay the 10% penalty at tax time this year for early withdrawal. The amount was around $1,000.

What confuses me is which taxes do I need to fill. Right now, I am living in Florida, so I will be filling the federal taxes, but the 401(k) plan was from a previous job when I was working in Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico does not fill taxes at federal level, only at state level).

New reddit user and first reddit post, if I'm breaking any rules or am doing something wrong please let me know! On mobile as well.

So here's my situation - I am currently employed by an Automotive manufacturer in the field of maintenance. I am currently a part time worker at 24 hours a week, 16.50/hr. I am still going to school and graduating in just about 4 months. Which then, will go to 40+hr a week with a pay increase to 22.50/hr, from there, to max out the wage/hr, is 2 years from May, at 34.50/hr.

I have NO college debt nor will I at the end of the intern/scholarship program I'm in. I have purchased a 2016 vehicle in the month of October, 2015, with a hefty discount from said Auto manufacturer, at a 2.0% interest rate, which I still owe 12k on. 

I have NO form of saving toward a retirement. Roth/Ira/401k.

I am not currently able to put money into a 401k until 2 years after May of this year. 

I have no credit card, have a car payment, insurance, cell phone, that I have no worries about paying come due date.

I have an emergency fund with my employers credit union at 2k.

So to my question, I want to do something with that 3,500 I have in a separate account. I'm waiting to either

A. Put it down on the car.

B. Look into investing in a Roth IRA.

Not really sure what to do, leaning towards the Roth considering I have no form of retirement investment at this time.

personalfinance,"29k in student loans, 4.5k in savings, 24, making $46k a year. Should I use my $4k tax return towards my loans?","First time in pf so forgive me if I make dumb mistakes.

Basically I have $29k in student federal student loans mixed between subsidized and unsubsidized.

I recently got a job where I now make $46k a year and my take home is $1225 biweekly.

My tax return is going to be ~4k and I'm wondering if I should use that all towards paying down my student loans faster or put it in savings. My parents have been trying to advice me to put it in my savings, but I feel like it could be better spent reducing my loans amount and interest I have to pay.

**Savings:** $4,500

**Bills**

*Car Insurance - $90/month

*Rent (utilities, internet and cable included) - $500/month

*Groceries - $150/month

*Phone- $30/month

*Savings-$500/month (I want to increase how much I'm putting into savings each month)

*Gas- $75/month

*Netflix- $8/month

*Loans- $350/month

**Very important** to mention that I plan to go to graduate school this fall and the total cost of that would be ~$22,000. My job would only pay $2000 a year and that would be considered taxable income, so I wouldn't see a large portion of that money. I can't seem to find funding for the program as a potentially part-time student with a full-time job, so I'm currently looking for a part-time job that will take me for nights and weekends so that I can start saving up and minimize my loan burden as much as possible come August.

Do my finances indicate that it wouldn't be too detrimental to allocation most, if not all, of my tax return towards my current student loans?",finance,1455680947
personalfinance,HELP! Found out I had Medi-Cal and Covered California at the same time without knowing and am worried I will owe a lot in taxes through something that wasn't my fault!,"So, to begin from the beginning...

I had just gotten a second job and had just turned 26. I realized I needed to get everything squared away and went into the EDD to figure everything out in November of 2014. They made copies of my paystubs and sent me on my way. 

I kept hearing about Covered California at the time and then signed up for it. I got some assistance from the government this way and paid the other half.

I noticed that I wasn't as financially strained as I thought I would be and realized I probably guessed at my income wrong by 3/4 way through the year and came to terms that tax season would be no fun. I was young and you live and you learn.

What I didn't realize was I would experience an absolute nightmare trying to have health insurance once 2016 rolled around. I've been back and forth and back and forth with Kaiser and Covered California trying to figure out why though I pay for my premium, I keep getting terminated for my health insurance. I've done everything, even just going through Kaiser but I have to have a triggering event for that and so I'm stuck with Covered.

Finally, after 2 months of this back and forth, today Covered said that my application kept getting messed up because of Medi-Cal and I needed to call them. I was on hold for 5 hours until I finally got a hold of a representative. 

She told me I've had Medi-Cal all year and that I needed to fax or mail in my paystubs.

I was floored. I wasn't even aware I was on it and assumed that since they were a government agency, they should have known from my income.

Now I'm terrified that I'll run into owing thousands for having Medi-Cal I didn't even know I had and thought had been taken care of.

HELP! I'm only 27 and this adulting thing is really kicking me in the butt. :( If it helps at all, I made around $29,000 last year and when I did my taxes before knowing this, I owed around $600 between California and Federal.",finance,1455682223

personalfinance,"I owe $6000 in unpaid taxes, what are my options?","So last year I owed nothing but I was also making less money, so I was able to deduct student loan interest (a whopping 6k). This year I wound up making more money and now that student loan interest isn't applicable - something I didn't know. I also kept my allowances at 5 because last year I actually got a refund, so I thought I would at least break even this year. As it turns out, I have no deductibles this year because even medical bills aren't enough. 

So I owe 6k (federal and state together) - and I just found out, as in a few hours ago. I am worried about penalties, something else I didn't know about. How much should I expect for penalties? I intend to use a credit card to pay for this since I am lucky enough to have one that is low interest until October. I also don't want to pay the IRS anything else this year in the form of added interest on top of what I owe - so a payment plan with them is not ideal. 

But, my biggest concern is stopping this madness from occurring again next year. What can I do? The most I can lower my allowances is 3 and even then I would be struggling to make rent and student loan payments (which will increase in October because I made more money this year). 

I am having a hard time calculating estimated taxes so that maybe I can start paying them now quarterly, but is there anything else I can do?

We actually have the next major resistance level at 1990. This is about 3.5% above current levels. We would not be surprised to see that level approached within the next 2 months. One theme we have noted is that it looks like the market does NOT like Janet Yellen. She does not seem to inspire confidence in the markets. However, recent economic data has been consoling and Fed voter Dudley has dissauded the market that negative rates in the US are an imminent possibility. The market seems to like that. Negative rates are not good for banks.

**Bonds:** The MAR16 US bonds continue their slide from the 170’s, now down another 1.7 points to 164’03. 162’10 looks like the next key moving average support level. Once the stock market showed strength, the bonds really started to tumble!

**FX:** The MAR16 USD is down slightly, basically unchanged on the day. We believe the USD will continue to rally this year and ultimately breach new highs and stay in the 100’s. We believe the Fed will hike rates at least one more time this year. The MAR16 Pound came back slightly this morning after a big down day yesterday.

**Commodities:** MAR16 WTI is up 6.4% to $30.91. The high 28’s, as we noted just yesterday, was phenomenal support for this contract. $28.75 turned out to be a key barrier. APR16 gold is up $4 today to $1212. $1220 may be a good short term magnet for gold. MAY16 coffee is up slightly to $1.1725. We believe coffee’s volatility will increase over the next few months and we believe the price will move to the upside. $127.50 is the 200 day MA which could be good resistance. If coffee can stay above that level, we believe it is in store for a big sustained rally to at least $1.50.

worldpolitics,"Welcome to Orwell: Your employer will work with 3rd party companies to mine big data to figure out what employers cost too much due to illness. (WSJ link, text in comment)","Bosses Harness Big Data to Predict Which Workers Might Get Sick
Wellness firms mine personal information, seeking to anticipate employee health needs, minimize cost

Employee wellness firms and insurers are working with companies to mine data about the prescription drugs workers use, how they shop and even whether they vote, to predict their individual health needs and recommend treatments.

Trying to stem rising health-care costs, some companies, including retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc., are paying firms like Castlight Healthcare Inc. to collect and crunch employee data to identify, for example, which workers are at risk for diabetes, and target them with personalized messages nudging them toward a doctor or services such as weight-loss programs.

Companies say the goal is to get employees to improve their own health as a way to cut corporate health-care bills.

Privacy advocates have raised concerns about such practices. Employees generally have a choice in whether to participate in the programs. The services are new enough that relatively few workers are aware of them.

“I bet I could better predict your risk of a heart attack by where you shop and where you eat than by your genome,” says Harry Greenspun, director of Deloitte LLP’s Center for Health Solutions, a research arm of the consulting firm’s health-care practice.

An employee who spends money at a bike shop is more likely to be in good health than someone who spends on videogames, Dr. Greenspun says.

Credit scores can also suggest whether an individual will be readmitted to the hospital following an illness, he says. Those with lower credit scores may be less likely to fill prescriptions and show up for follow-up appointments, adds Dr. Greenspun.

Welltok Inc., whose clients include Colorado’s state employees, has found that people who vote in midterm elections tend to be healthier than those who skip them, says Chris Coloian, the firm’s chief solutions officer.

In general, midterm voters are more mobile and more active in the community, strong indicators of overall health, he says.

As employers more actively involve themselves in employee wellness, privacy experts worry that management could obtain workers’ health information, even if by accident, and use it to make workplace decisions.

Federal health-privacy laws generally bar employers from viewing workers’ personal health information, though self-insured employers have more leeway, says Careen Martin, a health-care and cybersecurity lawyer at Nilan Johnson Lewis PA. Instead, employers contract with wellness firms who have access to workers’ health data.

“There are enormous potential risks” in these efforts, such as the exposure of personal health data to employers or others,” says Frank Pasquale, a law professor at the University of Maryland, who studies health privacy.

Typically, when a company hires a firm like Castlight, Jiff Inc. or ActiveHealth Management Inc., it authorizes the firm to collect information from insurers and other health companies that work with the client company. Employees are prompted to grant the firm permission to send them health and wellness information via an app, email or other channels, but can opt out.

Based on data such as an individual’s history, the firms can identify a person who might be considering costly procedures like spinal surgery, and can send that person recommendations for a second opinion or physical therapy.

Spinal surgery, which can cost $20,000 or more, is another area where data experts are digging in. After finding that 30% of employees who got second opinions from top-rated medical centers ended up forgoing spinal surgery, Wal-Mart tapped Castlight to identify and communicate with workers suffering from back pain.

To find them, Castlight scans insurance claims related to back pain, back imaging or physical therapy, plus pharmaceutical claims for pain medications or spinal injections. Once identified, the workers get information about measures that could delay or head off surgery, such as physical therapy or second-opinion providers.

Some firms, such as Welltok and GNS Healthcare Inc., also buy information from data brokers that lets them draw connections between consumer behavior and health needs.

Employers generally aren’t allowed to know which individuals are flagged by data mining, but the wellness firms—usually paid several dollars a month per employee—provide aggregated data on the number of employees found to be at risk for a given condition.

To determine which employees might soon get pregnant, Castlight recently launched a new product that scans insurance claims to find women who have stopped filling birth-control prescriptions, as well as women who have made fertility-related searches on Castlight’s health app.

That data is matched with the woman’s age, and if applicable, the ages of her children to compute the likelihood of an impending pregnancy, says Jonathan Rende, Castlight’s chief research and development officer. She would then start receiving emails or in-app messages with tips for choosing an obstetrician or other prenatal care. If the algorithm guessed wrong, she could opt out of receiving similar messages.

To steer more J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. employees to doctors in its network, insurer Cigna Corp. analyzed claims data to identify employees who lacked primary-care physicians. Those employees got personalized messages on Cigna’s mobile app with recommendations for in-network doctors, says Michael Sturmer, a regional Cigna executive in the Northeast. Employees who had downloaded the Cigna app used in-network providers about 2% more than they did before the system was implemented in 2015.

Some people may feel uncomfortable with the idea that their personal data is being used to predict their future. Castlight carefully test-markets its messages to try to avoid appearing too intrusive, says Mr. Rende. “Every word matters,” he says.

Maribeth Quinn says she was surprised to learn that her glucose levels put her at risk for diabetes, news she got in a message three years ago from HealthMine Inc., which says it analyzes health and claims data, but not other personal data. Ms. Quinn, a financial-aid executive at JFK Medical Center in Edison, N.J., has since lost 35 pounds, and is no longer deemed prediabetic. “It was in my face,” she says. “That made me do something about it.”",technology,1455731439

Hello -
I apologize for the above stats, but I intend to be fairly open about what my finances look like, in order to help make some changes to my credit worthiness, and the (what feels like) financial difficulties I have. 

At first glance, you'd look at the list of stats above, and think I'm doing just fine. However, I feel like I'm living paycheck-to-paycheck, and it's a very uncomfortable thing. When I was married, I had a dual income household, and was able to manage my finances better. The biggest things that are hurting me at the moment are my rent, childcare, and car payment. At the beginnging of each month, the majority of my paycheck goes to rent &amp; childcare. The second half of the month is covering the remaining bills/expesnses. I haven't been able to save (used all of my savings through divroce and relocating), I am not contributing to any 401k or any other investments (sold some shares I had), and my credit is slowly coming around to getting better after I took a small hit while going through divorce.

I receive no financial help in terms of child support, or anything like that. The interest rate on my vehicle is really high, because my credit was shot when I purchased it. I'm going to try and refinance it soon. 

There was this goal that I had, to purchase a home for me and my son in 2017, but that isn't looking like it'll happen. I am okay with that, as long as I am able to lift some of the stress of feeling like I can do a lot better. I know that I make a decent salary, and have made a lot less throughout my career, but it is what it is, and I need to figure it out.

I've lurked /r/personalfinance for some time, and hesitated even posting this. However, I feel that in order for me to fix this, I need to face it with some humility. 

If anything stands out to you, I'll be more than happy to discuss. Any (positive) thoughts are welcome!

personalfinance,26 year old with good amount of savings/income! How should I invest/save?,"Hey everyone, need some advice on how to best invest/save/allocate my money. I have been lucky enough to earn extra income while finishing my PhD. I buy/hold/sell website assets that generate income for me. At the same time, I receive income from my PhD studies.

Here is a breakdown about my current situation.

About me:

* 26 years old
* PhD student currently
* Full time job in September 2016

My assets:

* Monthly job income: $1800 after taxes
* Website income (varies): $3,000 to $6,000 per month on average
* $58,000 cash in bank
* I have multiple websites worth over $150,000 if all sold. The market is liquid and will remain that way for many years. I have no plans to sell my websites since it will result in Capital Gains tax for my LLC.

My liabilities

* Car loan, $373 per month at 2.49% interest rate
* Apartment Rent: $1300/month
* No student loans
* I have health/dental/eye insurance and planning to get personal life insurance

I usually spend all of my $1800 monthly stipend from work on rent/food/living. The car loan is paid from my website income. The other extra money goes into savings directly.

My plan:

* Set aside 6-8 months expenses: ~$15,000
* Set aside investment funds for more websites: ~$15,000
* Invest into ETFs: ~$10,000
* Remaining funds: ~13,000 (what do I do with this?)

I am not looking to invest in individual stocks. I did that in the past and I did not like the constant tensions. I would like to invest in a passive manner. Also, ETFs have shown growth in the past but now they seem to be going down due to the markets. I am not sure how to invest some of my money or if I even should.

Note: I do not want to set aside any money right now for my retirement. My job prospects are very good and in a very hot industry. Once I start my job, I will do 401K and a separate IRA with the income from my job.

I have been a reader for awhile and looking for some guidance into what to do with my savings in terms of investing, etc. I appreciate any help.

personalfinance,Little confused on how my credit card interest works. Someone help me out?,"Hello there!

To preface this, I'm 20 years old and have had a secured card with a small $300 limit for 10 months now. For the first 7 months, I kept my utilization to right around 10%. Unfortunately early into the 7th month I had to make a purchase that used up 100% of the card. Dumb I know, but I had no choice. I have made the minimum payment of $25 the past 3 months, and just got to the point where I paid off the $225. I'm a college student, so it took me a while to save up enough to even pay off the $300. But I finally did! Progress is a good thing right?

So here's my question. The 3 months I didn't have it completely paid off, I was charged interest on my account. I noticed small amounts on my statement, between $5-$8 each month. I'm confused because I thought APR was a yearly not monthly occurrence. My interest rate is a whopping 19% on this card. Am I going to be charged a large lump sum at the end of the year or are these small interest payments all I've owed?",finance,1455736168

personalfinance,[Student Loans] Nelnet (student loan servicer) changed my payment amounts per loan so more principal went toward lower interest rates and less went toward higher interest rate loans - is this legal?,"Hey PF,

Here are my student loans with amounts and rates as of today (02/17/2016):  
  
Loan A: $5,618.79 @5.75%  
Loan C: $2,774.04 @5.35%  
Loan E: $2,775.94 @5.35%  
Loan G: $6,910.73 @6.55%  
Loan H: $12,076.72 @6.55%   
  
Here are my [01/14/2016](http://i.imgur.com/64rrke4.jpg) and [02/14/2016](http://i.imgur.com/10AfNyy.jpg) payments broken down by loan. The January amounts were the same in all of 2015.  

Also relevant, I paid an extra $1300 on 2/11/2016 toward group G, which is why the interest accrued/paid is so low. Paid another $1700 toward G on 2/15/2016, but it hasn't posted yet.
  
As you can see, my Group G loan payment @6.55% was reduced from $112.71 to $97.03. But the total payment amount of $428.55 remained the same. That $15.68 (112.71-97.03) got distributed between the other loans, three of which have lower interest rates. Why did my servicer do this? Why are they allowed to do this? What the fuck?  
  
**UPDATE**  
  
I called Nelnet and asked that they change the 02/14/2016 payment amounts to the same as 01/14/2016 amounts. The representative said she would log the ticket but that it might make it look like some of the payments had not been made in their system and reflect poorly on my credit report - **what the fuck?** Was that a threat? Incompetence? Why should I be on the hook for them arbitrarily changing my payment amounts?  
  
**UPDATE 2**  
  
I asked that for future monthly payments only interest be paid on loans A, C, E, and H with the rest of the principal amount going solely toward G. The reasoning behind this is that I can eliminate a **$112.71** portion from my monthly payment amount when I pay it off, reducing it from **$428.55** to **$315.84** Is this advisable?  

**UPDATE 3**

Spoke with someone different/competent and Nelnet and she told me she'd submit the request for the 2/14/2016 payment amounts to be distributed according to the previous month's and year's payment amounts. u/ANGR1ST was right that minimum payments necessarily include some principal.

investing,Has there ever been another point in history where central bank policy had such direct consequences on the market?,"I'm not much of a history buff when it comes to the market so I was curious as to whether this is a mostly unprecedented circumstance or if it has been a common theme in the past. It seems as though asset prices are more correlated with Federal Reserve (and other central bank) policy stances than anything besides oil, and I'd argue that Fed policy disproportionately affects the price of oil as well.

It seems as though much of the immediate future of the market comes down not only to the macroeconomic conditions but also to central bank policy. Macroeconomic headwinds have worsened? Market better rally, that means central banks around the world may be pumping more money into assets via QE or reducing rates even further.

The Fed and other central banks appear to be more willing and eager to enact massive QE and ZIRP/NIRP than ever before, on a scale never seen before. Deflationary headwinds are obviously a concern in some parts of the world, but core CPI in the US is chugging along around the 2% pace. As oil recovers (even if that is only to $40/bbl) CPI is sure to return to a similar benchmark as well. Is this the new future of the market, where asset prices can be sustained and manipulated indefinitely by central bank policy? The reality is that the market and the economy as a whole are human constructs, and given that there is the political will (eg approval) the Fed and other central banks have the authority to print money to remove toxic assets from the real economy until their face turns blue.

Does anyone see the level of central bank interference in the market drawing down in the future, or is this merely the new normal that comes with Keynesian economics?

[Interesting Brad DeLong excerpt on the intent of Fed interest rate policy](https://youtu.be/8RrKScRg5KM?t=53m38s)

&gt;""But it leads to policy conclusions very much like those that the Obama adminsitration is trying now. That whenever you have a big set of fluctuations in financial market valuations that the government needs to step in. The government needs to step in and provide a Keynesian crutch. Not because we want to rescue the princes of Wall Street and the feckless investors that have lost money from their deserved bankruptcy, but because letting financial asset prices crash and overshoot on the downside and stay down that low on the downside puts the jobs on millions of Americans in danger and puts the jobs of tens of millions of people in Asia in even more danger. [...] So you have all kinds of crutches to try to keep the economy on an even keel even though financial markets are sending crazy and wildly erratic and volatile signals to the real economy about what the real economy should be doing. And that's what we're doing right now. That's why Ben Bernanke has done everything he can to drop the safe interest rate on the assets thought to be secure as close to zero as possible.""

personalfinance,Question about submitting incomplete taxes and filing state taxes from 2014.,"So last year I used turbotax and submitted my federal return, but when it came time to submit my state (Iowa) return they tried to charge me $30, but I realized I could file through Iowa's treasury website for free. I was going to download a copy of my return and upload it to the state site, but things happened and I forgot/never got around to it. Is it too late to file my state tax return from the 2014 year? 

My other question is slightly more complicated. I started my current job mid-February 2015, made roughly $20,000 and paid almost $3000 in taxes, leaving me a $1300 refund (estimated). I worked another job from January to mid-February 2015 at a restaurant. By my calculations I made roughly $900 (6 weeks, only working 3-4 lunch shifts per week) including wages and tips. They sent my W2 and claimed I made over $1700 but only paid $125 in taxes. Those numbers are way way off (and drops my return by about $150) but I have no concrete way to dispute it (had paper checks, lost stubs in a move). What's the best way to proceed? Can I just submit my taxes from my current job and omit the information from my last job until I can figure out how to correct the information, then file an amendment?  I'd like to file ASAP so I can make a deposit on an apartment for next year.

Edit- I will add that I have a decent credit score ~805 and I was originally given an interest rate of %1.49 but I purchased a service package and extended warranty which caused the dealership financing to raise my interest rate.

A couple of factors that were really contributing to my poor score were:

*  my delinquent student loans
*  no actual lines of credit
*  various small delinquent bills here and there

Almost everything has been resolved and I have been on a pre-payed credit card through my bank for about a year now (I get to switch over to a real one in like a month or so). My student loan payment plan is about to have all its requirements fulfilled and I will be handed back over to the department of education to finish the rest of the loan.

My question to you guys is... Once my Delinquent loan program is finished and I get sent back to the DoE to finish paying off the loan, will I see any sort of immediate increase in my credit score or will it not make a difference one way or another? Also, will my line of credit that has been open for almost a year (through my bank) and will be rolling over to a much higher limit have any affect once the actual roll over occurs?

Edit: I thought of one more question! Should I wait to do taxes until my loan get transferred back to the DoE? Currently any return i get (if any) goes directly to my loans to pay them off... but this will be the first time I think that wont be the case.

I have a few tens of thousands of dollars in student loans. It is not anything unsurmountable, and I do have a career in my field so I'm not complaining. My question is about how my interest rates are calculated.

All of my loans are federal, with a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized. I graduated a little over 6 years ago and have been paying the loans monthly via auto-payment. Admittedly, I'm a set-it-and-forget-it person on this.

I noticed in 2015 I only paid a little under $10 in interest. I checked a bit more and looks like my loans are in deferment, and I'm only being charged interest on my unsubsidized loans. Even so, it's charging a much lower amount than my stated interest rate.

I don't want to tip anything off (yet? ethics and all...) but is there a way to figure out how this could have happened without potentially messing it up?",finance,1455743446

Bitcoin,The ban on cash turned a goldbug into a bitcoin hodler.,"So I've been routinely listening to a gold-bug financial news podcast for the last year. It's called the financial survival network and it features a weekly interview with market analyst and gold dealer Andrew Hoffman. He offers some great analysis of the markets and as you can expect he also hypes gold all day long.

About a year ago they also started talking about bitcoin and Andrew Hoffmans opinion was always pessimistic and negative, much like Peter Schiff... That changed today... In todays episode they talked about the looming ban on cash and how he started buying bitcoin last month because of it. He said he saw some mega banks presentation on how a cashless society is needed so the banks can really go negative on their interest rate.

I think this really shows how the banks are pushing the adoption for us.

personalfinance,Federal/State taxes were not being pulled from my checks all year. Is it my fault or my employer?,"About a week ago, I tried to file my taxes. The employee helping me noted that it was unusual that I claimed S1 and my employer didn't withhold any state or federal taxes. He sent me away and advised I go to my employer and ask for a revised W2 or figure out why the taxes are not being taken out. This is a huge issue because I now owe the Fed $700. That may be minuscule for some, but that is a significant amount of my money.

I called my HR department today and the lady told me I did not make enough this year for them to pull out my taxes (made about 13k). She said had I been working full time and claimed S1, they would've pulled my taxes. However since I was part time, they didn't.

Now here I am, wondering what to do and who's to blame. This is my first year filing taxes and I have no clue what's going on. I just need to be pointed in the right direction on how to go about investigating this situation. No one seems to be giving me a straight answer.",finance,1455756238

personalfinance,Should I open a second CC? [Info inside],"Hello there, PF.

*My financial background*: I've had my current (and only credit card) for 6 years this December. I have 100% on time payments, and currently have the lowest interest rate my CC company can offer, which is 16.24% on purchases. My credit score is in the 770s, and I have a 100% history of on-time payments for my car, and student loans as well. I have a well-paying job currently, have never filed bankruptcy, and have no negative marks on my credit. My last hard inquiry was over the summer, in 2015 when I purchased and financed my car.

*My question*: I currently bank through a well-known online/brick and mortar bank (8 years this December), and finance my car through them as well. They recently sent me an advertisement for a travel credit card, which was quite appealing to me. I'm looking to travel more, and the benefits of my current credit card are frankly not worth it to me anymore. I got my CC when I was an undergrad, and it was a card designed for students trying to build credit. It has now been rebranded, and is no longer advertised as a card for students.

It runs on a points system that you can trade in for items (which are heavily marked up), but I only use it to purchase statement credits; the credits offered are small compared to the cost in reward points. I figure if I am using my credit card for regular purchases, and paying on time and in full, I might as well accrue rewards for something I can enjoy; like travel. This card also has an APR that varies between 12.24%-22.24%, which is may have me paying far less interest over time than I currently am. My current card has told me I am paying the lowest interest rate they can offer me, even with my history of on-time payments.

Any suggestions on what I should do? Should I apply for this new card through my bank, and keep my old card with my old company active/unused? Is there any way to see if my bank would approve me for the lower interest rate ahead of time?

personalfinance,Question about debt for family.,"Hey all,


Appreciate all the advice you have provided. I am a long time lurker under a different account, but I created this throwaway account to ask about a scenario.


I had some apprehension posting this only because I know there is a collective ""eye roll"" when the word family is uttered. I am trying to go about this the right way, though, so any advice is appreciated. My sister called and asked me for some money today. I am in a very good financial position (thanks to this sub, among other things) to lend her some money.


Her situation: She is a single mother who has custody of her child 50% of the time. I am still getting information so there are some gaps below.


Inflow

$2268 monthly income (currently looking for 2nd job, located in the midwest)


Outflow (numbers are monthly)

$1000 on renting a house (absurdly high. needs a roommate[s])

$440 on private school for child

$~50 on electric

$40 on internet

$123 on cell phone (unlimited data...dump internet?)

$235 on student loans (sofi or consolidation? not sure if she's done this yet).

$440 on credit cards

$45 on sewer

$~100 on gas

$33 on water

We did not even discuss groceries and other miscellaneous costs so tack on some extra for that and it brings her even further into the red.


Other:

$14K total CC debt owed to 4 separate cards. This is her single biggest issue. Unsure of interest rates at this point.

$~25K student loans (not sure if on income based repayment yet)

$9K mortgage bill (had to foreclose on a house when she lost her job and apparently this is the bill that is leftover from that. She has just ignored this bill for, I believe, a couple years.)


So my question for reddit is two fold:


(1) I want to lend her some money. I don't expect the money back and I will let her know that. I am not her personal ATM so I want to hold her accountable each month as a condition of giving her money. Something like asking her for a report on her positive progress towards reducing her debt(s) and progress towards an e-fund. What are good conditions under which to give her money so as to hold her accountable?


(2) Based on the partial knowns above, what can we do to get her out of deficit spending each month?
Some suggestions I would like critiqued:

-Ditch internet and use unlimited cell data as a hotspot

-She lives in a house by herself, except when her child is around (50% of the time). I believe the house has at least 2 bedrooms, maybe 3. Get a roommate. Or two.

-Not sure what the interest rates on her student loans are or if she has consolidated them. I want to recommend to her Sofi/reconsolidation/ income-based student loan repayment.

-Her shopping habits (clothes). Obviously this needs to be eliminated immediately.

-Bankruptcy. Not sure if this is a good option at this point. From what I know, she would shed the 9k mortgage debt and the 14K credit card debt. Obviously the student loan debt would stick with her but could be reduced if some steps above are followed.


The entire point here is that I don't want to just throw money at her and ""band-aid"" the situation. I want to actually get her to recognize and fix the reasons why she got herself into this situation in the first place. I would love any suggestions to that end. Also, if more information is required, please let me know and I will make edits as necessary.


Thanks for all your help reddit!",finance,1455763521
personalfinance,I have tons o' debt and I'm saving for a car: Tell me what to do.,"Debt: $100,000+. $18K in credit cards. Rest in student loans. I work in a non-profit area; so I will qualify for public service loan forgiveness when I start making payments, hallelujah (I start in Nov)

Income: $50,000/yr. Monthly takehome is around $3,200. $500/rent and utilities. $160/health insurance. I give myself $200/week for food/traveling (commuting public transit)/unplanned for expenses (say, i lose something or need lightbulbs, idk). I save $200/month for traveling as my family lives far and it is important that I visit them. I save $200/month for the car (which might have to go up...) and the rest goes to credit card debt, over $1000/month towards debt. Making HUGE strides, and I expect more than half my CC debt to be gone within the year if I can keep it up/maintain my income.

The car situation is creeping up to be more and more important. I have about $1500 in savings now for it, and about $1000 in bonds I can cash if need be. 

I want to pay for a car in cash as to not have any more monthly payments. 

Honestly: what do I do? Is this even a good idea? 

Do I save $5,000 (which I would expect to have by the end of the year... if I increase my monthly contributions a bit) and buy a cheap, used vehicle that might need a ton of repairs?

Or do I pay less on my debt and save $10,000 more quickly to buy a nicer vehicle that might last me longer-- and THEN resume paying down my debts?

On the other hand, entirely: as I don't *need* a car for the next few months (until June I am certain I don't-- after that it's VERY LIKELY I will need one). I keep getting tempted to just put the $1500 I have saved for a car at my CCs, to get rid of those more quickly, and just stop putting $200/month in savings and put that towards my debts, too. But if I did need a car ASAP at some point (job situation might change in summer)-- then I'd have NO downpayment for a vehicle. Which was the point of my saving in the first place... =\

Kind of at a loss. I like the idea of paying cash and just not worrying about monthly payments. But. I also know interest rates on a car could be lower than they are on my credit cards.... 

Oy. This one is stumping me. Any guidance appreciated.",finance,1455763943

I currently hold $53,000 worth of student loan debt, with some higher interest loans due to grad school. I currently pay $600-$700/month to these (more than my monthly payment of $352/month). My loans range from interest rates of 3.2% to 6.8%.

I have $13,900 left to pay off on my car, with a $220/month payment. My interest rate is 2.25%.

I pay $108/month for car insurance.

I have around $1,600 in savings, with a goal to save $2,000 by the end of next month (should reach goal by mid-March). My savings account has an APY of .75%.

I do not have a retirement account, but pay into a state account with deductions from my paycheck. We do not have a 401K program at my job, nor have I been seriously considering retirement at the moment (I know, I know...) My main focus has been creating a safety net and eradicating my student loans, then aggressively saving for retirement.

Savings: $700

Car payment: $400 (almost two months of payments).

personalfinance,Raise or bonus?,"Quick background: I'm a software developer, 25 years old. I make $65k/yr, and I have around $26k in debt, broken down thus:

   * $14k in student loans
   * $3.3k on credit card 1 at 22% on purchases and cash advances (but I never use it anymore)
   * $3.4k on credit card 2 at 8% on purchases and 14% on cash advances (if I use credit, this is the one I use)
   * $5k auto loan

So I work at a pretty terrific place, and it's probably a long term gig for me. I've been there almost two years, starting pretty much right after I graduated. My income to expense ratio is pretty good, so I have a nice chunk of change at the end of the month to throw at my debt (and I admittedly splurge on stuff I shouldn't, like eating out too much and buying gadgets, but I accept that).

We do performance reviews every 6 months, which can come with raises. So far, I've averaged a $5k raise per review overall - and it's important to note that they work off of straight dollars, not percentages (due mostly to the frequency of reviews/raises). My two year review is next month, and I'm considering asking for a bonus instead of a raise. It's unconventional, but management is very focused on being flexible and awesome to work with - for example, some people have asked for additional PTO days every year, top of the line UpDesks, etc. I don't -know- they'd go for a bonus, but it's definitely possible, so I'm considering asking.

So, my question is, assuming that I can get it, would it be more worth getting a $7k bonus instead of a raise? That bonus would immediately be used to pay off my credit cards, which I then should never need to use - I almost always use my bank account for purchases, and I only ever dip into credit if I've overpaid my credit cards and can't swing my normal expenses (doesn't happen often). So I'd have more money to save/throw at other debt and I wouldn't be being hit by my highest interest rates. The trade off, of course, is that in the long term sense, $7k now is a lot less than, say, $5k over many years.

If it matters, I am also hoping to be able to buy a home in the next year or two, and I haven't even started on saving for the down payment (though it would be FHA, so totally doable).",finance,1455773821

personalfinance,[Credit] How To Ask For Lower Interest Rate?,"Hi,

I'm in debt. I got out of it with the help of family (which I'm almost done paying off), but... due to necessity (but mainly due to being irresponsible), I am back in credit card debt (close to $15,000).

I live in Canada. I've considered consolidating through Credit Counselling Society (non-profit) since my father is back on his feet because of them. However, my aunt strongly advised against it. So therefore, I ended up going directly to one bank and asking for a loan to pay but they said I can only be approved with a co-signer.

Anyways, my main question has to do with asking for a lower interest. I've heard it's possible, but I tried once and they just tried to change the type of credit card. They actually said they can do that, or I can apply for a loan. 

Right now... the interests are killing me. I'm having a hard time paying the debt off since most of it goes towards the interest.

When I did some search regarding the Credit Counselling Society, I read that it's good. But... now I turn to real experts (Reddit.... What? Reddit has always given great info) to tell me if that's something I should be doing.

My aunt advised against it because she said my father couldn't even get a credit card for a few years because he went through that kind of program. She said ""it's kind of applying for bankruptcy.""

personalfinance,Trying to get on track. Could use a little personalized advice.,"Hi y'all. Throwaway because its no damn business of a few certain friends.

Background: I went from a lifetime of freelance work averaging $25-30k/ year. I made it work. I had (have) no debt. No credit cards. No student loans. i had a dependable vehicle. I am single with no dependents. I have always found affordable rent. I wasn't living high on the hog by any stretch, but I was housed, fed and happy. I called my own shots. Last Feb, I landed a great job. Full time. Benefits. Insurance. 6% matching 401k. 5 weeks PTO. Union supported at roughly $54k. I have had to make some lifestyle changes. I'm making better financial decisions, and while not perfectly responsible, I'm headed in the right direction.  I should have more money saved after the last year, but that's for another conversation.

 Now to the issues: A couple of months ago my once very dependable truck started to make some shitty noises. I Usually do my own work, but realized that this was probably out of my league. Well, my 25 year old engine is about to go. The mechanic said anywhere from tomorrow to 3 months. So what do I do about a new vehicle? I can either pay cash up front, or I can try and get a loan and maybe have a nice vehicle with A/C for once. I decided to take the loan route. Today, I got my credit history. I haven't checked in about 15 years, because I never felt I needed to.  It wasn't as bad as I thought. I only have one negative collection against me. It's a $130 AT&amp;T charge from a few years ago. I'm fairly certain it's legit, but I moved from that address years ago, and they never found me. (i'm not trying to bounce on that, i just didnt know i owed). The Positive credit I have is with my credit union. (I tried to get a secured CC 10 months ago, and they suggested a secured loan first). So I am at 10 months, on time, paying off a $1k secured loan.  

I have never gone through the loan process before, so I was pretty clueless as to what to expect. I was hoping that they would tell me what I was eligible for, if anything. I wasn't expecting much, but you never know until you try. What I didnt expect was me giving the first offer.  So, in a bit of a rush, and without doing the proper homework, I said $7k (at 3.49%). I don't know how ridiculous that actually was, but that plus my down payment can get me where I want to be. Plus I could afford that. Well, I was denied with no counter offer. No real surprise to me. The reason given was ""limited credit experience"" and ""limited credit references"". She told me my FICO score was 632. 

I walked out of there not defeated. I walked out of there better educated and more determined. I don't necessarily want to be in debt with a car note, but I realize the advantages, and I am ok with that. This is all very new to me, and I have gone through a lot of posts and faqs here. I feel a little overwhelmed. This is my plan of attack, can you tell me if I am doing the right things?

1) take care of the $130 AT&amp;T charge. However, It has been taken to collections and is now owned by AFNI, who doesn't have such a great customer care score. I don't really dispute the charge, but I can't confirm it either. I have seen many posts saying to always dispute the charges. We haven't been in contact. They dont call me or send letters, and it gets removed 7/18. How should I go forward with this?

2)Try and get FICO higher by:

3)??? 

I'm not sure if I should try and get a credit card from here. I'm not even sure where to begin to get one that won't act as a payday lender, and come at me with 1000 sticky fingers. Is it an option to go to a car dealer with my history, and pay a higher rate for financing, pray that they are not scumbags, and build credit there? Do I pay cash for a shitty $1k truck for the time being and look for other lenders?

Sorry for the life history, and I thank you for any suggestions and welcome criticisms.

There are many unsolved problems with potential impact in patient lives. 
 
Dr. Arai here – Thank you all for your interesting questions. It was hard to predict how many people would submit questions and comments. It was nice to see the breadth of both technical and clinical questions. It is hard to pick a favorite but hearing about long term survivors with cancer and congenital heart disease are heartening. Many of the technical questions about speed and comfort of MRI relate to research being performed at NIH and many other institutions around the world. Faster imaging that does not rely on breath holds is a major direction for the future. Better quality imaging hopefully will continue to improve patient outcomes.

Prior to finding out about this stuff, I'd been saving up for a downpayment on a house for myself and my fiancee, and I can't decide if the timing couldn't be worse, or couldn't be better!

Here's the situation- I'm 33, my take home is 3K /month, and my current rent (due to a special situation) is $900 /month (split with my fiancee).  Comparable rents in my city are closer to $1,200.  Median home price in my area is 270K, but inventory is wayyyy down, so things are very hot right now in the market (most houses under 400K sold in under a week).

My current rental is going on the market this Spring, and we'll have to move out.  I would like to buy so that I can be in control of my living situation, customize the house, and get in on a good interest rate, but after researching the market, anything suitable would be a huge hit to my savings rate.  Most of my friends have purchased at the median or above- I know I don't want to do that, but after reading a bunch of FI stuff, I'm having second thoughts about buying at all (unless, of course, a good deal came along).

Another option would be to move out of town, to a nice cheap place with a big yard and mountain views, but that may just shift my costs from the mortgage to other sunk/non-investment costs, like gas, cars, etc (I currently take the bus to work for free).

I guess my question is- should I stay the course I was on before finding out about FI, completely change my plans and find another rental, or shoot for a low mortgage out in the country?  I know it's a big question, but I wanted this sub's take on it- have any of you found out about FI after taking on a mortgage, and wished you had known beforehand?

personalfinance,"Need help. So much info, so many questions, and too much debt.","So, for a long time (several years) I maintained a great credit score with a credit card and a car loan. The car got paid off and my credit still good. Then a series of unfortunate... occurrences had put me in tough place while finishing my degree (and I did) and after. Things got bad.

Credit debt went through the roof, student loans hit, and I had my own place for the first time (couldn't afford but couldn't go back home due to toxic environment). Bills and rent got extremely difficult to cover. Things got worse.

All in all, I my debt well surpassed me. I have 3 credit cards (well i have the bills, destroyed the cards long ago), 3 student loans (1 fed, 2 private), a medical bill (although not too large), and the regular bills. I have roommates now so rent and utilities is no longer unbearable but I can't keep up with other things.

After years I finally have a job that I love but doesn't pay enough for my problems. So I just picked up a second job (just started this week).

For too long I foolishly kept telling myself, it will get better, without being active about it. Now I want to take control and fix things.

I have had my cards for several years with no problems but now have had too many times I couldn't pay for several months. (I know it's bad, I see my mistakes and am trying to learn and fix those mistakes). Now two cards are in collections and I have trouble keeping up with the loans as well. I have a large private loan that I needed to pay a lawyer in a bad moment.

CC 1: 10k (I know bad) had gone to collections but I made a payment plan deal that temporarily lowered interest and have kept up with payments for several months since

CC 2: 5k this has gone to collections but I haven't been able to keep up with any real payment.

CC 3 $800 also in collections and poor recent payment history

All 3 have roughly the same interest rate and I can still make direct payments to those companies (so from what I gather they haven't sold the debt to collectors). I read about disputes on here but I have the feeling it won't work for me (I'm pretty sure I have admitted the debt over the phone at some point while trying wade through the shit sea).

The student loans amount to roughly another 45k. 

The private loan for lawyer (which includes a little debt rolled from a higher interest rate card)
Is down to about 7k.

I know I did this to myself and realize my mistakes. Cards are destroyed (have been for some time) and I don't charge anything anymore, but often borrow money from my gf that I can't always pay back. I haven't making enough to make consistent payments to anything but the private loan and the largest credit card (after rent and such). I just started the new second job and should be earning enough to cover all these bills.

Because of not being able to pay recently on some of these debts the ""minimum"" payments they are asking for is simply undoable for me.

Cc2 wants 1k and cc 3 wants $300. Private students want $200 and $300. I can't do this but want to take care of my situation.

I did just get about $1000 from my tax return and plan on using it for my bills.

I am asking for advice on how best to proceed with this situation. Is there anything I can do to mitigate some of this? I need to make a solid plan but after lurking here I just feel like I don't know enough to handle this situation in the best way possible. I am hoping you help me make this plan. Thank you for any advice you can give me.",finance,1455804399

personalfinance,A HUGE thanks to PF and more advice please! (Long)(Student Debt),"I first want to start off this long post by giving a **huge** thanks to /r/personalfinance. Reading here over the last 2 years has given us the confidence to finally face our growing debt and start to move in the right direction. 

**Background:**

My fiance' and I are in our late 20s (27/28), own a home, and are finished/nearly finished our graduate education (MSW/PhD). Our combined AGI is around 75k. In the last year we've been tightening our budgeting and attacking our debt which has been slowly building in the form of credit cards and student debt interest. This time last year we had over 15k combined CC debt. As of January we have **zero**. 

We view this as our first step to allow us to start paying of our student loans and finally start saving for retirement. We have a tremendous amount of student debt (at least in our eyes). And, we haven't benefited over the last few years from the advice of family and peers on how to handle it (keep it deferred, hope for forgiveness). Basically, we're now prepared to take this head on and try to dig ourselves out of this hole of student debt; ideally within the next 10 years.

**Other Debt**

Right now it's basically our mortgage and a small auto loan. We bought our house 3 years ago; financed FHA with about 7.5% down. Right now we still pay PMI but are hoping to either remove it (we have the old pmi terms) or refi out of it in the next 2 years. We also have one small auto loan with about 4 years left (8k remaining) 

**Student debt:**

My SO has 51k in combined, consolidated subsidized and unsubsidized student loans; the majority of which were originated in graduate school. As a social worker she qualifies for 10 year forgiveness through public service. Our main plan with her is simple: utilize the lowest monthly income driven payment plan to hit the forgiveness mark (8 years left).

My debt is 40k direct unsubsidized, and 25k parent plus; all originated in undergraduate. I feel stupid for letting interest build on these throughout graduate school but the promise of forgiveness always won out. Our plan on these is to refinance the parent plus loan into a 10 year private with a lower interest rate (7.9 presently) and simply pay it off slowly. With the unsubsidized loans however, it's unclear if I will end up in a sector which allows loan forgiveness. Our present plan is to begin repayment with an income driven plan to keep the interest from continuing to snowball and start building payments towards forgiveness. At a later time; if I move into the private sector hopefully my increased income will allow me to simply pay aggressively. If I stay public 

Presently we plan to use the new REPAYE repayment plan because A) if your minimum payment is less than your interest, only 50% of the difference will capitalize B) it's the lowest % discretionary income we qualify for. Now, the REPAYE plan does consider both of our income whether or not we file jointly or separately in the future; I only see this as a problem if one of us gets a tremendous promotion. If/when that happens we can switch repayment plans at that time.

Additionally, we plan to start shunting about 15% of our income into her 401k and a traditional IRA for me (I don't get a 401k or 403b because academia). Hopefully this will overall lower our AGI and finally allow us to shelter some money for retirement one day.

**Basically, PF:** are we headed in the right direction? Is there something I'm grossly underestimating here? Are there any obvious ways to lower our AGI? Are there any additional tax breaks we're missing? Are we utterly boned?  If so, how boned? Will we ever have a positive net worth?

P.S. we're also paying cash for our wedding right now; so some discretionary income is going to that but we have a modest wedding budget overall.",finance,1455808899
personalfinance,Am I doing everything right?,"So a few things have happened recently. To start off, I am a 20 year old male, soon to be 21, living at home with my dad. I work full time, usually 42-45 hours a week, with OT. I also go to school full time (12 Credit hours).

I recently got a pretty big promotion at work that is relatively stable, with room to grow. There is a system at work where I can purchase product and it pulls from my paycheck weekly to pay for it, at a set rate based on what I spend. I typically use this to buy clothes for work (full dress attire) and its a consistent amount. After that and taxes, I usually take home between 390 and 450 a week now. The beginning of every month I have a school payment (I started paying out of pocket this semester) which is 350. Midway through the month I have car and insurance which is 240 combined. 150 for car, 90 for insurance.

I am pretty bad at saving money. I do a lot of impulse spending. I have no credit cards, only a single debit card to my account. Just a couple weeks ago, I finally started a savings account. The annual interest is .04% but I only needed $200 to open the account. For the last few weeks, every paycheck, I physically withdraw money and deposit 100 or 150 into the savings account. I opened the account with no debit card, at a small bank unaffiliated with my checking account. That way I can't access it without physically going to the bank. I chose a bank where there is one a few minutes from my house, and a few near my work in case of emergency. 

So far the account is working well in keeping me from spending money and I'm already several hundred in to saving now.

My dad is helping me set up my 401k this week and I was planning on setting it at 5% as well as putting a very small percentage in just company stock as it is low now.

I have some outstanding school loans (about 15k total from my first couple semesters at a state school), but 10k of that is a private loan and the others are federal. None of which require me to make payments until I am done with school, so I have no been paying anything. I was considering starting small payments on those just to chip away while I'm still in school.

I guess the point of this thread is to make sure I'm doing everything right. I'm trying to get my money under control so I can save properly and get an emergency fund in order. Am I doing everything right? Is there anything I should be doing that I haven't thought about? I lurk on here a lot but just wanted some weigh-in on my current position.

We did some quick math and found that our expenses are so low relative to our income that we can pull this off and maintain a surplus of about $80k/yr AFTER taxes, funding all our retirement accounts, etc. Our debt is minimal (no CC debt, one auto loan which we can pay off now but the interest rate is piddling, and a mortgage but we're renting the place out to keep that covered) and we don't buy stupid shit.

That's a large surplus and we can do a lot with it. We have a couple goals in the short-term but I wonder if it'd be worth considering putting money into a taxable account. 

Questions:

* Should taxable accounts be considered as part of the retirement portfolio?
* What reasons should I use a taxable account over putting more into, for instance, the after-tax 401(k) option (with a chance at rolling it into a Roth IRA?)
* Are services like Betterment worth it, or can I keep doing the same three-fund-portfolio style management?
* Is it ever worth not using passive indexing?

personalfinance,Student loan post-consolidation confusion. Need some help.,"So I did a consolidation of all subsidized (federal) student loans I had, starting September 2006 until 2010 (and one subsidized loan from fall 2011). Due to unemployment, etc., I deferred my loans from 2010 through this year, and finally have a steady job that also should qualify for PSLF (501c3). My loans were previously with Sallie Mae/Navient, but have been consolidated into FedLoan Servicing. Consolidation has been completed into one Direct Consolidation, but I'm still confused about several things.

1) During the consolidation process (done at studentloans.gov) a month ago, I submitted my IBR request. Due to my AGI for 2014 being relatively $0, and my 2015 AGI not yet being complete, I submitted a copy of my paystub. After being unable to fax it to FedLoan (their fax number spat out a busy signal repeatedly, regardless of the time/day I sent the fax in, even a weekend day), I snail mailed the IBR form and paystub in, then found out their website had a file upload that I was unaware of, so uploaded it that way. I am almost ready to file taxes for 2015. My AGI for 2015 should be ~$29,000, due to not working the whole year. What I earn this year should be ~$40,000. My main concern is that they'll base my IBR on the submitted paystub, not my 2015 AGI - I would like a lower payment. What should I do? Are IBR payments based on the previous year's AGI (2015 tax year)? 

2) It shows on FedLoan that my forbearance period ends on 4/11/2016, but my first payment is due 4/2. Does that make sense? 

3) I am shown to be on the Standard repayment plan effective April right now. I assume this means they haven't processed my IBR form yet?

4) I also see that the PAYEE and Revised PAYEE plan is what I should be eligible for, based on studentloans.gov (a green checkmark is there under those options). However, it shows that the 'new' borrowers go back to 10/1/07, and I had one or two loans that were taken before that time, but it also says that I need the consolidation to be completed after 2011 or so. I'm confused, because I would really like the PAYEE plan - it also seems like payments under those plans would still qualify for PSLF.

5) Speaking of PSLF, my main concern is that they won't be ready with the IBR/Payee (if eligible) by April, and payments I make won't count towards PSLF. I don't want to ""waste"" any payments, if that makes sense.

Sorry there were so many questions. I know the easy answer is to ""contact FedLoan"", but to be honest, this process is really intimidating for me, and I've seen many horror stories online about FedLoan, and getting conflicting answers, so I want to be prepared and have the best answers to make sure this goes smoothly. I'm also Deaf, so calling would be a hassle.

I'm not sure why but they say because it is tax season and they are too busy to connect me with the person who has that information.

The way I see it, my options are:

1. Continue with IBR but stash 10k each year for the next 22 years in an attempt to pay off the impending tax bomb. (What sort of savings account is best for this purpose?)

2. Pull out the money and attempt to get a private loan at a lower interest rate (2-3%). I see the flaws in this: I don't have the collateral for that size loan and I may end up paying the same amount in the long run.

3. Keep my loans int he IBR system in hope student loan reform happens, and attempt to pay $500 more per month to keep the interest down, while still stashing money for the impending tax bomb.

With each of these options I see the cons but I don't have the math to back it up, and know which is the best plan in the long run. Has anyone had experience with this? I believe I am the first in this class of Millennials in this bubble. We won't actually see the repercussions of this legislation for 20 years.

financialindependence,How to reveal to your non-FI significant other that you are FI?,"(Posting with a throwaway)

I'm seriously dating someone who, while not a spendthrift, does tend to live paycheck-to-paycheck. She is a single parent so the kids and her mortgage suck up most of her income, and she has had to say ""no"" to several activities I've suggested we engage in due to monetary concerns.

My concern is what happens when she finds out that I'm FI. She doesn't have a (big) clue now because I continue to work even though I don't have to. Due to FI lifestyle, I'm not extravagant, but on multiple occasions I've laid out several hundred dollars for items without a 2nd thought, so she may be cluing in a bit. 

What I fear is that she will get miffed that I didn't cover some of the activities that we didn't get to do together when I could have easily afforded them. I know she *shouldn't* feel like this, and until there's a ring on her finger she should not have a say in my money.

But what I guess I'm asking is for those of you who have had to reveal your savings to SO's without such funds, what are the better ways of doing so, and what are the really bad ways of doing so that I should avoid?",finance,1455832567

personalfinance,REMINDER: Your salary negotiations is the most important part of your job,"Real life example: I have a friend who lives in a small town. Very gifted, very talented, but took the first job offer given to him. He had been fired a few months before in a different state and needed a job ASAP. Too scared to negotiate.

Well, he did great at his job at 50k, until he found out his salary was the lowest and he was doing senior level work. It took me having to tell him to take the risk and interview at another company to convince his current company that he's worth a raise. Other company offered 58k, so they gave him a new job title and that 8k. Took 30 minutes apparently!

So now he's having to do twice the work due to his near 15% raise, and then he finds out that they're hiring entry level workers at 70k. Less experience and less education.He foolishly took the 50k last year without asking for more. He could have probably easily made much much more.

Just got his performance review. They love him...gave him the full 3% raise folks get after a year. He's offended that he's now making an extra $175. Now he's going to another state to work since he feels disrespected.

Moral to this post? Most jobs don't shower cash on you unless it's incentive or commission based. Your negotiated salary will be the most important thing you do. Please, don't sell yourself short, don't take the first offer, study negotiating as hard as you studied how to interview, and be ready to look elsewhere if you aren't getting what you feel you're worth.

personalfinance,"Broken car while getting finances straight, need advice please!","Hello /r/personalfinance. 

So I can't stress enough that I'm an idiot. That's being worked on. I made some stupid mistakes and am now living with the repercussions (bad credit, wage garnishments, etc…). Long story short I took out student loans and didn't graduate while being irresponsible. One day I would like to get married and not negatively impact my spouse on paper, and be able to buy a house with them. That's a long fix and a question for another day.

A while back I bought a car and it broke down shortly after (long enough the dealership won't do anything about it). The repair is substantial, to the point where it isn’t driveable (it wasn’t an accident so I can’t claim it on insurance). I can manage the payment, but it is high enough to not allow much on savings. Also the interest is high. Very high. I knew I wouldn't be able to fix it any time soon after throwing the majority of my savings at the new (to me) car, so I picked up a cheap clunker in cash off of craigslist. (Bus isn't an option locally). The cheap car is not running anymore and I’m very close to getting the amount of money I need for the repair of the car that I’m making payments on. When the first car broke down, it was apparent there was a problem so a budget was made and is how I’m able to save for the repair. 

Here’s where the question comes in. I do not have a credit card and received one of the ‘pre-approved’ offers in the mail. I know it’s not guaranteed, and the interest is high, but that’s expected with low credit. After checking out the wiki and reading a couple of posts in search I read that it is a good idea to go to CreditKarma and check and see the likelihood of actually getting a card, which was stated as ‘very good’. It’s also been stated to only get a card and use it if you can pay off the balance at the end of each month and it’s not an ‘emergency fund’. I do need a little bit extra to get me back on the road and the card should cover it. After filing my taxes, the refund from the state should cover the remainder of the repair with a little extra to have as a cushion. How big of a risk is this? It will get me back on the road, so it would be worth it. It would also be nice to use it for gas/ groceries and immediately pay it off to boost my credit so I can refinance the car and get the interest rate down. Also it would help lower insurance and come with the other perks of not having bad credit. Is this the way to go?

Thanks in advance for the help, pretty much all I was taught about money growing up was how to use the ATM and write a check. It’s going to be a long road to recover, but will pay off in the end. My long term goals are to build a decent emergency fund and be able to start investing into retirement. I guess we have a pretty good plan at work that I’m not able to use at the moment.",finance,1455850337
personalfinance,Transferring credit card balances- will it work for me?,"Hi, I'd be really grateful for some guidance. I'm 27 with a credit card debt of ~$3,900 I'd really like to be rid of. This debt is on 1 Chase card with an interest rate of ~13% (grad school and underemployment :/) I now am working a regular 9-5 &amp; have finally kind of settled down. I'm currently paying about a $90.00 min. payment + $50 service charge a a month on this card. With the new year, I've been making a much bigger effort to take opportunities to learn, save, and finally deal with this. My credit is rated pretty good, if that is relevant. 

I see a credit card offer with Bank of America (BankAmericard) that I think will give me an opportunity to pay it down a bit faster, without the pesky $50 a month service charge. 18 months interest free on balances transferred to the card within the first 60 days, and then 18% apr after that. There is a 3% balance transfer fee, which would be $120 for me. I figure the balance transfer fee here would cancel out after three months, since I'm already paying $50 a month in fees as is with the Chase card. This seems like a great idea, since I could probably make a much bigger dent in the overall debt if I wasn't paying these $50 fees on top of it. I'm probably not going to be able to pay it off 100% in 18 months, but I think I could get it down to under $1000 faster this way than sticking to what I'm doing now.  The higher interest rate I would have doesn't seem to be *that* much higher. 

So basically, I'd like to know if this is a good idea, if there's something I'm missing or not understanding, and if there's anything I should be wary about. I assume I just open the new account, then transfer the balance over, and then close the 1st card since I don't need it. Is there any reason the balance wouldn't transfer fast enough to make that 60 day window? Do credit card companies ever reject someone's balance transfer request? Am I completely missing something with this BOA card that is basically akin to the $50 fee I'm dealing with now? If you know of a better card to transfer balances on, that would be great to know too.

personalfinance,Can I contribute to a Roth IRA (for 2015) after filing taxes?,"I started my current job late last year. I made enough in the 2015 calendar year that I can contribute the legal maximum to an IRA, but not so much that I will pay federal income taxes. I opened a Roth IRA with Wealthfront (I thought I'd see how they handle a year or two of contributions since I don't pay any fees for the first $15k).

So far I've funded about half of the $5,500 limit, and I've been waiting for the market to get closer to the bottom while I increase my cash reserves. My question is: can I contribute the rest *for the 2015 tax year* **after** I file my 2015 taxes?

(My other options are to temporarily dip into my emergency fund or just wait, neither of which are prohibitive but I wouldn't mind avoiding if possible).

I've googled around and gotten conflicting answers. If it were a traditional IRA, the answer would be obvious, but since this is a Roth and (theoretically) shouldn't impact my taxes, I'm not quite certain.

personalfinance,"Loan rates have fallen significantly since my stupid, credit-wrecked self accumulated 18K in student loans. Is there any other way to reduce the interest rate than just auto-pay?","Okay, as a kid in university with no budgeting skills, poor credit, and ridiculous ideas about money, I accumulated student loan debt that has slowly whittled down to about $18,000.  Considering it started at 24K and I'm not working full-time, I'm not all that upset.  However, when I was budgeting for my recent car loan*, I noticed how high my student loan rate actually was: 6.75%!  (Much better than the 11% I had at one point on an old beater car, but now the highest rate I have.)

I know my educational loan consolidation garners benefits like deferment and other things private loans just can't offer, but the interest rate is still pretty high.  Private loan rates are around 4% or less right now, and my credit is also much, much better. Worked my butt off, and I'm getting there.

When I called my loan servicer, the only option they offered me was setting up auto-pay.  It would reduce my loan rate by .25%, which is still something, but I thought I'd try here to see if there's anything else I could do before I lock myself into an option that can take a couple months to rectify.  Is there anything aside from auto-pay that can lower my interest rate while still retaining the benefits of an educational loan? Can I re-consolidate through another educational lender? I got away from Sallie Mae, and it was a great decision, so I'm not really looking to go back there.  We've got Nelnet now, and they've been great.  Just trying to save a few.

People on here have had awesome ideas (obligatory butt-kissing, but also true), and I figure I'd see if there's anything else I can do.

*End note: Before anyone brings it up, the car loan was not a bad idea.  I did the math, and fixing up my old road-tired and vibrating-massage truck would have cost me at least 6-8 months in new car payments with no guarantee it would stay fixed.  Since both my business and my children's education depends on me being able to drive them to school and me to my client's houses, I can't be without a reliable vehicle.  We got the base model and the extended bumper-to-bumper warranty, so I don't have to deal with most repair costs for the entirety of the loan.

If it comes down to it, I'll just pay it off first (was really hoping to pay off the car first, but I'll take what I can get).

personalfinance,Tax question regarding Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA in the low income bracket,"Hi pf! I have an interesting situation regarding my choice of a Traditional vs Roth IRA for 2015.

I’m 21 &amp; in 2015, I made $11,824.

I set up a Roth IRA account last year and put $5,500 into it. When I was doing my taxes (in turbo tax), I got curious about the hypothetical and started playing around with some numbers. 
If I put all 5.5k into a traditional IRA instead my income would become $6,324 (therefore, only $24 -taxable). 

For my current situation (Roth IRA), my tax return is: $592 federal, and $ -155 state. 
By putting money into a traditional IRA, my tax return turns out to be: $1130 federal, and $240 state.

Therefore, by going the traditional IRA route, I would receive an extra $933! I originally put my money into a Roth because I thought that being in a low income bracket, this was the better option. 

Now from what I understand:
 If I'm in the highest tax bracket in 40 years (~40%), the extra taxes i'd pay on the Traditional over the Roth would be on the $5,500, so basically I'd pay $2200 in taxes vs around $550 this year. Even though I’d be saving $1650 (worst case scenario-highest income bracket), if I were to invest the $933 at a conservative 5%, the money would be worth $4621 (this calc. I'm not sure of..... would it just be 933*e^((0.05*0.8)*40))??? (to account for capital gains?)).  

So to sum up:
In 40 years, the Roth IRA option would allow me to take out the $5,500 costing me $550 (which I would pay this year). This would potentially allow me to save a maximum of $1,650.

However, an individual Ira, with the investment of $933 (from tax return) will yield me $4,621, so even if I'm at the highest tax bracket, I’d still net $2,971 (4,621-1,650)!   

I tried using worst case scenarios in my analysis, such as being in the highest income bracket during retirement and a very conservative growth rate, but even then a traditional IRA seems to make much more sense! 
Is there something I'm not accounting for?! Even at a low tax bracket, when/how does it make sense to invest in Roth over a Traditional IRA's? 
Is there anything that I should know before doing a re-characterization of my Roth to a Traditional IRA?

Sorry for the long post! I’m just very perplexed by my situation!

I've been paying $915 a month for over a year now, I worked full-time making $14 h/r and got by.  Now I'm at a new job and making $39,500 so I take home around $2260 each month, leaving me with $1345 a month after loans, and a car payment of $230.

I'm managing just fine, I'm able to save up every month, I currently have a $1000 emergency fund that I refuse to touch, and I just started a savings account to buy a ring for my girlfriend.  Problem is that I still live at home with my parents, and its very tough to move out on this budget and still save.

The good news though is that I'm currently enrolled in grad school, and have a full ride.  So I'm in class full-time and also work full-time.  I've been doing it since September and so there's been no problem there.  However there's no room to work a second part-time job (Which I would love to do) and I'm assuming I'm going to get at least $60,000 at my next job once I graduate, or more, alleviating a lot of my worries.

I fully expect to put this debt at the forefront of my life for the next decade, and, though its taken me a while, I'm well accustomed to how I have to live my life for now.  

I tried consolidating with SOFI and a few others, but my debt to income ratio was too high.  I have great credit (~735), no late payments, no marks or anything like that, but still no luck.

Should I continue to look to consolidate?  Should I find ways to pay off that $10,000 loan and then snowball the rest of my loans? (Can't wait for my interest amortization to grow so I can finally see some dents in the principal!)

Any general advice would be great!

And please, I know how bad this is, I know its a shitty situation, I get that I'm not going to be able to live a full life while I have this debt, I've been doing it for a long time already, and I've accepted it.  I let my financially illiterate parents sign me up for the worst loans due to a shitty family situation at the time, and I was only 16.  I just need to deal with the consequences.  I have no help from my family either, so its just me.  Please spare me the ""Why would you do this!  It's stupid!"" comments.  What's done is done, and I can't go back now.

personalfinance,Fedloan repayment plans. Stretching out the plan to 25 years to maximize Avalanche method.,"Currently in a standard repayment plan (10 years) and my monthly min payment is around $680. I have budgeted $1000 a month to paying down my loans. Using the avalanche method I would first pay my monthly min ($680) and then put anything left over ($1000 - $680 = 320) towards the highest interest rate loan. I am thinking about adjusting my repayment plan to the 25 year option so that my monthly min drops to something around $350. By doing this I now have $650 to throw at the highest rate loan. 

I am rather annoyed that there is this whole loan status thing. If I only pay the interest on the loan and not the amount specified in the repayment plan, then my loan status changes to DELINQUENT and it hurts my credit. What do they care, if I'm paying just the interest that just means I'm in debt to them longer. 

My plan: change my repayment plan to stretch it out as long as possible to reduce the monthly min so that I can maximize the effort to pay down my highest interest rate loan. Does this sound like a good idea? Am I making a huge mistake?

personalfinance,3 years into career. Student loans. How to budget each paycheck? [Budgeting],"I [28/M] am approximately 3 years into my career as an attorney in a small town. After taxes and a 401k contribution of $200/month (employer contributes 10% of salary to 401k), my net pay is approximately $3,500/month. I started with about $62,000 in student loans. That is down to about $40,000. Currently, I budget my $3,500/month net pay as follows:

$1,000/month for student loans (federal, 6.5% interest). $40/month for disability insurance. $350/month for travel (mainly for a trip I have planned at the end of the year). $300/month rent (I split with my gf). $600/month to savings (downpayment on home/emergency). $80/month for car insurance. $400/month for roth-IRA (retirement). The rest for food/entertainment/gas. I do not pay for utilities, and my car lease is paid through my employer. I have about $11,000 in savings. 

A few other possibly relevant pieces of information: Being able to travel at least once a year is very important to me. Job security is not an issue (successful, family practice). My minimum student loan payment is $750/month, but I've been paying more than that because I want to get rid of my student loans ASAP.

personalfinance,Some of my plans to reduce my student loan debt. Are any of them good options?,"[Debt]

Disclaimer: I'm well aware in need to increase my income, no question about that. I'm not ignoreing that fact, and I've actively working towards that. I understand the best way to pay off debt is to actually pay it, instead of moving it around. All of that being said, I'm looking at these *additional* options that might make my financial life at least a modicum degree of easier. 

So, my student loans are killing me, especially with some of them having the interest that they do (one as high as 7%). A thought occurred to me that I own my car, and KBB puts it's value at about 2900. I know I can get a really good interest rate on a secured loan using my car as collateral (the original loan I bought it under just ended and it was at 2.4%)

So, here's my options: 

1. Why don't I take out a secured loan, using the car as collateral for about 2K and use it to ""balance transfer"" the higher interest student loan? At the rate it's at now, going from a 7.5% to a 2.5% on 2K transferred balance would save me about $90 a year. Hmm, as I type this out, that doesn't seem like a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. Anyways, that's one idea. 

2. I can do the balance transfer for my credit cards (effectively taking my credit cards to $0 at a *substainally* lower interest), then my credit card company might have a balance transfer option (they do those every few months) where I can BT over another 2K from the SL at a promotional 0%. That should save me closer to $690 a year just in interest.

3. I've thought about also maybe taking out a line of credit, but I'm afraid that the interest on that after whatever promotional period would be higher than my student loan interest is. The total weighted average of all of my loans is about 7%, so my LOC would need to be about there permanently in order to make up for that, then a promotion for some time.

My biggest problem with the first two options, however, is about BT fees or loan origination fees. Maybe the ""Savings"" would be so minimal after the fees that it wouldn't be worth it? Whatever I do, I'm going to work on paying that off every year and ""Recycling"" the method. 

Anyways, those are the options I'm considering to get my student loans down a small chunk. Thoughts? Are there other options (besides asking for income based repayment)? 

PS - I don't like the thought of changing my payments on my student loan to income-based, because with where my interest is being charged, my payments would be less than the interest and I'd never actually be working towards principle for the next 10 years. I could do income based and drop my loan payments by about $200, but like I said, that's not even close to paying any portion of the balance. 

P.S.S - Right now, my student loan payments are $680/mo graduated to go up every year for the next 9 years (I've been paying for 18 months so far). Credit cards are about $250/mo. So, my total payments to credit are about $930/mo.

personalfinance,"Grad student stipend comes with zero paperwork, and the state says I failed to pay estimated tax even though I filed my taxes on time... I'm very lost. [TAXES]","Hi all,

I'm a grad student on a fellowship, and my stipend comes with zero (zip, zilch, nada) paperwork attached. The only thing I get is a 1098-T for the tuition payments, which go through the university. I haven't been given any rules or tutorials on how to pay taxes on my stipend; all I know is that it *is* taxable income, and nothing is withheld by whoever it is that does withholdings on wages.

I calculated what I would probably owe at the end of the year and put the appropriate amount in escrow each month, so I paid my taxes last month just fine. However, a few days ago I received a notice from the state of MA saying that I

&gt;""failed to make sufficient estimated or withholding income tax payments as required by law. You are being assessed a penalty for the underpayment of estimated tax because your estimated and/or withholding payments were less than 80 percent of your total income tax""...

My questions are: if the state sent me this notice, will I likely get dinged by the feds too? Do I actually have to pay money to somebody earlier in the year, and if so, how do I do it if I don't have any paperwork? When? How often? Why can't I just hold my own money in escrow and keep the interest on it?

personalfinance,"Question about vehicle purchases that seems to be asked often, but not completely answered.","I have been googling like crazy for an answer to this, and it seems there are numerous questions that revolve around whether you should pay cash for a vehicle, and consequently the lease vs. buy question. 

 There are a few questions about whether you should pay cash for a car, or finance the car and take out a low interest loan.

What I'd like to know, is what makes most sense in my situation.  I am thinking about buying a Ford Fusion, and I think the important things are:

- I have a stable income that will never go away, and a monthly payment would not be risky for me.
- I have enough cash to buy a new Fusion (32k..ish), although in reality if I paid cash I would buy a used Fusion closer to the 20k range.
- I currently have no debt whatsoever, besides my house.
- I have a 780 credit score, and financing (whether a loan or lease) wouldn't be an issue.
- I get the A Plan employee pricing, which is a substantial 2-5k off the msrp of a new car.

So, considering that I currently have the 32k invested, and all of the factors mentioned above, what would make the most sense for me?  I could:

1. Pay 20k cash and buy a used Fusion
2. Pay 10-20k cash and finance a new Fusion, and leave the remaining 12-22k invested. I would most likely get a very low interest rate, or even find a 0% loan offer.

OR, (this one makes the most sense to me... but I haven't seen ANYONE talk about it)

3. Lease the fusion and leave almost all of the 32k invested, if not all of it.

I am a non-US-citizen starting professional school in June. This was my top choice reach program, and I'm very happy that I was accepted. I went to high school and undergrad in the US, and I am planning to live and work here. Unfortunately, I'm also looking at $125K in private student loans (~55K annualy). EDIT: I am not eligible for FAFSA. I have to do all the work myself &gt;_&lt;

Course of study spans a little over 2 years (8 semesters), and after graduation I'm expecting to earn 35-40K for one year (paid clinical) and an average starting salary of probably 70K or more depending on setting and area. It will suck, but it's manageable.

What are some caveats of private loans I should be on the lookout for? The list of preferred lenders provided by the school includes:

* Sallie Mae  
* Discover  
* HUECU (targeted at international students, US citizen cosigner not required butttt also comes with a 4% origination fee &gt;_&amp;lt;)  
* Wells Fargo  
* Citizen Bank  
* EDvestinU (never even heard the name...)  
* Union Federal  
* Anything else? Navient is a name I've seen on here.

I'm aware that private loans don't usually qualify for IBR or loan forgiveness. 

* Is it better to go variable or fixed?  
* How are variable rates doing right now?  
* The rate ranges provided by lenders start as low as 3% and go all the way up - what do these depend on, cosigner financial history?  
* I have a 760 credit score and a Sallie Mae credit card, would this be taken into account at all if I go the Sallie Mae route?  
* What are some questions I need to get answers to before choosing the loan?  
* Am I able to get multiple loans for the year or is it better to stick with one provider?  
* What are good resources or providers for loan refinancing (SoFi?) or consolidation (I poked around a bit on /r/StudentLoans, looks like there are definitely options for private loans there)?

My loan grace period of six months lapsed during this time and notifications were sent, but to the wrong address. Sometime later I received a collection call and I immediately started calling my loan intuitions, including Salle Mae and explained that I was working through the university I went to, but was working as a part time employee and was unable to make payments at this time. My account was put into Forbearance and I stayed on Forbearance working part time until September 2012 when I gained a full time position and started paying down my debts. I was also mailed out a form to complete that indicated when I started working part time to retroactively remove issues from my account. I filled out the form and sent it off and the problem seemed to be resolved.  In 2013 I consolidated my loans into Fed Loan.

-Fast forward to the present- I applied for my first non-store credit card and was declined. To find out why I logged onto Credit Karma and found my score has dropped from 720 (previous Credit Karma score about this time last year) to 640 in a year. When I look at the reports on the site I see 9 marks against me from a student loan ranging from September 2010 to May 2011. I called Sallie Mae and was told Navient now has my loan records and that the companies divided in 2014. After explaining my situation to Navient I have been asked to write a letter and Mail it in an envelope, detailing what has happened and why I think the marks should be removed.

I am unfamiliar with how contesting works, and what would be necessary to put into the letter (tax info, Letter from university employer?) but while looking into how to contest I came across a post that stated that if I contest the dings and I am unable to convince Navient to remove the dings then it can reset the amount of time that the dings appear on my credit history. 

It is my understanding that the dings should not be reported on my account after 5-7 years (FL).  Would it be better to wait out the dings or move ahead on trying to get them removed? Any help would be much appreciated.    

Additionally,  I rented a house in 2012 and had no issues with my credit, but I have never pulled my credit report or applied for a credit card other than in store credit cards, which I cancelled after opening (Bad idea, but didn’t realize it at the time).

I ask because if there are no real restrictions, couldn't you use non-standard bases to skirt around some gambling laws?

Like say I issue a bunch of small loans whose interest rates are determined by a sports team's performance. Then, you have a futures market where you are trading these interest rates, longing and shorting depending on whether you think the team will win or lose.

I got a full-time job in June in the same field I'm studying and continued to go to school full-time, which qualified me for an employer-sponsored educational benefits. My employer covered half of my summer tuition and most of my fall tuition. My employer included the benefits in my gross income, and withheld for my salary plus taxable tuition.

I did a little reading on Working Condition Fringe Benefits (WCFB) (IRC section 132), which states:
&gt; Educational benefits may be excluded from gross income as ""working condition fringe benefits"" if allowable as an ""ordinary and necessary business expense"" had employee paid for education. Education must NOT be needed to meet minimum qualifications for a job and must NOT be part of a program of study that could qualify the employee for a new skill or business, even if the employee never uses that new skill, AND maintain or improve skills needed in the current job.

I think I meet all of the criteria for the WCFB, as I was already qualified for the job; the job is in my field of study, so it's not qualifying me for a new skill or business; and all coursework directly improved my job performance.

I'm a nurse not a car guy. I pulled my tranny out myself and have done some repairs but as far as tracking down parts I don't have the connections. So I've been told I eill have to buy an entirely new transmission at the amazing cost of 2500 /s. So 2500 for parts and I thought maybe I should just bring in my jeep and have them replace and reinstall the transmission maybe I can get a discount for removing it myself. So labor will be 1k or more. I always try to up charge when I figure this stuff out so I'm never surprised. My question really is. Should I fix my jeep with the money on hand. Or pay off what I can on my high interest loans and try to borrow against the jeep to fix it. I was a recent victim of identity theft with put 6k on my debt and brought my score down to 550 but I fixed it. Just don't know how long it will take my score to reflect. (i owed 10k on it now I own 3500 before this month's payment is taken out. I usually pay 450 at least. Most times I pay that twice a month rather than once.  instead of the required 332 a month since I live with dear old mommy

I guess what I am really asking is. What process will get my jeep fixed and me debt free the cheapest and fastest way possible. I can provide interest rates if it will help with the advice. Will just take me a while without my planner to be able to get through all my accounts and write it down

Anyhoo, with zero deductions it's saying my net pay is going to be like 63% of my gross pay. Does this sound right? I'm guessing with some deductions I could be losing up to half of my paycheck? I'm grateful to have finally made it but I didn't expect to be paying much more than 30% or so, so I just wanted to make sure that I didn't miss anything. 

Sorry, I come from a low-income family, food stamps and everything and I'm completely clueless about 401k and all that stuff. I am just starting to read about all this money stuff. My parents don't know anything unfortunately.

Backdoors can not be limited to certain people, they will be available to anyone, including criminals. What is the national security threat of anyone being able to steal and get information off on devices owned by government employees?

stocks,How to [and not to] ask questions / advice,"It seems this sub-reddit has a daily issue. It's fine to seek advice, but we see far too many posts that are not seeking advice at all, but simply want to be told where said person should put their money. This is not okay.  
  
Let me reiterate; This is not okay.  
  
I'm going to make a list of examples on what you ( people seeking advice ) SHOULD ask and what you shouldn't.  
  
**How NOT to ask for advice**  
- ""I am interested in the stock market. I know to buy low sell high. Can anyone suggest stocks for me to invest in?""  
- "" Recently decided to learn about investing. Can anyone point me in the right direction?""  
- ""Is it a good time to buy?""  
- ""Beginner wondering what all the terms mean""  
- ""The market is going down, should I sell all of my positions?!?""  
  
**Why the above is wrong**  
Never ask anyone where to put your money.( Less maybe your accountant or full-service broker if applicable). Especially don't ask strangers over the internet what you should do with your money. Do your Due Diligence.  
  
If you really were interested in learning about the stock market, you wouldn't post here and do nothing else. First of all you are not guaranteed a reply, and if you do get one, it could take hours or days. Just looking up the information yourself is a far better approach and really shows commitment and that you're serious.  
  
If you think it's a good time to buy, explain to us why you think that. Don't just ask us if it's a good time to buy, let's create a discussion.  
  
Don't know the terms? Look them up. Seriously, you'll get great answers ( and once again, likely much faster then waiting for replies all day ) if you just went to sites like investopedia, and then came to us with more specific questions.  
  
Lastly, if you think the market is going down even more so, don't just ask us if you should sell. Give us more details. MORE DETAILS. What's your avg? How long have you held? Etc.  
  
  
**How to ask for advice properly**  
  
- ""I have been interested in learning the stock market for awhile. I've done a lot of my own research but I don't understand how things like P/E, EBITA, etc, effect a stock price?""  
- "" I'm looking at 'x' stock. I think it's a good buy because of ""y and z"". What do you guys think?""  
  
- "" Beginner here. I'm trying to get the hang of technical analysis but I'm having trouble understanding what support and resistance is. Can someone please help me understand better?""  
  
- "" I currently have ""x"" and ""y"" company in my portfolio. I'm looking to add a company that has high dividends. Can anyone suggest some companies I can look at and do my due diligence to, to see if it's a fit?""  
  
Can you see the difference? All too often people come here looking to literally be spoon-fed answers on what to do. This won't help you make money on the stock market. If anything it's just going to hinder you. Beginners need to learn how to find information on their own, and then come here to ask us more specific questions. The other key difference in the DON'T and DO's is that the DO questions were , once again, specific. It shows you have taken your own time and done research, but still had trouble understanding some concepts. By all means, come post questions here if that's the case, and we'd all be more then happy to do our best to assist. However, if you come here and just straight up ask us what to do , and do literally no work on your own, that's the wrong road to be going down.",finance,1455984750

personalfinance,"[Taxes]Having issues with my return through TurboTax, can anyone chime in?","I'm doing my return through TurboTax, and getting kind of frustrated; I didn't have any issues last year.

Basically, I made 60k in 2015, and all I want is a standard deduction. But I get to the end and it's telling me I get 50 bucks back and owe the state like $20. I claim 2 allowances on W4 (claim myself and also single/one job). And in December of 2015 by error I was claiming 0 allowances for the month so  I should've been paying even more tax that I shouldn't have been.

Here's a breakdown of the tax I paid for both jobs I had:

**Job 1:** 

Wages: $58,469

Fed Tax: $8,169

SS Tax: $3,625

Medicare Tax: $847

Calculated Fed Tax Rate: 13.97%

**Job 2:**

Wages: $2,582

Fed Tax: $384

SS Tax: $160

Medicare Tax: $37

Calculated Fed Tax Rate: 14.87%

Total: 

Wages: 61,051

Fed Tax: 8,553

Calculated Fed Tax Rate: 14.00%

According to the tax bracket (single) I should be paying:

10% X 9,225 = 922.5

15% X (37,450 - 9,226) = 4,233.6

25% X 23,600 = 5,900

= $11,056

= 18.1% tax rate

But isn't that before my allowances? What's up with the discrepancy? I filed correctly on the W4 so I should be paying the proper amount. 

The standard deduction is $6,300 so I was expecting to get $880 back (6,300 X 14%)

Can anyone enlighten me?",finance,1455988601

investing,BARRON'S: What Recession? GDP Set to Grow 3%,"&gt; To begin with, while a 3% increase in gross domestic product might sound unduly ambitious, this reflects only the lowered ambitions of the current era. Every expansion since World War II has gone through intervals of slow growth. However, all have had years in which economic growth ran at 4% or better, including the 2002-07 expansion. If the economy rises by 3% this year, the current expansion will still retain the dubious honor of being the weakest on record (see chart above).

&gt; Growth of 4% seems unattainable due to the drag on exports from weak economies abroad, combined with a strong dollar that makes those exports more costly, plus below-par performance of the small-business sector and slowed expansion of the labor force, owing mainly to the retirement of baby boomers. But if the vicious cycle of recession is avoided, a virtuous cycle should ensue, as positive factors reinforce one another. 

&gt; Employment gains and the tight labor market are already driving up wages and salaries. That is boosting consumer spending, which is encouraging capital investment, which is causing businesses to hire, which, in turn, is driving employment gains. The virtuous cycle has also begun to include the housing sector. Employment gains make it possible for more people to form households, which spurs demand for apartment buildings and detached homes, which, in turn, leads to greater gains in employment.

&gt; With faster top-line growth, corporate profits can also rise. Profit increases typically slow long before an economic expansion runs out of steam. The pace of the bull market of the past few years has probably slowed, but stock prices can still reach new highs.

&gt; IF RECESSION IS AROUND the corner, it will turn history on its head. Take the impact of oil since the mid-1970s. As the chart below shows, each of the past six recessions has been preceded by a spike in crude prices, often called an “oil shock.” The logic is straightforward: Businesses and consumers suffer financial shock when this essential commodity suddenly becomes more costly.

&gt; The current collapse in petroleum prices has also been called an oil shock, even though plunging tabs for such items as gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, and jet fuel have enriched those same businesses and consumers. 

&gt; Of course, cheaper crude does hurt energy producers. But since most publicly traded companies are consumers of energy, it makes no sense for the broad stock indexes to track oil. The recent pattern in which the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index moves up and down in concert with crude seems to reflect equity traders’ belief that a low price for crude signals an economic slowdown. 

&gt; Hopefully, the market will soon break out of this circular-reasoning trap. If Barron’s is right that oil will rise to $55 a barrel by December, this pattern will be broken by events. Our Feb. 6 cover story, “Here Comes $20 Oil,” referred to the likely final leg of the energy bear market, which should end by April, before a rebound to $55 by December.

&gt; Defaults by the energy sector on loans are hurting U.S. banks. But according to estimates by economist Carsten Valgreen of Applied Global Macro Research, such loans account for no more than 4% of the banks’ total loan book. So even if losses on these loans run as high as one-half, this should hardly trigger a banking crisis.

&gt; As Valgreen also points out, in all three categories of bank lending—commercial and industrial, consumer, and residential real estate—conventionally calculated loss ratios are near historic lows. “Bank lending has been gathering steam,” observes Rennaissance Macro Research economics head Neil Dutta, noting that over the 13 weeks through Feb. 3, commercial bank lending accelerated across all categories. Valgreen, who helps run a hedge fund that trades on such insights, believes that the recent selloff in U.S. banking stocks offers a unique buying opportunity.

&gt; Another channel through which low energy prices supposedly threaten recession: weakness in developing lands that export oil. Making matters worse is slower economic expansion in China, Japan, and the euro zone. 

&gt; But while U.S. growth will certainly take a hit from lower exports to the global market, Michael Lewis, economics chief at Free Market, observes, “In the modern era, there is not a single recession that can be traced to foreign economic woes.” 

&gt; For example, the 1998 meltdown in the Asian economies that caused a brief selloff in the U.S. stock market didn’t trigger the recession that many expected at the time. Adds Lewis: “While a U.S. sneeze can give the rest of the world the proverbial flu, the reverse still does not happen.”

&gt; To be sure, the ultralow interest rates maintained by the Federal Reserve have created a breeding ground for financial excesses that, when painfully corrected, often bring recession. But so far, it appears that the Fed and the economy have been lucky. Major excesses are hard to find.

&gt; Even if stocks make new highs by the end of the year, standard price/earnings ratios will be noticeably below their peak of 2000, especially if earnings make modest gains. And the home-price bubble that started to burst in 2007 is a long way from forming again. The classic excess cited in the textbooks—the excessive buildup of inventories—is hardly present today, especially in light of the cuts to inventory investment in the second half of last year.

&gt; ONE INDICATION that the economy has found renewed strength: the labor force turnaround of prime-age workers 25 to 54. Much of the reason for slowed growth in the labor force has been demographic. The baby boomers are reaching retirement age, and they are merely following a predictable life cycle by leaving the workplace. But as Barron’s has pointed out (“Work’s for Squares,” Aug. 30, 2014), another, far more disconcerting trend was also evident: lower participation by prime-age workers.

&gt; This unanticipated trend is a key reason that forecasters have been surprised by how far the unemployment rate has fallen, despite modest growth. Skeptics have therefore dismissed the decline as bogus. Why place any value on a statistic that becomes more favorable as job seekers stop seeking jobs? But that is no longer true of prime-age workers, and the turnaround is due to the full-employment economy signaled by the jobless rate’s decline to 4.9%.

&gt; The prime-age labor force fell to a low of 100.6 million in second-quarter 2014 from its fourth-quarter 2007 peak of 104.4 million. Over the past six calendar quarters, however, it has rebounded by 1.3 million, to 101.9 million in January. The unemployment rate’s decline over this period, to 4.9% from 6.2%, has therefore been accompanied by more prime-age job-seekers rejoining the workforce.

&gt; THE RECENT TREND in the unemployment rate also tells us something about the diminished chances of recession. Evidence shows that increases in joblessness consistently lead economic turndowns. In the 12 months before all 11 recessions since World War II, the jobless rate rose on a three-month basis at least once, and usually several times, no doubt because it started to feel the tremors from reduced economic activity before the recession hit.

&gt; In the 12 months prior to the 2008-09 recession, the unemployment rate rose on a three-month basis no fewer than seven times. Before the previous recession, of 2001, it climbed five times, and before the 1990-91 recession, six times.

&gt;But over the past 12 months—in fact, over the past three years—the three-month change in the unemployment rate has generally been negative and occasionally flat; it hasn’t risen even once. The last three-month increase in joblessness occurred as of January 2013, when it hit 8%.

&gt; Further confirming the positive trend in the labor markets: the persistent decline in new claims for unemployment insurance. As Free Market’s Lewis points out, initial claims are “one of the most reliable leading indicators, typically giving ample warning of recessions.” But, he adds, there is “not even an inkling [of a rise] yet.” In the four weeks through Feb. 13, weekly claims averaged 273,000, one of the lowest figures in decades.

&gt; For real GDP to grow by 3% this year, real consumer spending must do its part, rising at an annualized 3% or more in each calendar quarter. So far, at least, consumption seems to be off to a good start. Based on the solid retail sales report for January, economist Neil Dutta is tracking 3.2% growth in the current quarter. If that persists, it will be noticeably higher than the lackluster performance of 2015, when real consumption for the full year rose by just 2.6%. Last year, the money generated by the boost to disposable personal income was mainly saved, rather than spent.

&gt; Applied Global Macro Research economist Jason Benderly predicts that consumption will rise by 3.4% this year. His forecast seems plausible if, as he expects, three factors that figured in 2015’s weak performance recede this year. 

&gt; The first factor, which weighed on consumer spending, was a fall in confidence. Benderly has found the best indicator of consumer confidence isn’t the standard surveys of confidence, but rather credit spreads. The spread between yields on Baa corporate bonds and 10-year Treasuries widened steadily over the course of last year and is now even wider. But as recession fears recede, this spread should start narrowing. That should signal a rise in confidence, he argues, accompanied by a rise in spending.

&gt; The second factor is, ironically, faster growth of wages and salaries. Benderly has found that consumer spending responds with a lag when wage-and-salary growth accelerates. That happened last year, with the extra income going into extra saving. This year, however, consumer spending should start to catch up with the increase in income.

&gt; THE FINAL FACTOR is also a lagged response, in this case, to lower energy prices. Benderly has found that when prices of necessities decline, consumers initially save much of the windfall, only to spend it later. So last year’s plunging energy costs went into savings, but much of it will be spent on consumption this year.

&gt; Another key component of economic output—investment in plant and equipment— was hurt by the severe cutbacks by the energy sector. But if the oil price rebounds to $55, as Barron’s expects, then key parts of energy investment will make a comeback before the year is out, says Citigroup senior energy analyst Anthony Yuen. And in general, Benderly anticipates a gradual rebound in U.S. manufacturing, as it responds with a normal lag to the pickup in retail sales.

&gt; The government portion of output, which began to make small contributions to growth in 2015, should pick up a bit this year, too, given the turnaround in state and local employment. 

&gt; Residential investment, which has been making steady contributions to GDP growth, should also climb a bit faster, as rising incomes spur greater household formation, in turn causing greater production and spurring greater employment and formation of households.  In short, the virtuous cycle should dominate. 

SOUNDS LIKE ITS TIME TO DUMP ALL THOSE BOND FUNDS AND GO 150% LONG EQUITIES!!!! I mean, there's no way BARRON'S editorials would be a poor forecasting cue, right? RIGHT?",finance,1455991596
personalfinance,Federal Income Not Withheld and now I owe the IRS.

My SS tax and Medicare tax were both withheld, as were state &amp; local income taxes. I did file for unemployed for about a month ($1680 worth), so I knew I would be getting taxed on that. However, the total money I owe the IRS is over $3,000 (my wages for the year were around $32,000 on my W-2).

MachineLearning,"Good machine learning course for ""advanced beginner"" which also goes into more complex data generation (yes, i've used the search bar and read FAQ)","I have already taken the undergraduate machine learning course that my university offers. We went over the theory behind linear regression, gradient descent, bayesian inference, k-means, neural networks, and support vector machines; but we only were assigned homework to implement linear regression, gradient descent, and neural network. These were all implemented in MATLAB and the datasets we used were all just numeric (for example our linear regression was estimating the MPG of a car based off a dataset which included MPG, horsepower, displacement, weight, etc... which are all just numeric things you can feed into the model. 

I had no problem understanding the math behind any of these machine learning models, but to be fair these are all pretty basic, we didn't even talk about more complex neural networks like recurrent or convolutional, so i am not sure if i might've had trouble understanding the math there.

I am looking for an online course that goes over the basics behind the math for different models but focuses on implementation (preferably in Python). Then towards the end of the course talks about how to use the models (preferably neural networks) to generate your own data.

Maybe i am looking for two courses:

1) Advanced introduction to machine learning models which talks about all the basic commonly used models for supervised and unsupervised learning and how to implement them

2) Data generation with machine learning that talks about how to implement machine learning models which can then be used to create data of complex forms like pictures.

Can anyone lend me some advice? Thanks!",finance,1456000816
personalfinance,Where does the left over money from an unemployment claim go once it expires?,"I opened an unemployment claim a little over 3 years ago after being fired from a job outside of my control (I was sick, to the point the paramedics carted me out of work via ambulance.) The claim was open for a total of 3 years from the start date with a total of around $6000 in it. As soon as I'd go back to work, I'd just stop filing. I've had to re-open the claim several times due to illness and/or being laid off in the span of those 3 years. The claim finally expired in October, which I was barely getting by on after being fired in August.

They obviously won't give you that money in one lump sum, which I understand. However, when it expired, there was still over $2000 in it. The day it expired the account went to $0. Where did that money go? I'm assuming back to state/federal?

Of course, still being unemployed, I had to re-open an entirely brand new claim which took about 2 months, as did when I opened the original claim a few years prior. This time, they put about $4000 in it and it's open for 1 year, instead of 3. I've been hired at a job that I'm suppose to start next week, even though I'm not sure if I'm going to keep it. It was really a more of ""see what will happen thing,"" due to the fact I'm way over qualified (was told so by the manager) and while I'm not above this, they're saying its part time at minimum wage and to be honest, it's probably going to be the same exact, if not less, of what I'm making on unemployment now.

Also, I noticed any time I've re-opened the unemployment claim, it would go down by a $10-20 difference each time. Was this based off of whatever employer they decided to use it from and how much I was making at the time? Which doesn't make sense to me, due to the fact I was making the same hourly or even more during the course of the last 3 years. 

So to sum it up: Where does the unused money from a UI claim go and why is it every time I re-open it, the payment drops lower? 

Thanks for the insight!

personalfinance,IBR risks?,"Hi Everyone
This subreddit has been good to me as far as increasing knowledge with loan repayments.  Im about 150,000 in student loan debt and have just started to repay my loans.  125,000 of that loan is federal and I am looking to apply for the Income based repayments.  My private loans are 28,000~ with a 8.3% interest (trying to pay this one off first) 
The 10 year standard payments are crushing as it is a little bit more than my 2 week pay check. ( i make around 64,000).  

My question to you guys is: 
Are there any drawback to utilizing IBR that i should be aware of? 

I know that my first thoughts out of graduate school was to consolidate loans since thats what everyone told me to do but quickly found out why it may not be the best options from reading stuff on this sub reddit.

personalfinance,Estimated taxes underpayment penalty question,"So two things. I filed my info last year to have employer withhold fed taxes at a set amount. I'm paid from two sources one of which is a stipend for my research program and so they don't withhold. I was asking them to withhold from the other smaller portion that they supplement.

About halfway through the year I realized they were not doing this. Subsequently I tried to make an estimated  for the whole year but I received a letter I didn't read but found recently saying they were unable to process my payment.

Therefore I am underpaid by like 2k or so (my tax situation is kind of unique--i'm SS/Medicare exempt.

If I let the IRS calculate the penalty, is there any chance they won't notice (like how audits are semi random?). I feel like a scumbag hoping so but I really did try last year and fucked up (my responsibility still).

personalfinance,Do I need a tax professional?,"My taxes are not particularly complicated (a couple W2s, small interest income from bank account, student loan interest, etc.).  The past two years, I have owed money and was at risk for an underpayment penalty.  My income went up substantially midway through this year, but I also bought a house at that time, so I thought those factors would sort of counteract each other.  Well, I just worked on my federal taxes online and it looks like I'm going to owe around $6000 this year.  The tax software I used suggested taking the standard deduction as my other potential deductions apparently didn't outweigh the standard.  I asked acquaintances who uses a well-known national tax prep company's local office and they pay about $700 to have their taxes done there (and that's by one of the company-trained agents, not a CPA).  I assume a CPA would likely charge even more, though I could be wrong about that.  

1.  Is it worth it to hire someone to do my taxes?  Is it likely they will be able to find more deductions than I have thought of on my own, or loopholes of which I am unaware (e.g. I paid more for my house than it is worth, could they make that count for something?)?  Or should I just do my own taxes but hire someone to give me advice going forward?  

2.  If you think I should hire someone to do my taxes, is it okay to go with the national company's agent (she does have years of experience despite not having a CPA) or is it better to find a CPA?",finance,1456002095

I am 19 and he is been in for the entirety of my life (he joined when my parents had me in high school at 18) however I have a 6 year old brother.

Hillary's lip service and pandering [has been blatant this entire campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3iBb1gvehI).  

[There are plenty of skeletons in Hillary's closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kypl1MYuKDY); what is posted below is a representative sample.  Hillary's history is enough to scare most people that put time in to learn about her.  [Hillary's Wall St connections and donations](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46qbn3/here_are_all_of_hillary_clintons_wall_street/), the tens of millions the Clintons made in ""speaking fees"" (legalized bribery), and her refusal to release transcripts of paid speeches are equally deplorable. {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46mr9r/sanders_accepts_clintons_challenge_on_wall_street/d06l7ty)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47y0fr/everyone_wants_to_know_what_was_in_hillary/)}

The Clintons have a pretty disgusting history of pathological lying, dishonesty, manipulation, corruption, vindictive behavior, and dirty tricks including smearing honest credible people through [whisper campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_campaign).
They also don't mind sending out supporters and surrogates to do their dirty work.  

One of the most egregious violations so far this election involves Clinton ties to MSNBC host Chris Matthews and MSNBC contributor/WAPO editor Jonathan Capehart.

There are other documented accounts of major media organizations manipulating coverage and protecting Hillary. {[1](http://www.salon.com/2016/03/16/new_york_times_busted_for_anti_bernie_bias_the_iconic_clinton_endorsing_newspaper_slyly_edits_article_to_smear_sanders/)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47z286/memetics_manipulation_and_suppression_how_cnn/)}{[3](http://m.dailykos.com/stories/1499966)}{[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4ag1cr/msnbcs_chris_matthews_faces_call_to_suspend_show/d109wmv)}{[5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orlC31eFTc0)}

Questions remain if Hillary will be indicted by the FBI for hosting a private server that exposed classified information to the internet.  Hillary's server was setup to circumvent archival requirements of the Federal Records Act and FOIA requests.  The Clinton Foundation is also under an FBI investigation for pay-to-play access involving Hillary's DoS actions in exchange for ""donations.""  {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47kt9u/whichhillary_twitter_trend_calls_out_clinton_for/d0dv5mh?context=1)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/489ph0/final_clinton_emails_coming_today/d0hyuwc?context=3)}

Hillary is currently under six investigations, but the FBI and OIG investigations are the most severe.

**Re: Jonathan Capehart (WAPO/MSNBC) smears Sanders civil rights record**  
**Re: Chris Matthews bias and conflict of interest**  

http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/the-jonathan-capehart-saga-or-why-progressives-hav.html

...

This is an example of the incestuous relationship between ""journalists"" and politicians.

The Clintons have [a history of using journalists to push stories](http://gawker.com/this-is-how-hillary-clinton-gets-the-coverage-she-wants-1758019058).   On Thursday Feb. 11, 2016, Capehart published [an editorial in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/11/stop-sending-around-this-photo-of-bernie-sanders/) and [sent out tweets](http://archive.is/BCLLM) [check the summaries] smearing Sanders civil rights record.  Capehart repeated the smear claims during a post democratic debate interview [on a special edition of Hardball on MSNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AshSzj0F-nU) (Feb 11).  

It should be noted that the spouse of MSNBC's Chris Matthews is [Kathleen Matthews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Matthews) formerly of Marriott International, [who worked closely with the Clinton Foundation for four years to open a Marriott hotel in Haiti](http://news.marriott.com/2015/05/kathleen-matthews-departs-marriott-international-to-pursue-new-opportunity.html).  Kathleen Matthews, funded by Hillary donors and friends {[1](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/14/media/chris-matthews-kathleen-matthews/)}{[2](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/11/chris-matthewss-hardball-guests-have-given-79050-to-his-wife-kathleens-congressional-campaign/)}{[3](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/09/hillary-donors-helping-chris-matthews-wife-into-congress/)}{[4](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/13/ten-thousand-demand-chris-matthews-suspension-msnbc-silent/)}, is running for the U.S. House of Representatives for Maryland's 8th congressional district..  

Watch these vids {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTuMnN4wvBY)}{[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqjp8dYOvu0)}{[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FMdeXrfkmU)}, Chris Matthews is heavily biased.

This explains how Capehart's smears went unchallenged. A prominent progressive site has called for MSNBC to suspend Chris Matthews for continued shilling and bias. [link removed - it violates the rules?]

Danny Lyon the original photographer, heard of the smears and [posted additional negatives to his blog](https://dektol.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/more-bernie-civil-rights-photos-found) proving the man [in the original photo](https://dektol.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-29-at-6-49-15-pm.png) was Sanders.  On Friday Feb 12, Capeheart repeated his claims live [on MSNBC Andrea Mitchell Reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak3RDTOUJHY). 

Capehart failed to disclose a direct conflict of interest acknowledging [his long term romantic relationship with long time Clinton staffer Nick Schmit](http://capitolfile-magazine.com/inside-jonathan-capehart-and-nick-schmits-house) and refuses to print a retraction or apologize. It's a pretty transparent hit piece attempting to discredit Sanders civil rights record in the lead up to the South Carolina primary on Feb 27.

To maintain ethical integrity and standards of a news outlet and as a journalist you are supposed to disclose conflicts or avoid them entirely. 

Schmit [has worked for the Clintons in various capacities since 2004-2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20160215055916/https://twitter.com/McSquirmishes/status/699032420029337601) as an employee of the Clinton Foundation, staff on Hillary's 2008 campaign, and subsequently moved to the US State Department in 2009 under Hillary where he has remained as a GS-14 Schedule C appointment [maybe his job is in jeopardy next year if Clinton doesn't win].

Shortly after Capehart's smear campaign, the twitter account [@FauxJCapehart](https://twitter.com/FauxJCapehart/with_replies) appeared. [[archived](http://archive.is/XrGMW)] 

As outrageous and disturbing as Capehart's actions are, the conversations initiated by troll account @FauxJCapehart is probably one of the most hilarious things to come from this election cycle.

**Re: Dolores Huerta: Sanders supporters chanted ""English only!""** {debunked}

**Video**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiHDo-uEIi4

Huerta is a surrogate of Hillary Clinton.  She is a well known hispanic political activist and founder of the United Farm Workers (UFW) union. When Clinton routinely mentions support from the UFW that support is solidified by her personal and financial relationship with Dolores.

Huerta made [accusations against Obama in 2008](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/21/1488535/-Dolores-Huerta-did-the-same-thing-to-Obama-in-2008) and [received a $100,000 donation from the Clinton Foundation in 2010](http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/300/300048438/300048438_201012_990PF.pdf). [page 33]

After the Nevada Caucus, Dolores Huerta and Ugly Betty star America Ferrera claimed supporters of Bernie Sanders chanted ""English only."" {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1l5SHR4GvE)}{[2](http://web.archive.org/web/20160224094857/https://twitter.com/DoloresHuerta/status/701184235315400705)}{[3](http://web.archive.org/web/20160224094846/https://twitter.com/AmericaFerrera/status/701166307387928577)} 

[This is false](http://www.snopes.com/sanders-english-only-huerta/).  

A person in the audience noted that people only spoke Spanish and needed a translator.  Precinct Chair Raymond Buckley asked if there was a translator in the audience. Buckley then stated, ""First person on the stage that speaks Spanish gets to do it."" Hillary's supporters shouted ""Dolores."" Dolores walked up to the stage.  People in the audience objected. ""no!"" ""neutral!"" ""she's a surrogate!""  Nevada Caucus Guidelines prevent observers and surrogates from speaking during the Caucus proceeding.  Rightfully, people in the audience were concerned that Huerta, a Clinton surrogate, might attempt to instruct Spanish speakers to group toward Clinton's area.  Precinct Chair Buckley noted the conflict and stated ""we are going forward English only.""  Buckley followed with the instructions, ""if somebody next to you is not English speaking please make sure you are next to them so you can translate as quickly as possible.""

**Re: Obama Boys 2008 vs Bernie Bros 2016**

This attack was first run by Clinton supporters against Obama in 2008, in an attempt to disparage the candidate and label their supporters as sexist mysoginists with racist connotations.{[1](http://dailykos.com/stories/2016/2/8/1481627/-WOW-Before-the-sexist-Bernie-Bro-Clinton-supporters-created-the-sexist-Obama-boy-No-seriously)}{[2](http://www.salon.com/2008/04/14/obama_supporters/)}

""Bernie Bros"" is a demeaning categorization for male Sanders supporters first penned in a Fall 2015 OP-ED. The BernieBros myth was further pushed into the sexist misogynist realm by Clinton supporters Emily Nussbaum and Emily Cahn.  Emily Nussbaum is a blogger/TV critic for ""The New Yorker"" and [a self-professed Clinton supporter](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216033537/https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/691834775343087616); her father [is attorney Bernard Nussbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_W._Nussbaum), former white house counsel for Bill Clinton.

Emily Nussbaum [was labeled ""a psycho""](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216040007/https://twitter.com/TJMitchJohnson/status/691839468710535168) by a single self-described Tea Party Trump supporter with a fake twitter account [@RepStevenSmith](https://twitter.com/RepStevenSmith). {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a8Q0RYWGqM)}{[2](http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/01/31/greenwald-anti-sanders-bernie-bro-articles-based-on-parody-account/)}{[3](http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/199111-fake-congressman-fools-people-on-twitter)}.

btc,"In the aftermath of the last Roundtable, some of us are feeling a little discouraged. Take heart. The Classic movement is still growing. Read this exchange I had with a fellow investor...","Him: What do you say to this? &lt;link to biased network scaling article&gt;

Me: I'm so glad you asked.

Blockstream is a for-profit company rumored to have $77 million in venture capital behind it.

They are working hard to develop a product to solve a problem that doesn't exist.

It is necessary for them to engage in a massive propaganda effort to convince the world that a technical roadblock exists so that they can provide a solution. (By the way, their solution transitions bitcoin users from a decentralized network to a federated network. Some think this is pretty horrible.) 
It is necessary for them to persuade the community to run artificially limited versions of the bitcoin software that artificially introduce that problem and make it a reality. Part of the propaganda effort has been to censor and erase any mention of alternative bitcoin versions from reddit /r/bitcoin and from the bitcoin forum at bitcointalk.org

The problem has been given many names, but essentially refers to the network capacity/throughput, or number of transactions per unit time.

Right now, blocks are nearly full. I'm running a bitcoin node on a 6 year old computer with a crappy 2mbit cable internet connection. It uses only a tiny fraction of my bandwidth (~ 2% just eyeballing it). 

Satoshi Nakamoto predicted that the growth of high speed internet infrastructure, such as fiber optic cable, throughout the world, would stay ahead of the growth of bitcoin usage. I was just recently at a hospital in &lt;large city&gt; where the public Wifi delivered 60mbits down AND up.

Furthermore, there are technical advancements in compression on the horizon that could increase the number of transactions you can squeeze into a block by orders of magnitude (segregated witness and thin blocks). These achievements transcend Satoshi's original vision.

In summary, the challenge facing Bitcoin is not a technical one. It is political. Can Blockstream succeed in bamboozling miners and node operators into continuing to keep the ridiculous block size limit in place? If so, we may need to consider looking into promising alt coins. Begin backing multiple horses, so to speak.

I am doing my part in the fight against Blockstream by running a Bitcoin Classic node https://bitcoinclassic.com/  Every node counts and the world is watching.

personalfinance,"What ""type"" of financial advisor should I seek based on my current financial issues?","I am giving a somewhat longwinded synopsis of my family's financial situation here in the hopes that I can be guided to the appropriate type of financial counselor/advisor/firm/whatever to help get things in order and move forward in the most constructive way.  We would like to speak to someone in the next 1-2 weeks locally to figure out what our options are and the implications of these options (bankruptcy, debt consolidation, etc), both short term (ability to stay afloat) and long term (getting a mortgage, buying a car, etc, and how this would affect these sorts of things down the road).

I am a 34 year old physician.  I finished training last year and finally started pulling a decent income after giving up my 20's to the field... as an aside, at least I love my job and look forward to every day and every patient I see at work.  My income is $290k/year (really $310k but $20k is required to go to a 401(a), so I am not including it).  My income will increase by $20k next year, and probably by $50k or so the year after; what happens after that is irrelevant at this point but suffice it to say it will not decrease from then on.

My wife is a homemaker, though she recently started her own company with literally zero overhead (all overhead to start up has been spent); I anticipate that income from this venture will be negligible for the next 2-3 years.

We have a 16 month old daughter.

Educational debt for me is around $250-300k, and for my wife is around $75k.

Our total credit card debt is around $60k.  Interest rates average around 13%.

I have a professional (private) loan with a balance of around $30k, with an interest rate of 14.5% (higher than any of our credit cards, surprisingly).

We have no assets to our name aside from some furniture.  I previously had a mortgage but sold the property.  We have two leased cars (would cost $15000 or more for each to return them now).  We have no savings.  I do have a small amount in the 401(a) but the amount is negligible at this point.  We have no other retirement at this point.

We do not have enough cash on hand to afford a move, even local.

Our credit cards are at or near maxed out.  Our checking account balance is around $1500.

Basically, starting next year, if expenses do not change, we would be able to begin paying down ~$1k per month on credit card debt.  However, this assumes that we don't have any more kids (wife is 36 and time is limited), our current baby doesn't become more expensive (they always do as they get older), and nothing catastrophic happens job or health wise.  In any case, we can't make it to next year without bottoming out and basically completely running out of money.  In fact, we can't make it to May of this year.  We are losing $1500/month currently (though after I hit the maximum taxable for ss/medicare, whichever, we will be down closer to $750/mo with current spending once those paychecks start coming in; irrelevant at this point).

My credit score is ~680, wife's is around 700.  I have never missed any payments on anything and have two credit card accounts that are 13 years old or older.  My score is low due to balance/limit ratios and balance/asset ratio.

I believe that with my wife, after even the most serious conversations, our overall expenses will not drop by any appreciable amount; perhaps 200-300 dollars/month could be saved of what you see on the spreadsheet linked at the end of this post...

Before marrying 4 years ago, my financial house was in complete order, and now it is in disarray at probably a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10.  Hopefully we can find someone who can lay out all options for us to move forward and begin paying debts down... any advice on what type of advisor to seek or how to go about finding them would be most appreciated.  We are in a small metro market (Greenville, SC area), but hopefully an appropriate resource is available somewhere locally.  Thank you for any help you can give.  If any other details of our finances would be helpful to any of you in guiding us to the right resource, I can provide them if requested.

I don't post on Reddit too often, am mostly a lurker, but I hope that I can get some direction regarding my debts. I will be receiving my tax returns soon, a total of just over $8k (I know that's because I paid too much during the year).

Rent: $1100. Plus utilities- ~$1200
I have a vehicle that I still owe about $14k for... $356/ mo.

Left over money goes to food, gas, miscellaneous.

I'm hoping to get another vehicle. My wife and I have been able to share a car for the last year and a half, but we feel it's time to get another one. There's a promotion being run for a dealership near us, they are offering to match tax returns up to $2,500. I've thought of taking $5k from my return to put towards a used 2014 Honda Accord that's priced at $19k. With the dealerships promotion, we'll be taking $7,500 dollars off the sticker price, so the car will be around $12k final after fees and such. I would then finance the car cost around $12k, preferably a 6 year finance at 3.24 apr. I'm fairly certain that we could make the payments, but what say ye? Should I go forward with this plan? Or should I use my $8k tax return to pay off debts before I think of getting another car? My wife will be able to commute to a job with the additional car. Right now we just have one income. When my wife has a job, most of her income will go towards paying off the new car, we could then focus on paying off the other vehicle when we both have incomes. 
If this isn't wise, please let me know what the best course of action would be. I think paying down debts is important, but I don't know if right now is the best time to pay them down ( you're welcome to correct this opinion).

&gt;College for All: Sen. Sanders has proposed making public colleges and universities tuition-free and substantially reducing student debt, in a plan that would cost about $75 billion a year.
Paid for by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculators that would generate about $300 billion in revenue.

ok, first of all, where did he get the 75 billion number from? americans pay around 200 billion per year on public tuition alone, and those costs are stopping many people who would otherwise go to university or otherwise get more expensive degrees than they normally would, as well as people who would choose free public schooling over paying for private schooling - i wouldnt be surprised if twice as many people went to university if it was free. and universities would have to pay for textbooks, room and board, and living expenses as well? thats hundreds of billions more per year on top of that. also, the plan for paying for it is ridiculous - he openly admits that trading crash 50%? why would it not just move to hong kong or london or something? if they did that, there would be nothing to pay for it at all - look at what happened in sweden when they tried this, trading crashed by 97%

&gt;Youth Jobs Program: Sen. Sanders has proposed a $5.5 billion youth jobs program to create 1 million jobs for disadvantaged young Americans.

&gt;Paid for by ending the carried interest loophole that allows billionaire hedge fund managers to pay a lower tax rate than nurses and truck drivers.

why doesnt he clarify whether the 5.5 billion is per year, over 5 years, over 10 years, or what? can anyone tell me? if its per year the carried interest loophole wouldnt even pay for half of it

&gt;Paid Family and Medical Leave: Sen. Sanders has proposed at least 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave to all workers.
Paid for by a payroll tax that would total $1.61 a week for the typical American worker. According to Sen. Gillibrand’s office, this would be “a self-sufficient program that would not add to the federal budget.”

ok, this is the most glaring one for me. ""at least"" 3 MONTHS of PAID leave would cost... 85$ a year to the average taxpayer? what the fuck? most small businesses run at an incredibly small profit margin, wouldnt cutting their workers hours by a quarter (on top of massively increasing taxes as he plans to do) completely bankrupt most of them?

ethereum,Skuchain - I fear there will be more of these,"Skuchain is a California based startup aiming to put supply chain administration on the blockchain. Let me first of all say that this is a very good idea. I have witnessed firsthand the mess, paperwork piles, red tape, bureaucracy and hair-loss inducing stress that is logistics. Kudos to the Skuchain guys who spotted the opportunity and moved on it.

But is the Skuchain way really the way to do it? The company proposes 'brackets' which will release payment on certain condistions like a container reaching its destination. Bracket is just another word for smart contract.

Also - this is marketed towards larger banks and logistic companies which means the odour of private chain is overwhelming. If there is one industry sector where the superiority of public compared to private chains would be apparent it is logistics.

Let us look at two future worlds:

Scenario A: a morphing, flexible package of smartcontracts handling logistics where interested parties can plug in and interact where needed.

Scenario B: private chains rule.
Supplier has own chain
Logistic supplier A, B, C and D etc have their own chain
Customs authorities have their own chain
Export permit authorities have their own chain
The banks involved have their own chains
and so on it goes...

It goes without saying what would work the best. The only cases where private chains would make sense is for either massive operations like FedEx which could bully subsuppliers and partners to join (and in the process push the system towards public) and for very specialised cases where there is little or no competition (ore transportion, fish transportion in arctic waters, nuclear transportion etc) where the blockchain will simply work to lower cost and hopefully improve quality.

Team analysis: there are eight team members listed on their website, kudos for openess at least. Of these eight exactly zero have any prior experience with logistics. The closest any of them come is a VP that has been involved in a online food ordering service. 

TLDR: thanks to Skuchain for highlighting the benefit of blockchain to the logistics industry. But please use a public blockchain.",cryptocurrency,1456044736

personalfinance,What to do with the house?,"It might be easier to follow if I put the key points as bullets:

* Lost my job in Feb 2015.  I am the primary earner, so wife (W) and I were not able to pay the mortgage starting in February.
* Notified mortgage holder on the day I was laid off.
* It took forever - until September - to get into the HAMP program.  For a variety of very frustrating reasons, we were denied 3x for ""procedural"" issues that were not communicated to us through the process.  Between the 3rd denial and the acceptance into the HAMP program, lender filed foreclosure action in Circuit Court.  
* The foreclosure action is stayed by the lender since we are in the HAMP program.
* We paid our three trial payments under HAMP and just received our loan modification documents from the lender.  Lender is putting the outstanding balance + foreclosure costs on top of the loan, dropping the interest rate, and extending the loan to 30 years.

Sounds great, but here's the problem...

* W and I have decided since then that we would separate/divorce, so we really need to sell the house - not refinance it.
* The house was appraised this month at $497K, but the new loan balance through HAMP will be about $470K.  We have a $26K HELOC as well.  The house is 15 years old, and it needs some repairs ($10K) to make it ""sale worthy"" in this market.  Even if we separate the HELOC and deal with that lender separately, it is likely we will be under water on the house sale (5% commission ~ $25,000 + closing costs).  If we do any repairs to the the house, it will put us even more under at the settlement table.  If we don't do the repairs, it's likely we won't get the $497K sale price.

We know the HELOC is a separate thing, but here are the questions:

1.  Do we refinance the house to stay the foreclosure and then sell it - which would likely mean we would have to bring money we don't have to the settlement table?  
2.  Do we Deed in Lieu with the bank?  What are the credit and other implications?
3.  Do we approach the bank with a short sale option?  What are the implications?
4.  Do we declare bankruptcy and walk away from everything? What are the implications?

The bank has not been communicative - and, obviously, their interests are different from ours.

The impending separation/divorce makes everything more complication, but what are our choices to get out of the house?  (I am having a tough time not honoring our mortgage obligation, but the house could very easily sink us as we try to get out from under it.)

personalfinance,Under grad + Law school = 180K debt. What to prioritize?,"First post here. So as the title indicates I have 180K in debt between undergrad and law school (a lot of undergrad was paid off with federal grants / I had 16K a year scholarship for law school). after graduating law school I took a job in the public sector paying me roughly 60K a year. The point of taking this job is to leverage the overwhelmingly advantageous experience I would gain in a public sector job to obtain a significantly higher paying job in the private sector after 3-5 years. Being in the pubic sector I qualified for an Income Driven Repayment plan allowing me to pay as little as $500 a month toward my student loans. However, this wont even be covering the interest accumulation each month so I plan on paying $1000 /m in order to prevent my loan from growing.

      With the $1000 /m into student loans and my other expenses I can save approximately $1000 a month into saving and still have around $500 a month for discretionary spending for food, gas, going out etc. 

   So my question is: is it wrong for me to be paying just the $1000 a month into student loans in order to free up cash to save for a Ring/Asset down payment? Should I pay the $500/m and just let my loan grow for 3-5 years? I currently have the mentality that student loan debt is a thorn in your side you live with your whole life. When I move to private sector I plan on refinancing and obtaining a plan to pay off the loan over 20-25 years, the theory being, this will keep my repayment bill the same over those years and as my income increases and I start buying income producing property this ""thorn"" will hurt less and less. Is my mentality completely wrong with student loan debt? I know the wiki in the side bar says to pay off loans first but I, along with im sure many other law students, have such a high student loan bill it almost seems impractical to devote all of my money into my loans.

**tl;dr**: whats the better mentality. Paying off student loans as quickly as possible leaving you with no saving/ assets once everything is paid off or do I pay a modest amount into the loan freeing up cash to invest/buy assets etc?

personalfinance,Using a debit card as a credit card,"I often see people on the sub talking about paying for all their purchases with a credit card (and paying off the balance each month) and how that is much more secure than a debit card - but why does no one bring up using a debit card as a credit card?

I have a debit card through my credit union that is a Visa branded card. I use it for all my purchases, the money come out of my checking account, but I have it processed as a credit card rather than debit. Because it is backed by Visa, it provides the same protection and warranties on purchases that a credit card offers. 

Since I have it processed as a credit card every time I use it, there is a 1 -2 day delay between when I make a purchase and when the money is actually deducted from my checking account. During that lag period, the purchases show up as ""pending transactions,"" so I can catch any fraudulent charge and report it to my credit union before the charges hit my account. This has happened to me once (in almost 15 years of doing this)- although the credit union caught it before I did and contacted me. They fixed it before the funds ever left my account.

I do have one actual credit card through my credit union with a very low interest rate and no annual fees. It provides some cash back for travel purchases, so I use that for traveling when it is harder to keep tabs on my account.

I prefer using my debit card because I only want to deal with one account, I don't want to have to keep track of interest rates/annual fees/enrollment for rewards, etc. And I would inevitably forget to pay off a balance sometimes and have to deal with interest or late fees on a credit card. I like the simplicity of this set up.

personalfinance,Why do people have savings accounts? I still don't understand.,"Before anyone says read the wiki, I did. All I could find about savings was 

&gt;An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. Unexpected travel, essential appliance replacement, and sudden medical proceduresare all user-submitted examples of emergency funds in action. If you need to draw from your emergency fund at any time, your first priority as soon as you get back on your feet should be to replenish it. Treat your emergency fund right and it will return the favor.

&gt;How should I size my emergency fund?

&gt;For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund (e.g., 9 to 12 months) may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. A smaller emergency fund of $1,000 or 1 month of expenses is temporarily acceptable while paying off credit card debt or other debts with interest rates above 10%. Read Figuring the Size of Your Emergency Fund for more.

&gt;What kind of account should I hold my emergency fund in?

&gt;Generally emergency funds should be held in safe investments you can liquidate in a hurry. FDIC-insured savings or checking accounts are the most common choice. CDs and I-bonds can be used too. Things that should not be used include stocks, credit cards, HELOCs, or anything that is volatile in value or that can be taken away without warning (such as lines of credit). Read the FAQ section on emergency funds for more.

..

What I don't understand is 

&gt;An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch

Yes. But is there any specific reason I need to open a savings account to do so? Why can't I just leave that sum in my checking account and spend around it? 

Example: if I have 3000 in my bank and I set my savings goal as 2500, then okay. I'll only spend 500 dollars of my 3000. I didn't need a special account to be able to do that. 

""Savings accounts are no fee accounts"" well my bank account charges nothing except 3 dollars a month for membership, and like once a year they give me a 15 dollar reward for staying with them. so that doesn't effect my savings goal. 

""Savings account accrue interest"" yeah like 1 dollar a year. I'd contribute more to my savings if I picked up change off of the street or if I cleaned out my mom's old purses that she doesn't bother to throw away or take all of the loose change out of. 

""If you lost your wallet and your card got stolen at least your entire funds wouldn't be on that one single account"". 
My wallet only goes in my pocket or on my nightstand. The moment it's gone I'll call my bank and lock my account. No one is getting my money.

I would elaborate on each, but this question deals specifically with my school financial aid refund check. 

I enrolled in classes this past year, but don't have a solid idea of what I want to do. As I work full time, I didn't feel it was a good idea to take a full course load (also not my question ;)), and so I have recently been informed that I have an $875 refund available at my disposal.

The credit card: due to a series of unfortunate events, I accrued $4000 of credit card debt at a high interest rate (think upwards of 20%). By the start of this year, I had worked it down to around d $3200. I no longer use this credit card. 

After filing my taxes, I used my entire tax return to pay $800 off on the card, and intend to try to pay at least double the minimum to continue to chip away at the debt.  The process is slow, but it is as much as I can do with my other bills. 

 My end goal is to file for a loan through my bank when my credit score raises around 50 more points, which will of course cause a small negative hit, and use that loan to pay off the credit card, as itwill have a much lower interest rate and be paid off at least 3x faster than if I were to keep paying my current interest rate. 

Now my question, I was planning to take some classes over the summer. My school refund would cover these... or it would be another $800 payment to go towards my credit card. I am going to be eligible for financial aid for next year's classes, so that's not a concern. 

Should I use the refund for more classes and keep making steady c.c. payments? Or should I apply it to my credit card and take the summer off, continuing my studies in the fall? Or should I do a split-some classes and some c.c. payment?

personalfinance,pay sudden large credit cards using consolidation debt vs. mutual funds?,"Thank you all very much for your analysis, and it is a privilege and a pleasure to read your work in this subreddit. I hope this is not too verbose, but just enough.

I’m considering shopping for consolidation loans or cards to reduce unusually high credit card interest vs. paying some from my mutual fund investments.  I got a “preapproval” loan offer, for whatever it’s worth, from Prosper for $35,000 at an unknown rate and I don’t know anything about what’s out there. I don’t know what I can get with a 614 score and 72% utilization, but please let me know where to try. I guess I can look at creditkarma and bankrate. I was considering applying for one or two of those, just to say I tried it before considering my mutual funds.

My total debt is $16,560 out of a possible $23,100, 72% utilization, costing about $200/mo in interest. My February 2016 Transunion credit score is 614 of 800 and Equifax credit score is 613 of 800, having dropped due to high utilization for medical surprises since summer 2015. I will submit an Equifax dispute against three old delinquent credit card payments where I’d misunderstood the minimum amount by $10/mo while auto-paying. I’ve already removed some.

Income is at least $2300/mo with no savings anymore, but I'm selling stuff. Fixed base living expenses are fairly optimized at $1100/mo plus ongoing medical expenses of $700/mo and about $200/mo in interest, plus variable expenses like food, etc, so I'll be wiped for a few months yet to go. I still have ongoing medical expenses which I hope to end in the next few months, so I’m only paying the minimum on debt lately.

I have $50,000 in Oppenheimer mutual funds, about to be reconfigured to a moderate risk at a projected 6% APY, give or take, lol, auto-reinvested into itself. I have always kept Oppenheimer separate from my cashflow and debt, to protect it from such volatility (or my lack of confidence), but I can reconsider using it to pay some debt.  I just wasn’t thinking of it as simply as just comparing interest rates, but rather as two firewalled worlds. I can withdraw at any time via mailed check on a week’s turnaround, and I have withdrawn $2000 now to pay my Sears card. I didn’t want to risk treating the investment goal as another debt to pay back if I was to use it to pay off credit cards, but I should eventually pay into the fund it monthly when debt-free.

I normally am totally debt-free every year or two, for about half a year at a time, other than Christmases and then summer 2015’s major medical expenses which I still carry. For example, most recently in April 2015, before the medical stuff, I was debt-free with $6000 in savings and an all time high 725 of 800 credit score. I had been using my Sears credit card with a non-revolving balance only for the purpose of churning reward points. I presently have a $750-1000 Sears or Kmart gift card waiting.

personalfinance,[Auto Loan] Pre-paying Car Loan If Planning to Sell - Math doesn't add up,"I have a mix of student loan debt (11k @ various interest rates) and an auto loan (11k @ 5.74% @ 5 years @ $228/month). In planning how to pay down my loans, I've come across a question that I can't answer/prove.

After I pay down all my higher interest rate student loan debt, does paying down my auto loan at an accelerated rate really save me money if I'm planning to sell the car after three years?

Clearly I'll pay less in interest over the first three years. I'll also build a higher amount of equity in the vehicle. However, since the car will probably depreciate 5-6k in the next three years, have I really saved money? In other words is (Interest Saved + Equity) &gt; (Depreciation + Maintenance Costs).

I'm thinking that I'd rather pay the extra $500 in interest and focus my money on my lower interest student debt. I don't think my car will hold the value of the additional equity, so it's just going out the window.

I've tried building excel models and I can't come to a conclusive answer, so thought I'd ask you guys. In fact, my model (probably incorrect) shows that I LOSE money by paying down the loan faster. Hope you can help.",finance,1456093032

personalfinance,Can anyone provide advice on filing taxes as married filing separately vs. married filing jointly?,"Let me apologize now if this isn't the correct place to ask this question.

My SO and I have always filed as married filing jointly. However, due to our substantial student loan burden, it was suggested that we file separately this year. I used the federal student loan website's payment calculator, and it looks like this would bring our monthly loan payments (under an IBR plan) from $200 and $400 ($600 total) down to $0, which is obviously a huge savings. 

Filing separately makes me nervous, however, for a couple of reasons. We moved to a new state in July, and our current state is a community property state. Frankly, I don't really know what that means or what effect it will have, other than an additional step in the filing process. We also moved from an income tax state to a non-income tax state, but I don't think that will make any difference (am I wrong?). We would be losing the $2500 student loan interest deduction, and I don't know if we would be able to deduct moving expenses. Then, after using the IRS calculator, it looks like I will owe about $200, and I assume my SO will owe the same. 

Obviously, if our loan payments really are reduced to $0, this would be a huge savings, and outweigh the lost deductions and owed taxes. But I'm still nervous. Does anyone have any advice or experience with filing separately to save on student loan payments?

For reference, we make nearly identical wages (~$33k each) and have nearly identical federal student loan debt ($25k).",finance,1456110302

I am Denis Wirtz of Johns Hopkins University, where I wear two hats: Vice Provost for Research and T.H. Smoot Professor in the schools of engineering and medicine. I also direct the Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences-Oncology Center and co-direct the Cancer Nanotechnology Training Center, both funded by the National Cancer Institute, and serve as associate director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for NanoBioTechnology.


As a faculty member, my lab conducts research in cancer: specifically, we are trying to determine the physical and biological underpinnings of metastatic disease, by far the primary cause of death in cancer patients. For example, my group was the first to establish how a 3-dimensional environment (think a 3D matrix) fundamentally affects the way cancer cells migrate, providing us with much more biologically and medically-relevant information than 2D studies (think Petri dishes) routinely used in the lab. Subsequent studies of the tumor microenvironment in simplified systems have increased our understanding of how cancer cells (we focus on pancreatic, breast, and ovarian cancer) migrate, morph, and are modulated by mechanical forces during metastasis. Our research has led me to re-evaluate what makes cancer lethal, often drug-resistant, and prone to recurrence after tumor removal. In the future, I am proposing a paradigm shift on how to diagnose tumors and develop new drugs, complementing the more mainstream genetic approaches. This is pertinent to US investments (biotech, big pharma, and federal agencies) in cancer treatments.


In my other role as VP for Research, I work with my divisional colleagues to oversee all research at Johns Hopkins University, the largest recipient of federal funding in the US. In that capacity, I direct the Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships, the President’s Frontier Award, research development, interdivisional research awards programs, improvements in research infrastructure, compliance and policies, etc. I have been particularly eager to help junior faculty (due to the current funding environment) and to promote collaborative, multidisciplinary research.

So here's our situation. My husband and I have about $100K in our savings right now. We would really love to purchase a house this year but want a second opinion on whether our financial goals are prioritized correctly.

My credit score is 650.

We don't want to wait much longer with the house buying, as mortgage rates are still low and it's still a 'hot' time to buy. But is it worth waiting for to pay off other high balances? Or are those interest rates low enough that we can afford to pay them off after we buy a house?

The financing we have requires we put down 20% to get an interest rate of 3.25%, so our total expenditure would be around 49k. To finance renovations, our mortgage broker suggested we take out a 2nd mortgage with a credit union since their rates for the 10-15% of our home equity we would be borrowing would be in the 3.5-4% range. The other option is to open up a equity line of credit for just the amount we need for repairs. The rate would 2.5% but only fixed until the end of 2017.

Which mortgage should we choose?

Here is the situation. We are buying a condo with a minimal down payment (5%). I have 2 mortgage offers. One is a 7 year ARM at 3.25% with only $499 in closing costs. The other is a 4% 30-year fixed with $2500 more in closing costs. However, that one does not require PMI, so the payment is $15 less per month. I am not attracted by that. All else being equal, I would prefer a 30-year fixed of course. But there is something I overlooked until just now. The 30-year fixed payment is not only $15 less a month, but $60 more of the payment is going toward P&amp;I (because PMI is $75) than on the other. Will that make much difference, or is it offset by the interest rate difference? 

A few more details to anticipate clarifying questions. The purchase price is $149,900. I think we will likely live there for around 5 to 7 years or maybe 15, but probably not longer.  We will likely pay ahead of schedule, hopefully aggressively so.

personalfinance,To people who have paid cash (over $17k) for a car,"To those of you out there who bought a car (over $17,000) by paying cash rather than financing, are you happy with your decision?

This of course assumes that you'd get financing at a fairly low interest rate.

But the cars my husband and I are considering are in the $17,000-23,000 range, and while we have saved enough money to pay in cash, it feels like a lot of money to spend all at once on a depreciating asset.

Other information that might be pertinent: 

* I am currently self-employed and do not make that much.

* I do not have a completed degree because my initial diagnosis of epilepsy disorder and introduction to Clonazepam really set me back and caused me to leave school in the first place.

* My degree was in Psychology/Neuroscience but I did not get far enough to have enough qualification for any job in the field.

I am very scared of my situation.  I am scared of how it will affect me personally and the long-term relationship I am in.  I do not know what to do.  Any and all help is greatly appreciated.",finance,1456170841

personalfinance,"I'm less than a year out of college, making more than my parents, and am trying to make my first budget.","So the title is pretty straight forward.  I'm 22 years old, ~9 months out of school (May 2015 grad) and am moving to Ohio to start my second job.  My first job was around my home in PA and I was making pretty good money, but I wasn't happy.  This job pays me 70,000 and I want to be able to budget so all my parent's sacrifices for me over the years don't go to waste.

I've done some quick budgeting where since I haven't exactly moved yet I'm trying to overbudget.  So if some of these expenses seem high, it's because I want them to be.  I'd rather have more than enough set aside than not enough.

I tried to follow the 50/30/20 rule and separate things into categories of Essentials, Personal Choices, and Financial Obligations.  However, I have drastically high student loan payments from my bachelor's degree because I went to a private college, wasn't able to get government subsidies, and had high interest rate loans because my parents had bad credit.  Right now I'm refinanced for $80,000 over 20 years.  It comes out to around $650 a month.  I don't regret going to school where I did and the money it cost though because it led me to the position I'm in today, which is better than most my age.  It's just a debt I hope to pay off sooner rather than later.

But I digress - here's my financials.

I'm expecting due to the over-budgeting to have more money in my monthly savings which will hopefully push that total closer to 40%  I'm planning on paying a little more ($100 or so) a month on my student loans until I build up a nice safety net of $10k (I have $7k in the bank right now)  and then try to push as much money into my student loans as possible.

Would I be right to do that?  Or is there another way I should be going about attacking my student loan debt with my savings?

personalfinance,Home Renovation Funding Flexibility Question,"My wife and I are about to get bids in the final planning stages for a home addition + renovation project.  We are fortunate to have a sliding window of options for paying for said project:

- Liquidate post-tax investment account equities and pay with cash.  This would wipe clean most of the balance.  Tax-advantaged account balances would be untouched and our per-month savings rate back into the post-tax account would be untouched.

- Cash-out refinance.  Per-month savings rate would be reset significantly (near zero).  Post-tax balance would be untouched and free to grow.  

We are in year four of a 17 year mortgage now and if we refi we are thinking that we would refinance down to a 15 year mortgage (our retirement goal date is approx 15 years away).  If we pay with cash we would be essentially wiping our post-tax equity balance. My initial reaction to this option is that it would be best to borrow as much as possible in order to leave that post-tax balance in play given that interest rates are very low (less than 3% on a 15 year fixed refi).  However at the same time taking on that additional debt burden would lower our monthly savings contribution significantly.  

I'm a personalcapital.com user and what gave me pause was attempting to model these two options on their retirement planner application.  To my surprise it heavily favored paying with cash and maintaining our monthly savings rate compared to borrowing the funds at the expense of reducing our post-tax saving rate.  

Neither of these options would touch our tax-advantaged balances.  I'm really just trying to understand the pros and cons.  What would you do?

Ally I've used for my savings for a few months, but for reasons I would rather not get into, I found myself less than pleased with their service and want to move.

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Question,"Hi - looking for some guidance regarding a potential mortgage refinance. 

Wife and I bought a townhome 4 years ago with an FHA loan and 3.5% down. We paid $186k for the home, and current LTV is around 89%. Interest rate on the loan is 4.25%. We've since moved into another house, which is now our primary residence, and we still own the townhome. We currently rent it out. 

The home has increased pretty significantly in value, up to around $239k based on a recent (two weeks ago) appraisal. Would love to use this to somehow have PMI removed. However, our current loan means LTV is calculated on purchase price, so mortgage co won't take an appraisal. 

Refinance options include a higher rate, since this is now an investment property. Rate would go up from 4.25% to 4.5%, but we'd lower term from 26 years remaining to 25 years remaining, and monthly payment would go down $90. 

We could either save money to accumulate enough equity to have it removed automatically (would need around $18k), or refi to remove PMI and take a year off the loan, but pay more in interest. 

Trying to wrap my head around what this might mean in the short/medium/long term for this property. I'd say it's unlikely we actually hold onto it for the next 25-26 years, so removing the PMI and reducing the term of the mortgage is attractive, but I don't know if that makes sense if we plan to hold onto it longer term.

The average American Taxpayer refund is $3,000. All things being equal, that is $3,000 that you over paid. Questions, Could you do a better job of managing that $3,000 (which is $250 a month that you currently do not have)?

If this is you, and there are no other unexpected ""taxable"" events, bonuses, sale of house, etc., you can talk to your HR department about increasing the number of dependents you claim n your W-4. The common misconception is that ""Dependents"" equals lives that depend on you. That is not necessarily the case. If are married and have two children, claiming yourself and 3 dependents and consistently receive a large tax refund - it's math! You have too much in taxes being withheld. Tax to your tax person (Disclaimer: I am nit a tax person, nor give tax advice) and HR person about moderately adjusting your W-4 so as to Increase your take-home yay, and Decrease what you are overpaying in taxes.

personalfinance,Do the circumstances of my job make a 6-month emergency fund unnecessary? Should I pay off my student loan or use that chunk of money to have a bigger down payment on a house? So confused.,"Hello! I need some advice, please.  I don’t know how to meet my goals, or how to prioritize my goals, for that matter. Sorry for the length of the post, but I figured too much information would be better than not enough.
The bottom line is that I want to buy a house.  (I’m renting right now.) I also need to pay off my student loan.  Finally, I know that I am going to need a new car sooner rather than later. I am just not sure in what order I should pursue these things. (And of course, I know that I need to maintain some sort of emergency fund.)

I recently inherited about $13,000.  This is a large enough sum in my life that I feel like I can move out of saving, saving, saving mode and into action mode.  I am just not sure what action to take.  

For a little background, I am a divorced 35-year-old with no children.  I have a bankruptcy on my record from 2011 thanks to my ex-husband’s antics, but I have built my credit back up to a credit score of 704.  I have no credit card debt. I rent my home. My car is paid off. 

I am a public employee.  This means I have good health insurance and a guaranteed pension that my employer and I both contribute to.  (Of course, the pension is only guaranteed provided that the government doesn’t reneg…but that’s a whole separate conversation.)

Including my recent windfall, I have $26,500 in savings.  My take-home pay is $3200/month.
Here are my monthly expenses:


Rent $825


Cable/Internet $105


Phone $85


Gas (for heat) $60


Electric $55


Gas (for car) $100


Food/pet supplies/toiletries/etc $300 


Student Loan $135 


Total $1665


Here are my questions and concerns: 


1.	I know I need just under 10,000 for a 6-month emergency fund, but reserving this much will clearly deplete my savings substantially and not allow me to do the other things I want to do. My question is, do I really need a whole 6 months’ worth? Since I am a public employee under a union contract, if I am legitimately sick/injured, as long as I have proof from a doctor that I can’t be at work, I will continue to get paid and to receive my insurance benefits until I run out of sick days.  I have approximately 150 sick days banked.  It seems like maybe 2 or 3 months of an emergency fund should be enough?


2.	I have a student loan. The payoff is $5,900.  It seems like it would be a no-brainer to just pay it off, but like I said, I want to buy a house.  And the loan only has a 1.875% fixed interest rate. So I don’t know if it would be better to keep paying the monthly payments on the student loan and use the larger sum of money for a down payment on a house or not. 


3.	My car is paid off, but it is a 10-year-old Honda Civic.  It has about $125,000 miles on it. I have no qualms driving the thing until it dies, but still, it is getting elderly, and that is a concern.


4.	All things considered, would I be in better shape just to pay off the loan, trade in my car while it still has some value, get a new (used) car, and hold off on the house for the time being? Or should I pay off the loan and go for the house with the remainder? Or should I just go for the house and keep paying off the loan incrementally?  And how much of an emergency fund is really necessary for me?


OK, I realize that last question was actually several questions…but still.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance.",finance,1456195861

personalfinance,"Buying a House From my Dad, is Our Mortgage Broker Being Honest?","Hey PF, 

Long time lurker, first time poster. I love what you guys do here.

Background:
Houston TX
Credit Score: ~800
Income: 90 - 110K

I'm in a situation where I believe the best course of action is for me to buy a house from my dad's investment property portfolio. I'm currently already living in the house ever since the last tenets moved out years ago and paying everything from mortgage to repairs to taxes (I know). I'm young and have never bought a house before.

The house:
Appraised: ~145K (appraisal pending this is an estimate equal to what my dad paid pre-great recession)
Principal left: 88K
Monthly payment of 610 @ 5.761%

Our mortgage broker/property manager who my dad has known for many years recommended that my dad sell me the house for 125K with a 25K down payment that will circle back to me. 

To summarize the strategy, I'm buying the house from him, tapping into (12K minus closing) equity for home repairs and using the down payment to avoid PMI(flag). My dad, once in receipt of the ~35K will turn it around and give it back to me so I can return 25K to my daughter's college fund and use the ~10K for home renovations.

The new Loan:
Loan amount: 100K / 15 years
Interest Rate (unlocked, awaiting appraisal): 3.25 - 3.5% / 707 per. mo.

He gave a couple of other options such as my dad refinancing and adding me to the deed, or just waiting it out. But my dad feels strongly that since I've poured as much money into this property as I have, that it should solely belong to me in the event of any inheritance dispute or lawsuit against him, without going into any details, it isn't an unreal threat.

Something about this doesn't sit well with me. First thing, my 25k down payment. I've scraped blood and sweat to put together around 25K for my daughters college fund. I do not feel easy withdrawing it from the safe MMKT account to let it float around while various party's take a cut, even if its really from the equity. I trust my dad to give me the money, but is there a way I can keep all if not most of the money in the account while still avoiding PMI? 

Secondly, our mortgage broker made it seem that they need the entire 20% for me to avoid PMI, nevermind what the house is actually worth. My argument is if the house is worth lets say 150k, with a sale price of 125K, isn't there already 20% built in equity which would excuse me from PMI? in other words, why do I need to make a down payment on a sale that already guarantees the bank a 20% return in the event of a foreclosure?

What are the tax implications of this strategy? I don't want this money subjected to any tax. I'm really confused and stressed because the ball is already rolling, and I am not as mentally secure in this decision as I'd like to be. It didn't help that when I was signing mortgage application papers, the broker was just showing me where to sign like 20 pages, while he chatted with my dad and seemed to be agitated that I was stopping to read. ""just sign them"" said my dad. 

Maybe I'm just looking for a warm fuzzy feeling that this is the best option and that my daughter's money will be safe from any taxes.

I have a bunch of signals that I'm trying to predict a future rare event off of, which I know is possible and somewhat trivial (trend is a big indicator).

I want to train an LSTM as a PoC. The strategies I have tried are overlapping windows, separate windows with and without timestamps of varying length and shuffled or not, class-weighting and not, fed into a one layer LSTM w/ dropout into a Fully Connected layer and then out into binary sigmoid layer. Currently I am only trying to classify sequences that contain the event, but ultimately the goal would be to see if I can predict the event prior to it occurring (presumably by labelling prior samples in some window as positive).

personalfinance,Working Canadian with an American husband in student loan default: looking for advice or feedback,"Hello, as the title states I'm Canadian, still living in Canada, unfamiliar with American laws about student loans, and a year ago I married an American.

I knew at the time he had student loans with both the federal government and private lenders. He graduated in May of 2014 and worked a few term positions following graduation. When we married he had just finished a term position and was looking for new employment. He has not found employment since. He has cut his spending to the necessities: moved back in with family, no payments for any luxuries or travel, and only paying for cell and Internet to further his job search. Monthly expenses are under $150, which I am sending funds for. He is conducting a full time job hunt for any job he is qualified for in public transit range.

The issue here is his student loan debt, in the neighborhood of $29k after interest in the last year (he told me $24k when we first started looking at it last spring). I trusted him to look after his debts, but I know that this is something that will definitely affect both of us in the future and I want to help. I left it longer than I should have, as I kept hoping he would find some kind of job, but every lead has come up a dead-end.

He hasn't contacted his lenders, and I'm asking him to do so but I don't know if he will qualify for loan rehabilitation or consolidation without his own income. From what I've read he will need to make 3+ consecutive, voluntary, on-time, full monthly payments before he can even look at consolidation. Can he start making payments again after he's in default?

I have a reasonably well-paying, secure position in Canada (as secure as any position can be) with low living expenses. I can afford to send more than what his loan payments were monthly before entering default while still meeting all of my own obligations and maintaining an emergency fund. I do not have the funds to send the full lump sum of his current student loan debt, although I can save up most of it in a year or look at borrowing.

I see people in this forum often discussing student loans, and I feel like our situation is probably straight-forward, but I don't have other Americans to discuss this with similar experiences.

I'm not saying that I simply want to put my student loans on my credit card. BUT let's say I was going to pay $200 a month on my student loans. Wouldn't it be smarter to put $2400 on my credit card and make payments of $200 a month to my Credit card company? This way I'm shaving $2400 off the principal, and considering my interest on the loan is 11%, I would be saving hundreds in interest.

Again, I would be paying the same amount that I would normally pay, and I would pay off the credit card before interest would accrue. Is this a good idea? Bad idea? Anything I'm missing? I'm open to suggestions.

Quick edit: My plan is to use the credit cards for everyday expenses (I've been very vigilant in my budgeting) and take my income and put it directly towards the loans. So I wouldn't be using my credit card for the loans per se, but indirectly I would be. Then when I've paid $2400 I will pay off $200 a month, a few months before the interest rate goes back up.

That's all that's happening here.

Yes it could get ugly for a while. 

The death of Core/Blockstream could get as ugly as the death of MtGox. 

In both cases, people trusted a centralized institution which thought that it could control Bitcoin forever.

And then that centralized institution was revealed to everybody as incompetent and corrupt and rotten to the core.

People who had placed their trust in that centralized institution got hurt bad - but the people who hadn't trusted that institution, came out fine.

If you're part of the crowd that's been complaining about Core/Blockstream for these many months - that's the same as being part of the crowd that was complaining about about MtGox for many months.

Consider yourself one of the informed. Just like the people who didn't trust MtGox, the people who don't trust Core/Blockstream will emerge unscathed after this crisis is past.

But people who trust Core/Blockstream are gonna get hurt:

As long as people continue to trust Core/Blockstream, the network will start to get clogged, and the price could crash - or just stay flat, as Bitcoin's expected price rise due to the halving, collapsing fiat financial markets, NIRP (negative interest rate policy from governments and banks) etc. gets cancelled out by Core/Blockstream's stalling and incompetence.

personalfinance,2 years later UPDATE: Need to buy a house within 6 months (Pregnant). Trying to quickly improve credit score.,"[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1vtetl/need_to_buy_a_house_within_6_months_pregnant/)

I always love updates, so I figured I would share mine. 

So, after I was torn apart in my original thread, my boyfriend and I sat down and discussed feasibility. We decided to put buying a house on hold for awhile. We didn't wait as long as we had originally determined because we got back our interest rate and it wasn't as bad as some people had predicted. Additionally, my dad pointed out that we could always refinance.  I ran the numbers 15 different ways and looked at our budget from all angles and decided that while it financially may be better to wait, we could afford it if it was our priority. After sorting everything out, we started shopping, and we bought a house in July when I was 5 months pregnant.

**So, here are our current stats:**

House Cost: 275k with 5k in closing costs credit

Original Interest Rate: 4.75%

Refinanced September 2015 Interest Rate: 4.025%

PMI: $150

Down Payment: 25k (Just under 10%)

Current Equity: 16%

Current Credit Scores:

* Me- 780
* Him- 670

Income: 

* Me- 63k plus ~10% bonus (as of December 2015. Prior to that, I had one raise in May 2014 so 45k to 50k)
* Him- ~90k (contingent on work-- he's a welder)

Savings: 15k 

Retirement: I'll be honest-- I'm not sure about this one because his pension complicates things. Mine has 28k and I plan start putting into a Roth IRA this year. His has much much more between his 401k and pension. 

A note on the credit scores-- they pretty much immediately recovered when we started to pay a mortgage. My husband's is low still because when we transferred him to my cell phone family plan right around when we bought the house, there was a residual bill that he was not notified of (it went to our old apartment), and it went to collections. That was a very nasty surprise when we went to refinance, and cost us our 3.75% interest rate that we thought we were going to get. I now am our CFO and manage all the bills, so we shouldn't have anything slipping through the cracks anytime soon. His score should make a full recovery soon enough. 

**Key Takeaways:**

I think if I could do it all again, I would still buy our house. We got a great deal and honestly I haven't seen a house cheaper than 300k in our area since we bought it, outside of ones that needed to be gutted. We are 6 blocks from my parents, have a huge yard, and my walk to the train is 7 minutes. In the span of just over a year, we bought a house, had a baby, and got married. I'm excited to have some of the most expensive things in my life finished, and we are saving a ton of money each month now. 

Personal finance has been a great help to me over the years but I will say that in that scenario, knowing what I know now, I didn't think that the answers were necessarily helpful nor entirely accurate. I'd say people got caught up in their opinions of my stress and relationship rather than the financial aspects. The decision to buy a house was easily feasible with our finances, but not necessarily a perfect financial decision. I'd happily pay the price all over again to end up in this house. 

What would have been more helpful towards making a decision: 

* understanding that PMI increases with lower down payment and credit scores
* info on closing costs (I had NO idea how much they were)
* info on how long it takes for credit scores to recover-- if I knew that I could make improvements in a year, I may have been more likely to wait

Overall, I'm thankful that people pushed me to think the decision through more and to really do an in depth financial analysis. Ironically, that analysis led me to increase our budget, because I realized that we were way below 30% of our gross with our initial budget. We didn't like the first batch of houses we saw, and increasing our budget allowed us to see houses that were exactly what we wanted and that we'd actually be willing to stay in for long term. 

**Current Questions**

* College fund-- it seems like the 529b is the right way to go. Are there any major downsides that I'm missing?
* Grocery bills-- we are averaging 1k per month. We eat organic and buy fancy coffee, but that's it. Anyone have tips for planning meals/shopping successfully without any extreme couponing/going to 5 stores would be appreciated. For instance-- buying meat on sale and vacuum sealing for deep freezing-- is that financially efficient?
* For equivalent cash value, are points better on CCs, or miles? I would make use of either, so I'm just trying to get the best bang for my buck. 
* Also for CCs-- are their any cards that reward more or are better for someone who spends say 30k-50k per year? We put *everything* on CC (and pay it off each month) so I'm just trying to make sure that is optimized. 
* For taxes-- our income last year put us in the bracket where we no longer got the child tax credit. I would have to put 9k into my traditional IRA to be eligible again-- is that worth it? The credit is 4k...


Thanks PF... I read posts pretty much daily and I've learned a lot. Again, I don't think that purchasing my house was a financially smart decision, but it was easily feasible and it made sense for our priorities. We will soon have our PMI gone (paying extra each month) and at that point I'll be satisfied with our mortgage.

personalfinance,How can I check that my Roth 401(k) is accurately reflected on my pay statement?,"Hello, hopefully the answer to this is as simple as I think it is in my head. Please let me know if I'm looking at this incorrectly. I am trying to make sure that my 401(k) contributions are being made after-tax and not pre-tax.

Test:
I am comparing two pay statements (through ADP) that are the same in every way, except that the % contribution of Roth 401(k) is higher in statement A than in statement B. My federal income tax (in dollars, not %) is the same on both statements. Can I conclude from that observation that my contributions are correctly being calculated as after- and not pre-tax?

For instance, if I had been making pre-tax contributions, then I would have instead observed a *higher* federal income tax in statement B. Is that correct?

A bank offered me a Career Assistance Program loan. Basically, a little over $4000. If I apply for it, I can knock out at least three cards. One with a balance of $500, one with a balance of $1200 and the other with a balance of $1400. That leaves me around $900 to put on my next lowest balance. 

However, with a loan comes a repayment plan. This plan has a relatively low interest rate and will cost me around $83 a month. The good side of this is the $83 is actually a premium towards a $250,000 life insurance policy. One I pay the loan off, I can choose to continue the policy or end it. So it's not like I'm not getting anything back. However, I'm just concern about taking on additional debt, even though a $83 dollars a month would wipe out $300 a month.

personalfinance,Buy a cheap home or rent for 5 years?,"My wife and I (no kids, not expecting to have any for several years) are looking to move when I go to grad school this coming fall. We will both be college graduates and between my stipend and her work, we will be making ~50-60k.

Renting an apartment in the area that we are interested in would cost at least $800 a month, but probably closer to $1000 before utilities. 

We are considering buying a small house in the 30-50k range (which in the area are approximately the same size or slightly larger than the aforementioned apartments and have garages, yards, etc.). 

Assuming $800/mo rent, renting would cost us $48000 over 5 years (best case scenario)

I done some calculations and it seems like it would be much more beneficial financially to buy a small house. Lets say we buy a 50k house and pay 10% on closing costs. Our credit is pretty good, I think 5% would be a slight overestimate on our interest rate. From my research on property taxes, we should be paying about 3% annually on the value of the house (in the midwest, does this value look reasonable?) and the average homeowners insurance is 600, but lets round up to $800/yr. Since it's a cheap home, we would expect to have to replace some things and maintain them ~5%/year seems reasonable (if you don't think it is, let me know). 

We're aware of the risk of not being able to sell the house when I graduate, but since she will be working, this shouldn't be an issue. For the sake of a worst case scenario, let's say we take a 20% loss in the value of the house on resale, and then pay a 10% closing fee on that.

The calculations for all of the above, assuming a 50k house are below: 

Item|Cost
:---|---:
Price of home | $50000
Closing costs | $5000
5% Interest over 5 yrs | $6600
Property taxes over 5 yrs | $7500
HO Insurance over 5 yrs | $4000
Maintenance 5%/yr 5yrs | $12500
Resale of home at 20% loss | -$40000
Closing costs | $4000
**TOTAL** | **$49600**

I designed these calculations around best case scenario renting and the pretty bad, but not quite worst case of homeownership and the total cost of renting, $48000, is only slightly less than the cost of buying, $49600. 

There are other houses on Zillow that are 40k and 30k too. A 40k house with these calculations would cost ~40k and a ~30k, which are a good deal below the cost of renting. Some of the apartments we have looked at are about $1000/mo, which brings the cost of renting to 60k, widening the gap between renting and buying even more.

It seems like such a clear-cut choice to buy. Am I missing something? It seems like there should be a catch. One thing is that most people who have posted about this are looking at buying $250k houses and having the same or slightly greater price of rent, so for them renting is the way to go.

personalfinance,Possible tax fraud,"I'm going to try to supply these details as best I can without being too confusing.

Yesterday I received an email from H&amp;R Block indicating that my account had been created. Only....I didn't create an account. After due diligence of making sure this wasn't an email phishing attempt I contacted H&amp;R Block's 800 customer service number and expressed my concern. The representative asked if I had worked with H&amp;R block previously. I had, in 2014, and years prior, but not the last couple of years. 

She said that whoever I had worked with previously probably just created an H&amp;R block account for me as they sometimes do this to try to drum up business.

Hm....maybe, I guess? Still seemed sketchy.

An hour later I received an email from H&amp;R Block Online - ""Your federal return has been submitted"".

It had ""my"" account username which was myfirstnamemylastname3 and billing information for another individual which included their first and last name as well as an address (we'll call the person Jane Doe). It also had an order confirmation number for the return that was filed using H&amp;R Block's online utilities, and a charge to this person's credit/debit card in the amount of $9.99.

I googled the person's name and address and found a few phone numbers. Two of them were not legitimate numbers, and one just rang and rang. When I was googling I also noticed that someone with my first and last name (A very uncommon combination, mind you) was listed as residing at this address.

After this I reached out to my guy at H&amp;R block from 2013 and years prior that I had worked with. He asked me to forward him the email that I received and he'd look into it. Fast forward a couple of hours and he reached back out to me. He was able to have one of his tech support folks look at the order number in the email and found that the SSN used for the return was nowhere nearly close to mine.

Here's what I think happened. I think this ""Jane Doe"" submitted her taxes online on H&amp;R block, and perhaps mistakenly provided the wrong email address. My actual email address is just firstnamelastname@whatever.com. So perhaps there actually is another individual that lives at this address with my first and last name and this other person that filed used the email address for the person that shares my name....only they forgot a letter or a number...and lo I received the emails.

I just wanted to run this all by you fine folks in the event you have any further recommendations.

I discovered that there's a form you have to send the IRS with your legitimate tax refund if you suspect that someone has stolen your identity and fraudulently claimed your tax refund, so I'm wondering if I should go ahead and fill out that form and send it in, or if, given my particular scenario, that's not worth pursuing.

Edit: I should have noted - I did attempt to log onto the account that was created at H&amp;RBlock online, but I didn't know the password, and the steps to get a password reset require verification answers to be submitted - obviously I didn't create the questions, so I didn't know the answers.

Edit: TL;DR

Called H&amp;R block, they said ""np bro, an H&amp;R block rep probably created the account since you used H&amp;Rblock in the past"".

Got ahold of old rep I worked with at H&amp;R block, he had a tech person track down the order in the email I'd received and said the SSN doesn't match mine.

personalfinance,Need advice about Tax Returns and Student Loans,"A parent ncosigned on a student loan for me, which they had defaulted on, but got back into good standing through the loan rehabilitation program. They had made a solid ten months of payments and got the loan out of defaulted status as of 1/29/2016 at which point the loan was handed off from ECMC to Navient. Navient had not mailed  anything to my parent yet pertaining to the new loans payment adjustment. Instead,  they simply took my parent's federal tax refund in whole, rather than giving my parent the oppertunity to use that money to pay the first months payment to them which they had yet to bill or even address her about.

The representative at Navient laughed at my parent and told them, ""The only way you're getting your return back is if you contact the IRS and contest hardship but unless you have proof that your home is being foreclosed on or your utilities are getting shut off, you won't get it back.""

""So basically what you're telling me is that you arbitrarily took it upon yourselves to steal money that you were going to get in the first place and if I'm not homeless or flat broke, I can't get it back?""

""Haha, yeah. Basically.""

So, thats the rub.

I know that PF generally advises against refinancing federal loans, but I was wondering if the savings from a lower interest rate might outweigh any forfeited benefits of federal loans in my case.

personalfinance,PSA: Sometimes opening up more debt can get you out of debt quicker.,"This may come off as obvious but it's a tactic I've used over the years to help with my credit card debt.

The best way, or at least the quickest, to pay off debts is highest interest first. Step 3 of the wiki. However, if most of your debt is in the form of credit cards. Getting a personal loan through a credit union or even the small loan places that are popping up online can really help you get out even quicker. 

My experience: $17k in credit card debt most with 20%+ interest and a car loan at 13% interest. To get out of this I made a budget, got spending in control within the budget, and kept applying for better and better debt. I got denied, a lot and that made my credit worse for a bit, but once I secured two personal loans through a credit union, I used that money to pay the highest credit card. Rinse and repeat and eventually I had moved all my credit card debt off onto loans. Why do this you may ask?

1. I had gotten spending under control.
2. This lowers credit card utilization and greatly improves scores and gives you access to lower credit card debt

I don't have a fool proof strategy but if you are suffering from killer interest rates while you try and get your credit card debt down, then consider getting a lower interest loan. With enough trial and error and good habits, you should be able to lower your interest to a point where your monthly debt payments aren't killing you.

Last month, I made an extra payment on the loan with the highest balance ($8k) and interest rate. Navient correctly allocated the entirety of the extra payment to principal of this loan which significantly brought down the balance; It still has the highest balance of all the loans. I just checked this month's minimum payment allocation and noticed that it was allocated totally different than in the past. Rather than putting $124 towards the highest loan as it usually had been done, only $44 was allocated to this loan while the other loans with low balances received more money than usual. $44 would've only covered the accrued interest on this loan and none of the principal. Did they advance my payment? I'm confused. When I made the extra payment last month, I made it explicitly clear on the phone (and recorded the call) not to advance the payments and that the extra $ should go to principal.

personalfinance,I'm trying my best to plan out my life after I graduate this spring,"Hello PF, I've been a subscriber here for a few years but I'm using a throwaway for this post. 

So, I'm a 22 year old single male, and right now I'm in the hiring process for a federal agency. I'm going to start off at GS-7, which begins at an annual salary of ~$35,000. In May, I'll graduate with a degree (that I actually get to put to use in a career I like, yay me) and $40,000 in loans. $26,000 of those are Direct Un/Subsidized loans at an average interest rate of 4.5%, and the remaining $14,000 are Perkins loans at 5%. One of the things that attracted me to those job in particular were a) loan repayment incentives (which I'll elaborate on later one) and b) the opportunity for loan forgiveness, since it's a federal job. 

All the above is set in stone, real life 100% fact. The rest is me ballparking numbers the best I can. Going off the assumptions that I do in fact get this job, I calculate my monthly take home will be around $2200. This is me using calculators to deduct the minimum stuff in my state, without any further deductions to retirement or benefits. Based off cursory searches on Zillow of properties in the area, I estimate that I will spend roughly $800 a month for housing and utility expenses (rent for two bedroom homes is anywhere from $500 to $800 and I'm estimating ~$200 in utilities). My place of residence and my actual work location amount to an 80 mile commute, so I'm estimating $300 a month for gas  (the vehicle I drive averages 33 mpg highway, and I'm operating under the assumption that gas isn't going to be below two bucks forever) and insurance. There aren't very many places to eat out in this town, so I'm estimating $150 for food, which I think I can manage to get down to below $100 (I plan on spending a lot of time on /r/eatcheapandhealthy). This puts me at $1250 for the absolute minimum things I need to live. I'll call it $1300 for the sake of simplicity. So that leaves me with $900 with which to repay loans, build an emergency fund, and save. This is my tentative expense budget, at least for the first year of this job. Beyond this point is where I need the outside opinion, or at least the best steps I can take to lay this all out to make the best decision.

As I mentioned, this job is a federal job, which I will presumably stay at for at least ten years. This would be ideal (I think), so that I can take advantage of the loan forgiveness of the Direct Loans I've taken out. So if IBR is based on 10% of your income, I'd have a monthly payment of about $220 to start off. From what I've been told by current employees of this agency, the promotion to GS-9 is pretty much automatic after a year. That would put my income at around $2,900 per month. Again, to GS-11 ($3,300) is only a matter of a year and not doing anything incredibly dumb, and so forth until GS-12 ($3,900). From there the promotions are more merit based (from my understanding). So considering all that, after three or four years my Income Based monthly payment will probably exceed my Standard Repayment Plan monthly payment, which I calculated to be a minimum of $320. So what happens there? Would IBR even be an option after that point? Would it be the equivalent of me paying more than the minimum payments at the Standard rate? Is IBR even a good idea if I think I can put more than the minimum for the majority of the term length? This is the part that's confusing for me. As for the Perkins Loans, I think that stuff is pretty standard so I calculate my minimum monthly payment would be about $150. From what I understand these are not eligible for forgiveness in the way the Direct loans are.

So, to throw a wrench in all the hypothetical stuff, I put in for a critical duty station, with the potential to get up to $10,000 a year for three years to put towards Federal loans. I *think* that can only apply to the Direct loans as well, but I'm not 100% sure. I know very little about this part, like whether I have to pay taxes on it, how exactly it gets dispersed, etc. Right now I'm treating any money I get from that as a windfall that I can only put towards loans. So ideally I can take a big chunk of those loans out within a year. 

To summarize, I'm estimating my monthly living expenses at $1300, which I think will apply for at least two years (barring an unexpected transfer to another location). I want to put as much as I can towards loan quickly, but to start I'll be at a minimum of $370 to $470 a month. With a monthly take home of $2200, that leaves me with $430 to build an emergency fund and save. I haven't mentioned it yet but there is also a potential to work overtime, which after typing this all out it seems that I'll have to do. Honestly after this wall of text I'm not sure what my questions were. I guess I just need to know if what I'm expecting is reasonable and not entirely outlandish. Up to this point I've had my existence subsidized by my parents, which I'm very grateful for. But it's left me with the first world problem of not quite knowing how to look after myself. Anyway, thanks if you've read this far. If you have any guidance or input, I'd really appreciate it.

I am strongly considering merging finances with my wife to make things easier to manage. I'm aware of the traditional pros and cons to this and am not interested in discussing those in this post, but I do want to confirm one thing before I proceed:

If we were to merge accounts and, God forbid something happened to her, would I be responsible for paying off her student loans? All the loans are federal and were acquired before we were married. My understanding is that I *would* be responsible under the premise that, once a payment is made on the loans in an account with my name on it that I am then also tied to that loan, even if she were to pass. Assuming this is correct, my workaround for this is that we will have a separate account in just her name that she will use to pay the student loans with.

Two major things that increased monthly expenses are

1) Additional child

2) Refinanced our 30-year mortgage to a 15-year for better interest rate, faster payoff and being able to pay less in interest. But that bumped up our monthly mortgage significantly.

Anyway, I still owe on the Sienna, but I'm at the point where those cars I'm looking at is priced just about at the difference between the fair market value and the amount I still owe on the Sienna, meaning I can just about walk away with the used car while paying nothing out of pocket.

I'm almost 30 and graduating with my MBA.  I have about $150k in student loans with interest rates ranging from 5.6 to 7.2%.  I have no other debt at the moment, and have a great credit score.

I graduate in May this year, but already secured a job offer.  I'll be in the consulting industry with $130k salary + bonuses.  I'll be living in Chicago and according to some calculators I found online, I'll have about $100k base salary after taxes.

So I need help preparing myself for my future.  I'm single with no kids.  I'm looking to rent an apartment in Chicago that costs around $2000-2500.  My employer also matches 25% of the first 6% of my 401k contribution.  It also says my employer can make a discretionary annual profit sharing contribution which has been historically 10% of eligible compensation, which I'm not too sure about what it means.

So monthly after taxes, just taking my base salary, I can expect about $7,600. Minus $2,500 for rent, $2,000 towards student loans (just a guess), $650 towards 401k (6% of gross salary), and $1,000 for things like food and going out, I'm left with over $1,500 at the end of each month.  Does this seem like an accurate calculation?  And if it is, what should I be doing with my remaining money?  My costs for food and going out is just an estimate, but I believe it will be low since I'll have a corporate card to pay for all my needs during the week when I'm working.  Also should I be looking to refinance my student loans?  Should I do that at my personal bank, BofA, or through some other private firm?

I have $2,000 saved up, so I know I could buy a car with cash. I've been doing research on Craigslist, looking at cars in my price range, and I'm not sure that's enough money to purchase a car that will handle the commute.


My credit score is low (~600) because I have never had any loans or credit cards, but I did have a tax lien placed against me three years ago for $300. The lien was from when I was accidentally overpaid on some unemployment checks and was unable to pay the difference back at the time the error was discovered (I have since paid this). Because of this, I am not sure that an auto loan is really the right choice for me either. I assume that any loan I could get would have an obscenely high interest rate.


My big issue is that I'm not really sure where to start/how to proceed/what kind of research to be doing that will help me figure out my next step. It doesn't really seem like a good idea to just walk on to a car lot and tell the nearest employee, ""I've got two grand in my pocket, a 38 year old car that might be worth something on trade in, and a desire to not get ripped off."" How can I figure out how to make the best choice in this situation? All advice greatly appreciated.",finance,1456305196
personalfinance,Taking out a loan and emigrating?,"First off, apologies if this is in the incorrect section. I'm not quite sure where to ask this.

I'm looking at emigrating from South Africa to either Canada or New Zealand in the next few years.

My question is this:

Can you take out a personal loan finance your emigration and once your are settled (with a job) pay back the loan from your new country like normal? new currency being in my favor. ( I spoke to my bank and they said its fine but the debit date should account for delays in currency conversions)

OR

Take out a loan to emigrate to the new country then take out a new loan in that country to pay off the previous loan in one go. The new loan, I think, will have a lower interest rate as to what is offered in South Africa since the economy is in the state its in.

Is my thinking correct or is this a flawed plan? Please note that I have no intention of taking a loan and then skipping the country and not paying it back.",finance,1456306616
gaming,"Just finished that new indie game ""Firewatch"" [SPOILERS]","**(This first part will be spoiler free.)**

So this afternoon since I had nothing better to do I was watching YouTube and saw Pewdiepie's video for his play-through of Firewatch. I watched the first five minutes or so and decided that it looked like one of those small indie games that would end up either being an artistic journey or a storytelling masterpiece - in other words something along the lines of Journey or Life Is Strange, big expectations I know.
So $35 and half an hour of downloading later I jumped into Firewatch and began my journey through the game. I will start off by saying that the introduction is awesome. It sets the background and emotional predicament for your character Henry very well, and giving you a few small choices in how he came to be where he is is a nice feature. I don't think this is a game where you have a lot of input on how the story goes but it certainly has a lot of dialogue options and intractable things throughout the world that likely have some small influence on how things pan out. The art-style in the game is very cool too. It's not hyper-realistic but not unrealistic either. It reminds me of the art in Life Is Strange but with a bit more detail, and my god is this game colourful - full of greens, reds, oranges and yellows.
Art and backstories aside one of the main reasons I play indie games is because so many of them have amazing stories, more often than not stories better than the ones we receive from top-tier video game companies. With this in mind I thought that a first-person indie game set in the natural forests of Colorado where you play as a member of the area's firewatch where all sorts of mysterious things happen would turn out to be an amazing experience. Five hours later I have now finished the game and to be honest I'm left feeling a little disappointed. 

**(Small spoilers start here.)**

So after this really great introduction you are dropped into your little outlook tower and promptly meet your partner of some-sorts, Delilah. The dialog between your character Henry and Delilah is very well done. The emotions are great and although you are in a world were you are literally the only person in the landscape it helps you to not feel completely alone. You start off with a few basic but enjoyable 'quests' I guess you'd call them where you do what you're supposed to be doing as a member of the firewatch; preventing forest fires. As the game progresses all sorts of mysterious things begin to happen ranging from someone breaking into your tower while you are away to discovering that everything you do is being monitored by some mysterious group. You and Delilah (well pretty much only you since Delilah is nothing but a voice through a radio) venture off on this little story to uncover who is watching you and why. The story is very interesting at this point as you feel a deeper plot emerging and the true story of the game begins to unfold. You explore the landscape finding all sorts of little clues on the way and venturing into deeper dialogue with Delilah about what you two are going to do why it involves both of you. All sorts of other things are brought into the story; a mysterious research camp, a story about a father and son who randomly disappeared one day, two teenage girls who have gone missing in the woods and you were the last person to see them, two strange park rangers who are leaving each other notes in the firewatch's supply chests...

**(Nothing but story-breaking spoilers from here on.)**

...and then it turns out the story is pretty much just your basic crime drama - or perhaps even more basic than a crime drama. The game builds up this massive conspiracy that leads you to believe that you are being set up for a huge surprise with the story, and then just as it reaches the peak of this build-up it begins to slow down and the ending is revealed to be something so basic. The story ends with you and Delilah discovering that the 'mysterious group' who has been monitoring you is merely the father of a boy who died caving while his father was working for the firewatch. That's it. The mysterious research camp? Never explained. The two firewatch members leaving each other secret letters? Never explained. The two teenage girls who disappeared? This was actually explained but it turns out they both just stole a tractor and ended up in the jail of the next town over. All of this build-up and suspense for such a, and forgive me for being so harsh, but a mediocre ending. The boy's father isn't even revealed to be a mastermind who was toying with you the whole time, he just randomly at one point leaves you a tape where he tells you why he was monitoring you and that all he wants to do is live out in the forest. No secret motive, he was just wondering what you two were doing while he lived in a make-shift dirt bunker. As I played through the game perhaps the only thing I ended up wanting more than an M. Night Shyamalan ending was for your character to in the end meet Delilah. You spend literally the whole game talking to her and building this relationship as you try to uncover the mystery of what's happening in this Colorado wilderness. You are in your tower on one end of the map, and she is in hers on the other end. All game she talks about how she can faintly see you from her tower (presumably with binoculars) and how she wonders what you look like and how she would like to meet you. You joke and share your pasts with each other all game and then just at the very end when you become so close to finally meeting her face-to-face she decides to leave on a helicopter while you're on your way to her tower. No real reason to leave, she literally just couldn't be fucked waiting for you. Thanks Delilah, spent 77 days talking to no one but you and then after everything we've been through you just pack up and leave because you couldn't be stuffed waiting five more minutes to meet me. Thanks bunches.

**(Closing thoughts)**

So there you have it. Firewatch. A decent concept of a game let down by an average story. I'm not saying that it is a bad game, but considering that IGN gave it a review of 9.3/10 and that I paid $35 for the game I was really hoping for more than five hours of build-up to an average ending.

**(TL;DR)**

Firewatch has a great concept with a very sub-par story. 7/10. Not worth $35.",technology,1456312222
personalfinance,"$60k in Debt w/ Home Equity in Portland, OR : NEED HELP","My story begins with being debt free 2 years ago. I owned a successful insurance agency and I was in process of building my dream recording studio in the home I own. The studio was half done. I was out of money with contractors lined up. I was unable to get any loans/grants/small business help/home equity/etc. despite zero debt (outside or mortgage and car) and a 775-800 credit score so I opened several credit cards.

I chose to finish the studio on the credit cards. I was pot committed. When the studio was finally built I sold my insurance agency nearly a year ago to transition into the new business and take a different job offer. I immediately paid off some of the debt I had accumulated (about $40k at that point). I also had several backup job offers lined up in addition to starting the new business on the side and my girlfriend moving in which would help with expenses. I thought I had a solid plan with multiple levels. I thought I had prepared for worst case scenario.

This is when everything went wrong. I paid down my debt to about $15k with the windfall from selling my business. A lot of the equipment I had bought then ended up being lemons. This cost about $20k as I desperately tried to get the business up and running. My debt was suddenly back up to where it had been. NONE of the 5 jobs I had lined up came through (including one I had spent over a year putting part-time effort into that I thought was a definite). I hired several people to help fix things, build a website, etc. I foolishly paid them up front and they all took the money and ran, costing me thousands.

A few weeks after selling my business I began hunting for a new job as I saw the writing on the wall. I was now $40k in debt again and sinking fast. I have yet to find anything decent after 10 months and countless resumes and interviews. I have texted/called/met with every person I can think of, even applying for minimum wage jobs and temp agencies and doing mystery shopping, Fiverr and life coaching, etc.  I post dozens of creative ads a day all over the net.  The ""real"" job search has been crickets other than I have been driving for Lyft (mostly a waste of time).

My debt is now at nearly $50k to credit cards and another $10k to relatives. I have basically nothing coming in and no reserves left. I have resorted to liquidating anything non-critical for my studio business to try and stay on top of the mountain of about 40 bills I get monthly. I am now behind 2 months on a couple bills and one month on several.

One dilemma, which is good in one sense, is that there is equity in my house. Probably around $50-100k (maybe more factoring in the studio). This makes me ineligible for bankruptcy.

Selling the house is an option but I live in a terrible neighborhood with an unseemly neighbor who has pit bulls barking every day (he leaves early am and comes back late at night so they are outside most of the day). His house is a trash heap. He has homeless ""employees"" living in their cars who openly sell drugs and wake me up loudly arguing and slamming car doors several days a week.  The city and police do nothing.  There have been 3 shootings right outside the window where I sleep. An 18 year old got shot and killed over a couple dollars 2 blocks away.  My house and car have been broken into as well as dozens of other petty crimes. In other words, I cannot get fair value on the house in the short term even if I sell because one look at the neighbor's literal junkyard (he runs a commercial junk hauling and hip hop car stereo installation business among God knows what else) is likely to make most run.  He is hardly the only problem neighbor (section 8 housing, etc.)

I have also looked into debt consolidation but it seems a waste of time. I would have to keep unloading assets to make any payments and that is unpredictable. I have also considered settlement but then my credit is truly trashed and I will  get an IRS 1099 bill.

The studio took 2 1/2 years to build and at age 43 has been my sole intent and dream since I was 2. I was a professional musician for 2 decades and I have songs that I have mixed that have been in Super Bowl ads, Hollywood movies, national ad campaigns, MTV, VH1, you name it. IE - I coulda' been a contenda'.

I would hate to have chased my lifelong dream this far and to lose it because of a bad luck streak. Even if I sell everything I will walk away without much debt, maybe none, but I won't have much to show for it either. I worked 80-120 weeks for many YEARS building my insurance business and this studio.

There is money left in the studio gear, but it will be a lot of work selling it and it is far from an endless source. A lot of it is bulky and not shippable. Collectively I estimate it would take about a year of 20-30 hours a week to unload. It would not be enough to pay off the debt. Then I would have little debt, and a beautiful studio, but no equipment.

Any ideas? Every path I have tried for 9 months has hit a brick wall. It appears as a self-employed for 15 years 43 year old I am about unemployable. I live in Portland OR. The cost of living here has skyrocketed, as have my property taxes which is not helping. I am current on my modest Kia car loan, though I am considering selling. I would have already if I did not need the vehicle to transport heavy equipment to FedEx.   I am also concerned that without the car in front my house will be broken into regularly.

I am depressed, at my wits end, and 2-5 bills keep showing up every day. I realize it is my responsibility, but this is all essentially business debt taken out personally as I didn't have any other options (I was denied 10-15 times by various banks).

Additionally I am battling disturbing health issues.  I have had 2 eye injuries (including a bacterial ulcer that nearly blinded me) so the computer is strenuous as best.  There are many days when I cannot use my eyes and I have a lengthy process waking every morning to have decent vision at all.  I have also had hand, wrist and joint problems for close to 10 years.  I went to a doctor this week and was diagnosed with severe tendinitis, carpal tunnel and arthritis (not rheumatoid thankfully).  I have serious doubts as to my ability to be able to work the kind of hours required to get myself out of this mess.

Too many things have gone wrong. I am out of ideas. I do not go out, do not drink, do not spend any money other than on necessities. I never really did even when I was making good money. It all went into my passion. The studio is in a position where it can be somewhat used so I am trying to promote that. I have had a couple small jobs recently. I had hoped to transition it into being my career but the other jobs were supposed to be there and be flexible to allow that to happen over the course of time. That was not the case.

I apologize for the long winded nature. I feel awful and I am angry at myself for selling the other business, though it was about to go into severe decline due to a couple of my biggest carriers going out of business. Basically I got out while I still could get something out of it and 2 of the offers I had were for more money, but they ran into problems of their own.

Yes, it would have been smarter to transition from the initial business but the offers I had were enticing and I had to time the sale to fit that job offer. I am technically still involved with the insurance business as there is a year long transition. Obviously it was a bad decision...the spread sheets sure looked good.

Yes, I could possibly go back to insurance (I have applied and had interviews) but realistically it will take at least a couple years to make any decent money and that won’t cut it.

Yes, I shouldn't have bought in a bad neighborhood but I could only buy with what I was approved at and the market was moving faster than I could find a decent home in a decent neighborhood.  I targeted 5 neighborhoods that were bad but ""up and coming"".  The other 4 have gotten radically better.  My hood is the last in inner Portland that hasn't gentrified and of course the natives want to preserve the wonderful thugs and drug dealers and homeless people that litter the streets and throw garbage in my yard every day.

So far in my adult life I've been pretty good at maintaining a budget and staying out of debt.

I've been working toward a potential career in a field that has made me feel more satisfied and happy than I've ever been in my working life. They're about to offer me a promotion from a part-time employee to full-time salary + health insurance(which is great, I haven't had health insurance since I got divorced). They gave me an offer of $22k, which is definitely lower than what I made last year, but is better than what most people make starting out in this field. Below I've posted my budget but I'm trying to figure out what my net income will be for the year based on a gross income of $22k and then trying to balance my estimated monthly budget against that.

$400 - Food

personalfinance,"Going to law school, how to manage savings?","Hi all,

I'm a 24yo living in the Northeast and was recently accepted to law school with plans to matriculate this fall. I'm wondering how I should manage my current savings given the big expense of law school and would really appreciate any advice. Should I invest my savings? Keep my savings in my checking account? What about 401k/Roth IRA contributions?

**Cost of Law School:**
I've been lucky enough to be awarded a scholarship that totals $93k over the 3 years of school. The school lists tuition and fees (not including room and board) to be $50,370 be year ($151,110 total). That said, my estimated cost of attendance is **$58,110**.

**Savings:**
Fortunately, I have been planning on attending school for a while and currently have ~$57,000 in savings (which are held in my checking account with no interest since BoA's interest rates are a joke). I also have a full time job that earns me ~$4,400 a month after taxes+15%401k contribution (employer accounts for 3%). I plan on working until August, so I'll end up earning another $24k or so. Assuming I save ~60% of this income (based on Mint stats), this puts me at a total savings of about **$71,000** going into school.

Note: I have not asked work yet about support for law school, but my gut feeling is that they won't help much given that I will be leaving (no part-time) for at least the first year. Has anyone had experience trying to negotiate something like this?

**Monthly Expenses:**
My monthly expenses (which will continue through at least the first year of law school) are summarized as follows:

 * Rent: $500
 * Utilities: $100
 * Food(groceries/restaurants): $150
 * Misc (Gym/Bars/Transportation/etc.): $250
 * Total: *$1,000*

I have no debt (already paid student loans), but will need to buy a car to get to school. I've been looking around and plan to spend $5-8k (car+registration), but will have added fuel+insurance expenses each month. Based on my roommates insurance premium and current fuel prices, I think ~$200 a month is a safe estimate. This brings my total monthly expenses to **1,200**.

Putting all the numbers together and assuming my expenses are fairly constant (although I do expect them to increase after the first year) brings me to $58,110+($1,200/monthx33months)=**$97,710** total for law school, or **$32,570** per year, plus another $5-8k for the car purchase.

Obviously, my estimated savings of $71k will not cover the entire three years of school. Granted, I plan on working during the summers and earning at least my current rate of $4,400 a month (so, at least ~10k a summer). However, I would really like to avoid taking out loans as much as possible, although I am eligible for the $20k/year Stafford loans. I also don't like the idea of completely exhausting my savings.

Given my current situation, what would you guys recommend I do going forward (aside from living as frugal as possible)? Should I move any of my savings to something that will earn interest? Should I contribute to a Roth IRA still (maxed it out at $5,500 last year)? What about my 401k contribution which I upped to 12% since I won't be contributing for ~3 years?

http://www.finra.org/investors/day-trading-margin-requirements-know-rules

What the link says about cash accounts. 

Day trading in a cash account is generally prohibited. Day trades can occur in a cash account only to the extent the trades do not violate the free-riding prohibition of Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T. In general, failing to pay for a security before you sell the security in a cash account violates the free-riding prohibition. If you free-ride, your broker is required to place a 90-day freeze on the account.

So since it says day trading in cash accounts is generally prohibited, does that mean I shouldn't be allowed to day trade using RH?

How do I know if my trades violate the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T? 

Also, why is it bad to be a PDT with under 25k?

personalfinance,Housing Q: Do you hold a former BF paying child-support against an applicant? (X-Post from /r/landlord),"So I have Renters Warehouse as leasing agent/prop manager.

The leasing agent has done some showings and has an applicant who has already given him the damage deposit. Her background came back clean criminally (though I personally found a few tickets/no insurance misdemeanors), but her credit score is in the 500s and she has had two accounts go to collection. One to an energy company and one for cable.

She also had student loans that were delinquent, but was able to show confirmation that those federal loans have been paid off as of earlier this month.

She wants to sign a 3 year lease. She personally has not had any evictions.

The real sticky wicket is the fact that through looking into the father of her child who she gets child support from, he seems shady. Has a felony for fleeing an officer that just went through in Nov '15. He has several other gross misdemeanors as well, and two evictions in '12 and '13. His name also came up in a contempt of court note on my counties arrest report.

The court case re: support occurred in 2013.

My question is, is it even possible to ask her how involved the father is? If I did, wouldn't she just say no? Is it possible that they left his name off the lease app for this reason exactly?

The house has only been listed for a couple of weeks, but obviously I'd like to get it rented sooner than later, and she said that if we bought her paint that she would do some painting herself and she didn't bring up any of the other things that seemed like some tenants might want updated prior to move-in.

I have to decline her soon if I'm going to, because we can't hold her deposit too long.

The IRS website says I should do this, but doesn't make a ton of sense to me:

*Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2016 is $3,924. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $9,210 withheld for 2016 resulting in an overpayment of $5,286 when you file your return. If you want your withholding to more closely match your anticipated tax, adjust your withholding on new Forms W-4 as follows:*

    Job 1 (which has a projected salary of $45,455): 3 allowances.
    Job 2 (which has a projected salary of $33,000): 4 allowances.
    Check the “Married” box on your Forms W-4 

ADP says I should simply take 3 allowances from my W-4, and does not specify if I should check ""Married"" or stay taxed as ""Single"".

No savings; spent most of our savings buying and moving into a new house in November 2015

I'm a 30 y/o father of three and my wife doesn't work. My parents own a house in New Jersey valued at $300,000 and they have ""given it to me"" to take it over or sell it. They owe $95,000 on the mortgage at 8.875% and want $100,000 in cash after everything is said and done. 

How feasible is it for me to take out another $200,000 mortgage and rent out the place for about $2,000 per month? My understanding is that we can use the excess equity as a ""gift of equity"" in lieu of a down payment. 

We could keep the current mortgage going but the interest rate is too damn high and my parents wouldn't be able to get any money out of the place. 

If buying it myself is a bad idea, how do I go about quickly selling the place? I really don't want to take over mortgage payments until the sale is finalized.

btc,Bitcoin as a reserve currency is a fallacy right now,"I keep hearing people over and over lying to themselves saying Bitcoin will be a reserve currency and therefore small blocks, fee pressure.

Let me wake you up to the real world my friends.

For a currency to be a reserve currency, it needs to be VERY stable. Anyone who has traded bitcoin and has traded anything else in the past know that Bitcoin, given its current small market-cap, numerous loosely regulated market places in different world wide regions (awesome for arbitrage cycles, look at the price in Venezuela - see surbitcoin, more investors would close that market inefficiency gap), is no more than a speculative asset on which you can make a decent amount of money day trading. Bitcoin will stay around unless it collapses spectacularly or loses to a clearly superior alternative, that ""first mover advantage"" argument is also a fallacy, where's Napster? MySpace? Friendfeed? Technology always moves forward.

To become a stable currency it needs to be massively adopted, massively accepted, infinitely useful so it can transform all forms of value into any other form of value. 

Small blockers are blind to real world use, perhaps they don't get paid in Bitcoin, nor they ever use Bitcoin to pay other people remotely. This fanboysm is killing this possibility by creating artificial limits when Bitcoin is barely used and it's giving more and more power to miners (the Chinese Bitcoin Fed, a handful of unelected Chinese mining pools will stall adoption and price stability). This is an open and permissionless technology, yet only today we're peaking in transactional volume (on-chain) and we don't yet hit 250k transactions per day.

It will take a hell of a lot more than that number of transactions for Bitcoin to be massively adopted, we're looking at the millions or tens of millions of transactions per day, before it can be a reserve currency. Yet you want to push everyone away with your artificial limitation, when we know we already have over 14 blocks worth of transaction waiting to be written at any given time.

Some transactions out there on the queue (aka mempool) are waiting 2.5hours at best (if all blocks were to be 1Mb, but we know some miners are not giving a damn and mining empty blocks before the halving comes) and some companies are doing everything they can to drive their agenda of a fee market, which is absolutely absurd when you have very promising cryptocurrencies which have already solved many of the issues Bitcoin is plagued with, and banks with trillions of dollars at risk not missing the beat, along an entire industry of Fintech getting tons of funding.

So in short:

Trust/Lower barriers of Entry/Ease of Use =&gt; Mass Adoption =&gt; Stability =&gt; Reserve Currency =&gt; Saving Accounts Obsolete.

It's almost as if these companies were funded by the banks and other opposing interests and they're conspiring to destroy Bitcoin,

personalfinance,20 years old and I have a wild opportunity in front of me. Should I do it?,"Hola Redditoros. I'm 20 and I come from two parents whose families are two opposite sides of the spectrum.

On one end, my mother's family of 7 has gone the conventional route, always working for someone else, sometimes having more than one job at a time. My one uncle is a court officer and security guard, my other uncle works security for the high school as well as working for the USPS, my aunt is a designer for some interior design company, my other aunt works for the local hospital as a nurse, and my mom works for the same hospital as a chart analyst. Her mom was a secretary and her father was a mack truck driver.

On the other end, my father's family of 8 has gone their whole lives being self employed. His parents owned their own pizzeria, my uncle currently owns 4 restaraunts in Burlington, VT (Bernie central), my other uncle owns a restaraunt and a pizzeria, my other uncle owns a restaraunt and a pizzeria, my dad owns his own construction company after getting out of the food industry, aaaand my two aunts dont work because they married money.

I'm the oldest of 5 kids. As of right now I work for said hospital in the emergency room. I hate it, but it's $15/hour per diem every Friday and every other weekend. Plus whenever they call me to fill in. My paycheck ranges from $500-$1000 every two weeks. My car costs $189 bi-weekly, so its $370/month, the car insurance is $200/month, my phone is $95/month, and im financing my computer at $65/month, I owe my old employer $2,000, so I pay them $50/month, and my life insurance is $30/month.

I have the opportunity to buy a semi-popular bar on Long Island that makes about $4000/week with a $2600 monthly rent for $75,000 with $25,000 down and the other $50,000 financed at a so-far undisclosed interest rate. I know nothing about bars. I'm not even old enough to be in one. I'm not too sure my dad knows too much about owning a bar, he mainly focused on pizzerias and restaraunts. Should I get my uncle from Vermont in on this to help me? 

Am I stupid to be this ambitious this young? I'm starving for success and die a little bit every time I have to come to this job. I can't stand being told what to do by a ""boss"", but at the same time I'm smart enough to wanting to avoid making stupid mistakes and ruining my credit/life. Gahh fuck. What do I do?

Should I follow down the risky path of being an entrepreneur like my dads family or continue to work for this hospital, graduate, and get a job working for someone else? I ultimately want to own a group of businesses like my uncle, so is it time to start?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Edit: I'm doing it. Except not alone. Actually, I almost wont be doing it at all. I'll be working there, in the back, with the numbers, and making some decisions.

I'd like to have a career in the future becoming a fund manager and I think this is a good way to start. All of the information included was obtained from nasdaq.com and SEC filings from the from the company.

I am 16 years old and I am currently looking for strong long-term (10-15 years) investments. The following company is one that I'm interested in. Tell me what you think.

*Note: I do not own any shares of AmTrust. Please do the proper research before investing in any companies that I recommend.* 


**Company:** AmTrust Financial Services

Date: *2/24/2016*

**Stock Ticker**: AFSI

**Sector**: Financial

**Industry**: Property and Casualty Insurance

**Company Statistics vs Industry-Wide Stats**

AmTrust stock has a much better value than the average company stock in the property and casualty insurance industry based off of multiple factors 

First, its P/E ratio. Using data off of Yahoo Finance, AmTrust has a P/E ratio of 9.05 compared to the average P/E ratio of 19.1 for other stocks in the industry. Also attractive to the value investor is AmTrust's return on equity, which is 20.43% compared to the industry standard of 9.2%. 

AmTrust has a P/B value of 1.98, which is about par for property/casualty insurance companies which, on average, have a P/B ratio of 2. 

AmTrust also has strong profit and operating margins, 10.8% and 12.67% respectively, as well as a high quarterly year on year revenue growth of 15.40%. 

AmTrust has a dividend yield of 2.36% vs. the industry standard of 2.8%. However, I believe this small difference in price yield is more than made up for by the higher ROE and lower P/E ratio AmTrust has compared to other property/casualty insurance companies. 

**What exactly does AmTrust do?**

AmTrust underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance products such as workers' compensation, commercial automobile, general liability and extended service and warranty coverage, in the United States and internationally to niche customer groups that, generally, are underrepresented in the insurance market. 

The company strategy is to target niche, small and middle-sized customers using in the United States and Europe using a proprietary technology platform to efficiently manage the high volume of policies and claims that they receive. 

AmTrust approaches acquisitions conservatively by taking modest balance sheet risks, including acquiring companies, access to distribution networks, and hirings of established teams of insurance underwriters.

**Strengths and Future Opportunities**

A big strength of AmTrust is its key statistics compared to companies in the industry, indicating that the company stock is undervalued. 

Another big strength is the proprietary technology that AmTrust uses, which allows the company to ""appropriately price and structure policies, maintain lower levels of loss, enhance [their] ability to accurately predict losses, and maintain lower claims costs than the industry as a whole."" Wherever possible, AmTrust adjusts the terms, conditions, and exclusions of their coverage to manage their risk and increase their profitability. 

Another part of AmTrust's strength is the fact that the company targets niche customers where the market is not as competitive as the broader market and where AmTrust's level of expertise provides them with a distinct advantage over other competitors in the industry.

AmTrust and its principal insurance subsidiaries are rated ""Excellent"" by an independent organization, A.M. Best Company, an organization that analyzes insurance companies. ""Excellent"" is A.M. Best Company's third highest of 16 rating levels.

AmTrust's effective and robust policies are shown through the company's high retention rates for its insurance policies, with an average policy renewal rate of 86% for the years of 2014,2013, and 2012.

AmTrust has strong future earnings potential, with analysts predicting that over the next 5 years the company will grow earnings at an average annual rate of 11%. http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/earnings-growth



**Weaknesses and Risks**

AmTrust is currently involved in several class action lawsuits filed in February 2014 in the southern district of New York. According to their 10-K SEC filing, the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss. This lack of loss estimates suggests that perhaps there are potentially large losses at risk and that the company does not want to erode stakeholder confidence. That being said, I believe the claims made by litigators are unsubstantiated. The cases are currently in appeal, but judges have ruled in AmTrust's favor in the past. 

Volatile financial markets could adversely affect their business operations, financial positions, and liquidity. In the case of an economic downturn, lower levels of economic activity could negatively impact confidence in the company.

There are no policy limits on Amtrust's liability for worker's compensation claims unlike other forms of insurance. In the event of catastrophic losses or a force majeure, AmTrust could theoretically be forced to pay out significant amounts of money to the workers they insure.

A large amount of Amtrust's money (About $4.25 billion or 77% of their investment portfolio) is concentrated into fixed income securities. In general, the market value of fixed income securities decrease as interest rates rise. Conversely, when interest rates decrease the market value of the securities increase. According to their filing, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a $207.3 million decrease in Amtrust's investments. 

**Economic Moats**

What makes AmTrust much more effective at producing returns and reducing risks is through how its business is structured. AmTrust has three business segments: Small Commercial Business, Specialty and Extended Warranty Risk, and Specialty Program. AmTrust's moat comes in its small commercial business side of the company, with its small commercial business segment making up 49.3% of their gross written premium in 2014, 40.3% in 2013, and 34% in 2012. 

The small business segment for worker's comp, which continues to increasingly take up a majority of the companie's gross written premium, is less competitive for the large insurance market because of the lower average premium and smaller policy which do not fit the profitability criteria of their customers. This allows AmTrust to work in a niche market that allows them to make money consistently and obtain a portion of the market share that other insurance companies are restricted from.





**Analyst Ratings**

Although I take analyst ratings with a grain of salt, some people may find them to be insightful. To that end, all of the analyst ratings for AmTrust have been positive. According to: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/afsi/recommendations  

Out of 5 analysts, 4 gave it a strong buy and 1 gave it a buy.

**Overall**

I give AmTrust Financial Services a BUY rating based off of several factors: its favorable P/E and ROE, its strong future earnings potential, and the unique way the business is structured to target niche clients in an underrepresented market. I believe the market is currently undervaluing AmTrust because of lower consumer confidence in the financial markets, and that the recent dip in its price is not based off of fundamentals.

Additionally, the applications ask how much notice I've given, when I wasn't planning on giving a two weeks notice until I was actually hired by a new restaurant.
So my questions are A) whether I should just allow them to contact him and hope for the best, or explain that situation to them; and B) How I should handle the notice section of the applications

And help would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1456404174

personalfinance,Taking out a private loan to make interest rates lower and other student loan questions,"Hi all! I know I'm probably going to get torn a new asshole for the amount of loans I took out for school but please know that I know I'm an idiot and think about it every day. 

Basically, I have about 30k of loans in my name and about 66k in my moms name as a parent plus loan. They haven't kicked in yet as I just graduated in December and wont kick in until June of 2017 because I will be back in school part time between May and December of this year, thus, renewing my grace period. However, I do plan on making payments on those loans once my emergency fund is built up. Right now I have about 2050 in my savings and would like to get it up to 9-10k for my efund. I've been putting 500 a month in plus I'm getting bonuses from work because it's tax season so all my bonuses are going in there as well. I also put anything extra from my expenses in there and once it's full, all of that extra will go towards loans. 

I've pasted the loan summaries below. My question is, would it be beneficial to take out a private loan to cover the parent plus loans in hopes of getting a lower interest rate? Obviously if it doesn't offer a lower rate, we don't have to take it.

My next question is, should I worry about paying off the loans in my name first or the loans in my moms name first? My mom won't need her credit as she plans on getting married(will be filing MFS) in the next few years to her boyfriend who makes enough to support both of them. She won't have to work therefore her payment will be 0. 

I'm honestly just getting really anxious about all of this loan stuff. I would appreciate constructive criticism but please don't bash the decisions I've made already. I know I effed up and beat myself up every day for it. I'd just really love to not be in debt for the rest of my life.

personalfinance,"17 Years old with no health insurance, denied by FAFSA, denied independency status. What are my options?","Hello all! I am currently 17 years old and a senior in high school. I turn 18 next week if that is of any importance. I have no health insurance and I was denied federal financial aid for college because my father (only living parent) has not filed taxes for several years and is also unemployed. I work at a food chain and make $11 an hour with a *mostly* reliable vehicle. My father lives with me and I pay the rent at $650 a month. (Though his name is on the lease) He's not disabled or anything, he just does not do any over the table work. As I approach graduation I have began looking at colleges, though being denied federal financial aid has made the idea fairly daunting. Loans are there of course however I would like to avoid them if possible. I have spoken with the financial aid advisors for a couple schools and the informed me that while my situation is not very fruitful, I would not qualify for a dependency override as my father is still alive. So I am stuck as a dependent who cannot receive any federal help until I turn 24 to my knowledge. I am close to a promotion to make $13 an hour, but my situation otherwise will remain unchanged the next year. 

My current mandatory monthly expenses are:
  *Rent - $650
  *Car Insurance - $115 
  *Food - $200 
  *Gas - 140


In the coming months I would like to acquire health insurance and possibly enroll in a community college (Roughly $3000 a semester) but am at a loss - I can't find room in my budget for both (Or either for that matter.) What are my options?

Edit: Thanks for all the help so far. Looking into taking light hours for my basics while working an extra job might be what I look into. Also I realized I phrased it poorly. I was not 'denied' by FAFSA, I was unable to complete any forms without tax information and finaid.org states 'Even if the guardian does not claim the child as a dependent and if the student displays complete financial independency, this is not sufficient grounds for a dependency override' which is essentially my case.

Bitcoin,I want BTC to be usable as a currency.,"* The Currency app requires nearly instantaneous confirmation of each transaction.

* It is not the case that the existing Bitcoin system provides nearly instantaneous confirmation for each transaction.

* Therefore, the existing Bitcoin system is not the Currency app.

Fortunately, the existing Bitcoin system's capabilities are probably enough to allow for simulating the Currrency app to a nearly arbitrary degree of accuracy; the existing system forms a self-contained, coherent protocol for settlement on which another, higher-level protocol can be built to provide to BTC the properties of currency.

**This is *not* a competing vision; this is *not* a re-imagining of Bitcoin.**

BTC is a unit of account. Bitcoin is a settlement layer. The Lightning Network is a currency layer built on top of Bitcoin; the Lightning Network turns BTC into a currency.

Currency is but one app that can be developed on top of a settlement system; Bitcoin as a settlement layer has been discussed since the dawn of Bitcoin.

* [Satoshi on 30 September 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1306.msg14714#msg14714):  
&gt; As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation.  **0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens.  At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature.**

    That is, your transaction doesn't mean much until the Bitcoin network begins to settle it in the blockchain.

    Since early on, people were discussing all manner of ways to make confirmations faster, including changing the rate at which blocks are confirmed; people realized that waiting for settlement wasn't going to work well for using BTC as a currency.

* [Hal Finney on 30 December 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211) (he was the first person to receive a transaction from Satoshi):  
&gt; Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. **There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient.** Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.

    &gt; Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalization of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.

    &gt; George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.

    &gt; I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the ""high-powered money"" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. **Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to *settle* net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.**

* [hashcoin on 04 July 2011](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25786.msg320931#msg320931) described what became known as a 'payment channel', the fundamental protocol on which the Lightning Network is built:  
&gt; In general long-term business relationships can agree to just ""**settle** it in the blockchain later"", but still do it in a way that neither can screw the other.

    &gt; ...

    &gt; In this scheme, money is tied up, but still cannot be spent by the other party without authorization from you.  On the other hand, you can provide that authorization to them **instantly** offline of the blockchain.

Whether or not you call the whole functioning ecosystem 'Bitcoin', the fact remains: There must be a settlement layer, and there must be a currency layer built on top of that settlement layer.

We've got the settlement layer working pretty damn well. Now, we're working on the layer that will provide cheap, high-volume, instantaneous confirmation for transactions that represent usage of BTC as a currency.",cryptocurrency,1456422679
personalfinance,Get rid of PMI or pay off student loans?,"Over the last few years I’ve been able to save $27,000 and I’m thinking I should do something with it instead of leaving it in savings collecting basically no interest. 


My student loans are almost $21,000 with an average interest rate of 4.5%. I pay $300/month towards them now, and I’d like to get rid of that payment, but putting out that much money at once makes me really nervous. It would still leave me with $6000, which is about 2 months pay. I currently put $600/month into savings, and after paying this off I could bump that up to $900, but it would still take me over 2 years to recover at that rate. 


The other option I've been considering is paying my mortgage down to eliminate my PMI. The PMI on my mortgage is $80/month, and I need to pay off another $10,500 to get rid of it. This would take less of a bite out of my savings than paying off my student loans, but it also wouldn’t free up as much money each month.

If not, and interest rates stay the same, could I just keep refinancing every few months and making money?

The only potential downside I can think of is that I'd have to put up the money for a new escrow account, but I'd get a similar amount back from the old account after closing, and I have the cash.

I'm a 23 y/o male living at home with mom. I have not been on my own at all, as I didn't want to rent. I have been looking for a house for a while now, and have found a small 2 bed 1 bath that would be perfect for me. It will be only myself living there. The asking price is $39,999 and I am submitting an offer today of $34,000 asking that the seller pay 3% of the purchase price to the closing fees, as the type of loan that I have been set up on is capped at that maximum for the seller to pay. 

I am looking at a 30 year loan with 3.5% interest rate, and will be putting down a minimum of 3% down payment. Very likely to be closer to 10% but with the closing fees, some things I will have to pay for to fix a couple small issues, furnishing and inspection, I am not trying to sell myself short on money. By closing I should have at least 2 more paychecks, as I'm paid biweekly at approx. $1100 a week. I've been through college and am settled in a small town in the midwest and the house I'm looking at is roughly 5 minutes from work, vs. the 20 minutes I currently drive. 

As far as affording the house, I've had my mom and several other people to go over all the costs associated with purchasing a house and feel that I can afford the house without being stretched too thin. What I am mostly after is whether or not the interest rate seems to be on par with what I should have? Are there any kinds of incentives for being a first time homeowner to look for? Are there any strategies that I should work toward on making things cheaper? What are some of the pitfalls someone in my situation may face? I really just have no idea what I'm in for, and even though my mom is a homeowner, I still would like a bit more qualified and better researched opinion and viewpoint on how to go about this. Are there any advantages that I may be missing out on? 

If this is the wrong sub, I apologize. I don't believe I violated any rules. If there is a sticky I could read, I'm sorry, I didn't look super thoroughly and I will be meeting with the real estate agent later today so I'm a bit behind on the curve on coming here anyway.

I'm currently a first year grad student straight out of my undergraduate. Basically my mom has been claiming me up until now because I've been submitting her info for FAFSA for financial aid throughout my undergrad. In the summers of 2013 and 2015 I worked hourly wage jobs that were taxed (other summers I received stipends for research that weren't taxed) and my mom was just seeing the person that does her taxes and she said I should file my own to get money back from the government since I only worked over the summer and was a full time student.

I have a couple of questions about this though: Will me filling out my own taxes do anything to mess with the money I received from federal and my school's financial aid? I continued to received financial aid throughout 2015, just not now that I'm a grad student. 

Could I go to my ex employers and ask for my W-2s to fill out 2013 and 2015 forms to get tax returns?

personalfinance,Federal Direct Unsubsidized Student Loans Repayment,"Hey all, I'm graduating in May and was completing the exit counseling for my four federal direct unsubsidized loans.  For repayment, it seemed I had two real options open for me.  The 'standard' repayment plan of 10 years, paying the same amount every month for 10 years to pay off the full balance, and the 'graduated' repayment plan for 10 years, where the monthly payment increases every 2 years until they are paid fully after 10 years.

One of my loans has a much higher interest rate than the others, so here's my plan:

Start on the graduated repayment plan to lower my minimum monthly payments on the other loans, and therefore be able to pay as much as possible towards the one with the highest rate (hopefully paying it off completely in about 2 years).  At that point, I think I would switch to the 'standard' repayment plan.

I quickly became stressed out, and my worth ethic did not improve.  I quickly grew to dislike the job, and that manifested in poor work performance.  Fired at 9 months.  


I didn't have a safety net, so I moved closer to my friends for emotional support and to cheapen my housing situation.  Cut bills, got a job at sonic and uber to make ends meet.  Really struggled for 4 months.  Totally changed my attitude, and I found a new job as a Melt Engineer (basically a process engineer).  


I have been here for 8 months now.  Really hit the ground running, really made a name for myself.  Making 55k.  Work eithic did a complete 180, so did initiative.  My department is becoming the model department.  Management thinks really highly of me, president of the company (small ish company) is impressed with what he is hearing.  Benefits, access to overtime after 55 hours per week.  


I have recently been put in contact with a fortune 100 company looking to create a Process engineer job.  Job is the same thing I am doing now.  Pay based on my contact could be damn near close to 42$ an hour.  And the plant is in 100x better condition than that one I am at now.  So more time to do projects and less fires to fight everyday.  Benefits, immediate access to overtime after 40 hrs.   

The job sounds like a stupidly awesome upgrade.  However, if I was offered the job, would it be smart to take it, based on my employment history?  I really learned my lesson from being unemployed without a safety net, and I really feel like I can hit this job sprinting.  I'm basically already doing it now.   But I don't want it to damage my employment image.  I know I need to get some time under my belt and some loyalty built up...but it seems like a great opportunity.  What do you guys think?

personalfinance,Should I take out a private student loan?,"Circumstances: I'm in my first year of college. I have a lot of financial aid, and end up paying about $4500 out of pocket, after taking out $5500 in federal student loans. Right now, I have an outstanding balance of a little over $3000 on my student account. I've spoken with the financial aid office, and they're willing to work out a payment plan for me.

Issues: I am paying for college entirely on my own--my parents aren't in a good financial position to help me out because they have their own debts. I have three part time jobs on campus, but only make around $340 each month due to difficulty getting hours, and part of that goes to buying things like soap, and shampoo. The most I can reasonably afford to pay each month is $250. At that rate, it'll take me a year to pay off the current balance. On top of that, my balance is going to increase during the fall semester of my sophomore year, when the charges from that semester pile onto the charges from this semester.

After speaking with financial aid services, I basically have two options. The first is to take the payment plan, pay as much as I can, and deal with the outstanding balance as much as I can. This is probably the preferable option, but it will take a pretty big short term toll on me financially. Additionally, my balance will continue to increase over time, with no guarantee that my salary will increase. It'll be more and more difficult to make the payments over time, and I'm worried about having to pay off a still-large balance at the end of my undergraduate degree.

My other option is to take out a private student loan. I know that for some of these, the interest rates are reasonable, but I'd obviously still be paying more over the course of however many years than I would if I took the payment plan. I also have no credit history, and would need someone to cosign my loan. The pros are that I would be paying less each month, and that my balance would be taken care of.

So my question is, if I can find a private student loan with a reasonable, and preferably fixed, balance, should I take it? Right now, I'm going to be making payments for at least several months to see how I can handle them and how much of a dent it makes in my balance. But if it becomes difficult over time, or my balance gets too high, should I take out a loan? What are some pros and cons? Does anyone here have experience with private student loans? If I do decide to take one out, what should I be looking for?

Obviously this isn't the most ideal situation, so I would appreciate advice about what steps I should take to resolve this issue, and what would be the most financially viable for someone who doesn't make much money and is paying for college on their own.",finance,1456431250

I panicked for sure, but my parents need my help and they were the ones who allowed me to go to a great school by taking on this debt, it's the least I could do (though hindsight being 20/20 I sure wish I had tried to get more scholarships back then)  

I wanted to start looking at consolidation options and I have no idea where to even start.  They are federal MEFA loans (Massachusetts educational financial assistance, or something like that) and right now the monthly payment is over 900 dollars, which in addition to the loans i already pay, would put my monthly payments at almost $1,200.

This semester however it doesn't look like I'll be able to do that and I was hoping for some advice.


Currently I owe $3300, and I thought if I went to my bank (Wells Fargo) I would see if they would give me a school loan that is reasonable. I'm looking for something with less interest than my highest interest Stafford loan (6.8%). My credit score is 738 right now. Is that naive?


Currently I could pay about $100 to $150 a month on it. I know I'll have to start paying right away and that they won't offer me things like income based repayment and I wouldn't be able to pause the payments, but I think I can manage it.


So Personal Finance I just wanted to see if this is feasible? I'm going to go in and see what they can do for me, and I've never overdrafted or been late on my credit card payment with them which I hope helps my case.

personalfinance,"Bought new car, 4 days later dealer calls saying they are changing payment/amount. What are my options?","I'm typing this as short version as possible.

February 20th my Wife and I signed/purchase for a new car (Nissan) at a dealership that is 50 miles away.  

Before I start, you should know that we were already approved at a under $300 a month payment for new Subaru and at the last minute we decided to buy a bigger car, the Nissan.  We had ordered the Subaru new (no signed anything, but did put $500 down), and after 9 weeks of waiting it was suppose to arrive this week (Feb 22nd).  

When making the decision to go with the bigger Nissan we called the dealership (50 miles away) because they had the exact model/color/features we wanted.  On the phone I told them we had a very specific price to hit (monthly budget) of $300 or less.  They said they would make it happen so we don't waste our time down driving down there.

At the dealership, we went back and forth with the finance/salesperson and I held firm at $300 or less per month.  I told them if they can't do it, to let us know, because our fallback plan was to get the Subaru.  I was very clear that even 1 dollar above $300 would be a dealer breaker for us.  At least 3 times we held firm at $300 or below with the Nissan dealership, finally they agreed.

We signed the purchase paperwork and took our new car home.  3 days later (wednesday) we got window tint work done and added paint protection (similar to 3m) on the new car, total of about $1,100 cash. We just got the car back this morning from the tint place.

Today (after 5pm) I got a call from the finance person at the Nissan dealership saying he had 'good news' (he had 2 days ago, not the day we signed, asked for a copy of my paystub which I hadn't given him yet).  He said the good news was that he didn't need my paystub anymore, because they had found financing for us, but it would be at a higher interest rate, shorter loan term (72 months instead of 78) and would now cost us only $311 per month.

They knew that anything above $300 was a deal breaker and he sounded like this was good news at $311 because it was so hard to find financing for us (we have terrible credit, but good income).  

He also said we signed a clause saying the amount/pricing was pending they could find a bank to agree to that amount and had 4 business days to do so.  They had already listed a bank name on the official paperwork that we signed.

Now, I'm obviously angry and let the guy know on the phone.  But what are my options?  We will not accept anything above $300 a month and may have lost out on the opportunity to get the Subaru as our fallback plan.  Lastly, we've spent $1,100 on tint/pain protection already.  

Can car dealerships pull this bait and switch maneuver?  Do I have any rights?  I'm in Washington State.  

What are my options?  I don't want to take the car back, but don't want the higher monthly payment.  If I take the car back, can I get the dealership to pay for the tint/paint protection?

I've heard of dealerships doing this before and honestly thought this place was of higher caliber, so I'm very pissed.  I'm just glad we didn't sell our old car yet!  

Please help!

EDIT: In my haste I forgot to clarify.  We do plan on paying the car off years early.  So while it may seem like 72 months at a higher rate costs less than 78 months at a lower rate, it won't affect us that way.  We plan on paying the car off in about 3 years.  My biggest gripe here is that they lied to us to get us to the dealership and then lied again about the price.

Also, when we walked out of the dealership we were under the impression they had already found a bank that had a loan for us, hence they confirmed under $300 a month and the bank name written on the paperwork.  They made no mention that financing wasn't actually established yet.  We made it clear, $300 or less or it was a deal breaker, I was extremely firm on that point.

EDIT 2: We put $10k down which they took from our account immediately.

EDIT 3: I never said we couldn't afford more than $300, I said we weren't willing to pay more than $300.  From the comments apparently it's ok for dealerships to lie and do bait and switch.  Nobody cares about morals or principle, etc anymore?

Edit 4: Our bad credit is due to foreclosure several years ago.  Yes, back then I was bad (and mostly ignorant) about personal finances.  I have learned a lot since then and put those lessons into practice.  This has resulted in being able to save up enough to put $10k down on a vehicle and also smart enough to know what our monthly payment should be on a car so that it won't be any kind of burden.  We also planned on paying more than minimum to pay off the car quicker.  

I'm not saying we are perfect, obviously, but we are making big steps to getting a much better financial foundation, this car in both of our names should also increase our credit rating over time.",finance,1456452031

personalfinance,Large house down payment or split it between down payment and student loans? [No PMI],"Hey PersonalFinance,

Background: I am currently in the market to buy a home ($205,000). I have been notified that PMI will be waved by the lender and closing costs are covered by the seller. I also have a little over $50,000 in student loans. 


With the knowledge that I am not required to do the 20% ($41,000) down payment in order to avoid PMI. I could use some of that money on my student loans instead. I have run into a wall when attempting to calculate if using 10% ($20,500) as my down payment and putting $20,500 towards my loans in a lump sum is better than doing the full 20% ($41,000) towards the house. 

Can someone walk me through the math? It makes sense to want to knock down the higher interest as soon as possible, but I'm struggling to prove that to myself when the length of time isn't similar. 

As of now 20% down payment is $41,000 @ 3.75% interest [$164,000 Loan] 30 year term

If 10% it would be $20,500 @ ~4.00% (estimating high. I don't have the exact interest rate for this on hand) [$184,000] 30 year term and the remaining 10% would be put towards the loans with 6.550% interest. 


Loan Breakdown is as follows: (paying $1,000 per month; 6.6 years until paid off)

    Subsidized Principal Balance:
    $4,528.10 - 4.250%
    $4,528.10 - 5.350%
    $2871.95 - 5.750%
    $6,998.15 - 6.550%

personalfinance,Repaying Student Loans Aggressively. Seeking recommendations for short term actions,"Hello! I am a 26 year old graduate and I have currently set myself in a position to aggressively pay off my student loan debt. I have a few questions about how to proceed in the short term and would appreciate some input from some more experienced in personal finance than myself.

Firstly, here's the basic run down of expenses, debt, and income. I currently take home after all payroll deductions and taxes roughly $35,300 annually without taking into consideration two yearly bonuses but I'd ballpark it at roughly $1,250. I have chosen to live at home and bought and payed off my car in full. My only current monthly bills outside of the loans are car insurance and small home bills I help out with, both combined being ~$3,000 annually.  I'm a pretty frugal person but I'd estimate around $4,000 for misc spending money throughout the year.  

My total debt amount is $31,000. $19,900 is at 6.5% across four loans (the largest being two at $8,000.) The remainder being at 3.15%-3.6% across multiple loans as well. I'm currently on a 10 year repayment plan which takes ~$375 a month.

At the end of this month, I'll have $8,000 I can use and I want to begin to knock out the 6.5% loans. My goal is by the end of this year to have all 6.5% loans gone and half of the remainder. Complete payoff being done by Spring 2017. I'm aware that it could be more beneficial to leave the smaller interest rate loans there and start investing but I am one of those people that hates personal debt and would rather be free of it before moving on in life. 

So here's where I'm looking for help. Given my plan, is it more  beneficial to me to have the longest possible repayment plan with my loaner to have the smallest monthly payment? I'm assuming consolidation would also not benefit me much with such a short term repayment plan due to some loan groups having lower ~3.3% rates. 

Any stories from others that have aggressively payed debt off? If you did, would you recommend it? Is my whole plan dumb? Any help or feedback is appreciated.",finance,1456482841

personalfinance,Inheriting USAA custodial account,"Hello all. My grandfather started a mutual-fund account for me when I was a child intended to use for college costs. I'm 25 now, and finishing up graduate school this May so obviously it won't be used for school. The account is through USAA, and is currently in the process of being transferred to me. I don't have an exact number but my I was recently told it amounts to between 18-25k.

I've read through the basic posts and was looking for additional info. I've noticed that most prefer Vanguard or Fidelity due to the low expense costs. I'm not opposed to this, but my I would have to learn more about this obviously.

Some of my questions are, would it be better to invest the money yearly into an IRA or Roth for the yearly max?

I was thinking of using half of the account for a downpayment for a future house in about 2 years. Thoughts?

I plan on working for the federal government (if all goes well). I know the TSP is a great plan, is there a way to transfer the USAA account to the TSP when that time comes?

About me: 25, engaged to be married in 2017. No CC debt. Finishing up masters degree with &gt;100k in debt (will be utilizing PSLF so not worried about tax implications or payments) Hope to be working a federal government job upon graduation.

I graduated in 2009 with a series of federal loans that got bought by Moehla after I entered the repayment phase. Earlier this year, I filed a FAFSA because I am going to grad school. While checking on my Moehla loans, I noticed my status had been changed to deferment, even though my loans are all in good standing. I called them up and they said I went into deferment because I am going back to school half time and do not need to pay during this time. My auto-payments were cancelled and cannot be set up during deferment; but I can make manual payments if I want.

Here's my questions: the person I spoke with also mentioned that while in deferment, I would continue to accrue interest **but the interest would be payed by the government**. Can anyone give me more information on this? Is it really as simple as that? Just as an fyi, I still plan to make payments while in deferment, but if I didn't have to worry about interest that would be pretty neat.

personalfinance,What do I do with this car?,"First off, some back-story. When I got my first real job as a software dev at 19 (currently 21), making $45K/year, I thought I was hot shit and bought a new car. I bought a 2013 Nissan Sentra at (first mistake, I didn't actually know the price of the car) $360/month. It was brand-new, with 23 miles on it when I drove it off the lot, I thought it was awesome. Stupid, I know.

A year later, mistake #2 happens; I get a call from a salesman where I bought the Sentra, offering to ""Get me into a new ride for only ~$40/month more!"". This sounded awesome to stupid 20-year-old me, so I took him up on it, got a 2015 Nissan Altima S and true to his word, the payments were only $400/month! I thought it was awesome. I didn't realize I was getting an entirely new loan for another 72 months AND carrying negative equity over from the previous loan. God, I feel so stupid.

Within the last 6 months, I have started seriously looking at my finances and the breakdown is as follows: I own a car that has a trade-in value of ~$12K and STILL OWE ~$20K because of the negative equity that I carried over. The minimum payment is $405/month, I usually pay $450+ just to try and tackle it a little faster. I have been doing this for the past 5 months. The interest rate on this loan is also an absurdly high 5.68%.

The way I see it, I have two options:

1) Re-finance the car and aim for 3% or lower to reduce interest paid, keep making above-necessary payments to get it eaten quicker. My credit score is ~720, so this seems feasible.

2) Trade in the car for a shitty used car and drop as much off the loan amount as possible. My fear with doing this is the car I would end up getting would be so shitty that I'd end up spending a ton in repairs anyway and that my current car with only ~18,000 miles on it is much more reliable even though I'm over-paying a crazy amount for it.

It's a shitty situation and it's one I've definitely learned from, but is there anything I can really do about it?

Just some more information; I'm currently at $55K/year and going to ~$63K in June and plan to use a considerable amount of my extra monthly income on my car debt, just to get it out of the way as quickly as possible and save as much as I can on interest.

Thank you for reading. Let me know if anything's unclear, I know I rambled a bit up there.

personalfinance,Does this sound like hypocrisy in Dave Ramsey's teaching?,"First - I listen to the Dave Ramsey everyday and am a big believer in 99.99% of his teaching about debt. 

As anyone here knows who has listened to Dave even once is that he teaches that debt is 80% behavior and 20% math. This philosophy is the #1 driver behind the ""Debt Snowball"" method.

In his own words,""The interest you save by paying off the highest interest rate loan first is irrelevant compared to the behavior of building self-discipline and staying motivated while paying of your debts.""

**I agree completely with this philosophy!**

Now - this is where I find a little hypocrisy in Dave. I hear Dave all the time tell people who get a large income tax check back to ""Stop giving the government an interest free loan and change your W-4 immediately.""

Mathematically he is correct, however from a behavior standpoint, isn't forcing yourself to live on less knowing that you will get it all back at the beginning of the year a smart behavioral decision? The interest is irrelevant to having a huge chuck off money to throw at the debt at the beginning of the year. 

If you think about it - it would be impossible to get any of the extra money you gave to the government until the next tax season anyway thus for the majority of people - that is a very good thing.

Just for transparency - I do pay way more taxes during the year than needed. My wife and I received over 10K back from income taxes this year and were able to pay off our car which is awesome and gives us extra motivation for the rest of the year.

To close - I think Dave is awesome at what he does and I would be the first to say his debt teachings are the best out there. IMO - it seems like the income tax thing is more politically motivated that staying true to his belief system.",finance,1456519628

We got relocated from a very low cost of living place to a very high cost of living place. The last few years we have gone through the ringer financially. Some of it was our own fault (ex. don't base what you can afford in a mortgage on your company telling you that a few years of mortgage assistance will help until you get a few years of raises to cover it - ouch and nope - lesson learned). But most of it was genuinely unexpected and felt unavoidable (ex. a sick dog that we continued to spend money trying to save...14 months and several thousand dollars later, she is gone). Done and done. There were more incidents, but you get the idea.  



About 6 months ago I snapped and couldn't handle the downward spiral we were in. Not including our mortgage and car payment (we only have one car; husband walks to work).


August 2015: $31,000 debts; $20,000 of that was 0% interest


February 2016: $17,000 debts - ALL 0% interest  



We have made a ton of positive progress, thanks to this subreddit.


Step 1: stop spending on credit cards, no matter what


Step 2: start reading r/personalfinance


Step 3: sign up for YNAB &amp; stick to it (and be forever changed)


Step 4: payoff debt with interest rates (just finished this by putting the entire bonus towards it. Entire bonus. Ouch again.)


Step 5: .....um....help!  



Our mortgage is increasing $420/month in May. We have to free up more monthly cash to cover this. We have 3 zero interest accounts that cost us $400 in monthly payments...this would do the trick.  



We have $4500 coming in from the IRS soon, which is just enough to pay those 3 accounts off (all 0 interest and on track to payoff on time). If we go this route, it would leave us with only 1 debt account, that is zero interest until August of this year. It is a little over $12,000.  




Our plan from there would be to payoff a few thousand of it before August, and then flip over to another zero interest card (yes, paying the 3% fee) to buy us more time. If everything goes as planned, we could finish paying off that balance within 18 months...probably sooner.  



A few more details you may ask about:


Retirement: just reached 1.5x annual salary


Salary: just over 100K (8% going into 401K, full match achieved at 6%; not including variable bonus)


Mortgage: $3000 per month (this includes condo dues)


Car pmt: $475 per month


Emergency Fund: $800 (this is low priority while we are paying off debt, but does make me nervous)


All other bills are what they are - we have gotten them as low as possible, and they are non-negotiable. We even cancelled Netflix and Hulu :(


Everything here is expensive. We have changed where we shop, what we buy. We eat only food that we make - no eating out at all anymore.


All health insurance, including HSA contributions come out of paycheck prior to taxes, as well. HSA is in good shape to cover all medical expenses.



So, is this the correct path to take? Payoff the 3 other debts with the tax refund to keep us able to pay new mortgage and maintain budget/bills/long term debt payoff?

I have been making the minimum monthly payment for these loans, but I am getting frustrated that the principal is not going down fast enough. I want to become more aggressive with paying these off, but am unsure where to start. Is it a good idea to start with lowering my 401K contribution? I know it's best to start investing as much as possible in retirement as early as possible, which is why I put so much towards it to begin with.

I'm 21 so at 18, this was the first car I ever have financed. My dad helped me with the down payment and I was approved without a cosigner which I believe was because of the large down payment, since I did have credit however it wasn't very established. So they gave me an interest rate of 10.49%.

Fast forward a year(2014) and my credit had grown exponentially better, and I wanted to refinance. I sat down with an employee and she advised against it, almost to the point where she wouldn't do it if I pressed her to. Until this day, I still don't understand fully what she meant even though I had her repeat it to me 3 times. She said the equity of the car is greater than what it would be worth if you were to refinance it. I bought my car for around 8k, 3k was put down, and I'm currently paying $115 a month for it. While this is extremely affordable, the interest rate in my opinion is way high, why pay extra when I know I don't have to?

Now the topic of interest rates has come up in conversation recently with my boyfriend and he said they just told me that to milk the money out of me, and that I should be able to refinance with no problem. He said I could definitely be paying a lot less, and now I'm considering going back and trying to refinance again. However I don't want to sound like an idiot if they try to sell me the same spiel.

Is this a legitimate reason to not refinance, or are they just out for my money? I only have about 1 1/2 years until it's paid off.

**TL;DR: financed car at 10.49%, want to refinance for a lower interest rate ~2 years later out of a 4 year loan.

personalfinance,23 year old student desperate for vehicle loan advice!,"Hi r/personalfinance! As stated I am 23 year old engineering student planning a transfer from CC to University by next semester (Fall 2016). I am finding it difficult to take on more than a 10 unit/semester workload and it's taking me too long to graduate. Financially, I can't afford to study at University for longer than 2 years (expenses and living situation). To cut to the chase, I am looking to cut my work hours to about 15 hours/week in a paid internship (plan on applying to internships at engineering firms after I have transferred to University) so that I can take on a greater workload at school (15-20 units/semester).
      I currently work 30 hours/week bringing home $1,800 a month after taxes. I have a car loan that I am upside down roughly $5k on and I need a means of transportation considering I live in the LA area. 

This is where I need your help r/personalfinance!

     I am essentially looking to get rid of my CURRENT car and purchase a cheap car/motorcycle for roughly around $3k-$5k cash.
So far these are the best options I have come up with to accomplish this.

Amount owed on current car: $21,500
Car Retail Value: $16,000-$18,000

Credit Score Range: Experian 710, Transunion 725
I could REALLY use a loan that would allow me to defer my payments until AFTER graduation, however I understand that federal student loans aren't allowed to be used on automotive. Does anyone know of a loan that would allow me to defer payments to cover the difference upside-down amount until AFTER graduation?

I have already been approved for personal loan of $5,000 for 3 years at 9% APR by my bank to pay for upside-down difference. (I have 60 days to decide whether I want to take the loan or not)
(Also looking to shop around considering 9% may be high for my credit score)
Savings: $4,000


A) (Most Ideal)
    Sell car privately for roughly $16-$18k
    Take out loan to cover the difference of upside down amount
    Purchase other vehicle in personal cash (savings) for around $3-5k
    Work 20hrs/wk study 15-20 units/semester
 
B) Sell current car to dealer for roughly $15-$16k
    Take out loan for difference
    Purchase vehicle in cash for $3-$5k
    Work 20 hrs/wk take 15-20 units/semester

D) Loan assumption-someone takes over my payments? is this possible?
     Purchase vehicle with personal savings
     Work 20 hrs/wk and school 15-20 units/semester

D) Keep current vehicle @ $380 a month and continue to study 10 units a semester to attain my degree after 3-4 years while working 30 hrs/week.

To give a more descriptive background on my financial situation, I live at home with my dad (don't plan on that changing over the course of 2-3 years) and only have to pay for my car payment and gas and school (books, fees, etc.). I am preapproved to have my tuition covered at University via FAFSA. The only debt I have is my $22k car loan. What should I do!?

I really need some sound advice considering I really need to accelerate my degree and complete it!

Thanks for your time r/personalfinance!

Under federal (US) law, I am a convicted felon. I can vote, but cannot own a gun, and certain licensing boards have to deny me if I try to go into certain fields. I got into tech, doing an interesting mix of IT/tech support/system administration/infosec/security, and love what I do. However, I made more money at 20 years old working fast food (with overtime) than I do now at 25 working here. I haven't been here too long, and have received a couple COL raises, but: I took a big hit when I entered the industry. I'm making 33% less (on average) of people with the same skill set and job function. 

I understood I was going to take this hit, and it would get me in the door. I can take what I've learned here and go elsewhere and double my salary if they are okay with the record. However, I do not want to leave, I love my job.  

So my question is how to approach this at my next review? I knew I'd take the hit, but I know I've proven myself very valuable, and they're trusting me with tasks they don't trust people who have been there for much longer to do, and I'm working way past the scope of my employment agreement. I'd like to climb up in salary, but I also know that there's a very valid reason I'm being paid so little.

After more research about investing and learning about options, I wanted to switch to TD Ameritrade for their cheaper commissions and to use their Think or Swim platform so I opened an account with them at the end of January. I completed the dough options course for the certificate to use, and transferred some money to start off the account. Everything was going smoothly and I started using their paper trading on TOS to practice learning their platform while I was waiting for them to approve me for options trading then one day I tried logging in and it was saying that my login was incorrect, which it wasn't. I called them and they told me that my account was frozen and they were not able to give me any information on the phone and that I would be receiving information in the mail. They told me it was sent out on February 2nd and I still have not received any letter about what to do. To add insult to injury, I have received several things from them welcoming me to TD Ameritrade including a stuffed monkey, a letter saying I've been approved for different types of options and also options trading manuals and information/magazines. This is making me very stressed out because I have no idea wtf is going on. They won't tell me anything over the phone and I don't have access to the funds that I transferred. I don't know if I'm being impatient or being the worry-wart than I am but I feel like 24 days is plenty of time for me to receive the mail considering I have received everything else they sent me and I had just opened the account a few days before it was frozen so I was wondering if anyone has some advice or insight on what I can do to calm my nerves.",finance,1456545460
personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Idea: Does this make sense?,"So I'm in the process of paying down my loans, had been doing the standard avalanche system. However, I think I came up with a decent idea, and need someone to tell me if its crazy.

Ok my highest interest loan is about to be (mercifully) be killed off, so I have two loans left, they are (roughly):

1. $20k 6% (fixed) to the US Govt/Great Lakes
2. $40k 4.5% (variable) to Sallie Mae (aka private loan)

So the conventional avalanche wisdom is to pay off the higher interest Great Lakes loan first, right? But there are a couple of positives to waiting with that loan:

1. It's a government loan so it gets all of those advantages
2. Great Lakes lets you pay above your monthly minimum with a credit card so you can get cash back, effectively lowering your interest rate.
3. It's a fixed rate so I don't have to worry about it going up in the meantime

If I use, say, the citi double cash back card, I can get 2% back on my great lakes payments. This effectively lowers the interest rate on that to 4%, below the Sallie Mae number. Obviously its slightly more complicated than that, but doing it this way also gets rid of a private variable rate loan quicker.

Am I missing something or does this seem like a good plan?",finance,1456548485

personalfinance,"[student, 21] Feeling overwhelmed by personal finance- please help!","I am currently 21, and I have one semester left of college. I began college immediately after high school and chose a small liberal arts college because I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I eventually decided on philosophy because I hated it the least/sometimes enjoyed it. I'm bracing myself for criticism, but it seems that philosophy is at least somewhat applicable to many fields even though there aren't many professions that strictly deal with philosophy in and of itself. I also believe that I would not be able to finish school if I had not chosen this major, as I really hate school and have somewhat of an affinity for the subject. Philosophy makes it bearable. I have taken this semester off from school for mental health reasons, but I have one semester left and I intend to finish my degree in the fall. I have about $23,000 in debt (all in federal loans, which are currently deferred) from this degree. This is my only debt. Right now I am living at home with my parents and I have a job, so I am able to accrue some money without immediately spending.

I really don't know what I should do about my current situation. Having the debt makes me anxious, but I also don't technically have to make payments on it yet. I would like to save up for a car and to move out hopefully pretty soon after I graduate, but I don't know if it would be wiser to put all the 'excess' money I am making right now toward paying off my loans. I've also been thinking about getting a credit card to build up my credit, but it is a very scary prospect to me and I'm worried that I would screw myself over somehow. My parents have also advised against me getting one. I don't really have anyone I can go to for financial advice who I know I can trust. My parents are both teachers and have done okay for themselves, but do have some credit card debt. There has always been at least a minor amount of financial stress in the household, so I don't exactly want to follow in their footsteps. 

I'm lost on what my first steps should be. Ideally, I would like to get a decent job right after graduation, but I still don't know what I really want to do for a living and I feel like I've sunk too much time and money into my degree to give up on it now. I have over $1000 right now, sitting in my checking account. The emergency fund doesn't seem applicable in my situation, since I am living with my parents, have no car, and have good health insurance from my parents. I've read through some of the sidebar links, but I am still feeling lost and overwhelmed. Much of the advice is subjective and I don't know how I should apply it in my situation. I've thought about consulting a credit union, but I don't know how trustworthy they are or how helpful that would be. I would really appreciate any advice you guys have to offer.

politics,The tax analyses of Bernie's proposals aren't including the money we're saving from no longer having to purchase health insurance. I spoke with someone at the Tax Foundation and confirmed that at least their's didn't.,"About a month ago the Tax Foundation released [this](http://taxfoundation.org/article/details-and-analysis-senator-bernie-sanders-s-tax-plan) analysis of Bernie's tax plan. I read it a few times and noticed that while they talked about wage decreases, they didn't say anything about increases in gross pay stemming from insurance deductions no longer coming out of employee paychecks. Someone re-posted it yesterday morning on /r/politics, and I decided to reach out to someone involved in the analysis. Maybe they did include it in their analysis, but never explicitly mentioned it? I contacted the analyst with the Tax Foundation who ran the numbers to find out.

From me to him:

&gt;I came across your analysis of Senator Sanders' proposals, and I have a question. You said that his policies would lower wages by about 4.5%. Is that including any savings from no longer needing to purchase health insurance (which we're required to by law and that the Supreme Court upheld as a tax)?

From him to me:

&gt;This is an excellent question - the 4.5 percent figure only reflects the macroeconomic effects of the Sanders plan on wages. It does not reflect the fact that many employers will likely stop purchasing health insurance and will push wages upwards as a result.

From me to him:

&gt;That makes sense, it'd be a difficult thing to estimate how employers would pass on those savings to their employees; would it be 1:1 or some other ratio or would they do it at all? I would certainly hope they would, since a good argument can be made that healthcare benefits are part of an employee's compensation package, but you can't say with much confidence beforehand.

&gt;However, that wasn't exactly what I asking about, so my apologies if I wasn't clear! 

&gt;As I understand it, Senator Sanders' proposal would place a roughly 2.5% payroll tax on employees. The median household in terms of income ($52,000, or so I thought) would be paying an extra $1300 to the federal government because of that payroll tax. Now, according to KFF, ""The average premium for single coverage in 2015 is $521 per month, or $6,251 per year. The average premium for family coverage is $1,462 per month or $17,545 per year."" If those are gone, wouldn't that median household's gross income (by which I mean take home pay after taxes, retirement contributions, and other deductions) increase anywhere from about $5,000 to $15,000 (depending if single or a family, given KFF's numbers)?

&gt;Granted, yes, not everyone is going to see savings like that seeing as it's funded via a progressive structure and some are fortunate enough to have employers who cover their healthcare almost entirely (in which case, the 6.5% tax on their end will likely be a savings for those employers). But when I read that wages would decrease 4.5% in the aggregate because of the policy, I was curious if that was also taking account the above phenomenon because I can see a scenario where it could increase gross wages in the aggregate.

&gt;http://kff.org/report-section/ehbs-2015-section-one-cost-of-health-insurance/

From him to me:

&gt;The 4.5 percent wage decrease figure is only referring to the wages that employers pay employees, not to gross household income.
 
&gt;In general, our analysis of the Sanders plan only reflects the taxes that households would pay and the economic effects of these taxes, and not any changes in the healthcare system. We have no idea whether the healthcare coverage offered by the Sanders plan would be more or less generous than Americans’ current coverage, or what co-pays and deductibles it might include. Therefore, we’ve chosen not to make any assumptions about how much the healthcare component of the Sanders plan would make Americans better off.",finance,1456586242

I currently have an auto loan that I'm considering refinancing and I have a few questions. 

Background:

Before anyone hates on me for purchasing a new car, just know that I'm a great financial situation (thanks to this sub!). I make a high income for my age and geographical area ($60k at age 23 in a cheap area) and the vast majority of my disposable income goes into retirement saving and I have a 6 month efund. I rarely spend money on ANYTHING. My fiancé gets aggrevated sometimes bc I'm sooooo cheap.

Well, I had a POS old 4 cylinder Altima that I drove all thru college and I absolutely hated it (again, I'm obsessed with cars). I then got my first job out of college making a very high income with absolutely no debt. (Thanks parents and scholarships). I still drove the Altima until it finally just gave out. 

So, I went to the dealer and bought my DREAM car for $23k brand new (talked him down from $27k. Even walked out twice). I put down $5,000 and my monthly payment is a lowly $278. But, my credit history was extremely new. So even though I had a high income, my interest rate was like 4.5%. 

I have like $14k left on the note, and my credit has skyrocketed since I first got the car (from a 620 to a 750). I'm just wondering if it's worth refinancing and how that process actually works administratively. My loan is simple interest and I can get a payoff offer on GM's website. Does that have anything to do with refinancing? Will a credit union handle everything with GM to take over the loan or is this is a lengthy process for myself?

financialindependence,"31 (UK), just bought apartment and now seriously considering FI and looking at best next steps - would welcome advice","**Life situation:** 31; male; cohabiting with girlfriend; no dependants (and we’re probably unlikely to have children); live and work in London UK.

**FIRE progress:** full paid off student loan for both of us, £50k pension (though I can only access this at 55 under uk law) girlfriend’s pension is defined benefit depending on her final salary; £20k savings currently in cash as emergency funds (buying house 6 months ago wiped all my previous savings up to that point).  Neither me nor my girlfriend have any reasonable prospect of any significant inheritance so we need to make our own way.

**Gross Salary/Wages:** I put 10% gross into pension and employer matches with 5%, so total 15% (£14,250).  Basic gross salary is £95k (me) and £35k (girlfriend), so £130k combined.  Bonuses occasionally but these aren't anything significant and I work on the assumption that I will get nothing or a single digit (i.e. sub £10k) annual bonus after tax.

**Yearly Savings Amounts:** Since I purchased my apartment I have been putting c. £2,500 per month into savings, which is generally what's left after bills and spending (for per annum calculation I multiply by 10 to allow for holidays / Christmas / birthdays and other general leakage, so c.£25k per annum).  I'm expecting a pay rise later this year that should allow me to save c. £3,000 per month (i.e. c. £30k per annum).  Girlfriend saves little (£00s) as, given the smaller amount she earns, it's much harder for her.  As a result, I'm calculating this based on my savings alone; what she contributes is a bonus for us both.

**Other Ordinary Income:** None.

**Rental Income, Actual Expenses and Depreciation:** No rental income.  

**Current Expenses:** 10% gross salary goes immediately into pension (see above).  £1,200 each per annum travel costs (no car, this is public transport for London).  Mortgage of £1,700 per month plus service charge of £300 per month (therefore c. £2,000 per month in aggregate) - I'm 6 months into a 25 year mortgage.  On top of this me and the girlfriend generally have around c.£1,200 in spending - bills, shopping and general living expenses - though this varies each month.

**Assets:** Only asset is our apartment.  Bought for c. £570,000.  We put down 10% (c. £60k) and we have (i) a mortgage loan for 75% and (ii) an equity loan from the government for 15% (c. £85k, which is interest free for the first 5 years and thereafter attracts interest at 1.75% with such rate then increasing by inflation).  The principal reason I took out an equity loan is because it allowed me to get a 75% mortgage which significantly lowered the mortgage interest rate and therefore the monthly repayments.  However, this equity loan can only be paid off in one lump sum, it has to be repaid either on or before the mortgage is repaid and the amount to be repaid is 15% of the price of my apartment at the time it is repaid (i.e. it can go up or down depending on property price at time of repayment).  Given London property price increases in the past it is my aim to pay this off as soon as possible to avoid it potentially becoming an extremely expensive loan!

**Liabilities**: other than mortgage I have no borrowings.

**Specific Questions**: My question really is what I should best do with the annual amount I am currently saving given my general desire to become financially independent at some stage, and whether what I've set out below is financially sensible.  I'm currently thinking of taking the following approach:

* Pay off the equity loan: once I have enough saved to pay off the equity loan, I should clear this straight away.  Although I think I'm sensible in taking this approach (though I welcome any criticisms!), I have to admit that the thought of my savings dropping back to £0 again (as they did when I bought the apartment) will be extremely disheartening, as it continues to (mentally at least) restart any date for financial independence;
* Overpay on the mortgage: once I have paid off the equity loan I will then try to overpay a bit on the mortgage (not all but a small portion of my monthly savings); and
* Financial independence: my aim is to become financially independent as soon as possible (sub-55 at least) and therefore paying off the mortgage early will help that immensely.  I'm looking at c.£30-40k safe withdrawal rate, but given that this requires a £750k-£1M pot, I think this may be optimistic.

Anyway, as I'm not about to start on properly saving and investing, I just wanted to run the above by you guys as if I'm hopefully misguided in my analysis I can at least start making amends now !",finance,1456602507

personalfinance,Got myself into a tax bind - what are the repercussions of not paying quarterly taxes as a self-employed individual?,"I plan on talking to a CPA about this, but i'm trying to figure out at least generally where I stand before going into that conversation. 

I'm admittedly pretty terrible with my personal finances - and made some very poor choices last year (my first full year living on my own)....I actually did probably the dumbest thing possible. Around April I was booking a big vacation for the summer, and needed some extra cash in a hurry. I made the brilliant decision to change my W-2 to max allowances, in order to lower my withholdings.  I planned to only keep it like that for a few paycheck cycles and just make up the difference at the end of the year (I usually get a small refund anyway so I didn't think it was that big of a deal).  Well - out of sight, out of mind - I never changed it back (I know, it was idiotic).

So last year I ended up making $46,190 in W2 income, and only had ~$1666.71 in Federal Taxes withheld. Additionally, I made ~$11,000 in 1099 income doing freelance consulting work on the side, and ~$1600 from renting out my roommates room to Airbnb when he was gone. 

After doing a quick Turbo Tax evaluation, I believe I will owe ~$7,000.  

So this year, I cut back my spending substantially, and have been saving every penny I can towards paying this tax bill. I think I should be able to get the money to Together by April. 

My problem is this - At the end of January I left my W-2 job to pursue my consulting business full time. I will have made ~$5500 in January, ~$6500 this month, and expect about the same next month.  Problem is, I don't think I'll be able to afford my tax bill for last years return AND quarterly taxes for the first 3 months of this year. 

I'm just trying to figure out what  happens if I don't pay quarterly taxes this quarter and make up the difference next quarter.",finance,1456605796

personalfinance,Getting an auto loan as a student,"Totaled my car not too long ago.  I wasn't at fault, but I am finding myself in a tough spot now trying to finance a new car.  I bought my car two years ago with a $6,000 loan at ~7% interest rate.  Not the best but I had no credit and figured I would be in a better place when I needed to buy again someday.  Welp, that is not the case.  Now I am in veterinary school with no income, just a stipend I live off of which I receive as a loan, and I don't have any family to ask to co-sign. I am having the worst time trying to find a loan for about $7,000 for a decent used car-- insurance is giving me enough money after paying off my previous loan for a small down payment.  I have been denied for loans left and right, the only auto loan I have been approved for is a 19% interest rate (yikes!).

I live with my parents still, and my only regular expenses are car payment and insurance (about $500 total per month). The only major savings goal I have will be to pay for my master's degree (around $25k) so I was wondering how would be best to pay off my current loans. 

The interest rate is under 4% for about $8k and over 4% for the rest (max of 5.8% on a $3k loan). I was planning to just pay them off as quickly as possible (a couple of months with my current income and savings), but I have heard that paying them off that quickly can be worse for your credit than paying them off over time. How quickly is too quickly for paying them off? 

I will for sure be paying off the highest rate loan as I didn't need to take that one out anyway (University told me I was not going to receive some money I had previously received, and then changed their minds so I ended up with a loan I didn't need)",finance,1456610180

personalfinance,Should I consolidate defaulted student loans? I am not eligible for loan rehab,"I owe about 40K in student loan debt. I defaulted, then did the rehabilitation program, then I messed up and got into collections after I got a new job and couldn't afford the payments. I am no longer eligible to join the rehab program.

A few years later, I have a better paying job and have been paying my collections agency (ACT) on time - unfortunately I cannot pay the 40K in full or over a few years. 

I was told by the collections company and the Dept of Ed that I could loan consolidation which would get me out of default but I am confused on whether or not:

1) I need pay all of the interest fees that have accrued over the years (around 8K). Do I?
2) My interest rate increases. Everyone tells me my interest rate is low at less than 3%. If my interest rate is low now what is the benefit of consolidation?
3) After consolidation does my monthly payment go up? 
4) If my income increases does my monthly payment go up?

I plan to get married within 2 years and don't want my poor credit or defaulted loans to affect our future. 

I see many posts about choosing rehabilitation over consolidation but other than being out of default, improving my credit rating and self esteem I am not sure what financial benefits or disadvantages there are about the benefits of loan consolidation after default.

personalfinance,Unique Ways to Refinance Student Debt?,"Hello PF!

My SO and I have a lot of combined student loan debt at relatively high rates ($252k @ 6.5% average rate).  Our current income is about $200k combined.

We're both very financially responsible, educated professionals.  We have untarnished credit histories and credit scores of 800+.  

However, we're stuck in the very shitty situation of not being able to refinance our federal student debt to reasonable rates because of asinine Department of Education policies.

We're looking for unique ways to use our good credit to refinance this debt on our own.  We have already contacted the majority of the companies that advertise refinancing of student debt, but the rates we've been offered are terrible!  There seems little reason to give up federal protections on so much debt for a 1-2% reduction in the interest rate.

We've also approached our various financial institutions offering to sell the loans to them/do a private refinance, but we've met nearly no interest (unbelievable!)

What other unique ways exist for pulling off a refinance?  We'd like to use our good credit to our advantage, and we're definitely looking for any strategies to achieve a refinance, even a partial refinance. Are there other kinds of financial arrangements or instruments that could be used in unintended ways to help us?

personalfinance,"Finally on my own, making about $50K take-home salary after taxes and a maxed-out 401(k). I still feel like I won't be able to afford a down payment on a house or college for my children.","Edited to add more details at the end.

---

I'm really new to personal finance going beyond having a monthly budget to keep my daily expenses in check while I went through college. Now that I'm working, I'm spending more on entertainment and things like gifts for family and friends for holidays and birthdays which don't easily fit into a monthly expense structure anymore so Mint is less helpful now and I'm looking at coming up with an annual budget to cover things beyond my monthly expenses, but I have no idea what would be reasonable for that, so I'm trying to figure out how much I need to save every year.

I'm sorry if the following is really disorganized but I'm just feeling lost and uneducated so I'm hoping for some help.

Some background:

I recently finished school and started work. Because my parents made a college savings account with guaranteed tuition, my tuition was effectively free for me. Through working as a TA and internships I was able to afford the rest of my expenses on my own after the first two years of college. I actually graduated with some savings. I went on a 3-week trip to Japan that cost me $5000 all together and still had some savings after that.

I don't regret that trip at all and I feel like I'm in good shape overall, but my parents are super neurotic about savings so any time I make a large expense like that trip or buying a plane ticket for my girlfriend to visit me or for me to visit my girlfriend (she is still in school), they make a comment about my savings.

So I listed out some large mid-term savings goals: down payment for house, college for 2 kids, etc. I'm not yet married so I'm not yet figuring in a spouse's earnings, and I haven't accounted for bonuses or pay raises. Just based on what I'm making now.

Assuming I want to buy a house here in 5 years, and because down payments in this market around here tend to be enormous, I'm thinking I need to have 200K saved up. After my expenses, I'm currently at a rate of saving about $20K per year. Clearly that isn't going to cut it.

I haven't invested any of my savings yet, but my savings account balance is growing and I feel I should invest. How can I strategize to be able to afford the down payment on the house? And down the road, college for the kids.

On an extended estimate, if I put two children through college: being conservative, I'll say it will probably cost about $50K per year per child (it's impossible to tell how expensive college will be in 20 years). By the end of them both being through college I will have gone into debt paying for it. This is assuming my monthly expenses stay the same after I have children, which is not going to be true.

My girlfriend will be a teacher and has a lot of college debt so I'm not counting on her income going towards our combined savings for the next 10 years or so. A strategy about what to do about her debt is also something I'm interested in. She's currently planning to pay $1000 per month towards her debt, which she will be able to afford on her salary because she will be living with me and I will pay the majority of the rent. Is there a benefit to her paying so much, or would she be better of investing some of her money and letting it grow? I've heard that if a loan has an interest rate of 3% or less, you should invest in something worth more than 3% expected return, and pay less toward the loan on a monthly basis. Some are deferred-interest loans, but if she waits to pay them there will still be relatively more interest when it starts accruing, right?

So, I'm interested in:

* Affording a house down-payment
* Advice for my girlfriend on how she can manage her debt
* Advice for how to invest and help my savings grow so that I can afford college for my children

Any other advice like other big expenses I'm not accounting for would be helpful as well. (I already own a car and I'm making monthly payments, which accounts for part of my monthly expenses.)

---

**Edit:**

The initial responses have told me that I'm likely way off my rocker and I'll be just fine. It also tells me I have a lot to learn about managing my money and expectations of how much I'll need to save.

This is all very encouraging.

To help us get past the apparent excess of a down payment on a home, I want to add more info so we can focus on my questions on debt and investing.

I'm making about $100K base salary. I can expect about a 10% bonus and 2-3% raise each year assuming I stay in the same position. I assume by the time I'm realistically looking at buying a house (5 years or so), I'll be making around $150K.

My take home pay is currently about $50K. I'm saving about $20K of my take home pay annually.

The median list price of a 2 bedroom in this area is $600K. I was aiming at between $500K-$600K. Anecdotally I have heard because of a huge demand for houses in this area it is not unusual to need to put down $200K on a $500K house because you are essentially in a bidding war with other interested buyers. I'm happy to hear that is way more than I actually realistically need to put down on a house. If I reduce my expected down payment to $100K everything looks fine down the road including the cost of college for 2 kids.

I will consider reducing my 401(k) contributions if it looks like a problem, but now that I feel like I'm a lot closer to being able to afford all this, I'll focus on smaller things like managing my monthly costs like food. I've been eating out too much and food is much more expensive here than where I used to live.",finance,1456623636

The spread with treasuries is really wide, and stocks still seem overpriced historically","Recently Paul Krugman argued ""Don't be afraid of bonds. The fear of a spike in interest rates is implausible. Lock in relatively high interest rates in advanced countries where they can still be found""

Given the (still) relatively high price of shares and the dim prospects for interest rates over the next five years, this is looking pretty good to me. I predict low growth over that time period, but the fears of a big downturn seem overblown. The spread between corporate bond interest rates and treasury bills is very high right now, but recent indicators show the economy actually isn't doing all that badly, and the odds of a recession in the next year are still pretty low.

I am in early 30s' and married and have a stable job in high-tech and live in CA. My Income is pretty decent  (150 K+/Year, though I feel lot of goes to IRS and Feds). It is single income and my wife does not work. I have bought a 5-year old used car with 60K miles which I drove another 70K miles.

Now I am planning to buy one of certified user cars from dealership (I don't like  buying anything 5k+ from private parties on craigslist since I am not sure about condition of the car).  It costs around 25K+. I am left with few options:

1. Pay in-cash everything as I have cash with me. But I would like to avoid it as I might need part of the money for down-payment  in may be a year or so.

2. Lease the car. I dont know if it is easy to lease a certified pre-owned car. I do plan to keep the car at the end of lease and buy it. Is it a better option if I need to delay the payment for 2-3 years?

3. BMW Select Program: This is where I pay small  payments for 2-3 years and pay a final ballon amount. 

4. Finance: This is an option I want to avoid due to religious issues (cannot pay interest). If there is possibility to throw in $500 (yes, give money to the dealership) or something and get a 0% APR, I can make it work. Does this work?

My goal is to delay the payment and avoid paying upfront taxes.

which is best option here for me? I would like to hear any comments/suggestions.

In 1983 Rich and partner Pincus Green were indicted on 65 criminal counts, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo (at a time when Iranian revolutionaries were still holding American citizens hostage). The charges would have led to a sentence of more than 300 years in prison had Rich been convicted on all counts. The indictment was filed by then-U.S. Federal Prosecutor (and future mayor of New York City) Rudolph Giuliani. At the time it was the biggest tax evasion case in U.S. history.

Hearing of the plans for the indictment, Rich fled to Switzerland and, always insisting that he was not guilty, never returned to the U.S. to answer the charges. Rich's companies eventually pled guilty to 35 counts of tax evasion and paid $90 million in fines, although Rich himself remained on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Ten Most-Wanted Fugitives List for many years, narrowly evading capture in Britain, Germany, Finland, and Jamaica. Fearing arrest, he did not even return to the United States to attend his daughter's funeral in 1996.

On January 20, 2001, hours before leaving office, U.S. President Bill Clinton granted Rich a highly controversial presidential pardon. Several of Clinton's strongest supporters distanced themselves from the decision. Former President Jimmy Carter, a fellow Democrat, said, ""I don't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts. In my opinion, that was disgraceful."" Clinton himself later expressed regret for issuing the pardon, saying that ""it wasn't worth the damage to my reputation.""

Clinton's critics alleged that Rich's pardon had been bought, as Denise Rich had given more than $1 million to Clinton's political party (the Democratic Party), including more than $100,000 to the Senate campaign of the president's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and $450,000 to the Clinton Library foundation during Clinton's time in office.

politics,"Is America becoming a slave nation, again? Where's the AFL-CIO when you need them?","Here's a preposition for you that is almost too preposterous to believe, but it indeed appears to be more fact than fantasy.  What if the ""end game"" for the U.S. military and DOJ is to eliminate our basic civil rights and create a slave nation with one singular purpose, war.  

It's Orwellian and dystopic to be sure, but that does seem to be the direction the current administration is intent on going.  The gradual erosion of our civil rights with one frivolous lawsuit after another, like the one that has come before the courts today by the FBI and tech giant Apple.

If we take into account the ACLU's battle against the Department of Defense and contractors like Raytheon for their crowdsourcing programs aimed at surreptitious ""crowd control"" via networked computer software including social media, as well as local law enforcement and their adoption of crowdsourcing, then this idea seems much more plausible.

Should the FBI succeed in their demand to force Apple employees to design code for them what impact would this have on the American people?  Is this a slippery slope to forced slave labor?  

In 2010 and 2011 the U.S. utilized crowdsourcing techniques to wage cyberwars against countries like Iran.  The Iranians called one of the viruses that were launched against it ""Flame.""  The U.S. social engineered non-military, often children, to fight these high tech online battles and no one was paid one dime, well except the social engineers.  

It was around this same time that legions of hackers launched the Stuxnet virus against massive corporations.  Many of the hacker groups were traced back to DOJ and Eric Holder who was running these secret operations against corporations and the American people.  Identity theft, extortion, DDoS attacks, infrastructure take downs.  

This case that is before the federal courts is most definitely a slippery slope and will lead to a labor force devoid of human rights worse than what China and some other countries have.  I think the potential to cause irreparable damage far out weighs the potential good if the original order issued against Apple is enforced.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNfuplRB2GI

Judge it for yourself, but I don't think it's mean or nasty at all so much as a damning indictment of her record. Period.

I mean with her record on the Crime Bill, with it's 3-strikes provision, it's mandatory minimum sentencing, including the 100-to-1 sentencing ratio for crack-cocaine offenses vs. powder cocaine offenses, the Welfare Reform Law that funneled money for public housing &amp; child welfare into beefing up &amp; expanding the prison system, &amp; these other example from Michelle Alexander herself:

""The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense—an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities.

Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the “one strike and you’re out” initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense.""

Hillary Clinton wasn't just a traditional First Lady in the White House. She was one of Bill Clinton's most influential political &amp; policy advisers. She deserves to be taken to the woodshed on these policies.

politics,"2 Economic Sytems: one for the super rich, one for everyone else.","For those that don't know, Alice Walton pays a lower percent tax than you do. In fact, it's about half of someone making $120,000 as a single person.

Someone making $120,000 pays 15% SS &amp; Medi, and 20% Income tax (roughly) for an average tax of 35%.

This murderer, on the other-hand, gets a tax break from being 'too wealthy' that caps her max rate at 23%.

BUT - THERE - IS - HOPE

Bernie Sanders is the ONLY candidate that believes Alice Walton should pay her fair share in taxes. In fact, he wants her to not only pay as much tax as you do, but more, up to 67%, or **200% more than she pays now**.

And for the first time in 20 years, Alice Walton would not pay less % tax than the 99.9%. Hope that's not too single issue for you. To put it another way, the Average America pays roughly their net worth in taxes each year. For example, the person making $120,000 will pay $42,000 (roughly) in SS, Medi, &amp; Income taxes. And it wouldn't be too surprising for this persons net worth to be $42,000 or less.

**The rich are taxed totally differently.** They profit, or get paid, off growth, not income. For example, Zuckerberg became a billionaire before Fbook made a dime in profit. That is because of projections, etc. All the same, the federal government didn't see a dime in business tax.

Then those stocks were sold, and Zuckerberg made long term capital gains, capped at a max rate of 23%. A fucking MAX rate, without a cent of contribution to Social Security, which is 12% alone for most Americans.

And Republicans call this 'double taxation'. Mark paid 23% on his billions, and you pay 30% on $60,000.

But here's the real kick in the nuts. That 23%, since it is on income, not growth, is likely less than 1% of his fortune. In other words, even if his fortune grew at a rate of just 2% a year, he'd be well above his taxes paid. Comparatively workers are taxed at roughly 100% of their fortune, whereas the rich 1% or less.

Example:

Zuckerberg worth = $35.7 Billion. I can say with full confidence he has likely not paid even 1% of his worth in taxes, or $357 Million, annually where as if someone had earned that same amount of money working, they would have paid roughly 40% or $14.3 Billion instantly.

Under Bernie's tax plan Mark would pay at a Max rate of 67%, which effectively makes his taxes paid as a percent of wealth, roughly 2% annually (up from 1%).

All American's earning under $250,000 won't be affected at all.

personalfinance,Best credit card or financing options?,"I am trying to find what the best credit card is for me in my given situation. I recently got promoted and now make 53k a year. I have good credit as I have paid off all of my school loans. I've only had a debit card and I am looking to get a credit card.

The purpose for me to have the credit card would be to pay off monthly bills that I already pay with a debit card so I can maintain or increase my credit.

Additionally, if I could find a way to do this without hurting credit I would like to Purchase a new bicycle (anywhere from 3000-5000k I know I'm into higher end fancy bikes but it's what I like). Ideally if I could pay this off in small chunks per month and not pay all at once is what I am looking for. So I guess I need something with a small interest rate.

personalfinance,25 y/o trying to figure out budget and future - where do I go from here?,"Hi everyone,

I use this subreddit as a huge inspiration to keep me going and to help me figure out my budget, where I've gone wrong, and how to make better choices. You had a heavy influence on me earlier this month - I received a $2.5k federal tax return (due to an error made on my part with a HORRIBLE state health insurance system) and while I really wanted to use it to but parts for my car, I used it to pay off my credit card debt in full.

From here, I'm kind of stuck. I have experienced a lot of change in my life - received a degree in graphic design, spent a year in the field and hated it (I enjoyed paper media, which is dying and was left with only front end Web Development which I had no experience in). In October, I started as a CSA at a local bank and love it, and was informed that in April I will be moved up to a Senior CSA with a small pay raise. I live under very tight means, but still try to put $10 in my savings biweekly and contribute 1% to my 401k (company offers up to 4% match). Things are getting more tight though, and I need help. I'm so sorry for the book I just typed out as well!

Here's my monthly budget. I live with my long term  boyfriend, who is able to help me at times. I make $1480 per month, not including OT and sales bonuses.

Rent - $700 (lease up in June and we are looking for a cheaper place, but enjoy the comfort this one offers. In order to be at 28% of wages before taxes, I need this to be at $560 a month or less.)

Apartment Insurance - $18.55 every 3 months

Electric - $65 (budget plan)

Gas - $27.50 (budget plan)

Phone Insurance - $10

Car payment - $350 (made a stupid decision and bought a 2009 Subaru WRX, but it brings me tons of joy at a cost. Parents currently assist me by paying $250 a month, and I am able to pay them back afterwards at my leisure. Car is also set to be paid off 6 months in advance, so March of 2018).

Car insurance - $55

Motorcycle insurance - $75 per year (motorcycle is owned outright and just changed plan, I owe $37.50 in April and then I don't pay until next year)

Private Student loan - $201.25

Gas - $80

Food - $80

If I remember properly, that makes my costs around $1365 a month, with a little wiggle room for unexpected bills (for example, I owe my doctor $100 for a psychiatric visit. Having severe anxiety and depression on top of this blows.)

Here's the issue. My federal loans reach the end of forbearance in June, and I have done this for 3 years so I am not able to do this anymore. I am hoping to apply for income based repayment, putting the costs between $150 to $200... which does not fit into my current budget.

I guess I'm freaking out at this point and wondering if I'm on the right track. I would like to consider buying a house in the next 5 years, and that doesn't look like it will ever be obtainable. I would appreciate any advice towards better decisions for my future. Thanks!",finance,1456676486

personalfinance,Frustrated with parents,"My parents are a struggle to deal with. They are now into their early 70's now. My mom is passive and operates on a middle school level IQ, while my father has a spending problem. Almost like gambling. He gets off buying expensive things, but then regrets it later and ends up in financial trouble. 
Both parents are working class......worked hard jobs. My mom never cleared an annual salary of $19k her entire life of working. Very sad. 
So my parents always lived above their means. They would buy and buy things and eventually get into financial trouble. They never saved. My dad had a habit of cashing in the 401k more than a couple of times. 
At least once a decade they would go into Bankruptcy. This would have the benefit of forcing them to live within their means for a couple of years......but like a gambler......my Dad would court the car dealers trying to score a new vehicle. Usually he would get something new with a high interest rate. So this has been the cycle for the last 40 years. I learned from this and am the extreme opposite. Live within my means, save and keep debt low. 
When my parents hit their late 60's they were living in Florida, I tried to take a more active role in their finances. Tried to give advice, but it never seemed to stick.....they kept up with their destructive behaviors. 
As mentioned above my Dad has a issue with buying new cars. In the last 10 years they have gone through close to 15 cars. At one point they purchased a new honda......then 8 months later traded it for the same honda......year newer and that was the only difference. I thought it was the same car until I noticed the mileage was at 500 vs. 4500. 

So my Dad was worked until he hit 68. His vision deteriorated and he had to stop working for safety reasons. Just prior to stopping work he purchased a new F150 FORD for $30k. Then he lost his job and could not pay for it. So within 6 months of buying it he gave the truck back to the bank and went bankrupt over it. I was sick. In the end my Mom just goes along with everything and never speaks up. I feel bad for her that she busted her ass all her life and he just pisses the money away. 

After the bankruptcy, they started to live within their means again. I decided to try to be more active and try to help support my mom in keeping my Dad from screwing her over. My dad makes $1500 from social security and my mom makes $950 a month. They had a place they would afford. So I told my Mom they she should call me if he tries to buy a car. I would try to talk him out of it. 
Well, within a week of telling her this, I get a frantic call from her. They are at a dealership and he is doing loan paperwork. So I tell my mom to go sit in the car. I try calling my Dad.....he refuses to pickup his cell. So I tell my Mom to go in and hand her phone to him. He refuses to take the phone. So I tell her to give the phone to the manager. I talk to the manager and ask for details. I then proceed to tell him that the guy is 70 and is only living on $1500 social security and cannot afford a $30k truck. I then tell him about the bankruptcy the year prior. He claims this does not show up on the credit report. I am stunned! At this point, I decide I don't have many options for stopping this. My mom is sobbing. I tell my Mom to just take the car and go home. Leave him there. He can't trade the car if it is not in his posession. She is so scared, she just locks up and cries. So I have a aunt that lived 30 mins away. I call her and explain the situation and she drives over and physically pulls him out of the dealership. He is pissed. But the crises is averted. Then 2 days later, my mom calls me and tells me he purchased the truck. Ugh. I was pissed. I called him and gave him hell. Then gave up. Nothing I could do. 
6 months later he gave the truck back to the bank. They bought a new Honda before the credit agencies saw he gave the truck back. Sick twisted cycle continues.  

I really feel bad for my mom. She hasn't had an easy life. She will not leave him and to be honest, she does not have the money to support herself. My fear is that he will end up in a nursing home and they will take all of his social security which will leave my mom with little. 

I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing I can do and will let them continue to self destruct. I can't take on more children beyond my own kids. When he passes, I will have to help her pick up the pieces but I refuse to let his bad decisions impact my families future. I have told my Mom repeatedly, she cannot rely on me to support her or fix their financial mess. She has to be an adult. Kinda sucks.

personalfinance,"I was discharged from the ER a week and a half ago, and I'm not sure what I should be doing to prepare for/initiate the billing process?","Hi! I've been eyeing this subreddit for a while because I have a number of questions that I should probably be asking about 401Ks, credit, apartment-searching, car payments, car insurance, and student loans, but right now I'm here because I have a specific thing to worry about relating to an emergency room visit. So first; here's my basic finance info:

I'm 23; I make 4200 a month after taxes, and currently I have about 7,200 in the bank. 135 goes to monthly repeating bills: netflix, car insurance, and 'rent' at my mom's house. I owe ~$18,000 in student loans; monthly payment due is $319, technical *legal minimum* monthly payment is $50; in practice I've been paying about $2500 per month since I got my current job in July 2015. My W2 forms from 2014 showed about $9000 in income from two jobs at McDonald's and Max &amp; Erma's, so I'm not really accustomed to dealing with this 'real job' money yet.

What I came here to ask about today though; is how does ER billing work? How soon can I expect a a bill to show up? I have health insurance through United Healthcare via work, but I'm not sure how much of my visit they'll cover. 

I arrived in the ER at 9 PM on February 15th; my discharge papers say I was admitted on February 16 and discharged on February 17. They gave me a Potassium IV, a bunch of saline solution IV, two IV doses of one anti-nausea medicine called Zofran I think, and 1 dose of another anti-nausea medicine, they drew blood 6 times for tests and labwork, took chest X-rays, MRIs of my stomach/intestines, did a flu sinus swab test and a strep throat swab test, and I'm pretty sure they called every GI Doctor in the city in to come look at me.

I'm not a doctor but I *feel* like that's going to cost a *shitload* of money, and I'm not sure how much of it my insurance is going to pay for; and I'm also not sure if there's something I should be doing to start the billing process? I'm pretty sure the hospital contacts my insurance company and puts the billing through, then the insurance company responds with the amount they'll pay, then the hospital sends me a bill for whatever remains, unless I hit my deductible, in which case the insurance pays everything over the deductible? Or do I have to initiate the billing process here?

I wouldn't worry about it ordinarily, but it's been about 2 weeks since I was discharged and I don't have a bill, and I'm not sure how long I should wait. I usually make a student loan payment as soon as it pops up in the Loan Service Provider site that my next payment is due, but I've been postponing making a payment because I don't want to shell out $2,500, then suddenly find that I have an ER bill for $7,000. If it's getting close to the actual payment due date and I still don't have a bill, I can always just make the minimum payment amount for this month and go from there, but.. My loans have a 6.8% interest rate, and they calculate the interest by the day, so if I can I want to pay them back as soon as I possibly can.

I'm generally unfamiliar with the world of finance, and this is probably the most uncertain thing I've had to deal with since I graduated. I hear horror stories about ER bills, and I'm not sure if there's anything I should be doing to avoid that. This question also has mild relevance to the whole ""rent at my mom's"" thing, and the whole moving out and finding an apartment thing, but that'll have to be a separate post I'm thinking.

EDIT: So I registered with UHC and logged in, and it says I've made 6 recent claims; 4 of them are related to the hospital visit. There's the bill from the hospital, the bill from a doctor, and two bills from radiology something or other; the 3 that aren't from the hospital look pretty minor, and they've already been processed, so those are probably already in the mail, but um...

Some Doctor:

Provider Charged $198.00, Member Responsibility $152.62

Radiology 1:

Provider Charged $45.00, Member Responsibility $22.03

Radiology 2:

Provider Charged $324.00, Member Responsibility $59.54

I can handle all those, but the only one that hasn't been processed yet is the one from the hospital:

Provider Charged $13,591.00, Member Responsibility ???

So uh... Yeah, if I spend money on literally nothing (aside from the claims that have already been processed), I'll be able to pay that out of pocket on... Carry the two... April 29. Currently looking to see if there's any way to figure out how much of that they're likely to cover...

I did find a chart with some ""Benefit Maximums"" numbers; is this the ""Deductible(also called out of pocket max, stop loss or a few other names)"" /u/DirtyMike24 was talking about?

In-Network Individual Deductible: $250
In-Network Individual Out of Pocket: $1,500
Out-Of-Network Individual Deductible: $500
Out-Of-Network Individual Out of Pocket: $3,000

So... Does this mean the most they'll charge me on any one claim is $1,500 if the hospital was in their network, and $3,000 if it wasn't? I can't find any signs that my hospital is on the network... Actually I'm not even sure what my network is called; there's a million UHC networks listed on all these sites but none of them match up with the specific name mine goes under; UHC River Valley. $3,000 is ok. I can do $3,000 if that's all there is.

EDIT 2: Also I just realized that on an unrelated note I've already paid about $1,000 this year on medicine that my insurance told me flat out they do not cover. Is that going to knock my max-out-of-pocket down a little, or am I using Maximum-out-of-pocket and deductible interchangeably when I shouldn't be?",finance,1456690188

I'm using a throw away just because I don't like publicly discussing my finances. I've been out of school for a couple of years now and started a job in sales, previously working in various areas of clinical medicine, so I've had a significant salary increase. My base salary has gone up from around $34,000 to $56,000 + commission. I'm still new so I've only earned about $2000 for my first month (Normally quarterly, new hire was just prorated). 


Due to my previous low paying job and living in a high cost area, I've missed a number of payments in the past on my loans, have medical debt that is in collections, and my credit has taken a hit. It was around 570 but since paying off a lien on my car (Originally 3000, paid off 2 weeks ago with my tax refund) and making my monthly loan payments, I'm at a 634.


I've started trying to balance my spending habits, repayment on debt, and savings to put me in the best financial situation as well as pay off my debt, using Mint mostly but also trying ReadyForZero. My debt breaks down to the following:


~$54,000 in student loans

---$33,402 @ 6.75% with monthly payments of $322.98 (Private loan)
---$21,107 @ 6.55% with monthly payments of 205.56 (Federal) 

Debt:
Probably around $2000 in medical debt, mostly by the same debt collectors who have yet to be willing to negotiate down my payment 

Expenses:
 
Rent- $670 (Student housing since my girlfriends a PhD student)
Food- ~$300-400 monthly (Traveling a lot, eating out)
Loan Repayment- $528.54
No car or gas expenses, covered by company


No Credit Card debt, only 1 card with a limit of $2000. 

Average biweekly check: $1387.00 after tax ($2153.85 gross)

Investing 8% of paycheck (matched by employer) and bonuses (also matched) into a new 401k, never could afford to have one before.

Having money in my account and being able to save is a new thing to me and I've never been in this situation. I don't really spend on myself but have had to recently to buy some nicer clothes for the job, which won't happen typically. I'm not sure where I should save, where I should pay off debt, how much I should keep for myself, etc. Obviously I'm not making a huge amount right now, but I have the potential, from what I have heard, to make 6 figures in a couple of years which is purely overwhelming to me.

personalfinance,Paying down student loans - which first?,"I have extra money budgeted to help pay down my student loans, but I am doubting myself on which loans to pay down first. Standard wisdom is of course to pick avalanche or snowball, but hear me out.

All of these loans are federal student loans, but some of them are under my name, and some of them are Parent PLUS loans in mother's name that I am paying off. The combined balance of my loans and the PLUS loans are about equal (25k-30k), but all of the parent PLUS loans are at much greater APRs (6.4%-7.9%) than the ones under my name (3.4%-4.6%), and their monthly payment is $100 more.

My instinct is that I should put the extra money towards the parent PLUS loan at nearly $12,000 @7.90% loan first, because yikes. Following avalanche method I will be paying off these PLUS loans under my mother's name first, and saving a good chunk of money in the long run on interest. 

But I do wonder - am I missing a bigger picture, such as regarding taxes or my credit score? Technically I am not responsible for these PLUS loans.

I own a 4 plex purchased with an FHA loan which I now understand to have been a foolish decision, at the time I was not VA loan eligible but now I am. If I were to do a cash out refinance I could eliminate my car loan, eliminate the PMI from my mortgage and most likely get a lower interest rate. The streamline refi would simply drop the PMI, lower my rate and leave the equity that I already have in the home there. Now I don't have a ton of equity, probably in the neighborhood of 20k so I feel like using he cash out would at the point in time be worth using to eliminate my car loan (only source of debt as I never carry a balance on my credit cards) thoughts?

TL;DR refi and get lower rate and drop PMI or cash out refi eliminate debt but lose equity in home, drop PMI and get lower rate.

personalfinance,"Business Dead, Partner took off and left me with $85k in Debt to Wells Fargo","A few years ago by business went belly up.  We tried to weather the recession, my partner and I piled on the debt, but we couldn't hold on.  He took off, left no trace, my name was on pretty much everything and I was stuck with the bills.  I've paid off just about everyone, dealt with the vendors we owed money to, did whatever I could to leave no trace of debt but for a Wells Fargo Small Business Line of Credit, it was a Mastercard, that was just too much ($85k) to pay off at once.  We closed up about 2012, but I continued to pay off the Wells Fargo line, 800-1k a month, and I've managed to take it down to $70k.  Interest on the line is 10.25%, but they've recently bumped up principal repayment by an additional 1% (or 1.5% not sure, can't find the notice at the moment).  My min payment at this point will be ~$1300k.  That kind of payment for a defunct business is hard to live with.

My wife and I refinanced our home a couple of years ago to take advantage of cheap interest rates.  We also wanted to cash out some of the equity, we thought it would be a good idea to stash some money away to help us pay this line off.  We haven't used a dime of that money so far because we could meet the credit payment, this was probably a mistake on our part.  We're good on our home, pay the mortgage with ease, and have a little more than 40k from the equity cash out (that's about as much as we could get without throwing off our monthly expenses).  The increase in min payment has thrown me off, and the additional $300 a month may not seem like a lot but it is to us, especially with two kids.  

I'm still current with Wells Fargo, I've contacted them for hardship assistance, but they're notorious for being tough to deal.  I would love to send them the 40k and call it even with them, but that's probably a pipe dream.  Live in NY, if I default I'm probably looking at a lien on my home, (my wife and I are both on the deed).  Really stuck at the moment, not sure what to do.

I need to figure out what we can afford going forward and if a car loan is the only viable option, what interest rates we should look for.

My net pay after taxes and health insurance deductions is $30k/yr.

Credit score is 715, no cc debt.

I have $7k in student loan debt.  my monthly bill is $90.

My rent is $700 currently, will increase to $850 after may.

Internet is $45/month, necessary for work.

Electric is $60/month

I don't pay for a phone bill, hers is $50/month.

I do not own a vehicle but can rely on cycling to work.

She will be making $15/hr at 25 hrs/week, but has 8k in credit card debt so the vast majority of her earnings will need to go towards that until it's paid.

I have 3k in liquid cash.  She has 1k.  We have already obtained most of the essentials in preparation of the baby outside of food but will additionally need to look at child care options.

I'm fearful of putting 3k on a craigslist car that will be a money sink or facilitate buying a more expensive car in a year.  Looking at used vehicles in my market, cars under 100k miles generally are not below 7-8k.  Should I look at financing options or should I roll the dice and pick up something without warranty on craigslist or an alternative site.  If financing looks like the way to go what would be a reasonable interest rate/monthy payment given my credit score and information I've provided?",finance,1456701602

btc,Stop DDOS using dynamic version lists without ips. Separation of node ip and node version.,"The upside from reporting a node's version is that we all know the approx % of the network nodes for each version. This only applies to non-mining nodes as we can tell by block versions what the miners are voting. The current method for non-miners is for nodes to share peer lists with ips and each node reports its version. But for sharing its version info in this way the nodes become vulnerable to DDOS filtered by version.

According to the current ddoser /u/botneko-chan there is no way to avoid DDOS by version if a node reports their version (https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/487lxl/what_if_classic_nodes_fix_their_client_name_to/d0hk051). So the only option is to stop doing it. Separation of node ip and node version. Perhaps we can figure out the version of non-miner nodes another way.

Currently a node cannot prove that it is genuine anyway. It may appear like a certain node just to fake a vote but in reality it doesn't allocate meaningful resources to the network. So ultimately node versions are rough data easily spoofed. Therefore, why risk DDOS just to get some rough data? The same rough data can be gathered another way without nodes sticking their heads out and appearing different to Core: dynamic version indexes without ips...

What if all clients are upgraded to report the same version so that they appear identical and behave like Core. But they maintain a new version index with bitcoin address, version, datetime through different channels which hide the node's ip.

To do this, first using vpn they try to get an existing version index eg from agreed irc channels. Then they append their own bitcoin address, version, datetime to this index. They occasionally check the irc channels and redownload newer indexes and rebuild it locally. Occasionally they send their current version index to the irc channel for others to download. Over time entries on the version index expire automatically and nodes need to re-append themselves to the index with new datetime.

The version indexes could be distributed p2p but then Core nodes would need to behave the same way by default. Since Core may support DDOS by version sharing the version index via vpn to irc or some other way that hides the ip may be the only way. 

To verify the data is real the node owners could declare which bitcoin address on the index is their node and establish a chain of trust between each other.

In this way the community can figure out the approx distribution of versions without being vulnerable to DDOS by version. Of course its not gonna be perfect data but even the existing method can be spoofed easily, so why not do it this way instead?",cryptocurrency,1456719405

personalfinance,Strategy for Student Loans and Tuition,"I am currently a first year sophomore engineering student, who is receiving some aid from his parents, looking for advice on how to proceed with student loans and my tuition/employment situation.  I am pursuing a 5 year degree program in Electrical and Computer Engineering that will allow me to graduate with both a master's and bachelor's degree simultaneously. 

To start off, my family surprised me going into college since they had never discussed finances with me previously. I had been operating under the assumption that I had a decent amount in savings, as I had been told I had money well invested since I was born with additional contributions (which I mistakenly assumed would be non-trivial due to my family's earnings). I figured I wouldn't need a dime for college because the place  I intended to attend offered me a full tuition scholarship plus athletic money in addition to what I assumed was healthy savings. Long story short, the school I was planning to attend lied to me about their offered majors (despite me questioning it due to their website) and refused to give me a course list for registration until I had driven 5 hours for orientation, at which time I discovered their deception. I chose a different university that did have my intended major, but at a higher cost since I accepted too late for scholarships. It was at this time that I found out I had ""about $6,000"" in savings (the exact amount is still unknown since my parents refuse to discuss financial details with me). 

Because of the large issues regarding my college plans, my parents paid for my first semester and agreed to cover my housing costs for the next year. That said, tuition at this university is still approximately $15,000 a year, which I am expected to cover myself.

I currently have no idea as to whether or not the savings for college that were set aside for me have been used (my parents earn enough it's possible they weren't, but they refuse to tell me about details), and I have been told my grandparents have some money set aside for my college (which I have been forbidden to ask about, and therefore cannot access or even confirm the existence of unless it appears). To complicate matters a bit further, I am currently 17 years old and cannot sign for loans, housing contracts, or anything else that is legally binding. 

This semester I had enough in my personal savings from working previously to only require about $1,500 of the maximum of $5,000 in federal unsubsidized student loans I can take out, at an interest rate of approximately 4%. Since the other $3,500 of aid will expire at the end of the year and reset, I am wondering if it would be wise to take the money and invest it as a means of paying the interest that will accrue on my student loans while I am attending college. If so, I am not sure where the best places to look to invest would be and how the matter of my age would complicate things. 

I also have a slight dilemma in terms of my summer employment plans. I currently have an internship through NASA, which could become a paid position over the summer if I stay with it. The hours, however, are somewhat limited (and would remain less than full time over the summer) and are at odd enough times that I would be prevented from getting another job besides perhaps a part time night shift at a convenience store or other such location. I also have the option of working full time over the summer, at a golf course, which would earn more money but net me less experience. I am unsure about whether it is more valuable to have an experience like that on my resume or if I should pursue the option that affords me the fewest loans. 

My primary questions are summarized thusly:

- Is it worth it to take out additional loans, that would otherwise become unavailable to me at a relatively low interest rate, to invest and use to pay for college/loan interest in the future? 

- Is it more valuable to have an extended experience with a prominent organization in your area of expertise, although at a somewhat basic level,  or to have more money to pay for college to allow me to take on less debt?

One additional question I have is as follows:

- What is the best way to handle delicate subjects like money with family without souring relationships? I feel like I can't truly take control of my financial situation without knowing the full extent of my situation, but so far all attempts I have made to discover the full situation have been shot down.",finance,1456739716

Last year I was laid at the beginning of November from a standard entry level engineering job (~60,000/year, I earned $55,000 in 2015) and spent a few months living off unemployment. This year I chose to move to a different state and take a short term, high pay contract with a well known company beginning February 1st. After about 3 weeks I took a higher paying contract that is projected to last until the end of the year. Unfortunately, there is a very real chance this contract could end at any time. In addition, there is a chance of getting hired full time if a position opens up although the total compensation would likely be about 20% lower.

&amp;nbsp; 1) Security fund. Have $4000, plan on increasing to $10,000 in the next month. 

&amp;nbsp; 2) Pay down my student loan that is at 6.55%, possibly the one at 4.25%, likely keep the others at minimum payments.

&amp;nbsp; 3) 401K. There is no matching, but I have elected to contribute 18% from now until the end of the year.

&amp;nbsp; 4) Max out my HSA. This is already included in my monthly expenses.

&amp;nbsp; 5) Maybe a roth IRA 

&amp;nbsp; 6) ?????????????????

I got the following details from the dealer about their finance package : 

Cost of the bike : €15,489

Deposit : €2,000
Monthly Payments : €239 - for 3 years
Residual Value : €7,900 - i.e pay this and then the bike is mine (or I can trade the bike in against a new model)
Total Paid : €18,504 (Deposit + Monthly Payments + Residual)  

If I understand it correctly, I'd actually be borrowing €5,589  (Price of the bike - deposit - residual)  
..and paying back €8,604  (€239 * 36 months)  
  
..and that works out at just under 16% interest per year (using B = P(1+r)^n )  
  
That seems like a very high interest rate to me (for reference, banks look to be offering something around 9.9% on a loan of €5,000 at the moment)

On the other hand, if I get a loan for €15,000 from the bank, it looks like I can get a variable rate loan of 7.9% with monthly repayments of €464.90 - meaning I'd end up paying back €16,736 (give or take a bit with interest rate fluctuations)

personalfinance,"About to inherit a considerable chunk of land, need advice","*I realize this topic isn't typical of what is discussed on this sub, but I respect the minds in this community. There's a great deal of knowledge and experience here on which I'd like to tap.*

As the title says, I'm about to inherit some land, 50 acres. Here are some **Quick Facts**

* This land is located deep in a rural area of a small town in the South. When I say small town, I mean this is kind of place you drive to and you feel like you've gone back in time 100 years. I've always enjoyed going out there, but this isn't exactly a prime real estate location.

* Of the 50 acres, about 48 are wooded, undeveloped

* There is a home on the property, 3 bedroom 1 bath

* The property is about an hour away from the nearest major city and about 10 minutes off of the nearest major interstate highway

* There are no county ordinances to contend with, and from my understanding the city regulations are very minimal. No HOA or anything like that to worry about

* The approximate value of the entire property is $140k. My brother and I have agreed not to sell it.

* I currently work and live in a neighboring state. (About a 9 hour drive away). I work in financial sales and I've just started to build a solid book and generate enough revenue to pay my bills on time and put some money aside every month. Point being, I work a pretty high-status job with a lot of future earning potential , so it isn't such an easy decision for me to pack up move closer to this property.

**Ideas**

*Renovate the House on the property and take in renters*

This seems like the most logical idea if not for the fact that this property is far out of the way and not in a good rental market. This is kind of area in which someone could sign a lease and then turn the place into a meth lab, plus the rent I could get for this place is quite low. For instance, in the adjacent town, which is much bigger than the town in which my property is located, a 1500 square foot 4 bedroom home rents for $445 per month! If you've ever rented or been a landlord, you know that's cheap as hell. I'll assume optimistically that my property could rent for $300 per month. That's better than nothing, but there must be a more lucrative option given that I have so much land to work with.

*Selling the lumber, flattening the land, and raising beef cattle*

Like I said, this is cow-town, and there are other residents in this area who do this, lots of cows and horse barns around. From what I understand, raising cattle is a profitable business, I'm just a complete noob on it. Anyone know what is involved in this? What's involved getting the trees knocked down? Won't the Feds have something to say about chopping down so many trees? What kind of initial investment would be required to start raising cattle?

Also, this option is probably not one that I could do while maintaining my current day job, which is something to consider.

I've kicked around a few other ideas, but I'm anxious to hear what you guys think. What would you do? Should I find a way to move closer and be more involved? Obviously, I'm stoked to have my name on the deed to this property, but I have also have some mixed feelings. On one hand, I'll be the owner of 50 acres of land very soon. People spending thousands of dollars and years of their lives paying off mortgages so there can call themselves home owners, and I'll have that privilege without any of the BS.

One the other hand, as I've said this is not a prime location. This property is not only far from where I currently live and work, but far out of the way from civilization. I'm definitely not complaining, I'm just curious how I should approach this.",finance,1456763939

This brings the monthly payment down by about half as much as buying the points would.

The interest rate was set at a hefty 13% which I reluctantly agreed to due me needing a new car in time for college as the semester was starting.

It's been 6 months of paying outrageous insurance costs and I'm finally fed up, despite my insurance rate dropping to $350/mo (still way too high). Currently, the remaining balance on the auto loan sits at $8,000.

I am connected to a salvaged car dealer through a close friend that purchases slightly damaged but overall great shape cars and repairs them, then flipping them for profit. My friend had purchased a car worth over $25K for 5K and another 4K in repair expenses. He now outright owns a luxury vehicle in beautiful condition for less than half it's market price.  This option seems very appealing as I would love to outright own my car and not pay high monthly bills to cover my auto needs.

So ultimately, the question is, what would be the smarter financial decision? 

A) Pool all the money and pay off almost all the remainder of balance on the Honda after refinancing to lower APR to minimize interest payed

OR

B) Sell the car at a loss (Life lessons don't come cheap sometimes) Pool all remaining money and purchase a car off auction and have it repaired to near new condition. 

All input would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: I live in a no-fault state (Florida) so rates are generally higher. I was forced to finance the vehicle on the lot before I could drive off because it was partially financed. I had a lapse in auto insurance coverage for many months prior to the purchase. Actually, I have an absolutely clean driving record. No accidents whatsoever, no speeding tickets (only 1 warning).",finance,1456785334

personalfinance,"First CC, clarification on a few things.","I am 18. Credit score of 624 (about the same for all bureaus), $6400 car loan with an insane interest rate (I'm probably gonna pay it off by the end of 2016, if not be very close), and I live at home. Car, insurance, and gas are my only major expenses, other than the couple days a month I buy lunch or go out to eat, or some other activity.

I got approved for and just received in the mail a CapitalOne Platinum card with  a $300 limit (I guess it goes up after making on time payments the first five months). What amount of this should I utilize? When should I pay it off? 

All in all, this isn't a ""I'm buying everything because free money,"" this is more of a ""I'm going to build and establish credit to create a better future for myself.""",finance,1456787124
