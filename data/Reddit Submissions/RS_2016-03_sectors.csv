personalfinance,Looking for Loan Payoff Equations to calculate where to place extra income (Student Loan vs IRA),"Like everyone else I'm trying to minimize my taxes paid and minimize interest payed on loans. From the FAQs, I know paying high interest loans should come before IRAs. However, with a potential tax deduction in mind, I'm having trouble just assuming that the loan payment is better. I trust the advice here and believe that it is - I just want to calculate the difference so I can rest easy and get a better understanding of finances. The tax deduction sounds like free money and I would put the tax refund towards the loan after. 

The calculation isn't that easy though. I have a number of loans, varying in amount and interest rate (as high as 6.74%). I want to use unbury.us to see what would change if I dump $5500 (the max IRA deduction) in my loans now. I need to contact my loan provider because online they list the minimum for all loans combined, without giving the specific minimums for each loan (although I know all extra is going toward the highest interest rate loan). 

I have briefly looked at an IRA and my understanding is the deduction is at my federal tax rate (The 'Federal Income Tax Withheld/'Wages,Tips, other Comp.') = 12.7% for me. So the Refund would be $5500*0.0127=$700.01 in my case. Then consider the potential growth of the IRA and... This is where I'm getting lost. Can I assume 5% growth? and If I do wait until all my loans are payed off, what kind of money would I be losing out on?

Background info that may be Relevant: I'm 24, total 70k student loans currently, have been paying down aggressively, made 55k last year (pre-tax), have a 10k emergency fund and 8k in checking(which is what I would use for the IRA/ or loan dump), employer does not offer 401k (so no retirement fund at all currently), relatively cheap living expenses (rent + utilities = $600/month).",finance,1456796326
personalfinance,"If IBR allows payment that is less than accruing interest, is it wise to let it grow?","My fianc√©e has $89,000 in student debt. We're making plans to eliminate this on our combined $95k in gross income. This is essentially our only debt. No car loan, and our CCs balances are paid off in their entirety monthly. We're already making more than minimum payments, but will be ramping up to about 2k paid monthly with periodic lump sum payments with gifts, tax returns, and bonuses. Of this debt, 38k is in two separate government loans at 6.25% which qualify for IBR. The total of minimum payments is around $700. 

We have decided on a fairly pure Avalanche method, as the highest interest rate loans also happen to be the smaller loans, this works out great. In the process however, the loans which qualify for IBR will grow slightly over the next two-three years before we begin addressing them.

personalfinance,"Just guaranteed loan in a small business, how will this affect me?","Hey personalfinance,

I would just like some questions answered.  I am an officer of a small local business and am therefore authorized to sign checks for company expenses.  Recently, our company decided to purchase a vehicle for picking up clients and employee transportation.  I understand that large stakeholders in small businesses oftentimes personally guarantee loans for the company.  In this particular case, the individual that normally officiates these transactions was unavailable, so instead, I became the guarantor of the loan and signed it.  As such, although the company will still be making payments for the vehicle, I have also taken on some liability.  Here are my details and questions:

Gross income: ~300k
auto-loan in question: 50k, 3 yr
FICO score: 763

I have no other unsecured loans.

How will this affect my ability to take out a mortgage in the future?
--Will the interest rate I get be lower than if I had not guaranteed this loan?
--Will this limit the size of the mortgage I can get?

If I wanted to purchase a car for myself in the future, how will this effect the rates and loan I can secure for that?

Input, especially quantified ones, would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Paying off large student loan debt,"Hello PF!

I have made some not-so-great financial decisions over the past few years, but am trying to move forward and no longer make those mistakes and be more responsible financially.

I am graduating from college with a secured job offer at 122,700/year, but with the burden of 300,000 in federal student loan debt, with an average interest rate of 6.4%.

I should bring home roughly 6,354/month after taxes, and after 401(k) contributions (company matches 6%), healthcare, and professional liability insurance... I should bring home roughly 5,200/month...

I have calculated my total living expense monthly to be around 1,300. This includes rent, power, water, cable/internet, my car payment, and a credit card payment.

I owe 7,000 on my vehicle and 7,500 on my credit card currently. I think these are two focuses for paying down because it can free up 400-450/month in budgeting and could easily apply this to my loan payments.

Deducting those monthly expenses leaves me with 4,441/month to put toward my goals. Obviously I want to use some of that for myself to enjoy, but I also understand the importance and want to be as responsible as I can be.

Some of my goals: paying student loans effectively (IBR vs 20 year plan vs graduated vs REPAYE/PAYE minimum payment and forgiven amount as taxable income in 25 years, etc.), saving a 6 month rolling nest egg, saving money in general, being able to keep a few hobbies.

A lot of graduates in my field are immediately buying new cars, houses, etc. I am more comfortable with maintaining the automobile I have, for as long as I can, and will be renting an apartment for the first year with a fellow graduate. Once I know where I will permanently settle down, I will opt for purchasing a home/townhouse/condo, or if I meet someone would make plans accordingly.

I am really just having issues trying to figure out how to tackle the student loan debt while both enjoying the present time and planning for the future, because I think it can all be done at once.

Thanks for any help in advance. And, yes, I realize that it's an absurd amount of student loan debt, but I also know that I am not the only person in my field with that kind of debt. And I would like to start being more productive now, preferably without the hateful keyboard-induced, internet bashing that can sometimes take place in this subreddit.",finance,1456841118

personalfinance,"Switching Graduate programs, finances will change drastically","I am a 26 year old full-time employed, full-time graduate student. I am currently working for a biotech company that allows me to work flexible hours, which also allows me to attend class full time and TA at night. The TAship also covers my tuition, so I have no academic expenses for the graduate degree.

The problem is: I hate my program. I don't see the Masters degree really benefiting me in the future, despite it being a low financial investment, which is what attracted me to it in the first place. My company allowed me to pursue the degree because it relates to my work, but over the past 6 months I have really become disinterested in the subject and don't see myself making a career of it. 

So, this month I was accepted into a different program, at a different university starting in September 2016. This is a year-and a half program at an engineering-focused university that upon completion of my degree I will have a starting salary of roughly $100k. The engineering school does NOT offer TAships, and tuition will cost a total of $40k. I believe I may be able to still work at my current company for at least the start of the program, but will quit if it becomes too overwhelming. I am here to ask how to prepare for that inevitable day...

My current strategy has been to:

1. Save about $1000/month until September

2. Get as far ahead paid on my car loan and private student loans as I can. I previously had private loans at a much higher interest rate, but piled on and now my federal is the highest interest rate (how should I tackle this?). I can typically make double payments on the car/private loans, which would push a required payment out until after the year and a half of my degree completion and hopefully have a nice salary. Federal loans can be deferred for up to 3 more years, but I would still plan on paying off the interest.


Here is a breakdown of my current monthly income and expenses:

* **Current income** (after taxes):

Work: $2500/month

TAship: $940/month

= $3440 total

* **Savings**: 

12k, deposit $1000/month

* **Monthly expenses**:

Rent: $550/month

Food/entertainment/gas/etc: roughly $800/month (using a 2% cash back credit card, paid in full every month)

Car loan: $200/month (typically I pay $500), $5900 total left on the loan @3% interest (14mo paid ahead)

Private student loans: $250 minimum payment (typically I pay $500), 19k left on the loan @2.9% interest (9mo paid ahead)

Federal student loans: $180 minimum payment, 25k left on the loan @5% interest

My budget can allow for an additional $100/month on auto, including the increase in insurance and payment (gas mileage is roughly the same on both models). Has anyone taken their dealer up on an offer like this? If so, what was your experience like and what are some things I should keep in mind with the negotiations? Should I attempt to lower my current interest rate on the new loan based upon a better credit score and payment history since I bought the car in 2013?",finance,1456857529
personalfinance,Confused about how to get rid of MIP on our FHA mortgage?,"We bought our first home in 2007 for 175,000 with an FHA loan, we put down 3.5% and were required to pay MIP.  We have made extra payments on the loan most of the time since then. We refinanced into another FHA loan (I can't remember if it was a ""streamline"" but I don't think we had an appraisal) in 2010, to get a lower interest rate.  We paid the closing costs with cash so the loan balance did not change. This new FHA loan still had MIP, however. We continued making extra payments, and now our loan balance is $141,400.  Last year we bought another house, and in the process of deciding whether to sell our first home, our real estate agent did a fairly thorough market analysis and said she would list it for $215,000-$217,500 if we were to sell it.  (We decided instead to convert it to a rental property.)  This would indicate that our current loan to value is possibly as low as 65%.  Based on the initial purchase price however it's around 82%. 

My understanding is that we can get our MIP canceled (Since our refi was before 2013) by making payments until the loan to value reaches 78% of the initial purchase price or initial appraised value.  But for private mortgage insurance I believe you can also get an appraisal and ask for it to be canceled. Is this possible for MIP on our FHA mortgage? This would save us around $1500 in MIP charges over the next few years, after paying for the appraisal.",finance,1456859514
personalfinance,IRAs &amp; Student Loans,"After years of grad school and job loss, I'm working toward paying off my student loans and building my retirement accounts.

I have two Stafford loans at the moment. Subsidized is $9600. Unsubsidized is $12500. (I've made several large windfall payments to drastically reduce them.) Right now my monthly payments are income based at $71/month, but will jump significantly in November (unless I reapply for IBR). Interest rate on both accounts is 6.8%. 

I have a Rollover IRA worth $5500 and a Roth IRA worth $6300.
In order to reach the $5500 limit, I'll have to put in $105.76/wk.

But what's the smartest way for me to address the debt and prep for the future? I know they say to pay your loans first, but given that my loan debt is no longer crushing, should I find a balance and pay towards both? How much should I put in my traditional vs roth? 

If I don't get income based repayment again, my loan payments will go up to $115.56 &amp; $186.27 for a total of $301.83/month. Is there a benefit to keeping the expected payment low and paying more, or is there no difference? For instance, if the bill is $71 and I pay $300 each month, is that somehow better than just paying a $300 bill? 

Right now I'm a server working towards a new career, so my income is both unimpressive and irregular. Some weeks are good, some are bad. My wife makes a steady income about 3x what I make annually, so we've opened a joint checking account to pay bills, with the intention of putting 10% of whatever I make into my personal checking, 10% into personal savings, and $105.76/wk into IRAs.

Any additional thoughts or advice welcome.",finance,1456860240
personalfinance,Car Buying Help!,"Sooo I am faced with a huge dilemma! I am looking to buy my first car, I have 14,000-15,000$ to put down on a car. I really want to buy a Subaru (Let's face it, really well built). I have been shopping around but alas they really do not depreciate.

Option #1
I found a 2012 Impreza 2.0 with a tech package. One accident on record and 56,000km. There is no remaining warranty on it and is priced at around 17,000$ and I am sure I could get them down.

Option #2
2015 Subaru Impreza WRX STi.
This car is a beauty... Used but only 11,000km on it and bought at auction being sold at a used car dealer. Car proof comes up cleaner than clean and it has been on the road for less then a year. The price on the other hand is significantly higher, 34,000$ to be exact. The warranty is 2 Year bumper to bumper and 4 years of 100,000km Left on the powertrain. 

This is the struggle I am faced with. Financially it fits into my budget and leaves me ton of room left over. My payments will be around 400$ a month of 5 years. It would be an open loan and I am expecting a huge chunk of cash to make its way to me soon so I have the option of paying it down. I have to run Premium in it so cost for fuel will be more, but it's only a 4-cylinder so really not going to be that much to fill, and insurance will be approx. 160$month. On top of it all this is my literal dream car so my judgment is a bit clouded.

My credit is pretty bad, I am unsure what kind of interest rate I will get from the dealer.

Do I buy a car outright and worry about repairs, or spend more and have the guarantee of having a working car for some years. I mean making higher payments on a high interest loan will boost my credit slightly which will help and then after about a year i can pay it down in chunks.

If you require some more details please ask.",finance,1456860556
personalfinance,No records of a student loan that I co-sign for.,"In 2007 I co-signed a student loan for a ""friend""... I was 20 years old and he was my best friend at the time. We lived in Pennsylvania and I still live here. I didn't finish high school, was working 70hr+/week making over $35k/yr. I felt rich and like I could easily pay off the loan if anything happened. It was the type of loan that he didn't have to pay on until a year after he graduated... I talked to him about it in 2010, when I saw no payments were made, and he was like ""Don't worry about it. I got a new job and will make payments soon"" Meanwhile, he's moved to Los Angeles, bought a new car, got married, etc. I asked about it again later that year and he basically said ""F*** off"". That's the last that I tried contacting him.

Also, some time in 2009, I was classified as permanently disabled and have been receiving social security since. I spoke with the loan company a few times between 2010/2011 and explained the situation to them.

Sometime last year, I received a letter stating that there was a default judgement for the student loan for $175k. I have since lost the letter and have no idea how to find out information about it.

A few months ago, I called the loan company to figure out the status of the loan. They said it was transferred to a debt collection agency in 2011 and gave me their number. I called the agency and they said they have no records of a loan under my name, they suggested that I call the loan company back for more information. The loan company is positive they transferred it to this debt collection agency and the agency is sure they have no record of it. They've search for it with all of my information and with my friend's information. The one good piece of information I found out is that it's not a federal loan. All this time, I thought it was a federal loan and would follow me for life... so I'm assuming it was written off... even though it's been less than 7 years. Also, on my credit report, the loan shows as ""Charge-off"" and the account was closed in Sept 2011. There is nothing else on my credit report that even vaguely resembles the loan I co-signed for.

I have been studying over the last few years in the hopes of finding a good paying career. I would like to return to the work-force soon, but I have no idea if my wages will be garnished or not. My field is easily $65k/yr, but most places only offer me $12/hr... I don't know if it's because my area just sucks or it's due to my lack of actual work experience. Probably both. Being on disability and receiving section 8 assistance makes it very hard to accept a position at $12/hr. Paying bills at $12/hr would be extremely tight, but it is possible. I've already used up the 9 months I'm allowed to work while receiving disability payments. I worked for $10/hr at a large company, hoping that I'd earn enough promotions during that time to finally live off of without assistance. That didn't work out, as promotions were given by seniority, and even people who've worked their 5yrs were only making $14/hr. I live on my own and don't receive food stamps or any other assistance. Anyway, it would be impossible to survive at $12/hr if my wages are garnished. Not to mention, I'd never pay off $175,000.

How can I find out more information about the loan I co-signed for? Can a loan be written off in less than 7 years? Who can I call about that $175k default judgement?",finance,1456860586

Loan 3: $7,596 at 8.99%  
Loan 4: $13,521 at 7.74%

Current income: $30,000 ($1,922 take home)  
CC Debt: $1,100 (will be paid off with tax return)  
Savings: $750  
Federal Loans: ~23,000 (probably won't refinance these)   

Now those are high interest rates, and most refinancing options will be below all of them. Which is why I'm interested in refinancing. I'm wondering if I should apply to SoFi, CommonBond, and Earnest to check the best rate, I can do the soft application but that give such a wide range of possible interest rates or nothing at all. If I apply to all 3 it will do a hard credit inquiry 3 times. Will that change the rates for the other application processes?     

I have read through several other refinancing threads for specific individuals, but obviously they are different then mine. Mainly, my access to a cosigner might be somewhat troublesome. I remember I couldn't have my parents co-sign each of my loans because they were on my older sister's loans. Right now, SoFi isn't giving me an interest rate until I apply, CommonBond sent back a 4.86-7%, and Earnest requested a co-signer. Can a co-signer hurt the interest rate?  

My Credit: 721 (Credit Karma)  
I've missed 2 CC payments, one was on accident and removed. The other I payed with rewards points (triple minimum payment) which didn't count as a payment, I think I got that removed too. Purchased a motorcycle through a loan in 2012 ($3,800 paid off in 2014). Also have had a couple NSF's from my checking because auto pay/checks can be a bitch at times.

Bitcoin,Why the hate for Bitcoin as a settlement system?,"We all want a censorship-free store of value and a payment system, but it looks likely that on-chain transactions can't deliver both of these ideals together.

A payment system that scales properly can be built on top of Bitcoin, be it the form of payment channels such as the Lightning Network, or as a sidechain (federated or not). And you'll be able to chose one of a multitude of sidechains depending on your needs (speed/security/locale).

Why are people so concerned about lack of on-chain scaling? Are they worried that their Bitcoin investment will suffer?

Well, imagine that Bitcoin is the world's settlement system that all other blockchains are anchored to. It's gold 2.0. It's held as a reserve currency by governments around the world. It's a worldwide ledger that is the backbone to $trillions of global trade. How much would a single bitcoin be worth then? A lot more than it is now that's for sure.

And you could still be a part of the network by running a full node, or earning fees on the Lightning Network if it comes to fruition.

Need advice on how to move forward.","So I finally got my financial wakeup call today when I went to open a new bank account and was turned down because of a credit score in the low 300s. Little back story now. Been on my own from 18-24 until I moved in with my now ex girlfriend. Made a rash of bad financial decisions including but not limited to:

Changing phone carriers and not paying my cancellation fee or returning my phone

Getting a laptop mailed to me by someone who recalled the credit card payment a few months later, ignored the one notice I received and never bothered to dispute

Let my ~$2000 in student loans default from lack of payments. Filed taxes for 2013, lost my whole federal refund to the student loans, never bothered to file again.

And most recently, breaking my apartment lease with my ex a few weeks ago. Which I suspect is what put me below the threshold to even open a checking account. 

Whew, feels good to type all that out for once. Anyways I am currently unemployed, living with family for free. I have two contingent job offers but due to the background/credit checks I'm now afraid I may no longer qualify for either one. I owe cable cancellation fees and have a phone bill of $145 a month on a contract that expires in July. I have mailed away to get a copy of my credit report and should have it next week. I have not filed taxes for 2015 yet but am planning to tomorrow.

My question to PF is. Should I declare title 7 bankruptcy and start over? I know this won't absolve me of student loan debt but it could clear up some of my debt. I have about $300 to my name, no assets or properties, a $200 laptop and some clothes. Should I be expecting either job to withdraw their offers? My background is clean criminally, does a low credit score affect the process that much? Does anyone have any general advice as to how to move forward when I receive my report? I have never checked my credit before and don't know what to expect.

Today was the final straw. I partied and pissed away my 20s, and I refuse to continue on in this manner.

personalfinance,Wrecked credit; ready to clean up. Advice beyond the sidebar?,"Hey guys. Referred here by /r/frugal. I've checked out some of the FAQs and stuff. They're helpful, but I thought I'd also get some additional opinions. Mainly, since my situation is very unique (and I am going to have to have some strategy with repayment).

First and foremost: I understand that my position here is the consequence of very poor decisions and I am ready to accept that. I know what needs to be done overall. I am not struggling...but I am looking for ways to efficiently deal with this mess I have gotten myself into.

I'm 25, $67,500 per year, and my credit score is around 525 right now. Try not to throw whatever you're holding at me; I can explain. To make a long story short, I made some really poor decisions in my personal relationships. I married a leech. I'm very generous or compassionate or whatever and I did not have a lot of self-esteem so I let this woman convince me to neglect all my own financial obligations to fund her ludicrous spending habits, get her a car, and pay for her to live for a year by herself (in her own apartment). I inherited some money (50k) and it's all gone.

Okay, yes I know a lot of you are probably screaming ""you idiot"" but there was a breaking point back in September where I just realized how badly I was screwing up. So I started the process to get her out of my life. Good news is we have no kids. Judgment just came in for legal separation (yes, there's a story behind that choice over divorce, but I will probably be divorced by the end of the year), which terminates her ability to get any kind of spousal support. After some pretty gnarly e-mails yesterday about her new lover and how she's moving in with him and all this garbage (quickly followed by claims that she said this just to hurt me) I decided it wasn't worth it to leave communication open to deal with the next stage (separation to divorce). New

Alright. So here's where my debt is at

* $12,000 Federal loans - deferred (not in collections)

* $20,000 Wells Fargo Student Loan, in default since February 2015

* $4,000 credit union debt from doing a bunch of cash withdrawals to overdraft during a month or two where I couldn't cover the two rents. They allowed such a high overdraft due to the $50k balance earlier that year. Half principal half overdraft fees. Unpaid, in collections.

* $6,000 other private student loan debt, unpaid and in collections

* $800 ambulance bill from 2013, unpaid

* A few utility bills for small amounts, unpaid and mostly in collections.

Problems:

* As fate would have it, I wrecked my car at the end of last month. Hydroplaned on CA's first day of rain in a while. No comprehensive coverage. This isn't a huge deal...I am within a 35 minute walk to work and have friends that take me everywhere else in exchange for what would have been my monthly gas budget. As I have been doing something special to save through next month, I do not have access to a down payment. **Is it still possible to get approved for an auto loan for $4-6k with nothing down and such a low credit score**?

* I don't really know where to begin with paying back the loans - seems like it's a lot more difficult to get private student loans off the credit report even if you start paying them? **Where should I begin with these kinds of loans to start getting my debt taken care of? In a way that makes my credit go back up quickest?**

Good things:

* I am not listed as a co-owner on the car or any of the debt that my ex acquired. She only made me pay.

* Just to be able to kind of prove to myself I was capable of saving in some capacity, I have invested heavily in our company's 15% discount stock purchase plan while all the divorce nonsense went down. This stops in March. The plan is to have it as a partial savings for a potential down payment on a house in 2-3 years. Maybe it's not a decision most of you would make but I just needed to know I was capable of putting money away somewhere before tackling debt. Since I am stopping this, **starting at the end of March, I'll have 8-900 available each month to pay off debt or put money into real actual savings**

* I have roommates so I'm living in Calabasas (LA suburb/Kardashiantown) at 790/month. A mile from work. I do not care about luxury and plan on renting with the bare minimum until I can own.

* I am generally pretty geared towards saving, so it's not too difficult to cut on spending with the exception of dining out during some happy hours. Actually once the break-up happened and I was free I got a little OCD...I have an excel spreadsheet with every transaction I have made since mid-September. Takes 5 minutes of my time each day, it's incredibly useful at seeing where I am with my spending. So budgeting is not an idea that I am closed off too, in fact I probably do too much of it. (I like manipulating data beyond what Mint and other programs allow.)

So I don't know what to do exactly. I'd like a car pretty soon, nothing flashy just like a mid-2000s Honda or something of the like. But I'd also like to repair my credit. Is it worth calling Wells Fargo to arrange something monthly or will that not help my credit? Should I just save up for a payoff amount instead? 

Thanks guys.",finance,1456872970
personalfinance,How can I determine who to pay for a defaulted Perkins loan?,"I have a defaulted Perkins loan from when I attended UC San Diego about 10 years ago, and I'm having trouble finding out who is servicing the loan.

From what I can gather, UCSD's Perkins loan service processor is ACS Education (www.acs-education.com), however, when I called ACS, they informed me the loan had been sent to collections at a company called Progressive. When I called the number ACS provided, Progressive had no information about the loan, and recommended I call the Federal Student Aid to find the loan servicer. Well, the FSA lists UCSD as the loan servicer, and so I'm now stuck in a loop and can't seem to find out where I can repay this loan.

I did a credit report through Credit Karma, and the credit report shows the loan is serviced by UCSD. It shows the debt as closed-derogatory and charged-off, however, my understanding is that Perkins loans must always be repaid - but how can I repay it if I don't know who to pay?

btc,Why I support Bitcoin Classic,"I'm the developer of bitaddress.org. I like to share my thoughts on the recent Fee Event. I have come to believe Bitcoin is more about people and our values than about code. 

Bitcoin's vision in the whitepaper is explicitly about P2P cash. It wasn't labeled an interbank settlement system. 

The original client was an all-in-one Windows application for your desktop PC. You could mine with your CPU. Send and receive payments with a wallet. Relay transactions and store the full blockchain. 

We've drifted from the original optimistic and idealistic vision of Satoshi. The Genesis block made a statement about the banks and monetary policy by quoting a prominent newspaper headline in the financial center of the world, London. Satoshi's answer was cryptographic art through mimicking commodity money realized with networked code. We should bring our focus back to making that work. 

The first critics said Bitcoin wouldn't scale. Satoshi continued responding that Moore's law is powerful and text is cheap to store. As more people joined the network there has always been need to optimize the code. Specialize the software repositories and binaries. Respond to the adapting changes in OS landscape. From retail users on smartphones to power users at data centers. 

The protocol developers (or reference implementors), today known as Core/Classic developers, have always been able to respond and adapt. The community was smaller and the establishment in society wasn't paying attention. There were less parties interested in the possible, next step, direction of Bitcoin. 

Other independently managed development teams have built special mining and wallet protocols. This is healthy for Bitcoin. Various groups of developers have specialized parts of the Bitcoin code system. These groups typically need to be communicated with and coordinated with to safely roll out an upgrade to the protocol. These groups are paying attention to the Fee Event. 

As things have become specialized some things have moved in a positive direction for example how SPV wallets put monetary sovereignty in your pocket. Other things like mining pool centralization and custom hardware and data center scale efficiencies that are due to various pressures in the incentive system of mining have taken us further from the original vision in Satoshi's whitepaper and original client. We don't have the solution for that problem today but rest assured that people are thinking about it. One day, an altcoin might get mining, incentive-wise, to a place where CPU/GPU have some inherent advantage when coupled with the use of other hardware on a typical PC. 

Bitcoin has longer term decentralization challenges. But today we are faced with a simple short term challenge with a common sense solution. 

On the 29th of February 2016, the network became unreliable. Today, there is a short term solution running in production for miners and full nodes called Bitcoin Classic 0.11.2. 

Smartphone wallet and web wallet users will not be affected and transactions will start getting confirmed in the normal 10 to 30 minutes. The tiny change it makes is upgrading the block size limit to 2MB with some additional safety code in place. Once 75% of miners have signaled they have upgraded a 28 day grace period begins and we will have a heck of a get out the word campaign to do! 

All exchanges, mining pools, large private miners are paying attention. Not everyone who is running a full node is paying attention! When/If Bitcoin Classic activates they will receive a notice in their Bitcoin client that something is not right because blocks are not being found at the regular speed they've slowed down. This will be a message that you may need to upgrade. This has happened before and was effective in getting the long tail of users of full nodes to check the well known discussion sites for news of an event. 

2MB means, to me, going from an estimated 10 million user community to a 20 million user community. Even more when medium term SegWit benefits are rolled out. 

Bitcoin Classic 0.12 is coming out soon so you will have a best of both worlds. All the good stuff of 0.12 from the Core repository. With the Classic finishing touches. 

When/if Classic activates the Core repo would necessarily need to pull the change set from Classic and begin again to work on the same protocol version. At this point either the development release teams merge or they compete for priorities of feature-sets and the market of miners, full nodes and wallets signal readiness for any upcoming protocol upgrade. The latter might be a robust development governance model for the future of Bitcoin. 

Join me in upgrading to Bitcoin Classic.",cryptocurrency,1456882605
personalfinance,Help with personal finances and planning for kids/retirement/life.,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a long-time lurker of this subreddit and enjoy it immensely. I read a post by doxyisfoxy in which she asked for planning advice related to her investments with Northwestern Mutual and the responses were wonderful.  My wife and I have been working with NWM for the past few years, and my constant perusal of this subreddit has me second guessing that decision.  Please forgive the following loquaciousness! 

My wife and I got married about a year and a half ago.  We sold our starter house almost one year ago and bought our dream/forever home with the money we made on the sale and some additional savings.  The price was a little higher than we originally planned for, so we had to get a loan with a second mortgage to avoid PMI and get a lower rate on our first mortgage.

We are both 29 and fairly early in our careers (four years in our current positions).  We both work for the same large medical organization which provides a variety of good benefits and our positions are stable.  Our organization provides free life insurance at 3X our annual salaries, a defined pension plan in which we‚Äôve estimated having the pension be about 1/3 of our retirement income (although we know we can‚Äôt plan on that entirely), great STD coverage, etc.  My wife had a medical condition in childhood that may cause future problems so we planned for extra insurance/disability coverages in order to provide security in our life and in our minds.  

Our combined incomes for 2015 were $187,000.  We each received a 2.5% raise for 2016 and I am finishing my MBA in 6 weeks with the goal of gaining a new position. My wife has about $100K in student loans which a family member bought out a few years ago and we now pay them at 4% interest. 

Over the last few years, we‚Äôve bought extra term life insurance, extra disability (not sure at the moment what the coverage is), and last week bought a whole life policy from NWM. We also have our IRA through NWM.  We are planning on having kids within the next year or two and would like to incorporate a 529 to save for their education. 

After we bought the whole life, I did more research (late I know) in this subreddit and elsewhere, and now I‚Äôm having second thoughts about that purchase.  Below are our current liabilities and our monthly or yearly payments.  Is anyone able to provide some thoughts to our planning overall and what we could possibly do in the next year or two to plan for kids and our retirement? 

Mortgage: 
1st: 390,000 balance with 29 years remaining at 3.75%.  Monthly payment is $2,324. 
2nd: 47,400 balance with 14 years remaining at 5.79%. Monthly payment is $413. 

Student Loans: 
Balance- $99,000. Maturity- 04/22. 4% interest rate with a monthly payment of $1519. 

Retirement: 
We put 11,000 per year in a Roth (IRA converted to Roth) at 5,500 for each of us.  We each have 4% of our income go to our 403B plan with a company match of 50%. 

Emergency Fund: 
$7,500

Car Loan: 
$4,950.00 with two years remaining at 3.5% interest.  We plan on using a portion of our tax refund to pay this off this week.  
We want to plan for a new family car in the next 1-2 years and would plan to use savings/sale of current car at that time to purchase a car worth less than $20k.  

Insurance: 
Whole Life- 65 Life plan with 8% loan provision. $100K policy for each of us.  $233/month. 
Term- Term80 policy $33/month
Extra disability- ‚ÄúDINC‚Äù plan- $98/month

Additionally, my parents are in their mid- 50s and own a 160 acre farm in southern MN.  The acreage is great and all tillable.  We‚Äôve talked about wanting to buy the farm at some point to keep it in the family and hope to plan for that in the future. If we bought the farm, we would earn rental income on the acreage. 

Lately, I‚Äôve gotten cold feed about our NWM relationship as I know they are ‚Äúsalesmen‚Äù first.  Should we look at finding a certified financial planner instead?

Should we look at doing something else with the car loan money instead of paying it off?  Ideally, we would like to buckle down and get our second mortgage paid off soon to focus more on the student loans.  Are we carrying too much in insurance with the benefits our employer provides? If so, is there anything we can do about that at this point? My wife appreciates the insurance as related to the medical condition and the cost of the home and student loans with the hope of dependents being in the picture soon.",finance,1456882956

I plan on paying $14,000 off my student loans by December of this year. That will bring my balance down to $35,000. I am 31 years old and I do not want to continue renting and neither do I want to wait until my entire student loan balance is paid off before I buy a home. Basically, I plan to pay $14,000 in 2016 off my student loans, and $18,000 off my student loans in 2017. My expenses should drop in 2017 by about $150 a month. Hopefully, my student loan balance will be reduced to about $17,000 at the start of 2018. I have no plan of paying off my car note early.

Will this be a reasonable debt load for obtaining a home loan? My credit scores are EX 755 EQ 763 TU 763. I expect my scores to jump in April when the credit card debt is removed and the statements generate. Am I on the right track here?

Dear Mr. Horner,

Thank you for contacting me regarding the issue of net neutrality. 

On February 26, 2015, unelected bureaucrats at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted 3-2 to impose heavy-handed regulations known as net neutrality on the Internet. The term ""net neutrality"" might sound good, but it is just a clever name for government control of the Internet. 

Since the Clinton administration, the FCC has wisely applied a light regulatory touch to broadband services, resulting in a highly successful broadband industry. The FCC reversed that bipartisan policy decision after consulting with outside interests rather than Congress. The decision is wrong, and the process raises serious questions about the president's inappropriate influence over what is supposed to be an independent agency overseen by Congress. 

Thank you again for contacting my office. It is very helpful to hear the views of the constituents I serve. To date, my office has received more than 1,800,000 letters, emails and phone calls. My mission is to provide information to as many people as possible concerning the enormous financial and cultural challenges facing America.

personalfinance,Should I cash out savings bonds to put in a better savings account?,"SO and I are trying to save up for some impending expenses and bolster our emergency fund in the next few months. We are doing pretty well (esp since we just paid off our credit cards in February), thanks to PF advice. 

My mom gave me a handful of old paper EE bonds, all of them between 1992 and 2006, so I won't lose anything if I cash them out. Most of them are only doing okay interest wise. The $500 one purchased in 2001, for example, has only hit $330 when I just checked it today (if you didn't know--paper bonds are purchased for half of the face value, so $250). They are keeping up with inflation, but is it worth it to wait another 15 years to cash it out? Especially since my income in 15 years will be in the 200-300K range. I think it would be more useful now, even if I don't get the full face value. Could it NOT hit $500? 

I have a savings account with Barclays online that earns 1.05% interest. I'm guessing it would be a wash with regards to interest (although I earn some bonuses if I make monthly deposits, which I do). I could do a CD, but the interest rates don't seem worth it if I want to have the funds within a year. I could invest it, but it seems too high risk and I've never done any investing before.

personalfinance,"Stockpiling cash, looking for good ways to use it.","Hi PF. I'm looking for ways to invest what has become a fairly large (to me!) stockpile of cash. I feel I'm very close to having maxed out most of the easy/low risk ways of distributing what our family has earned over the last 15 years and I'm looking for ideas that are better than leaving my cash in a savings account. Here are the details of my financial situation.


* My spouse makes about $250k a year with at least a 15% increase per year for as long as she stays at her demanding job. 


* We have **$130k in our checking account**, getting .9% interest.

* We have $375 in retirement accounts.


* We max out 401k contributions, have reasonable insurance policies (at least I think we do) and we contribute $8k per year per child towards their 529's. They are not in pre-school yet.


* We live in a relatively high cost of living town, but we bought our first house and the median price of homes in our neighborhood has gone up 30% since we purchased about 5 years ago.


* We have a mortgage remaining of about $400k. We pay $200 extra a month towards principal. Interest rate of 4.5%


* In terms of debt we have $40,000 in student loans. about $30k of those loans are at 5%, the rest at a 2.8% We've been paying off in full the highest interest rate loans each year for the last 4 years. Also paying down a new car at 3%. Roughly $18k.


* In addition to retirement, 529, we save an extra $1000/month and leave it in our checking account. We also do the same with annual bonus, between 10-20% (after taxes) of base salary.


* I don't work, I stay at home with the kids.



So I have two basic questions, the first one is: how are we doing so far?


The second one is that I'm not sure what to do with the extra cash. I'm fairly risk averse, although our retirement accounts are aggressive. I keep thinking it would be so enjoyable to buy a vacation house that we could rent out. The problems with this are another 30 year mortgage, and managing another property (honestly I think we'd have to hire someone to do everything), and I don't feel I'm a savvy home purchaser. We bought our current house because it was located near work, near public transport, and didn't need renovations when we moved in.


I suppose the easiest choice is to pay off the higher interest loans, then put more towards principal of the house. But a vacation home sounds really appealing and might make us more money than just paying off our loans early. Also, the more cash we have in the bank, the easier it will be to find a home we like. But who knows if we'll pull the trigger. I'm just intimidated by the idea. Don't even know where I would buy that I could afford, enjoy, and also be able to drive to on the weekends.


So, any thoughts would be appreciated. I realize I'm in a very fortunate situation but the earlier we can retire, or enjoy long weekends away (which would be so much more enjoyable if we could just go last minute and know we aren't blowing tons of money renting out someone else's place), the better.


One last thing, my wife might decide to say f*ck it and change jobs, cutting her salary by 50% or more so she can avoid an early death. This is why we are slightly risk averse. We expect to inherit $250k in the next ten years and possibly another $500k on top of that in twenty. But we are not counting on these windfalls when figuring out retirement.",finance,1456892212

The next thing is that I was looking at the option of getting a 30 year mortgage at a slightly higher interest rate  (+0.75% vs. 15yr) and them just paying it off as if it was a 15 year loan.

Maybe it is a waste. Maybe I am losing more than what I could have lost due to inflation compared to market crashes and market manipulation. But that's money I chose to use with freedom and take that risk with, rather than forced by the government.

2. I know savings accounts are limited to 6 transactions a month, are there limits to the amount in a transaction? If I needed to put it all back in my USAA Checking account because of a major purchase could it be done easily?

3. Can someone explain the frequency of the interest paid in a savings account? If it's daily VS monthly what are the big differences? Which is better?

4. Any other savings accounts other people have seen a better interest rate with/somewhere else I could put the money to be easily accessed?

personalfinance,Tax Return - how to allocate,"Hey /r/personalfinance - 
I'm set up to receive a combined federal and state tax return of ~1400 (give or take a few dollars). I am focusing on aggressively paying down my debt (about $6100 in consumer debt, 150.00 left on an interest-free promo period and will be paid off before that is up, 1600.00 on 19.24% APR - this comes up again later, and about 4000 on a 15.99% APR). 
My take home pay is about 1400-1600, not factoring in any monthly bonuses I may get (performance based, so ideally, monthly, but for budget purposes not including them here). 
All told, my monthly expenses come to about 1000, not including any emergency expenses. I currently have $825 in a savings account, am contributing $25 weekly to an IRA and was previously doing $200 monthly to my savings account. I'm also putting 6% into my employer 401K, even though I'm not yet eligible for the match (3.5% to 6% personal). 

The plan: I was initially planning on putting that entire tax return toward the 1600 CC debt with the highest interest rate - the logic in doing this is that I am underwater on my car (pay 210 a month and $111 monthly for car insurance) and while payments aren't a burden, would really like to balance it out and get rid of it. My mother, who has been amazing (letting me live rent-free in her basement suite while I handle the rest of my bills) has agreed to match every additional dollar I put into my consumer debt and put that same amount toward my car loan. Ideally, this is awesome because it essentially doubles my money.

However - I really want to start practicing a 0 base budget and living on last month's income - unfortunately, the way my income and bills are set up, I never really have a chance to store a whole month's income. So I am considering using the refund as my ""last month's income"" to get the ball rolling - now would be my only chance to do it because I have already adjusted my withholding to have a higher net pay/smaller, if any, tax return annually. 

TLDR: continue paying debt aggressively or focus on 0 budget/last month's income so I can really see where every dollar is going and put additional monthly excess toward debt?

I currently make 54k a year, and after taxes and IRA matching by the company, i walk with exactly $3,000 a month. Expenses are $450 a month for rent, about $200 a month for utilities, and $50 in various other monthly expenses (gym, spotify, netflix, etc.). I have no credit card debt to worry about. I have been using about 600-700 a month on personal expenses, but that can probably be cut down. I put $500 a month into a savings account, leaving me with $670 on top of the minimum payments to throw at loans. How should I go about doing this? My plan was to get the $4,000 loan completely paid off by the end of the year, and then try to pay extra towards the unsubsidized federal loans. Does this sound like a decent plan?

personalfinance,"In a period of my life with lots of credit activity, how to mitigate score drop?","Hey guys, first time posting.

I currently have a credit score of around 760. (For reference I am a 30 yr old male making $45k). I am in the process of purchasing a house with my mother (who is putting in the down payment), and since I am on the deed as well, my credit got run for the mortgage, which is fine. The mortgage is going to be split 3 ways between myself, my mom, and my girlfriend. My student loans were recently paid off, so my debt level is fairly low as you will see below.

I have a credit card balance of approximately $3600, which is at 16% APR, with the Discover It card. I would like to transfer my balance to another card with the introductory 0% interest rate, after closing of course. 

I also need to finance some furniture for the new house, which is going to be another credit check.

Is there any way to go about doing these things while mitigating some of the credit hits? Or should I just take them, and keep moving forward? Any input would be helpful!!

personalfinance,Personal Loan or Credit Card,"Last year I had a few situations and I ended up getting my self into some debt. 

I have built a pretty comprehensive budget and planned out my pay offs.

My main concern however is my credit card. I have about 9K in CC debt. I'm slowly paying it off but only half of my payment is going to principle due to interest and a ""security fee"". 

I have been looking at personal loans and for a 10k loan with 5-7 percent interest rate I can get a guaranteed pay off date in 24 months. The total monthly payment I believe was somewhere between 440/500 a month which would be lower than what I am paying the credit card company. I would hope to pay off the loan by no later than June of next year at the latest.

My question is should I try to get a personal loan or just stick with the Credit Card company and pay off the loan.

personalfinance,"Buying a car from my parents, not sure what to do or how this works when buying from a private party.","Hey everyone, so to keep this brief, I just got my first higher income job and moved out of my parents. Up to this point I've been driving a car they have. Now that I have a job and have moved out, they want me to either return the car (so they can sell it/trade it) or have me buy it for $6000.

I bring home $4500 a month, of which about $2500 is for all my expenses (rent, phone, utilities, food, student loans) not counting entertainment or unnecessary things like eating out. I don't really have much saved yet as I've just moved and spent money on setting up the new place. I have great credit (750+).

They still owe $3000 on the car, it's a great condition compact SUV with 90K miles on it and about 9 years old and I really enjoyed driving it so I have no problem just keeping this car instead of looking for another one.

My parents aren't exactly lenient on how long I have, they essentially want the $6000 as soon as I can get it. I'm not sure what I should be asking for when I walk into the bank. Does this fall under an auto loan if I've buying it privately from my parents? Should I be refinancing the car and signing that $3000 debt over to me (and giving my parents $3000)? I'm not sure how refinancing works. I also have the ability to join the Navy Federal Credit Union. Is it smarter to go through a credit union than a regular bank? Should I suck it up in terms of luxuries and just pay this off in 3-4 months or will having a long term, consistently paid loan be good for future loans? Any advice would be appreciated.

personalfinance,What do I do next in life?,"I am just kind of cruising along here and though I would see what some others would do if they were me.   

Income: 
I make 130-170k in engineering sales. 
Wife makes $50k in a safe and steady job. Both jobs offer great benefits to one or both of us, we currently pay almost nothing as my job covers everything.   


Assets: 
House appraised at 648K in one of the fastest growing areas of the country. Is in a VERY desirable location, but I hope to never move!
3 cars worth ~$110k only one is depreciating still and no solid plans to replace any. 
$25k Boat
$80k savings
$50k 401k/IRA (Mostly IRA because I was jumping around jobs a lot before now, but it will be going up by about 10% of income a year it seems (mine is as a bonus to my income, wifes comes out of income matched and vested immediately). 
$20k worth of other easily liquidated assets.   


Debts: $500k on the house in 1st and 2nd mortgage 400k@3.25% 30 years and 100k @ 3.875% for 10 years.   


Since we have low debt, our cash flow is pretty good, but my hobbies are all very very expensive, so we aren't saving as much as some of the more paranoid in here would, plus we travel, etc.   


Bills include
1st and 2nd mortgage and escrow: $3800/mo
Gas for cars and boat $400/mo
Cell $80
Internet $92 (all i can get)  

Electricity, water, trash, septic, netflix, maid, car and boat insurance, bug control. $900 a month  

Basically it all adds up that there is about $36k a year leftover after all bills etc.   

So now I can kind of choose to do one of the following:
Replace the older sedan with something nicer (the most useless of all things really, but needs done eventually). 
Buy an investment property - But this makes me poor right away and I don't like that as much, most of the good options would require around 50k cash to get into. 
Buy investment land - easier but less likely to do well, has fringe non monetary benefits to me. 
Save more? I have posted a question like this before and somehow people thought that I don't have enough money saved. I agree that the 401k/IRA is low, but total non depreciating assets is high and savings is high. 
Buy a ferrarri, wife is not impressed with this... would be financially stupid but I could...  

And the most conflicting in my head is this one: Aggressively pay off the 2nd mortgage. Yeah we could put maybe even as much as $2k a month into here without taking a huge lifestyle hit, however it seems like it just doesn't accomplish anything and the interest rate is so low.

personalfinance,Starting My Personal Finance Journey,"After lurking for some time, reading through the wiki (which I can‚Äôt recommend enough now), and doing my own research into my personal savings and investment options, I‚Äôm at a point where I believe I finally understand where to start when it comes to my long-term savings and retirement accounts. Given its somewhat convoluted nature, I‚Äôm hoping to get feedback on the soundness of my plan or if I have overlooked significant details. Let‚Äôs start with some background:   

 

### Personal Background   

Me: 25, single, no debts      

Savings: $50,000   

IRA: $0   

401(k): $24,000 (mix of Before and After Tax)   

 

### 401(k) Background   

Basic Pay ‚Äì ‚Äúyou can generally choose to save from 2% to 60% of your Basic Pay.‚Äù   

Basic Contributions ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhether contributions are After-Tax or Before-Tax Contributions, the first 6% of pay you contribute to the Plan are Basic Contributions.‚Äù   

Company Matching Contributions ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Company matches 75% of your Basic Contributions‚Ä¶‚Äù   

Supplemental Contributions ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you are contributing a full 6% Basic Contribution and you want to increase your savings, you can also make Supplemental Contributions in addition to your 6% Basic Contribution. These contributions can range from 1% to 54% of your Basic Pay and can also be After-Tax and/or Before-Tax Contributions.‚Äù   

After-Tax Contributions ‚Äì ‚ÄúAfter-Tax Contributions go into the Plan after applicable federal, state and local taxes are paid.‚Äù   

Before-Tax Contributions ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you elect to make Before-Tax Contributions, the Company reduces your taxable pay by the amount you choose to defer‚Ä¶ Before-Tax Contributions are limited to a specified dollar amount for each calendar year (for 2014, that dollar limit is $17,500).‚Äù   

Maximum Contributions - ""Generally, contributions to this Plan are limited to a specific amount (for 2014, the limit is the lesser of $52,000 or 100% of your compensation).""   

Withdrawals During Employment ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Plan has six (6) withdrawal options, Options 1-6 discussed below. If you are an active associate, you may make withdrawals ‚Äì but you may not make a withdrawal under Options 1-5 more than twice in any 12-month period‚Ä¶ Option 2: You may withdraw Supplemental After-Tax Contributions that entered the Plan after 1986 and their earnings. There is no suspension of future Company Matching Contributions under this type of withdrawal.‚Äù   

 

### Step 1: Emergency Fund   

Most sources seem to suggest an emergency fund totaling 6-months worth of expenses. I can be quite conservative and say that $25,000 provides me with a comfortable 6-month emergency fund (and then some). I would leave this in my existing Money Market account. I‚Äôm left with $14,000 unallocated, which I‚Äôll get to later.

 

### Step 2: 401(k) Company Match   

The Company Matching Contributions are free money, so I have for a while now and will continue to put 6% per pay period into my 401(k). I can do this either Before-Tax or After-Tax. Currently, I am contributing After-Tax, partially on the assumption that tax rates will only go up in the next 40 years. If there's compelling reason against this thought, I'm all ears.

 

### Step 3: Roth IRA   

Sticking with the Roth IRA for the same reasons as above. Again, if there's reason to go for the Traditional IRA, I'm all ears.  Regardless, I opened a Roth IRA account with Fidelity and have contributed $5,500 to it for both 2015 and 2016.

 

### Step 4: The Mega backdoor Roth   

And now for the fun part‚Ä¶ Additional savings (which are currently TBD pending a proper assessment of my current yearly expenses) would go to my 401(k) as Supplemental Contributions. If these contributions are After-Tax, then they are eligible for an Option 2 Withdrawal During Employment (up to twice in a given 12-month period). The taxable amount of any withdrawals is equal to (Payment - After Tax Contributions). Presumably, this amount will be very close to $0, as earnings over 6 months will be minimal. After-Tax Supplemental Contributions can therefore be moved (essentially) tax-free into my Roth IRA. If maxed out, it could be an additional $40,000+ per year into my tax-advantaged Roth IRA. Similar to normal Roth IRA contributions, I would only have paid income tax on these additional contributions.

 

### Step 5: Reducing Non-Tax-Advantaged Savings   

Time to deal with the $14,000 of unallocated savings I discussed in Step 1. I can't easily move it into a tax-advantaged account, but I can do the next best thing: spend it. I'll max out my 401(k) After-Tax contributions and use the $14,000 I have in unallocated savings to directly counteract the corresponding reduction in monthly income. Once I have spent the $14,000 in unallocated savings (and presumably contributed an additional $14,000 After-Tax to my 401(k), I will modify my 401(k) contributions to be at a more sustainable level based on my monthly expenses. I can then perform the Mega Backdoor Roth on my 401(k) to roll it all into my Roth IRA. It would take a few months to ""convert"" the non-tax-advantaged savings into After-Tax 401(k) contributions, but the long-term tax savings would be awesome.

 

### Step 6: Steady State   
Long-term, the majority of my savings would be going into my 401(k) After-Tax, only to be converted semi-annually into my Roth IRA.
 
### Access to Funds   
My understanding is that normal Roth IRA contributions (and not earnings) can always be withdrawn tax and penalty free. It's also my understanding that for conversions (such as the Mega Backdoor Roth), a 10% penalty 1) applies if I withdraw the converted funds within 5 years of conversion and 2) applies only to any earned interest from the time I make the After-Tax Contribution to my 401(k) to the time I convert it to my Roth IRA. In other words, it would be a 10% penalty on 6 months worth of earnings, which would most likely be far less than 1%. In my mind, this seems like a justifiable penalty should it be needed.
 
### What Did I Mess Up?      
As I said, I am new to personal finance, so I am sure I overlooked something important. Ex1. If my 401(k) After-Tax contributions are actually part of a Roth 401(k). Ex2. If I completely butchered how to do a Mega Backdoor Roth (since it honestly seems too good to be true). In any case, I‚Äôll end this wall-o-text by simply saying: thank you. This subreddit was exactly the springboard I needed to start figuring this out, and I am eternally grateful for it.",finance,1456955681

I have just turned 23, am still living with my parents, have a car (which albiet I probably spent too much on), and have a decent job. I am trying to set up a gameplan for my future but it is proving to be difficult.

To outline my situation. I currently work as a Senior Analyst at a web hosting company, making about $52000 CAD a year net with 4-5 years experience. I have been at the company for two years and my pay has increased from $46000 to the current number within the last year.

I purchased my car one and a half years ago. I can't recall exact numbers but I placed a $13000 dollar downpayment on it, and financed it for 3 years. It was a $20000 car + interest rate of 5%. Forgetting exact math my car payments come to about $310 a month and I have 7 months left until it is paid off (open ended)

My insurance is currently $330/month. Being a 23 year old with no history but living in a high risk area (accident risk, not a bad neighbourhood)

I also end up spending $450 or so a month on gas/parking, living outside of the city and commuting frequently for work/etc.

I did attend university for a Computer science degree, in which I completed two and a half years (working part time as a service desk tech through it all), then getting hired out of my university to my current employer (i did not complete my university degree).

My university bills are paid off, though I do have a bit of a credit line accumulated. I owe about $6200 *edit* was maxed out in November */edit* (10000 limit) on a 8% interest per year credit line. I do have a credit card but it has no debt accumulated onto it ($13000 limit)

Currently my focus has been to paying my credit line off, but it has proven rather difficult. I would like to know some intelligent ways to proceed with my future, what I should focus on, if I am in a good situation/should move jobs, etc.

I am hoping to buy a home or condo, which is no easy task. It is projected housing will go down in the GTA later this year/early next year, so I am trying to plan for that.

1) How much money should I realistically save for moving expenses? I will be driving my car from California. I have savings, but I also have student loans which brings me to the next question

2) I have approx $17,000 in private loans, and $16,000 in federal loans. (I don't need to be chastised here. My father ended up using the money I personally saved for college on his own stuff, and I was stranded at university. Took out a loan to fund the first semester, but left and went to local community college. I've been able to pay for the remainder of my tuition by working, but I needed the federal loans to make up the difference for the final two years of schooling. So really, I don't want to hear anyone telling me ""You should have done this... blah blah blah,"" I've worked incredibly hard to get to where I am and I'm damn proud of myself for paying for my education.)

* The credit line on revolving accounts

I assume this is because I'm at 14% utilization. When I plan on making my next big purchase or take out a loan, I'll start paying my credit card bill a few times a month to keep this lower.

* There is insufficient information, or no account history, for mortgage accounts

Didn't realize this was considered negative, but I figure this is just a time based factor. Can't do anything about it until I buy a house.

* The percentage of department store accounts or charge cards to all of the accounts in your credit file

I have 4 revolving accounts, 2 installment accounts (car and student loans). The percentage of revolving accounts affects your score? These are 2 credit cards, and two lines of credit (CARE credit and Ashley Furniture). Nothing's ever carried a balance without a 0% interest rate (the reason for the two non-card credit lines). I won't open credit lines for the sake of having more lines, that's kind of silly from what I've read. I'm just curious if the ratio is really that big of a factor?

* The length of time since credit cards have been opened in your credit file

Final one, which again seems like it's more of a ""wait"" type situation. I'm 24. Credit lines range from 1 to 6 years old. At what point is a the age considered ""good enough"" and not a negative factor?

I also was an authorized user on gas cards that were considered a charge off. Those came up on my report but not under the key factors for my score. The report marks me as an authorized user. The last payments were 01/13. Should I attempt to get my name taken off of the cards? Would I contact the credit issuer or the original account holder?

personalfinance,"Should I consider a ""blend and extend"" on my fixed rate mortgage? (CAN)","My credit union offers a service to ""blend and extend"" (B&amp;E) my mortgage interest rate--meaning blending my current fixed interest (3.32%) rate with their currently advertised rate, while also extending the fixed term.

My mortgage was originally $299k (now $251k - I make $600/2 week payments) and doesn't come up for refinancing until August 2017. If I sign on now:

* a 3 year B&amp;E would get a rate of 2.98%
* a 4 year B&amp;E would be 3.051%;
* a 5 year B&amp;E would be 3.089%.

There is a $125 admin fee and my payment remains the same.

My question is, should I wait 18 months to refinance without a penalty (hopefully at a lower rate) or should I take advantage of this blend and extend feature? And for how long?

personalfinance,Using and paying off a credit card at the same time?,"So I have paid off my fair share of credit cards. However recently I made a big purchase on one and I will be paying for it for a bit over a year. That purchase, lets just say its $10,000 is at an interest rate of 15.35% annually. 

Just a few days ago I was was needing to purchase some normal needs based items and had a thought which I am asking here for some clarification. Since I don't have any promotional interest rates and all new purchases get charged at the same interest rate, i could technically take advantage of the 25 day grace period on new purchases (at least I think so). 

So my idea was, if I have to use money for things, I would be better off, as an example, charging my $500 expense to the credit card while simultaneously putting an extra $500 payment to the credit card. It is my belief if I am reading all this stuff correctly is that I'd reduce my interest based debt on the card by $500 for 25 days until the $500 credit charge would begin accruing interest. Which is giving me small reductions in interest charges for each 25 days after making purchases, paying bills, etc.

Is this accurate or am I missing something?
If it is accurate, would it not be better if I just put all my bills into the credit card, and payed them all as soon as the paychecks come in to get as much reduction in the interest charged debt and to cover all the bills plus extra..

What you think?

personalfinance,How to finance medical school,"Hello,
I am a 21 year old undergraduate planning on entering medical school in August 2016.  I am already admitted to 2 schools (both MD schools and in the US) and am waiting to hear back from 4 more that I have interviewed at. So I'm wondering 1)which option I should choose for medical school and 2) how I should go about financing it and 3) what should I expect debt-wise in the long run.

Some background information: I have no debt from undergrad (I'm on scholarship) but I have no money saved for medical school either.  I will not get any money from family to help.  I have good credit.  I hope to be an emergency room doctor, and they make between $230,000-$270,000 a year. I filled out my FAFSA, and my expected family contribution was zero and I qualified for $20,000 in financial aid. I believe that generally how medical students fund their education is through federal stafford loans (5.84% interest rate, covers the first $40,000 ish) and through graduate plus loans (covers the cost of attendance minus the $40,000 from the stafford loan; 6.84% interest).  
 
So as far as which medical school to attend, I have a bit of a dilemma. I have been admitted to one school that I could go to almost for free.  I have a $10,000 merit scholarship (and I may well get more) from the school already, and their tuition is only $24,000 in state. So with my $10,000 a year scholarship and $20,000 financial aid from FAFSA, I would expect to only take out between 5-10k in loans per year for living expenses, and this is assuming I don't get any more scholarship money (though I expect to).  However, it is not in an area of the country that I would ultimately like to live in, nor is it a particularly well respected program.  
The other school I have been admitted to is mid tier.  Cost of attendance there is $76k, but it is in a more desirable part of the country to live in and I could well get some scholarship money as my scores are above their 90th percentile.  Average indebtedness upon graduation for them is $204k. 
Two of the schools I'm waiting to hear back from are top tier.  Both in great parts of the country and both are top 20 medical schools. Cost of attendance at both is around 80k, but they both have pretty good financial aid so average indebtedness upon graduation is $115,000 for one and $160,000 for the other.  I would not expect any merit scholarships from either if I get in, but might (small chance) get some need based if I'm lucky. I'm not accepted to either yet though, so it may not even be an option.

So anyway, should I go for the free option or consider going mid tier or top tier? Something to keep in mind is that my debt will grow with interest during my residency (will last 3-4 years after graduation, and I'll only be making 40-50k). If I take the larger debt, what would be the best method to pay it off (ie doing huge payments for 2-3 years or smaller payments over time?)  Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1456975118

personalfinance,Not another student loan horror story...,"Unfortunately, the title couldn't be further from the truth.

Basically, I am going to give you all a quick breakdown of my situation and plead for recommendations on whether I should pursue loan consolidation with a bank or not. 


I have a lot of student loan debt from NJ Class. It doesn't matter why/how I got it. That I can't change. However, there has to be a better way. 

I just recently accepted a job in my field (how fucking rare, right?) making $32,000 a year.  It is a great job with a lot of promotion potential and is a secure position. However, in the meantime I simply cannot afford $814/mo, especially after having to move across the country, get an apartment, and get a new car, all while making only ~$2,000 a month. Again, the new job will be worth it in the long run as I will receive at least $4k/year raise and there is very high promotion potential. 


Here is a breakdown of my loans with NJ Class (private loan)

Loan 1: $17,042.18 outstanding principle with a 7.59% interest rate

Loan 2: $25,134.42 principle, 8% interest rate

Loan 3: $19,539.44 principle, 7.05% interest rate

Loan 4: $19,309.65 principle, 6.65% interest rate


That leaves me with a total balance of $81,351.49 owed to NJClass.

I also have Federal student loans (~$23,000) that amounts to a monthly payment of $300.

I simply cannot afford a monthly payment of $1100 to just student loans. Thats over 50% of my income.

Based on everything here, I beg for recommendations about whether I should consolidate or not. I love the idea of paying off my loans in only 10 years, but I am wondering if a 15 year or 20 year consolidation with a bank will benefit me enough in the short term to make it worth it. 

One additional question: How can it be that when I check the breakdown of the amounts paid to my principle and interest each month, that it's usually 60% going to interest and 40% going to the principle? Are the loans backloaded so that most of the money goes to interest in the beginning?

Thank you all so much in advance!",finance,1456977455

investing,Yahoo - Bill Ackman is getting obliterated,"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-ackman-getting-obliterated-234544424.html

Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, founder of $13 billion Pershing Square Capital, is having another devastating year.

Pershing Square Holdings, his fund's publicly traded vehicle, has fallen 19.9% through the end of February, according to a performance update.

Ackman, a well-known activist investor, makes large, concentrated bets in a handful of companies. This year, the majority of his long positions have collapsed, while his only short bet has surged.

His returns in February were largely dragged down by Valeant Pharmaceuticals' massive decline and Herbalife's big spike on Friday.

On February 29, the last trading day of the month, Valeant confirmed that its part in several ongoing investigations, including ones by the US Attorney's Offices for Massachusetts and the Southern District of New York and the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

The stock collapsed 18.44%, or $14.87, to close at $65.78 per share on Monday.

Pershing Square is the largest hedge fund shareholder of Valeant, with more than 21.5 million shares. Since taking a position in the first quarter of 2015, the fund has lost more than $2 billion ‚Äî on paper ‚Äî on its position.

In contrast, Herbalife, the fund's only short bet, surged in February. The stock gained more than 18% over the month. On Friday, the company said in a filing that it's in talks with the Federal Trade Commission.

For more than three years, Ackman has been crusading against Herbalife, a multilevel marketer that sells nutritional shakes and weight-loss products. In late December 2012, Ackman publicly declared that he was short $1 billion worth of Herbalife.

He believes that the company is operating as a ""pyramid scheme"" that targets poor people. It's his contention that regulators, specifically the FTC, will shut the company down. In March 2014, the FTC opened an investigation into the company. Herbalife has always denied Ackman's allegations.

In his fourth-quarter investment letter that he published in late January, Ackman intimated that he would be sticking by his positions. Here's a rundown of how they have performed this year/last month:

Valeant (VRX): -35.27% YTD / -27% MTD
Platform (PAH): -44.74% YTD / -7% MTD
Fannie Mae (FNMA): +4.88% YTD /  +29% MTD
Freddie Mac (FMCC): +2.47% YTD / +26% MTD
Canadian Pacific (CP): -5.02% YTD / +1.22% MTD
Howard Hughes (HHC): -18% YTD / -2.36% MTD
Restaurant Brands International (QSR): -8.25% YTD / +0.36% MTD
Air Products &amp; Chemicals (APD): +1.81% YTD / +4.55% MTD
Zoetis (ZTS): -14.32% YTD / -4.62% MTD
Mondelez (MDLZ): -9.61% YTD / -o.56% MTD
Last year, Pershing Square suffered its worst year in its history, losing 20.5%.

I am currently a student with about $17,000 subsidized student loan debt and an incoming tuition bill for $16,000 for next year. The loans have around 4% interest, but the interest will not begin accruing until 2017. I am going to be employed at two different jobs between now and August, and I expect to make enough money (I will be working overtime) in order to cover these two obligations this year. My parents have offered to help me pay for the loans, but I would really like to pay them off myself. My parents have been incredibly generous to cover my expenses so far, and I really dont want to be a further financial strain on them.   

I wanted some advice on how to use my income as effectively as possible. On one hand I just want to pay everything off and stop worrying about it which would allow me to pay off my loans before they start accruing interest.  On the other hand,  I don't want to regret my decision later as I probably wont have so many savings anytime soon. I have thought about investing the money, but I have never done that before so I don't know if I'd be able to get returns over the loan interest rate.

In the near future (2-3 years) my salary will jump to around $115,000. In the distant future (~8 years) I will be making over $150,000. I'm currently single and live a pretty frugal life however I'll be married by the end of this year and we're not planning on having kids. Last year I got hit pretty hard with taxes since my 401k was my only tax buffer and I only contributed enough to maximize employer contribution. 

I have decided to contribute 20% of my paycheck to my 401k account where I'm putting 100% of the contribution into my Vangaurd Target Retirement 2055 account. After reading a lot about compound interest and the importance of investing early I've decided to make it my goal to max out yearly 401k contributions since I can easily manage that.

I also opened up a Roth IRA account after reading a little about it and I put the maximum of $5,500 for my 2015 contribution (since we have until April 15th, 2016 to contribute to last years account). I did it on a whim since I read that I could use $10,000 of my contributions &amp; interest gained (without any tax penalty) for the purchase of my first home if I have the account open for 5 years (so no harm done, right?). 

Currently my Roth IRA is sitting in a Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund because I have absolutely no idea where to invest it in. I have done a lot of reading on this website and others to get to this point and although I still lack a lot of knowledge I'm definitely willing to learn. I've read the Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA wiki on this site and I'm still not sure if I made the right move by starting up a Roth IRA account. 

**Questions:**

Should I move all of my 401k Funds into the 2060 retirement account?

Should I have gone with a Traditional IRA rather than Roth?

What funds should I invest in?


Are there any other steps I should be taking other than maxing out my 401k and IRA?

My current loan rate through the dealer where I purchased the car is at 7.99%.  I have 49 payments of $217.99 left.  I figure that if I continue paying that exact amount I have $10,681.51 left to pay.

The offer I've received through a credit union is at 2.99%.  This would be 48 payments of $214.28, paying exact amount would come to $10,285.44.  My intention was to start paying more each month and pay off earlier with the lower interest rate.

What I didn't foresee was that with the new offer the following fees are added on:  Title Fee at $85.00, Service/Doc Fee at $299, and Membership Fee at $10.  That's $394 that I wasn't expecting.  Does this sound normal?  I hadn't thought far enough ahead about what I'll need to pay at the end of my financing to get the title in my name and anything else I may need to pay at end of term.

Can anyone offer and thoughts on how I should plan?

She wants to have a third too, 40-60% chance that'll happen. My wife has better interest rates across the board than I do but I don't have access to all that right now.

After all that, should I increase the HSA contribution? I'd almost definitely be able to use it.

Lastly, is there anything wrong with being on IRB and just using any extra money only towards the 3 loans that have the interest rates?

personalfinance,Student Loan payments about to start - need to decide how to manage them (Really made poor decisions early on),"Hi everyone,
 
First off, I am already appropriately ashamed of many of the poor decisions I made in my early 20's regarding student loans, and even some I made since, but they are what they are and I need a plan. I'm 33 now and ready to be a grown up I guess.
 
My first few years of college I worked a lot and didn't take huge loans, then my final (5th) year of undergrad I quit and took the full amount offered ($20,000) which put me up around 30 or 40k. Then I went back two years later and did a post-grad degree again with full loans, in just one year, for another $20k. Then I went off and spent a couple years in the Peace Corps, which it turned out only forgave a couple grand, just of my little Perkins Loans.
 
Then I got married and went to grad school, all at the same time. I had about $15k in medical bills from a couple knee surgeries at that point, so I took full loans both years to pay that all off. I ended up with more than $80k in loans and it seems that interest has already pushed me to just over $100k. No more medical debt though.
 
I just started a job with a four year contract at a non-profit that qualifies for PSLF. I am now making $57k, with a raise to about $65k in a few months when I finish training. I expect to be around $75k to $80 when I finish my contract in four years. I also can stay employed here for as long as I want and plan to stay for at least 10 years. My husband currently makes about $30k and with his work he goes to school just one or two terms a year. He should finish his bachelors in about 3 years and then should be making around $50k. 
 
We have about $5k in other debts (credit cards etc) that we are on track to have paid off by about September. We have a one year old with another on the way and my five year old stepson, for whom we are currently suing for full custody and we expect to have him full time starting in April. We would also like to have maybe one more child.
 
We just bought our first house and our mortgage payments are currently about $1300/month. We pay $400 for our cars, $350 child support (should be going away soon), $850 daycare (will be around $1500 once we get my stepson with us and will stay around that after having another baby because the oldest will start public school), and about $700 in other bills. We also put into HSA, retirement, and pay a bit for benefits, so I bring home just about $2300 a month currently and my husband maybe $1500.
 
That is a pretty general idea of our financial situation. We are ok, but we don't have extra right now. It will be easier once the other debts are paid off, then we can up our itty bitty emergency fund, which is currently just about as much as one mortgage pmt.
 
Our credit is decent - around 700 each - but needs to be better. Our home loan is currently owner carried with a five year payout, so we need to have great credit and income to go to a bank in about 4.5 years and get a ""real"" home loan to buy out the previous owners. Our house was valued at $400k and we were able to put $150k down from an inheritance, so our loan isn't going to be too unreasonable. There's also a lot of big expensive things we'd like to do to our home at some point. It's a decent investment property with 75% of the value being in just the lot size and location, but it has a wimpy boring little house on it that could use some improvement.
 
Now, all my questions. [Here are my current loans.](http://i.imgur.com/ddMvEBt.png) I consolidated after my first bachelors, so I have two consolidation loans there. Everything is federal.
 
My thoughts right now:
 
1. I think I need to fill out some forms to get all my new loans consolidated into my existing consolidation loans. I see no reason not to do that immediately. I thought I remembered hearing randomly through college things like ""consolidate now while rates are low,"" etc. Is there some reason to wait for some ""low rates"" or something or just do it?
 
2. I feel like there is no reason to pay more than the IBR bare minimum, if I am hoping to have it all forgiven in ten years anyways. Unless there is some fine print I am missing about a minimum monthly amount you have to make to qualify? I'm so worried I will do something wrong and not end up qualifying and have massive interest accumulate in the meantime. I already have an email in to HR about getting certified to qualify on the employment end, but I also need to make sure my payment plan qualifies.
 
3. The loan repayment calculator shows a drastically lower monthly payment for ""married filing separately."" How does that affect taxes and stuff if I do that? We had never considered that. We already filed jointly for last year.
 
4. What piece of the plan am I missing?

personalfinance,State (MA) estimated taxes mixup,"I'll try to keep this short. My wife was working as an independent contractor for the second half of 2015. She paid estimated federal and state taxes in October 2015 and January 2016 for Q3 and Q4. 

We filed married/jointly and included my wife's estimated tax payments as part of our return.

Just got a notice from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue that *I* claimed $XXX in estimated taxes but the state received $0 from me. I looked back at my submitted form from TurboTax, and I see where the confusion is - the $902 is listed under my name. But looking further, I realized that's because we were filing jointly - there was no separate ""estimated state taxes"" line item for my wife. And I'm listed as Spouse on the payments that she did make, so I don't see why that should be an issue.

What's the best way for me to resolve this? I don't need to amend my return, right? Because it's technically correct? How do I go about submitting the evidence to the state that we really did pay estimated taxes for Q3 and Q4?",finance,1457034910
finance,[CAN] Spread between inflation indexed and vanilla GoC bonds?,"Hey /r/finance, 

I'm still a student but working on a project forecasting expected inflation and I came across the spread between the GoC RRB (Dec 2021) and GoC 5 year (interpolated June 2021 June 2022) and the spread seems to come in at ~1.25.

Judging from the BoC posted CPI rates I adjusted for 2% inflation (that is what core CPI has been steady at and Total CPI should trend around that for the next 5 years) there would be a a real spread of 85bps yoy.

The way I understand it is that is essentially betting on total CPI being &gt; 1.25 over the term, with little interest rate risk and only exposure to inflation risk over the term. 

The way I see it, short GoC vanilla and buy GoC RRB and you'd make a killing. Could someone experience in fixed income tell me why this is happening and what risks I may be missing or is the market just mispricing these that badly?

personalfinance,Income-based student loan repayment: How to organize payment priority across accounts?,"Hello! I'm new to budgeting (and, let's be honest, new to actually paying attention to my finances in general) and have found SO much helpful information on here! I have heaps of questions about budgeting, but as most of them boil down to ""I just want confirmation that I'm on the right track,"" I'll keep doing some reading on my own until I find more specific things to poke at. 

That being said, one of those things I want to look more closely at is my student loan repayment. I'm paying on two different federal loans - one mine, one a ""plus"" loan in my mom's name. The one in my name is on income-based repay, and at the moment, my monthly payment is zero. (Yes, I need to increase my income. Moving on. =] ) I DO generally have a bit of money left at the end of my months that I can put into paying more than the exact amount due on each loan. My question is: Which do I put it toward? Normally I'd say ""well the one with the highest interest rate, of course!"" However, since my loan is on a $0 repayment and can be forgiven after x years, should I keep leaving that one alone and dump money into the one that I'm going to have to pay off in full, no matter what? Or is it smarter to keep working towards paying off both? If I ""ignore"" the IBR loan for the moment, should I at least keep the interest paid down so that doesn't get added to the principal at the eventual time of forgiveness and create a larger tax burden? 

Goodness, I hope that makes sense. I'm so new to all of this, I don't really even know what questions to ask, but I am extremely grateful for any ideas out there!",finance,1457035597

personalfinance,"Graduating in May, hopefully employed by August. Looking for help with plan to pay down debts and start off on the right foot.","Hey /r/personalfinance. I've posted about my situation last year, but now since I am getting closer to the ""real world"", I want to make sure that I start off on the right foot and have a good plan.

I will be graduating with my BSN in May. Expecting anywhere between 70-85k starting yearly. As for my debt:


Private Discover Student Loans: 57,488k (interest rate anywhere between 8-10.99%) Only way to get through school, no help whatsoever, I can't change this.


Federal Student Loans: 34,788


Credit Cards: 6,626 (had to pay a semester of school). EDIT: I am paying MONTHLY MINIMUMS 100 for one card and 55 for the other. Interest rates are like 15-16% Ive called up twice in the last 2 months and have got them decreased by 1%.

Overall: 98,902k. Makes me sick just typing that lol.

Now, my plan is to start by paying off my credit cards first, hoping to complete within 3 months, while paying the minimums on my student loans. Then, after the credit cards are paid off, continue paying the minimums on the student loans + whatever I was paying monthly for my credit cards to pay it off.

Im looking for advice to start off on the right foot and to pay down this debt as quick and efficiently as possible Ive been thinking about this every day for the last 3 years and I can't wait to just get a good job and start paying everything off. 

I also, obviously, want to go on with my life (housing, car, etc.). So, I want to be able to pay off my debts but continue moving forward with my life.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1457038228
personalfinance,"I am a 22-year-old female looking to purchase the car I have been leasing. I make 1,000 a month.

I got it new (2013 Civic EX) and have been leasing for 3 years for $176/mo. My payoff amount is right around 14000. I don't pay rent and for all intents and purposes, live with my parents. On my application we put down that I made a little more than 1,000 a month, because my parents do support me here and there and it counts as supplemental income. I'm also going to start working full time so my income is going to shoot up within the next few months. My lease ends next month.


The negotiating at the dealership to finance through them was pretty intense and took a long time. They are supposed to call me back today and still haven't. But the lowest rate they offered me was 5.79% interest. I held out to have them check with credit unions they work with, but I won't be surprised if 5.79% is the lowest I get offered. I've had a credit line for 2.5 years and my credit score was 737 before credit checks dinged it recently. Now it's 7-twenty-something.


I know I'm not going to get offered 1.8% like my boyfriend was who recently bought a used car from the same Honda dealership, because he makes 75k a year and also has good credit... But is this rate terrible for my circumstances?

Read over it, thought it was interesting so I figured I'd share, also first post so give me tips/pointers if you have any.
Highlights I found interesting:

""now with quantitative easing and negative interest rates, the concept of nurturing credit seems to have morphed into something destructive as opposed to growth enhancing. Our global, credit based economic system appears to be in the process of devolving from a production oriented model to one which recycles finance for the benefit of financiers. Making money on money seems to be the system‚Äôs flickering objective. Our global financed-based economy is becoming increasingly dormant, not because people don‚Äôt want to work or technology isn‚Äôt producing better things, but because finance itself is burning out."" 
(1st paragraph)

""Private sector savers are growing leery of debt piled upon debt and government regulators have begun to build fences against further rampant creation. In addition, the return offered on savings/investment whether it be on deposit at a bank, in Treasuries/ Bunds, or at extremely low equity risk premiums, is inadequate relative to historical as well as mathematically defined durational risk."" 
(2nd paragraph)

""The recent collapse in worldwide bank stock prices can be explained not so much by potential defaults in the energy/commodity complex, as by investor recognition that banks are now not only being more tightly regulated, but that future ROE‚Äôs will be much akin to a utility stock."" 
(3rd paragraph)

""Puerto Rico follows Detroit not just because of overpromised benefits but because they cannot earn enough on their investment portfolios to cover the promises."" 
(4th paragraph)

""government policymakers seem to be setting up future roadblocks for savers. There is a somewhat suspicious uniform attack on high denomination bills of global currencies. Noted economists such as Larry Summers; respected journalists such as the FT‚Äôs Gillian Tett, central bankers such as Mario Draghi ‚Äì all seem suddenly concerned that 500 Euro or 10,000 Yen Notes are facilitating drug dealers and terrorists"" 
(5th paragraph)

""And that‚Äôs not the end of it. If negative interest rates fail to generate acceptable nominal growth, then the Milton Friedman/Ben Bernanke concept of helicopter money may be employed. How that could equitably be distributed nationally or worldwide I have no idea"" 
(6th paragraph)

""The secret in a negative interest rate world that poses extraordinary duration risk for AAA sovereign bonds is to (1) keep bond maturities short and (2) borrow at those attractive yields in a mildly levered form that provides a yield (and expected return) of 5-6%""

personalfinance,Prospective first-time home buyer questions,"I‚Äôm considering buying my first home in the near future and have some questions. I realize a lot of answers to financial questions are ‚Äúit depends‚Äù so if you could ballpark it, give a range, or give an example from personal experience, that would be great.


Me + SO would both be on the mortgage. We are both mid-20s, credit scores 750+, combined income approx. $100K. Looking in Fort Worth, TX, area for home &lt;200K.

1) We most likely won‚Äôt be able to put a 20% down payment without breaking into our backup funds (which we won‚Äôt do). My understanding is we will be required to have PMI until we pay down our principal to 80%. What kind of fee can I expect to pay for PMI? Is it a percentage of the mortgage or flat rate?

2) Given the above, what kind of interest rate would be ‚Äúgood‚Äù for us? Obviously there is a wide range of what we might expect. What would be the threshold between ‚Äúthat seems good, let‚Äôs think about that‚Äù and ‚Äúholy shit I can‚Äôt believe we got one that low, let‚Äôs go with that one‚Äù? Alternatively, what‚Äôs the threshold between ‚Äúseems high but we‚Äôll consider it‚Äù and ‚Äútoo much, don‚Äôt give it a second thought‚Äù?

3) Our current thoughts are along the lines of renting a house is pretty expensive, might as well be paying a mortgage and building equity in something we own. That said, we also know that the mortgage payment is not the only thing we‚Äôd have to worry about if we purchase a home. What kinds of additional expenses might we be overlooking? I‚Äôm talking things that we WILL be paying (property taxes, homeowner‚Äôs insurance, etc.), not things that MIGHT happen (hot water heater breaks, need to replace the refrigerator, etc.). Note: I‚Äôve been living in rented houses for about 6 years so I‚Äôve accumulated a good amount of ‚Äústuff,‚Äù so major furniture purchases, stocking the kitchen, and the like are already taken care of.

4) Closing costs ‚Äì who covers them? Are these things like realtors‚Äô commissions etc?

5) Do monthly mortgage payments get bundled with other expenses (PMI?) or is it all paid separately?

Any advice, pearls of wisdom, horror stories, ‚Äúwish I woulda‚Äù stories, etc. are more than appreciated. Thank you!

personalfinance,What is my employer telling me in this email regarding 401k contributions?,"The email is pasted below. I understand the first two paragraphs, but I don't understand how it relates to bonuses and how to know if I need to make changes to my contributions before the bonus is paid. 

&amp;nbsp;

Federal tax laws limit the total amount of Compensation that may be taken into account under the Plan each Plan Year (January 1 through December 31). For 2016, the maximum amount of Compensation that may be counted for Plan purposes (e.g., calculation of matching contributions) is $265,000. The maximum elective deferral limit for 2016 is $18,000. The maximum catch-up deferral limit for 2016 is $6,000 for participants age 50 and over. The total elective deferral limit including catch-up (if eligible) is $24,000 which includes both regular pre-tax deferrals and/or Roth post-tax deferrals.
 
These limits, combined with your deferral election percent, work together to determine the amount of Company match you will receive on your deferrals.  The Company matches your deferral on a tiered basis (see chart below) up to 6% of your wages and this match is calculated each time you make a deferral. It is not calculated at year end on your annual average deferral percentage. This fact is very important to remember as you consider your wage pattern, including bonuses, and your deferral election level throughout the year.  If your election is greater than 6% on any given payroll, the amount over 6% does not receive the match. Therefore, if you defer 12% for 6 months of the year and 0% for the other 6 months, perhaps because you have reached either the wage limit or the deferral limit by mid-year, only half of your deferral amount will be matched. If you defer 6% over the entire year, every dollar will be matched, according to the matching schedule.
 
Company Matching Schedule*                                                                                 
$1 on every $1 you contribute, up to 3% of your eligible Compensation
$.50 on every $1 you contribute, for the next 4% - 6% of your eligible Compensation
 
*Catch-up deferral elections are not matched.
 
As we are approaching the payment period for annual cash bonuses, you may want to review your deferral election and the impact of possible bonuses on your wage and deferral limits, in order to maximize your opportunity for the Company match.  Changes to deferral elections must be made in advance of payroll processing.  Deadlines for election changes are below:

personalfinance,Need assessment on a graduating student's plans and financial status,"Hey guys,

I've been a long time lurker on this sub and now about to graduate college in July with loans. Now, I know this is often posted especially what with new college graduates entering the real world around this time but I'd appreciate every little bit of assessment on my financial status as well as a few questions I have.

As of now, I have a grand total of $31,329.10 (principal + interest) in both subsidized and unsubsidized loans. However, I've exhausted all federal aid and can no longer borrow any more from the government so I will have to turn to a private lender to borrow $4,452.83 to pay off my remaining spring bill + a summer class that I need to finally graduate in July. In addition, my dad took out a parent loan of $4,672.08 for me when I was a freshmen which I have stupidly neglected to pay down since then. I'd like to ""own"" this loan somehow. 

1) Is it possible to consolidate it with my existing loans either by increasing my private loan to pay it off asap or by some other means? 



My current financial status is as follows:

Checking: $548.28
Savings: $2280.23
Credit Card Debt: $3,675.39 @ 0% interest until 12/2016
Transunion Credit Score based off of Credit Karma: 702

Current income: ~ $170/week from a current internship + work study
Vehicle Insurance for a fully owned car: 6 months paid off until 8/2016 
Rent + utilities: ~ $500/month
Phone plan (T-Mobile): $60/month
Food: $50 - $100/week (50/50 of eating out and making something at home but I know this needs work)



My internship + workstudy job ends sometime in early May so upon the end of this semester, I'm going to try and find a part-time job to sustain myself until the middle of August while studying.

I don't have a full-time career job lined up currently but I am fairly confident that I will be able to at least by the end of this year (engineering degree, several internships w/ large companies &amp; planning on taking the FE exam in August). 

Here's the kicker - I am extremely burnt out and want to take time off to travel for a month (insert clinche 20 something year old wanting to see the world, will not have time to travel for an extended period of time, etc.). I'm looking at an initial budget of $2-3K for this. 

2) Is this doable given my current financial situation? I've indicated on all my job applications that I will be available to start late-Septemberish to October because if I don't end up traveling, I'd want to spend time with family &amp; friends at the very least.

Lastly, I want to move away. This is of course dependent upon whatever job I land takes me but if this doesn't happen by the time the end of September rolls around, I am thinking of packing it all and moving from the East to West Coast, preferably Seattle or San Diego where I know someone who might be able to help with housing until I can get on my feet. This is attributed by the fact that I want to try living out on the West. 

3) Is this doable given my financial status?

This was long but I am essentially looking for an honest critique of my plans/goals since I don't really know anyone who is financially savy. My timeline seems a bit tight but bear with me on this. I am lucky enough to be healthy with no other financial obligations and want to make the best with what I got.

Thanks for reading and please be nice! Any advice, tips or concerns are much appreciated.",finance,1457059201

btc,"The owners of Blockstream are spending $75 million to do a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin by manipulating the Core devs &amp; the Chinese miners. This is cheap compared to the $ trillions spent on the wars on Iraq &amp; Libya - who also defied the Fed / PetroDollar / BIS private central banking cartel.","At this point, that's really the simplest ""Occam's razor"" explanation for Blockstream's ""irrational"" behavior.

Once you let go of *your* irrational belief that Blockstream's owners actually want to get a ""return"" on their $75 million investment, from ""innovations"" such as sidechains technology (Lightning Network - LN) - only *then* will you be able to see that Blockstream's apparently ""irrational"" behavior is actually *perfectly rational.*

They *say* their goal is to ""get rich"" from LN. And if you believe that, I have a Dogecoin I'd like to sell you.

**What are the real goals of Blockstream's owners?**

Blockstream's owners don't give a fuck about the Rube Goldberg vaporware which some focus group christened ""the Lightning Network"". That name is just there to placate the masses of noobs who congregate on /r/bitcoin.

The owners of Blockstream are laughing at Adam Back as he continues to labor in isolation, the stereotypical math PhD who is clueless about economics, toiling away creating a slow, overpriced, centralized ""level 2"" payment layer on top of Bitcoin - a complicated contraption which may never work. They have neutralized him - but meanwhile, he thinks he's a rock star now, as ""CEO of Blockstream"". Little does he know he is the worst ""collaborator"" of all. 

**Investors are risk-averse**

If Blockstream's owners *really* wanted to get rich from LN, do you really think they would freeze the ""max blocksize"" at 1 MB for the next year, when this 1-year freeze obviously risks destroying Bitcoin itself (along with their investment)?

Investors are not stupid - and they *are* risk-averse. They know that if there's no Bitcoin, then there's no Lightning - so their $75 million investment would go out the window.

And all the ""Core"" devs have actually gone on the record stating (in their less-guarded moments, or before they signed their employment contracts with Blockstream) that 2 MB blocks would work fine - even 3-4 MB blocks. Empirical research by miners has shown that 3-4 MB blocks - or even bigger - would work fine right now.

So why aren't the Blockstream investors pressuring the Core devs to go to 2 MB now, to remove the risk of Bitcoin failing?

If Blockstream did the ""rational"" thing and agreed to 2 MB now, the price would shoot up, the community would heal, innovation would start happening again. Bitcoin would proper, and Blockstream's investors would have a good chance at making a ""return"" on their investment.

For some reason, Blockstream's investors are trying to stop all this from happening. So we have to look for a different explanation. If the owners of Blockstream *don't* want to get rich from the Lightning Network, then what do they *really* want?

The simplest explanation is that the *real* risk which Blockstream's investors are ""averse"" to is *the possibility of trillions of dollars in legacy fiat suddenly plunging in relative value, if Bitcoin were to shoot to the moon.* They're afraid they'll lose power if Bitcoin succeeds.

In order to provide some support for this radical but simple hypothesis, we have to dive into some pretty nasty and shadowy geopolitics.

**What do the wars on Iraq and Syria, JPMorgan's naked short selling of silver, and the book ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" all have in common?**

Whenever a currency tries to compete with the Fed / Petrollar / BIS [1] private central banking cartel, the legacy fiat power √©lite destroys that currency (if the currency has a central point of control - which Bitcoin does have: the Core devs, the Chinese miners, and Theymos). 

*[1] BIS = the Bank for International Settlements, often referred to as ""the central bank of central banks""*

Trillions of dollars were spent to take down the central banks of Iraq and Libya, because they defied the hegemony of the Fed / Petrodollar / BIS private central banking cartel. 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ellen+brown+iraq+libya+bis

And while you're googling, you might want to look up whistleblower Andrew Maguire (who exposed how JPMorgan uses naked short selling to ""dump"" nonexistent silver in order to prevent the USDollar from collapsing).

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=andrew+maguire+jpmorgan

And you might also want to look up John Perkins, whose book ""Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"" is another major eye-opener about how ""the Washington consensus"" manages to rule the world by printing fiat backed by violence and justified by ""experts"" and propaganda.

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=john+perkins+confessions+economic+hit+man

That's just how the world works - although you have to do a bit of research to discover those unpleasant facts.

So for the legacy fiat power √©lite, $75 million to take down Bitcoin (and maintain their power) is chump change in comparison. 

**You all *knew* that ""they"" were going to try to destroy Bitcoin, didn't you?**

Even Jamie Dimon practically admitted as much. 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jamie+dimon+bitcoin

Did you really think they would be clumsy enough to try to *ban* it outright? 

Private central bankers run this planet, and they have never hesitated to use their lethal combination of guns, debt and psyops to maintain their power. They pay for the wars, they keep people enslaved to debt, and they dumb down the population so nobody knows what's really going on.

Print up a trillion dollars here, kill a million people there, brainwash everyone with censorship and propaganda. That's their modus operandi.

So we shouldn't be surprised if they they ruthlessly and covertly try to take down Bitcoin. They have the means and the motivation.

It was only a matter of time before they identified the three weakest centralized points in the Bitcoin system: 

- the Core devs

- the Chinese miners

- Theymos

And so that's where they applied the pressure. 

I'm sorry to be rude, but all three of those players listed above are idiot savants / sitting ducks up against the full-spectrum of covert dirty tricks deployed by the legacy fiat power √©lite - whether it's money, ego-stroking, or pretending to go along with their crazy cypherpunk beliefs that Bitcoin will only prosper as long as it remains small enough to run a node on a dial-up internet on a Raspberri Pi in Luke-Jr's basement.

So the simplest explanation is this: **Blockstream is a ""front company"" which has been established for the purpose of performing a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin.**

So Satoshi messed up. He messed up by baking in a 1 MB constant into the code at the last minute as a clumsy anti-spam kludge - which could unfortunately only be *removed* via a hard fork - and which the global legacy power √©lite have figured how to *retain* via social engineering directed at clueless Core devs and clueless Chinese miners (and clueless forum moderators).

**So why is the price is still fairly stable?**

Heck, I'm so paranoid, I wouldn't even put it past them to try to *interfere with investors* who might otherwise be trying to send a signal by ""voting with their feet"". 

In other words, several observers have commented that the only way to liberate Bitcoin from the cartel of Chinese miners and Core/Blockstream devs is to *crash the price.*

And many other observers are puzzled that the price isn't crashing now that Bitcoin is being strangled in its cradle by Blockstream. 

Well, this wouldn't be the first time that the Fed / PetroDollar / BIS private central banking cartel sent in the ""plunge protection"" team to artificially prop up their fragile, centralized, permissioned currency.

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=plunge+protection+team

Who knows, they could easily have printed up a few million dollars in phoney fiat and given it to players like Jamie Dimon or Blythe Masters who probably have access to the HFT (high frequency trading) tools to keep the price exactly where they want it, for as long as they want it. Manipulating an unregulated $6 billion market would be child's play for them.

The point is, we have no idea who is buying bitcoins at this price right now. Or what their motives are.

I know that if I were part of the legacy fiat power √©lite, this is exactly what I'd be doing now: buy off the devs, pressure the miners, encourage the censors, and play with the price - so nobody knows what the hell is going on. Prevent the price from crashing for the next year (so the community won't have a ""smoking gun"" to reject the Core devs and the Chinese miners)... and prevent it from going to the moon also (so the dollar won't look like it's crashing). Not too hard to do, especially if you have unlimited fiat at your disposal. 

**2016 is the perfect time to perform a ""controlled demolition"" on Bitcoin.**

All the forces in the global economy are now aligned for a massive economic storm of epic proportions. Without Blockstream's interference, Bitcoin's price would be shooting to the moon right now, because it's the only digital asset class free of counterparty risk, compared to all the other garbage floating around in the system:

- Deutsche Bank is teetering on the edge of collapse: that alone would be 5x the size of the Lehman collapse. (Deutsche has about $75 trillion in nominal derivatives exposure - 1000x as big as its mere $58 billion in assets. It's probably already bankrupt, and is merely being held together with ~~chewing gum and paper clips~~ accounting tricks.)

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=deutsche+bank+lehman

- Most of the major stock markets around the world are down 10-20-30 % so far this year.

https://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/45ogx7/daily_discussion_sunday_february_14_2016/d0015vf

- China has started to devalue the Yuan, and will soon be facing trillions of dollars in capital flight - some of which would flow through Bitcoin.

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=china+capital+flight

- NIRP (Negative Interest Rate Policy) now rules over 25% of the world's GDP.

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=NIRP+Negative+Interest+Rate+Policy

- After multiple rounds of QE (quantitative easing), the central bankers have shot their wad, and have no tools left to stimulate the economy.

- The 8-year US president reign will end this fall - which is when all the financial dirt that was swept under the rug always comes out. (Recall that Timothy Geithner went to Congress begging for the first $1 trillion of the bailouts *after* the 2008 election, in early November.)

- And the Bitcoin halvening is coming up.

Bitcoin is one of the *only* safe harbors in this oncoming economic storm. So it should be skyrocketing right now - if there were no artificial constraints on its growth.

So if Blockstream were *not* doing a controlled demolition of Bitcoin right now by freezing the blocksize to 1 MB for the next year, then the Bitcoin price could easily go to 4,000 USD - instead languishing around 400 USD.

In other words: the USDollar would be *crashing* 10-fold versus Bitcoin.

The only bulwark against Bitcoin rising 10x versus the USDollar is Blockstream's stranglehold on the Core devs and the Chinese miners. 

Just like the only bulwark against precious metals rising 10x versus the USDollar right now is JPMorgan's naked short selling of phoney (paper) precious metals, mainly via the SLV ETF (exchange traded fund). 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=jpmorgan+naked+short+selling+slv

(Most informed estimates say that there is 100x more ""fake"" or ""paper"" gold and silver in existence, versus ""physical"" gold and silver. So it's easy for JPMorgan to suppress the silver price: just naked-short-sell ""paper"" silver. They do this as a service to the Fed, to prop up the dollar. And your tax dollars pay for this fraud.)

**The silence of the devs**

Isn't it strange how not a single Blockstream dev dares to ""break ranks"" on the 2 MB taboo?

This unanimous code of silence among Blockstream devs speaks volumes.

Devs on open-source projects like this (particularly ones which were founded on principles of ""permissionless"" ""decentralization"") would *never* maintain this kind of uniform code of developer silence - especially when their precious open-source project is on the verge of failing. 

Most devs are rebels - especially Bitcoin devs - ready to break ranks at the drop of a hat, and propose their brilliant ideas to save the day.

But right now - utter silence.

This bizarre code of silence which we are now seeing from the ""Core"" devs must be the result of some major behind-the-scenes arm-twisting by the owners of Blocsktream, who must have made it abundantly clear that *any* dev who attempts to provide a simple on-chain scaling solution will be severely punished - financially, legally and/or socially.

Blockstream has deliberately set Bitcoin on a suicide course right now - and all the devs there are silently complicit - and so are the Chinese miners who submissively bowed down to Blockstream's ~~stalling~~ ""scaling"" roadmap.

**But I don't really blame the devs and the miners. I feel bad for them.**

I'm not really ""blaming"" any Chinese miners for being used like this - nor am I really ""blaming"" devs such as Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, etc.

Nor do I really ""blame"" guys like Austin Hill.

And I even think guys like Theymos and Luke-Jr ""mean well"".

They're all just being played. They think they're doing the right thing. Their arguments are genuine and heart-felt. Wrong, but heart-felt. This is what makes them so dangerous - because they really sound sincere and convincing. This is why they are the perfect pawns for the owners of Blockstream to play like this.

**Subtle coercion**

We recently found out that they *locked the Chinese miners in a room for 13 hours until 3 AM* to force them to sign an ""agreement"" to never use any code from a competing Bitcoin implementation that would increase the blocksize.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/46tv22/only_emperors_kings_and_dictators_demand_fealty/

Have you *ever* seen this kind of coercion in an open-source project - an open-source project founded on the principles of ""permissionless"" ""decentralization"" - where many of the founders were ""cypherpunks""??

The miners and the devs - and Theymos - and guys like Austin Hill - all are passionate about Bitcoin, and they all believe they are doing ""the right thing"".

But they are being manipulated, without their knowledge, by the real power behind Blockstream.

**Prisoners in a golden cage**

Strange how we never get to hear what *really* goes on behind closed doors at Blockstream. We never get to see the PowerPoint decks, we never get to find out who said what. Blockstream's public messaging is tightly controlled.

If Bitcoin were to have a ""core"" dev team, it should have had something like the Mozilla Group, or the Tor Project - non-profits, who answer to the public, not to private investors. Instead we got Blockstream - a private company funded by some of the biggest players of the legacy fiat power √©lite. WTF?!?

If they wanted to develop sidechains and LN, then fine, they should be able to. But what they're really doing is radically changing Bitcoin itself - mainly by freezing growth at 1 MB blocks now, which is choking the system.

Depite all this, I still would not go so far as to say that the Core devs and the Chinese miners are really ""traitors"". At most, they are actually prisoners in a golden cage, who are not even really conscious of their own imprisonment. They're smart people - and in some ways, smart people are actually easier to fool, once you figure out what they believe in.

So this is what I really think the owners of Blockstream have done. They've figured out how to manipulate the Core devs and the Chinese miners - and they're happy that Theymos is playing along, censoring the main online forums - so they're able to move ahead with their plan to do a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin, and it only cost them $75 million dollars.

**Centralization got us into this mess.**

The only reason Bitcoin is vulnerable to this kind of ""controlled demolition"" being performed by the owners of Blockstream is because mining operations and dev teams are *centralized* - thus providing a single, vulnerable point where the legacy fiat power √©lite could easily deploy their full-spectrum attack.

We finally have a digital asset with no counterparty risk - and they want to take it away from us, so that we continue to depend on their debt-backed, violence-backed legacy fiat.

And they're able to do this because the Core devs and the Chinese miners and Theymos were such easy gullible centralized targets.

**Decentralization will get us out.**

If you are a miner or a dev, and if you want Bitcoin to survive, then you must go back to the principles of *permissionless decentralization.*

Go dark, release some code anonymously.

Release an internal Blockstream PowerPoint deck or some internal Blockstream emails to Wikileaks, exposing what the Blockstream investors are *really* up to.

Otherwise, Bitcoin is probably going to fail to realize its potential - and we'll have to wait a while for truly decentralized development (and mining, and forums) to possibly create a successor someday.

If you're a hodler, it would be great if such a phoenix rising from Bitcoin would be a ""spinoff"" - ie, a coin bootstrapped off of the existing ledger (to preserve existing wealth, while upgrading to a new protocol for appending new blocks).

personalfinance,College student using cheaper debt to pay off credit card debt,"First and foremost, thank you if you are posting to contribute thoughts. Also a disclaimer, I am not struggling to make payments. I am looking to save more money in the long run.

I was issued a credit card during boot camp in the USMC, which at 18 years old I knew nothing about. The card had a $2,000 limit and I maxed it out 4 years ago. The interest rate is 18% (know I know). After paying it/repaying it for a couple of years I recently decided I need to pay this card off. I currently owe around $1790 on it and do not use it anymore. 
    All my gear was stolen when I was still active duty and I did not have the funds to pay for it. I took out a loan for $5,000 dollars at a 17.75 interest rate. I currently owe $4,050 on this loan. 
    Other than this, my only other debt is a jeep I financed for $20,000 at a 4% interest rate. I am not worried about this as I can afford it. I have no college debt as I use the GI Bill which gives me a monthly check of around $1,400. I have a part time job which I make around another $800-1200 a month.

gaming,"(SPOILERS) Just finished Lords of Shadow 2. Mercury Steam, you dun goofed","So I've been working through my backlog of games over the past year. Having finally finished all of my physical PS3 games, it was time to move onto my last two 360 titles: Binary Domain and Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2. Since this post is basically about how abhorrently garbage LoS 2 is, I'll quickly say that Binary Domain is a very underrated title.

Case in point, I felt compelled to comment on LoS 2, and I'm curious if any of you guys have played it, because I personally believe it undermined the potential of what was a stunning first game. Now I know love for LoS 1 is somewhat hard to come by, especially where original Castlevania fans are concerned, but I will stand firm and defend it till the end of time as a beautifully constructed game. A phenomenal soundtrack, satisfying (if somewhat monotonous) combat, superb voice acting, topped off with an incredibly emotional story. I was so moved by Gabriel Belmont's story that whatever sequel would eventually emerge, it had a fantastic foundation for one of the best stories of the last generation. Controversial opinion for a lot of people I'd imagine, but alas.

Heading into LoS 2, I was in a conflicted position because I had been aware of its mixed reception for a while, but I guess love for the first compelled me on. For me the absolute major crime this sequel commits is an absolute butchering of narrative and story. I'm not sure if the original writers left Mercury Steam or Kojima had a much bigger effect than I initially realised in the development of LoS 1, but how the sequel's writers failed SO badly blows my mind to high heaven...literally. 

 Immediately after finishing the game I just had to speak my mind about the abhorrent ending first and foremost because wow....just wow. When future generations look back on our society and desire the answer to the worst ending to a game of all time, which they inevitably will, Lords of Shadow 2 will be there greeting them in the dirt. The insane laziness of this conclusion left me gobsmacked; seriously, I was sat staring at the screen in a complete state of WTFery for several minutes as the credits rolled.

**Spoilers ahead for those who haven't played LoS 2**. The game ends with Gabriel/ Dracula killing Satan in a pretty dull final fight as the sun begins to rise over the city. Alucard/ Trevor asks his father what happens now. Looking into the Mirror of Fate (which gets next to no explanation unless you played the 3DS game), Dracula destroys it in his hand and says ""who knows what fate will bring"" or something along those lines; the player never sees what is in the mirror. The camera proceeds to pan out as Dracula heads inside the church and the game ends....WHAT?!

Ok, this is some next level shit. No Marie, no redemption, nothing with Alucard. This entire scene served to single handedly destroy the beautiful story of Gabriel and his fall to darkness started in LoS 1. Is this how MS wanted to end the LoS saga? It undoubtedly was rushed out the door, and given the quality of the rest of the game, that was a disastrous move.

I'm genuinely curious as to what you guys think if you have played and finished LoS 2. This is hands down the worst sequel to a game I have personally played in terms of overall screwing up a legacy and truckload of potential.",technology,1457062027

He's offering me to buy the house from him at what he owes left on it, which is 65000, or 75000 with the land next to it (Which is understandable, it's enough land to build about two houses on in the suburbs where nobody has that big of a yard by the road).

I've recently been promoted at work, but I still don't make much. After taxes and insurance and the such, I bring in about 700 every two weeks. I wasn't originally going to consider buying the place alone (I figured I could pull it, but not without just barely scraping by), but one of the old roommates has recently fixed his situation (it was a family issue that he couldn't really do anything about), and is looking for a place again. I figured I could buy the house, and have him pay around 35-50% of things with me in rent/utilities/etc.

Now here's where the problem really arises. I have little to no savings, because I was trying to afford renting the house by myself for a little while while only making around 1000 a month. I still owe some rent to the landlord (family member), which I'm now slowly paying off. He knows my finances and trusts that I've always paid him what I could when I could, so that hasn't been an issue.

So I have no savings, and since I'm 21 and haven't gotten a credit card or a non-federal loan, I have no credit either. I know I could get my parents (who have amazing credit) to cosign for me because they trust me not to screw them over (I've always been quite honest with them), but I still don't know if that would be enough to get a decent loan without an insane interest rate.

On top of all this, I have ZERO idea what I'm doing with a mortgage, how to even start the process, or really what it even means.

So all in all, I'm asking for some advice and guidance as to whether I should purchase the house (I'd probably be moving into an apartment in a few months and paying ~500 a month anyways otherwise), and if I should, what the best thing I could do to get a reasonable loan would be.

TL;DR:No savings, no credit (But good cosigners), little understanding of what a mortgage even is, great offer to buy a house and adjoining property that is an offer specifically only to me. Seeking advice.",finance,1457062599

I have been dating a girl for a little over two years now. We are both in grad school, studying architecture, and will be graduating next May (2017). Here's the short of it:

I will graduate with absolutely zero student debt, thanks to scholarships and my parents saving / paying for my education. I have a pretty decent Roth IRA going with full contributions the last three years. I'm generally good with my money and try to live frugally. 

I'm highly motivated in my field, and while architects aren't compensated like STEM professionals, those with a strong work ethic and the ability to manage people/projects can rise fast inside a firm - that's definitely me. 

My girlfriend definitely does not have that ""killer"" instinct (friend's description, not my own) that would lead to a well compensated position. She's pretty okay with just going with the flow of life and seeing where it takes her. It's both incredibly attractive and equally terrifying.

She will graduate with over $90,000 of student debt. They are all private loans with Sallie Mae, some with interest rates as high as 12%. 

And I have absolutely no idea how to handle that. 

So this is really a cry for advice and help, both financially and personally. How would you handle this situation? Has anyone else on here married into this kind of debt? Is it even possible to pay it off jointly in time for us to start saving before maybe having kids / contributing to retirement in time? Just to add more potential variables to the discussion, as a couple, we would make around 80-90k a year for the first five years before taxes. 

I'm here to listen and desperate for any advice you can give me. 

Thank you in advance!

worldpolitics,U.S. Out of the Near East! Syria: Imperialists Fuel Bloodbath (Workers Vanguard),"Workers Vanguard No. 1084 26 February 2016

For four years, the U.S. imperialists and a host of lesser powers have been stirring the Syrian cauldron, inflicting untold bloodshed on the Syrian people. The result of this all-sided intervention and carnage: Much of Syria has been laid waste, its economy is in ruins, and more than half its population has been driven from their homes, either as displaced persons within the country or as refugees abroad.

The Western bourgeois press explains those refugees as caused solely by the undeniable crimes of the Bashar al-Assad regime and its barrel bombs dropped on civilian populations. What about U.S. bombing? Kobani was ‚Äúliberated‚Äù from the control of the reactionary fundamentalist Islamic State (ISIS) by being leveled. Likewise, in Iraq, Ramadi was retaken from ISIS by an Iraqi army that heretofore had proven itself to be a hollow shell. The secret of that remarkable success? The city was first reduced to rubble by U.S. airstrikes.

The rebel forces in Syria have received arms and financing from countries intent on pursuing their own agendas at the expense of the Syrian people. The Sunni Arab regimes of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are determined to deliver a blow to the Assad regime, which is based on the Alawites, followers of an offshoot of Shi‚Äôite Islam. Shi‚Äôite Iran, the great bugbear of these Gulf states, is Assad‚Äôs principal backer, and in recent months Russia has provided air support to the Syrian army. Turkey wants to see Assad replaced by a compliant Sunni fundamentalist regime that would serve as a platform for projecting Turkish power and influence in the Near East. Since the start of the war, Turkey has opened its borders to the flow of jihadists into Syria and provided funds and military hardware to support them.

Meanwhile, the U.S. imperialists, backed up on occasion by their junior imperialist partners Britain and France, are mainly directing their bombs against ISIS, while providing support to ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù rebel forces. Most recently, the U.S. carried out airstrikes in Libya on February 19 to target an ISIS camp, killing over 40 people, including two Serbian hostages held by ISIS. Libya itself has been fractured by fighting between warring factions since the U.S.-backed overthrow and murder of Libya‚Äôs former bourgeois strongman, Muammar el-Qaddafi, in 2011.

As Marxists, our starting point is that the main enemy, not only of the Syrian people but of the working masses of the world, is U.S. imperialism, as well as the other imperialist powers involved. The bloody mayhem that has been visited upon the Syrian people is the direct consequence of imperialist domination of the Near East. We have no side in the Syrian civil war, which is reactionary on all sides. But we do have a side against U.S. imperialism.

Any defeat or setback inflicted upon the imperialists in the Near East is in the interests of working people internationally, not least in the U.S., where workers have been ground down by years of economic crisis and a ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù from which they have not benefited. Thus, while we are die-hard opponents of everything the reactionary cutthroats of ISIS stand for, we are for the military defense of ISIS when it aims its fire against the imperialist armed forces and their proxies in the region. These include the Syrian Kurdish nationalists as well as the Baghdad government, the Shi‚Äôite militias in Iraq and the Kurdish pesh merga in northern Iraq, who have all acted as the ground troops of the U.S. military intervention in the area.

Any blow that helps to impede the imperialists‚Äô designs in the Near East can only aid the proletariat and oppressed of the region. The peoples of the Near East will not know peace, prosperity or justice until bourgeois rule is overthrown through a series of socialist revolutions. Only in a socialist federation of the Near East will there be a full and equal place for all the myriad peoples of the area‚ÄîSunnis, Shi‚Äôites and Christians as well as the Kurdish, Palestinian Arab and Israeli Jewish nations.

Syrian Hellhole

The focus of recent fighting in Syria is a crucial strip of land linking Aleppo, once the country‚Äôs largest city and industrial hub, to the border with Turkey. Here various forces backed by regional and international rivals are clashing in what could well be a turning point in the war.

From the south, the Syrian army has pushed to within 15 miles of the Turkish border, threatening to seal off what for years has been the main conduit of aid to rebel forces battling Assad. After suffering serious setbacks, the regime‚Äôs military has been greatly strengthened by almost five months of escalating intervention by Russian warplanes, which have been bombing rebel positions and residential neighborhoods.

From the east, U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters in northern Syria, also benefiting from Russian airstrikes, have rapidly seized territory lining the Turkish border‚Äîsometimes battling other forces supported by the U.S. Kurdish advances have infuriated Turkey‚Äôs rulers, who throughout the Syrian war have sought to prevent the consolidation of a semi-autonomous Kurdish zone in northern Syria. This is all the more vital to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan now that he is engaged in a brutal offensive against the nationalist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) based in Turkey. Since February 13, Turkey has been shelling positions in Syria held by the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) and its military wing, the People‚Äôs Protection Committees (YPG), which are affiliated to the PKK.

The YPG declared its intention to seize the entire 68-mile-long stretch of border from the Euphrates River to the town of Azaz, essentially uniting the western and eastern border regions that it controls. Turkey‚Äôs prime minister threatened ‚Äúa severe response‚Äù if that happened. He warned: ‚ÄúWe will not let Azaz fall.‚Äù

Washington‚Äôs alliance with the YPG has heightened tensions between the U.S. and Turkey. Addressing his U.S. ally, Erdogan asked: ‚ÄúAre you on our side or the side of the terrorist PYD and PKK organizations?‚Äù From Washington‚Äôs point of view, the answer is both: On the one hand, Turkey is a key U.S./NATO ally, and Washington joins Ankara in labeling the PKK ‚Äúterrorist.‚Äù On the other hand, the Syrian PYD/YPG fighters have served as the ground troops for the U.S. imperialist intervention, coordinating battlefield operations with U.S. military planners, operating with U.S. special ops forces and serving as spotters for U.S. bombing runs.

The close cooperation between the Kurdish nationalists and their supposed U.S. benefactors will not stop the latter from turning on them. Last July, in exchange for use of the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to launch operations against ISIS, the U.S. gave the Ankara regime the green light to launch airstrikes in northern Iraq against the PKK. As we have warned, by selling their souls to the U.S. imperialists, the Kurdish nationalists have committed a crime for which the long-dispossessed Kurdish masses will pay the price.

The struggle for Kurdish self-determination‚Äîthat is, to form a Kurdish state‚Äîis a just one, requiring the defeat of four capitalist states: Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran. We have long raised the call for a Socialist Republic of United Kurdistan. However, in Syria and Iraq the Kurdish nationalists have subordinated the fight for Kurdish self-determination to their alliance with U.S. imperialism. Any fight for Kurdish independence must take as its starting point opposition to U.S. imperialist intervention and to the nationalist parties that serve it.

In recent weeks, Ankara has called on the U.S. and its coalition partners to launch a ground invasion in northern Syria. So far, the U.S. has sidestepped the issue of a possible ground invasion of Syria‚Äîthe Obama administration has limited itself to sending special ops forces. Turkey has also reiterated its longstanding call for imposing a no-fly zone in northern Syria. This is a not-so-veiled threat against Russia, which has provided the crucial air support for the rapid advances by the Syrian army and the YPG. In November, Turkish forces shot down a Russian jet as it was carrying out raids in Syria‚Äôs northern Latakia province, an area where rebel Turkmen militias have operated with artillery support from the Turkish military across the border. In response, Russian president Vladimir Putin denounced the Erdogan regime as ‚Äúaccomplices of terrorists.‚Äù

Our main opposition is to the imperialists, but we also oppose the other capitalist powers involved in Syria and call on them to leave. That includes not only Turkey and Saudi Arabia but also the Russian and Iranian forces, which were invited in by the Syrian government.

Imperialist Depredations and Aspiring Commanders-in-Chief

U.S. policy in Syria is as incoherent and bumbling as it is ruinous to the masses of the Near East. Behind this incoherence is the fact that Saudi Arabia and Turkey are among the U.S.‚Äôs key allies in the region. At the same time, Washington‚Äôs main target is ISIS, which is tacitly backed by Riyadh and Ankara.

When the U.S., Turkey and the Gulf states began heavily supporting the Syrian rebels four years ago, Washington filled the airwaves with horror stories about the brutality of the Assad regime. In fact, in earlier years of the ‚Äúwar on terror,‚Äù the U.S. shipped suspects to Damascus for ‚Äúinterrogation‚Äù‚Äîi.e., torture. When the civil war escalated, the U.S. expected Assad‚Äôs military would collapse. After all, the Alawites, who constitute the regime‚Äôs main base of support and account for most of the officer corps, make up a mere 12 percent of the country‚Äôs population. Yet the Syrian regime, defying the imperialists‚Äô expectations, showed remarkable staying power. Meanwhile, the U.S. rulers, blinded by their great-power arrogance, could not fathom why rebel groups owned and operated by the CIA did not strike a chord among the Syrian people.

It soon dawned on important figures in U.S. ruling circles that Barack Obama‚Äôs goal of ‚Äúregime change‚Äù necessarily meant replacing Assad with Islamic fundamentalists. As reported by Seymour Hersh in the London Review of Books (January 7), the Pentagon, starting in the autumn of 2013, went so far as to secretly funnel military intelligence and tactical advice to the Assad regime to be used against the very rebels that the White House was backing. Today, rebel forces are reportedly worried that the Obama administration is preparing to abandon them as it seeks to negotiate, centrally with Russia, a ‚Äúpolitical transition‚Äù that would keep Assad in power, at least for a period of time.

However, even that ‚Äúpeace plan‚Äù is in trouble. An administration official recently opined that there may in fact be a military solution in Syria‚Äî‚Äújust not our solution‚Äù but that of Putin‚Äôs Russia. Perhaps. Putin might also use his strengthened position in Syria to bargain for concessions on sanctions against Russia or on the growing NATO presence in the Baltics and elsewhere in East Europe. While the U.S. is eager to curb Russia‚Äôs influence in the Near East, it also feels compelled to cut some kind of deal with Putin on Syria.

What explains the Assad regime‚Äôs unexpected resilience? While most of the Syrian military, including a significant number of its generals, are‚Äîlike the rebel forces‚ÄîSunni Muslim, defections by individuals were not accompanied by the predicted breaking away of chunks of the army. More generally, the inescapable fact is that for many in Syria the Islamic jihadists are scarcely viewed as an improvement over the Assad dictatorship.

In ISIS-controlled territory, as has been widely reported, those who are not Sunni are beheaded if they refuse to convert; untold numbers of women have been kidnapped and sold into forced marriages. Less widely reported by the servile media is the fact that sharia law has also been imposed by sections of the Free Syrian Army, the so-called ‚Äúmoderates‚Äù touted by Washington. Rebel groups have repeatedly perpetrated massacres in Alawite, Christian and other minority villages. Likewise, Sunni Arab and Turkmen villagers have been driven out by YPG forces.

Both candidates for the Democratic Party presidential nomination have positioned themselves to carry on U.S. imperialism‚Äôs devastating policy in Syria. As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton was consistently on the more hawkish side within the Obama administration. She was a chief proponent of the air war against Libya and pushed hard for retaining a stronger military force in Iraq and for supplying arms to Syrian rebels. Robert Gates, who was defense secretary under both George W. Bush and Obama, recalled in Duty: Memoir of a Secretary at War (2014) how he and Clinton teamed up in 2009 to force the decision to escalate the war in Afghanistan and, the following year, to delay the drawdown of forces.

Clinton calls for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria, a position shared by Republican presidential hopefuls Marco Rubio and John Kasich. The Obama administration has not ruled out the idea, but a number of Congressional Democrats have voiced (understandable) fears that such a move would risk military conflict with Russia. Clinton countered that the U.S. needs to stand up to Russian ‚Äúbullying.‚Äù

Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, while calling the no-fly zone idea ‚Äúvery dangerous,‚Äù has also been a loyal supporter of the administration‚Äôs bellicose policy in Syria and elsewhere (see ‚ÄúBernie Sanders: Imperialist Running Dog,‚Äù WV No. 1083, 12 February). Both he and Clinton agree on ‚Äúregime change‚Äù in Syria‚Äîthe overthrow of Assad. Sanders simply proposes a different policy to advance U.S. imperialism‚Äôs interests in the region, calling for ‚Äúputting together a coalition of Arab countries who should be leading the effort‚Äù to defeat ISIS. This effectively means calling on Arab countries to provide the ground troops in Syria to support Washington‚Äôs objectives.

In fact, the country that would be ‚Äúleading‚Äù Sanders‚Äôs ‚Äúcoalition‚Äù is Washington‚Äôs main Arab partner, Saudi Arabia, which claims adherence to the extreme, Wahabi variant of Sunni fundamentalism from which ISIS derives its theology. In Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed to drive. Without the consent of a male guardian, they cannot go to university or (if under the age of 45) travel abroad, and they risk being stoned to death for adultery. As for beheadings, the Saudi kingdom does not take a backseat to ISIS. In recent years, hundreds of people have been beheaded in Saudi Arabia for offenses including blasphemy, apostasy, homosexuality and sorcery. In a country where public observance of any religion besides Islam is forbidden, foreign workers, with their own religious practices, are especially vulnerable to being convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to 1,000 lashes, long prison terms or beheading. (A special police agency, the Anti-Witchcraft Unit, is tasked with investigating alleged witches, neutralizing their paraphernalia and nullifying their spells.) The bodies of those beheaded are often crucified and publicly displayed for several days, their heads either sewn back onto their bodies or suspended above corpses in plastic bags.

Defeat U.S. Imperialism Through Socialist Revolution!

Next month will mark the 13th anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which resulted in a pro-Iran regime in Baghdad and unleashed Sunni and Shi‚Äôite fundamentalist militias that have carried out pogroms against each other‚Äôs peoples. This set the stage for the current bloody unraveling of the region, in particular by sharply intensifying the conflict between the Sunni Gulf states and Shi‚Äôite Iran. At home, the handmaiden to that war, the occupation of Afghanistan and the U.S.‚Äôs other military adventures has been the American rulers‚Äô onslaught against working people, minorities and most everyone else.

The U.S. working class must be won to the understanding that its enemy is its ‚Äúown‚Äù ruling class and that it needs to oppose imperialist aggression abroad. Many working people are understandably repelled by the medieval brutality of groups like ISIS. But the gruesome crimes of ISIS pale in comparison to those of U.S. imperialism, responsible for the slaughter of tens of millions around the world. It is in the interest of American workers that U.S. imperialism suffer setbacks and defeats in its military aggressions and designs.

It is not ISIS, Al Qaeda or some other Islamist force that has taken income inequality here to virtually unprecedented heights. The same ruling class that wreaks death and destruction abroad gorges itself on profits while the workers it exploits have their jobs slashed and their health and pension benefits torn up. This same ruling class unleashes its cops to kill black youth on America‚Äôs streets, holds nearly one-quarter of the world‚Äôs prison population in its dungeons, lets this country‚Äôs infrastructure rot and outright poisons cities like Flint.

What is desperately needed is class struggle against the capitalist rulers, which would both defend the interests of workers at home and hinder the ambitions of U.S. imperialism abroad. On at least a superficial level, many working people in the U.S. perceive that the hardships they endure here are somehow related to the exploitation and oppression carried out by their rulers abroad. Our aim is to win the most conscious layers of the working class to the understanding that what is necessary is the overturn of the U.S. capitalist order through socialist revolution, which is the only way out of this system predicated on exploitation, racist oppression and imperialist war.

We fight to build a workers party, the necessary instrument to lead the multiracial proletariat in the struggle for power. Such a party‚Äîsection of a reforged Fourth International‚Äîmust be built in opposition to all capitalist parties and through political struggle against the misleaders of the trade unions, who chain the proletariat to its capitalist class enemy, not least by promoting the lie that the working class and the capitalist rulers share common interests. Only victorious workers revolutions on an international scale can end imperialist slaughter and ethnic bloodletting, opening the road to eliminating material scarcity and building an egalitarian socialist society.

Every dev, in their more rational, honest moments, has said that 2 MB blocks would be safe for the network now - even 3-4 MB blocks:

- Adam Back already proposed 2-4-8. 

- Gregory Maxwell has stated that bigger blocks would be fine. 

- JToomim has done the research - on both sides of the Great Firewall of China.

- Many devs such as Gavin have stated that no ""hard"" blocksize limit is needed at all, since miners set their own ""soft"" blocksize limits anyways.

Everybody knows that the infrastructure / bandwidth would already support 2 MB blocks, or even 3-4 MB blocks, *right now*.

So why isn't Blockstream pushing for bigger blocks now, just to buy some time, to avoid unnecessary risks to their investment?

Why are we all sitting here watching the network slowly clog up, reading horror stories from users whose transactions don't get sent (or worse: don't get *received*), letting these horror stories slip into the media, hurting Bitcoin's image, decreasing adoption, decreasing price, helping the competition?

Everyone who is watching Bitcoin (on these forums, in the media) is starting to talk about Bitcoin ""failing"", becoming ""clogged up"", ""backlogged"", ""unreliable"", with ""transaction delays"", ""high fees"", ""unpredictable wait times"". 

This is killing Bitcoin's image among users, in the media - and opening up the door for the competition to try to eat Bitcoin's lunch. 

How many multi-million-dollar investors do *you* know who would put up with this kind of three-ring circus for the next 16 fucking months?? (Blockstream has only promised a hard-fork to 2 MB in July 2017. But the unreliable network and the bad press are already happening *now*.)

Are we supposed to believe that these multi-million-dollar investors are putting up with all this needless risk simply because some dork like Luke-Jr told them they have to?

This is not how rational investors behave. Rational investors do not take unnecessary risks. They do not listen to dorks. They listen to *facts*, and they do what's practical to protect and grow their investment.

And then people say that *I'm* crazy? *I'm* not the one who is throwing away $75 million dollars here just to keep Luke-Jr happy.

---

This is why we must ask ourselves whether Blockstream's stated goals for Bitcoin (they say they want to make money via sidechains, ie Lightning Network) *might be a lie for public consumption.*

This is the *simplest* theory which fits the facts that we already know:

- Nearly all of the existing legacy fiat power √©lite *hate* Bitcoin and would do *anything* to stop it. 

- [Major wars have already been fought for the same reason, ie stopping any country from setting up a currency which is not subject to the BIS - Bank for International Settlements](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/3yits0/tinfoil_what_do_these_seven_countries_have_in/) - and as usual, the perpetrators covered up the real reasons with lies for public consumption.

- If they were to openly *attack* Bitcoin, this would only cause a Streisand effect, increase support / sympathy for Bitcoin, and they would fail in their attempt to kill Bitcoin. If they *really* want to kill it, they're going to have to get serious and be sneaky. They *cannot* afford to let Bitcoin have *any* chance of surviving.

- Microsoft was notorious for buying out small competitors, and dismantling them. This is a standard corporate tactic used by companies that have a big war-chest of cash. 

- In the case of governments / banks / companies that hate Bitcoin, we can assume that the cash in the war-chest is virtually unlimited (since they have a very special printing press where the control the mining algorithm anyways). This is why people who ask ""but why would they waste $75 million??"" are *clueless* about how the world of legacy fiat really works.

So let's assume they are being *secretive* - which would be typical for them. Let's assume they are *pretending* to want to ""help"" Bitcoin - but their real goal is to *destroy* it.

I know, I know, everyone thinks they can instantly yell ""Alex Jones"" or ""Illuminati"" or ""tinfoil"" and therefore they have instantly debunked my theory.

But look around you. How many times have major governments and banks *lied to your face?*

And what is crazier:

- My theories that the world is controlled by central bankers who print money and start wars based on lies?

or

- The theory which most people on /r/Bitcoin blindly accept: that Blockstream's investors are willing to invest $75 million in Bitcoin and then let some nutjob like Luke-Jr keep the blocksize at 1 MB for the next year, making Bitcoin so unreliable that it's already dead-on-arrival when LN finally rolls out - so they lose their $75 million investment?

I ask you once again: 

- How many investors do you know who take unnecessary risks like that?

- And how many times have governments and the legacy fiat power √©lite lied to the public?

Wake up people. Don't judge Blockstream by their words. Judge them by their actions. They are *not* trying to help Bitcoin.

I'm not the crazy person here. The crazy people here are the ones who believe that investors would flush $75 million dollars down the toilet for no reason.

---

And if there's anyone in charge of Public Relations at Blockstream: What the fuck did you *think* would happen if you stupidly refused to raise the blocksize to 2 MB to buy yourselves some time and protect your investors' $75 million? 

These ""conspiracy theories"" are *all your fault* - because you could have stopped them in one minute if you'd just act rational and up the blocksize now, like any ""normal"" investor would have done. 

It's called compromise. 

It's called practicality. 

This is how *normal* investors always work. 

They deal with reality and they don't let immature dorks like Luke-Jr jeopordize millions of dollars.

The only investors who are *not* acting normal like this are the weirdos who invested in Blockstream, who are sitting idly by (and plan to to continue to sit idly by until July 2017), watching their investment get flushed down the toilet. 

All to make little Luke-Jr happy, right?

So Blockstream brought this ""conspiracy theorizing"" on *themselves*.

So, sorry, Blockstream, you brought the crazy on yourselves. 

If you had acted like *rational* investors, and upped the blocksize to 2 MB *now*, to buy another year of time and good press and happy users while Adam Back continues to work on LN - then we wouldn't be *having* this crazy discussion in the first place.

I'm just connecting the geopolitical dots and using Occam's razor here, looking for the simplest explanation which fits the facts that we know.

My previous posts on this subject can be seen below. I still stand by them, until someone provides a better explanation of why Blockstream's investors are irrationally and unnecessarily risking flushing $75 million down the toilet ""because Luke-Jr wants 1 MB"".

&gt; Blockstream is now controlled by the Bilderberg Group - seriously! AXA Strategic Ventures, co-lead investor for Blockstream's $55 million financing round, is the investment arm of French insurance giant AXA Group - whose CEO Henri de Castries has been *chairman* of the Bilderberg Group since 2012.

I owe the army a lot of money.
I know that my student debt (at 3.4% or 6.8%) is calculated on a simple interest basis where the given interest rate is the annual rate, and the daily rate is easily calculated.


My army debt shows the interest rate = 0.020%. How do I interpret this? According to [their website](http://www.dfas.mil/debtandclaims/militarydebts/educationdebt.html),

&gt; Any amount owed under the agreement is assessed interest based on the 90 day Treasury Bill auction rate on the day which reimbursement is determined.

Do I just assume that this is the monthly compounding rate? Or the annual effective (compounding, or simple)? I'd call them but they have pretty horrible customer service.

I have no idea where to start, and my experience with investing is literally just contributing to employer sponsored 401K and maxing out employer matches.

**Some quick info**:

* I have a 90K/year salary
* I just received a 10K signing bonus that amortizes over 2-years
* Liquid, cash on hand roughly $20,000
* $0 credit card debt
* substantial student loan debt (roughly $200k.. split pretty much evenly between federal and private)
* Federal student loans have been approved for IBR, so my payments on those are hovering around $200/month, but will change as AGI changes
* Private student loan debt minimum payment is $450/month
* Rent is $1100/month
* Car Insurance is $80/month
* I don't drive my car regularly as I walk to work, so I can't be sure on an accurate estimate of total cost/month in gas, etc but I'd put it around $50
* spend about $300/month on groceries
* give or take another $300 on entertainment.. trying to cut this back
*utilities about $100 including gas/electric/internet

I know the first move I need to make is budget a good chunk into paying down the student debt faster, looking into refinancing private (**not** federal) student loans which I am doing through So-Fi, but I am curious as to what I can do with some of the extra cash I have coming in every month?  

**Some of the suggestions I have received:**

* Look into Mutual funds, or ETFs, or a Roth in addition to my employer sponsored 401k.  Any comapnies, directions, or research that I can be pointed to in this area?

* Sit down with an accountant and figure out exactly how much I can contribute to my 401K to maximize my contributions while minimizing taxes

* Open an Ally bank account.

* Budget out an emergency fund of about 6 months

* Maybe sell my car? Don't really want to do this...

* Create an E-Trade or another investing account and play around with a few hundred/thousand

1. Contribute the full $1000/mo to one loan, pay that off, and then focus on the second loan.
2. Similar as plan 1, except throw a little extra every month towards the second loan to help with driving down the principle (i.e. $900/$100 split).

Using a throwaway account since I am including some personal info.
I've done some of my own research regarding this, but wanted to pick this community's collective intelligence for any factors I may have failed to consider.

I'm &lt;23, making ~200k a year before tax. Right now I'm maxing out my roth IRA and contributing the yearly max to 401k, about half traditional and half roth. I did this because I read about the concept of ""tax diversification,"" the idea that since I don't have enough information about whether my tax rates will be higher or lower in the future, I should hedge my bets. The more I think about this though, the less likely it seems that half/half is the optimal distribution. I live in NYC, so after federal, state, city, social security, medicare, I'm paying ~40 percent of my income in taxes. I am single, don't have any student loans, or a mortgage, so I don't get any tax deductions. Yes, my income will probably go up in the future, but I may end up having kids, get a mortgage, move out of the city, or see a republican president get elected which might make my taxes go down and make it a more optimal time to contribute Roth. I haven't really been in the real world long enough to have the tools to analyze this properly, but I'd like to spend some time thinking about it now to avoid regretting my decisions in the future.

car loan, about $7k upside down - $20875 at 1.49% for 5 years (4 years left)
CC1 - $13082 at 13.24% (0% until 4/1/16)
CC2 - $933 at 12.24%
CC3 - $5340 at 12.24%
CC4 - $6191 at 13.15%
CC5 - $5013 at 14.25%
CC6 - $7409 at 11.24% ($6461 is 0% until 1/1/17)
CC7 - $11865 at 12.75% (0% until 4/1/16)
CC8 - $2183 at 13.24%

credit card min monthly payments - $875

weighted CC debt - $52k at 12.81%

income - $4215/mo average after taxes

Monthly Expenses:
* rent - $1770
* utilities - ~$225
* CC9 - $95 (0% for 4 years, ~3 left)
* car payment - $400
* medical bills - $95
* Comcast - $120
* Verizon - $210
* Gym - $30
* car insurance - $693 (3 cars between us, wreck &amp; 2 tickets on her record, working on selling 1 car to cut insurance in half)
* renter‚Äôs insurance - $33

If I ignore all the 0% APR deals I have right now and ignore the car loan, my total CC debt is right at $52k at 12.81%. I‚Äôm looking into a personal loan to reduce the interest rate and hopefully the monthly payment. I considered selling the one car we have that‚Äôs financed, but at 1.49% and being $7k upside down, it doesn‚Äôt seem to make much sense (and the car is mechanically sound).

I have a 401k from a previous employer worth about $78k that I don‚Äôt plan to touch, and a Betterment investment account worth about $705.

My employment has been spotty the last 1.5 years, and to top it off, my gross income went from $85 in 2013 to $50k last year to $69k this year. I moved to be closer to family, became engaged, and she is working on starting her own business. I love her dearly, but her working a regular 40 hour/week job for someone that‚Äôs not something she‚Äôs passionate about drains her mentally and physically. I just want her (and us) to be happy, and I realize now that we have to start making big changes. Or else‚Ä¶

My thoughts are are reduce expenses, starting with our $1770/mo apartment. We‚Äôre moving out into something around $1k when our lease is up in 3 months. I‚Äôm trimming down the gym memberships, looking at how to reduce our cell phone bill (Verizon, I have unlimited data, she‚Äôs on a tiered data plan). Can‚Äôt cancel Comcast without paying a fee, but the price is good enough to where getting internet-only and something like Sling doesn‚Äôt make much sense.

As I mentioned, I‚Äôm in the process of selling one car so $339 of the $693 insurance bill will drop off. I‚Äôm also seriously considering keeping her car on its own policy and having a separate one for my car (the one financed, hers is owned outright). This would drop another $115/mo off the bill.

The big problem here is we don‚Äôt want to live in a crappy area, and anything below ~$800/mo seems to be highly suspect (Atlanta metro), with ~$1k being the cutoff for a decent area outside the beltway. I know what I‚Äôd do if I were single, but I have to keep her somewhat satisfied, too!

I‚Äôm likely going to cash out my Betterment account and any pending credit card rewards, and use that to pay down the smaller CC amounts owed. I‚Äôm going to set strict limits for eating out, personal items, groceries, gas, and stop using the CCs entirely. Selling the 3rd car should net about $15k to help towards debt (car should sell for about $20k, so ~$5k would go towards emergency fund), and no, we don‚Äôt have a real emergency fund, it‚Äôs only about a month‚Äôs expenses (~$2k). I‚Äôm also looking into any work I can do on the side to offset the debt. If I can knock the CC debt down to $30-35k, then a personal loan should be easy to pick up and apply to the remaining debt (after waiting 1-2 months for my score to go up)!

Does my plan seem sound? Any areas I‚Äôm overlooking?",finance,1457122317
personalfinance,Student Loan Question,"Hello, I'm currently finishing up my MBA with $40k in student loans @ 6%. I paid the rest out of pocket and also received tuition reimbursement from my job, and budgeted for $35k to $40k in federal loans before entering the program. I currently make $55k a year and on track for promotion. I do not have any undergrad debt. I looked at the student repayment calculator and I'm planning on doing the standard payment plan, as I can afford the $450 a month for ten years (worst case scenario), but plan on paying $10k a year which should help me pay it off in about 5 years. Interest for the standard is about $18k over 10 years. 

My question: Looking at the Navient complaints forum, there are multiple people saying they started out with $XX,XXX, but after paying for 10/20 years, they now owe $XXX,XXX. How does that happen? Is the repayment calculator inaccurate? Can you make the full payment each month (not min) and still have this problem? I'm not understanding how that works. 

Also, anyone have any tips for making extra payment that go to principal specially at Navient?",finance,1457122966

I know I should pay off the student loans first, but I am an entrepreneur so every so often I come across a deal or opportunity I need money available for.
Ex. I saw a website for sale for $9500 I was able to flip it for $25,000 in 3 months

I have done this several times when it comes to cars, websites, side contracting gigs, etc.

Is there a investment I can put the extra $8,700/mo in which we are saving that will get me a decent interest rate which I can pull out in less than 10-15 days if an opportunity comes across? 

If I make crazy payments on the loan and an opportunity comes across and I don't have enough $$$ to make a move I will lose more money than I am saving in interest vs the lost opportunities.

personalfinance,absurd documentation requirements for FHA loan,"I kind of suspect a depressing answer to this, but here goes. I'm planning to buy a house soon! My lease is up in ~3 months, I'm tired of renting, I have no reason to expect to want to leave the state anytime between now and when I retire, my finances are in order ... the only flaw in the plan is that I haven't yet accumulated enough savings for a large down payment by myself. This didn't seem like an insurmountable problem. I'm working with a mortgage lender agent who has generally been very helpful and reasonable, and whose company has offered me by far the best deal with respect to (fixed) interest rate, total loan amount, etc. My grandfather very kindly wrote me a check to help with down payment / closing costs, and signed the form saying it was a gift not a loan, and I provided the form and photocopies of the check and the receipt from my credit union when I deposited it into my savings account. 

But now, along with all the other documentation (my bank statements, tax returns, proof of current employment, etc), the lender is now demanding that I produce my *grandfather's* bank statement ""to prove that the funds left his account"". He insists that this is legally required as part of the terms of an FHA loan (I know, I know, PMI is the devil, but I will have a nervous breakdown or something if I keep having to share walls with other people; getting out of that is genuinely worth the extra monthly cost to me). Because somehow, proof that I got the check and deposited it, and proof that it is really a gift from someone related to me, is not *sufficient* to demonstrate that the funds exist. 

This seems *ridiculous*. Is this seriously legally required? Is there any reason I shouldn't tell him to go fuck himself and go find a different lender? I am not terribly interested in requiring any further input from my grandfather, who is wonderful and amazing and *busy* and does not deserve to be forced to deal with random paperwork. Is my only option for avoiding this to wait three months, so when I get asked for ""my last two months of bank statements"" they don't show the check deposit, and go to a different lender and claim the money is my own savings?

Life Situation: Single, Midwest, 29 y/o Fed of 7 years

FIRE Progress: I've been reading about FIRE for about 6 months, both here and on some of the more well-known blogs. So still in the incipient stages. The early possible (traditional) retirement for us G-men is 57 (non-law enforcement). That puts me at about 2034 as a retirement date, as of right now... I guess. 

Gross Salary/Wages: $85k, netting about $43k

Yearly Savings Amounts: $18k TSP (as of this year, previously was putting in anywhere from 8-12% of my salary, not counting the 5% match), $5.5k IRA (starting my 3rd year), about $8-10k after tax savings, depending on if I'm doing any projects around the house.

Other Ordinary Income: None. Dividends I guess are around $1500 a year. Almost enough for property taxes, I suppose (~$2300).

Rental Income, Actual Expenses, and Depreciation: None.

Current expenses: Mortgage is about $550, which is something like $300 P&amp;I, $50 insurance, and $200 in taxes. Got about $54k left on the mortgage. My other expenses total about $1000 a month (food $300 or so, gym $10, cell $68, cable $130, natural gas/electric/water $150, petrol for the whip is just about $30 month since I carpool). I don't really see myself cutting any expenses for purposes of retiring a little earlier, but that's just me (and, I will acknowledge that this could change with starting a family, which I would like to do).

Assets: Hovering around $80k in the TSP, around $13k in the Roth IRA, around $42k in the taxable. I think my house is worth around $100k at the low end.

Liabilities: Owe $54k on the house, took out a $61k, 30-year loan on a $77k purchases price, paying around $550 plus utilities.

personalfinance,Financial security vs Education (23yo),"Heads up. New redditor. I am somewhat new to the financial world and am trying to become more responsible as I got fed up of living from pay cheque to pay cheque. 

I'm currently in a dilemma which has some back story to it. It is quite long and I won't be offended if it deters you, I will be grateful for any advice, if at all any. From 18-21, I worked for an organisation for minimum wage, went out most nights, smoked, ate out more or less everyday and would hit the back end of the month scraping coins together. 

Eventually I got fed up of working and decided to venture to university with not much direction of what I wanted to do and where I wanted to be afterwards, which as you can guess, ended up biting me on the ass. Long story short, I ignored my gut instinct and made myself stick university out for a year until it completely sunk in that I was on the wrong path.

This adventure left me ¬£1500 overdrawn and owing ¬£15000 of student loads (¬£3000 of which needs to be repaid asap as it was overpaid). My ""wing it"" attitude then led me to think it was a great idea to go to Ibiza with some friends. 

Ibiza was around August last year, and I was back at the job I was at before I started university (which I loathed). At some point, common sense and realisation kicked in and I have now since changed jobs (still around minimum wage but much better for self development), stopped smoking and drinking and prepare meals. I worked out how much I was saving from stopping bad habits alone (¬£6.70 per day) and set up monthly transfers of this into a basic savings account. I've been dabbling into the world of economics to learn more and took interest into turning it into a potential career. 

I've since applied for a full time college course which my company will finance half of, but I've realised that it is financially impossible to get out of debt before the term starts. So the decision I am faced with is; postpone any career progression for a year and dedicate myself to becoming financially secure to go to college next year, or enter college this to speeden up my career path. If I was to wait a year, I could do further research into certain fields and look at creating a social network in that field before I consider a set career path which seems the logical and safest choice, however I am fully aware that I am not getting any younger and my family's advice is ""the whole country is in debt and you're not getting any younger, so you might aswell just go into education again."" They aren't the most financially secure people on the planet and my gut feeling is to leave it for a year. I am just curious to see what the internet thinks.

politics,Since Trump mentioned the Iraq War and Releasing the 28 Pages to Jeb's face during a debate (about 2 weeks ago Feb. 16th?)--the opposition to Trump has kicked it up a notch,"On February 18th, Donald Trump said:

+  We went after Iraq, they did not knock down the World Trade Center. It wasn‚Äôt the Iraqis that knocked down the World Trade Center, we went after Iraq, we decimated the country, Iran‚Äôs taking over, okay.

+ But it wasn‚Äôt the Iraqis, you will find out who really knocked down the World Trade Center. Because they have papers in there that are very secret, you may find it‚Äôs the Saudis, okay? But you will find out.

Donald Trump has the Cabal squirming!!!

Since he brought up the Iraq War and the 28 pages former high ranking officials have been lining up to take their shots at Trump in the media:  George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, former CIA-NSA chief Michael Hayden, and other generals...

WHY???

Because the American public knows the Iraq War was sold to us on a pile of LIES...and there is no defense of NOT releasing the 28 Pages...

Former Senator Bob Graham had this to say last year at a press conference when he called for the release of the 28 Pages: 

+ The Saudis know what they did. They are not persons who are unaware of the consequences of their government‚Äôs actions. Second, the Saudis know that we know what they did! Somebody in the Federal government has read these 28 pages, someone in the Federal government has read all the other documents that have been covered up so far. And the Saudis know that...

+ ...They have continued, maybe accelerated their support for one of the most extreme forms of Islam, Wahhabism, throughout the world, particularly in the Middle East. And second, they have supported their religious fervor, with financial and other forms of support, of the institutions which were going to carry out those extreme forms of Islam. Those institutions have included mosques, madrassas, and military. Al-Qaeda was a creature of Saudi Arabia; the regional groups such as al-Shabaab have been largely creatures of Saudi Arabia; and now, ISIS is the latest creature!

personalfinance,Should I buy a flat on the equity scheme?,"Hi guys,
I am in the process of buying an ex council flat, based in London zone 3 for ¬£200,000 on a leasehold basis for 125 years. It is nice area, with good neighbours in East Ham, Newham where the Manor Park Crossrail line is going open in 2018 which is not too far from this flat. The flat is fully refurbished.
I am currently 20 years old, working in London with a salary of ¬£28,312 with ¬£25k in savings. I live at home, with no bills or rent to pay and I am a very strict saver. If I do stay at home I could say 100k in 5 years through my salary, potentially more if I get promoted. 
My question is should I continue to stay home, save my money and look for a freehold house in 5 years, where I can join forces with my sister to buy one of my Mom freehold home which is also in Newham London, or should I get on the property ladder now and buy this leasehold flat with the hope that the value of the flat will increase in 5 years from 200k to more than 300k, were I potentially can make a good profit compared to just staying home and saving my monthly wages in 5 years? 
Will the flat value increase by more than 100k in a period of 5 years within London, or am I missing out something?  
Flat Equity Scheme background information
I am buying the leasehold flat through the shared equity scheme, where I will purchase 50 - 75% share of the property through a mortgage and deposit and the rest will be paid via a loan from the government, therefore I will legally have 100% full ownership of the property on a leasehold basis.  This is different from a shared ownership scheme. 
The loan has an interest rate of 1.75% the first year which rises every year with RPI I believe. Also the loan value must be paid back in full within 25 years or can be bought out in stages, which will be charged at the property value at the time, so any increase in the value will mean more to pay back at the percentage of the equity loan I have been given. 
For instance, I buy the property at ¬£200k and get an equity loan for 50% of the value to buy it, which is 100k. However, if the property increase in value in 5 years to 300k and I decide to sell, I have to pay back 50% of this to the council, which is 150k.
Expenditure 
The flat I have been offered from the council is very big and is a 1 bed ground floor flat, the flat block is very small with only 2 levels above the ground flat. There is no lifts and the flat area and gardens is well maintained, hence the service charge is quite cheap at ¬£78 a month. 
Ground rent - ¬£100 per year
Service charge - ¬£78 per month 
I estimate my monthly charges including bills, mortgage, equality loan interest repayment, council tax to be around ¬£800 per month, maybe less.
Also the flat is done up in a way where the lounge is separated from the main bedroom, where both have different separate entrances. Therefore I plan on having a lodger stay with me where they will pay me ¬£400 a month towards bills etc., therefore my monthly costs could be as little as ¬£400 per month. 
There is no major works planned in the next 5 years, hence I will not be expected to receive a massive invoice. 
Also if I do buy out the equity loan from the council, I will be free to sell the leasehold flat on the open market. 
To conclude, I have 2 options, stay home and save my wages where I will have around to possibly more than 100k in 5 years‚Äô time or move out buy this leasehold flat hoping that the value will increase so much that I would be able to walk away with more than 100k from selling my share? 
I am really not sure what to do and really need some expert advice or any past experiences with doing something like this. My personal circumstances are very generous at the moment where I have ¬£0 bills, hence my full salary is saved every month.",finance,1457197620

Economics,How to Create a Free Trade Zone in my City?,"Hello.
My city has turned into a rustbelt area, and as a result has a lack of jobs. The county I live in is trying to promote UAV and underwater robotics, which is helping a small bit, but the fruit isn't there yet. The UAV is out at the airport and is in it's infancy. The only other big thing is an HQ for a smaller manufacturing co. and HQ for N. American operations of a publicly traded company.

Now I am running for a county office and I would have some leeway over budget allocation as well as creating enterprises for the county, but I can't actually levy taxes. I would also have control over zoning. Having said this, I don't think this in and of itself can do much, but I do have a few policy ideas that could allow flexibility in this regard.

The first is a FTZ out at the airport or near the HQs. This would encourage development of robotics goods at the airport by allowing parts to come into the airport duty free and only pay on the finished goods. I believe this could reinvigorate manufacturing.

The second idea is a local exchange trading system. Now I am not trying to be all buy local or anything, but I believe it could allow for more flexibility in terms of setting up a free trade zone. While certain economic policies would be harder to implement (such as liberalized labor, flexibility with certain federal regulations, etc.), at least with tax policy it seems you could easily liberalize that. I am just not sure how you would implement it for the purpose of tax savings. I just want my town to grow, and it seems like the options are somewhat limited. This is a rural area on the water, with a population around 27k. Anythoughts on liberalizing trade and encouraging investment?",finance,1457198886
personalfinance,1040-ES Question (Estimated Tax Voucher),"Apologies if this has already been answered, searched the sub and checked the wiki (as well as general google-fu) but didn't find a specific answer to my questions.

The short version - My wife and I owe ~$1800 in federal taxes this year, so TT included 4 estimated tax vouchers with my return.  It is my understanding I *may* pay these vouchers throughout 2016 so that when we file next year, ideally, we don't have another ~$1800 in federal tax liability all at once.  Is that correct?

The longer version - My wife and I got married in 2014, so 2015 was the first tax year we were married for the whole year.  We both had our allowances set to 2 on our W4s, because that's what I had read on the internet.  I think what screwed us here is that I make significantly more than my wife does.   When our incomes are combined for the joint return - our *combined* income is taxed at a higher rate than *her* income was throughout the year... if I understand how the marginal tax rate works.  

So I think TT has generated the vouchers under the assumption that I will owe about the same amount next year in tax liability.  The idea here being I can pay the estimated amount of taxes ahead of time, and not have to owe the IRS a chunk of money come next year.  As far as I can tell, this is not mandatory and I can choose to simply deal with my tax liability next year if and when the time comes.  The thing is, I'm hoping to avoid owing any taxes next year by lowering our allowances - we've both set to zero just to be safe and we'll see how it goes.",finance,1457200326

**What is the Census?**

* The U.S. Census counts every resident in the United States. It is mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and takes place every 10 years. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities.



Thanks. 

That out of the way, I think the GOP is making their final stand as a legitimate party in the United States.   For too many years, the GOP was convinced they had to veer hard right on a number of increasingly unelectable and unpopular views.  They had to do this in order to get the votes of different extremes within the party.   

These different extremes were led to believe that they were in fact the underrepresented majority of the party, due to the message that has been delivered to them via the channels the party used to reach everyone.  So, all the talking heads, books, news channels, community meetings, and most effectively and damaging, the internet, would all reinforce that the extreme views were in fact the majority.   We need to take our country back!""  It finally came to a point with the internet echo chamber and disassociation from actual functioning bipartisan conversation pushed the minority to seize the helm, and stand for their beliefs, unaware that they are in fact the minority.   My wife was watching some HBO special on Elizabeth a few months back, and I remember the Earl of Essex and like eight guys starting a revolution, and screaming to the people ""WE'RE HERE FOR YOU!  WHY AREN'T YOU BEHIND US?""   That's totally what happened with Trump.

I think the GOP thought they could wait out the change while the clear majority of those views literally died out over the next eight years, they've been trying to curb the far right for years now.   But, Trump came along.


However, Trump has some moderate policies.   The GOP just saw that these hard line conservatives abandoned the party they were holding hostage for someone with moderate policies.   They must be so goddamned furious right now.  They're all going ""Hey, fuck you!   We didn't like being called bigots anyway!""

Anyway, what they're doing is having the extreme right commit suicide.   Ryan came out and said the party cannot stand for bigotry. They've never so directly addressed the extreme minority that focuses on racism.  Romney came out and pointed out how Muslims aren't all bad.  

The moderates are finally able to broadcast the quiet majority moderate conservative message.  They're doing everything they can to lure out the last vestiges of sane conservatives from Trump, and it's working.  Trump is now completely unelectable, no matter what people will say.  

The moderate establishment begged for a brokered convention.  (Don't lie, Reince!)  Romney told people to vote for whichever candidate is in their area most likely to beat Trump.   The establishment candidates are all now attacking Trump's extreme views, and are focusing on whatever strength they have that speaks to the base that would support them.  

Rubio's out today giving a hell of a great ""Here's what conservatism"" speech is, and it's going to be wildly successful. 

Romney will be the candidate from the convention.   ('Member how everyone pledged to support the nominee?  Even if it's not you....Donald?)  It won't be anyone here now, we can all see the numbers.   None of them have large enough votes to represent the country.   Romney was vetted already.  He's been through a primary.  He said he's not entering the primary, and that's correct, he's going to sit it out while the moderates take back the voice of the party.   Did you see his speech?  He ended, and immediately started shaking hands.   Don't let him fool you, he's in full on running mode.

He'll lose, though.   Whoever comes forward on the Dem side (All likelihood Clinton) will crush him in the general.   Turnout is low on the dem side, as both of the candidates accurately represent the party spectrum.  From more conservative pro business liberal to populist leftist, the candidates are both more or less approved by a majority of voters.   Should Sanders get it, the party will really focus on his minority strengths, but in a less embarrassing way than what's been done so far.   Clinton would cakewalk, though.

The GOP will spend the next eight years building up a socially moderate platform, with really wonky number oriented fiscal conservatism, and heavy focus on American infrastructure, border security, and national security.   

The census is happening.   Everyone's going to be counted, and everything will be redistricted properly.  Both parties will really have to focus on local policies to remain relevant.   The left will probably lean left in many ways Sanders pushes, but not all.   The left will also start shedding a bunch of conservative dems, because the GOP will now be much more viable.

Social media and national interest in politics, and also effective ways to shame politicians who are corrupt are going to be the norm, and I think both parties now know the crony gravy train has ended.

To those that worry about the supreme court, or eight years of D's in the white house, I say it's really not going to be bad.  The country *cannot* go too far left or right, or we *will* actually fall apart, and we're literally at that spot right now.   I think the next eight years will be very boring for everyone, as there won't be sudden growth in either direction.  

As to why Trump won't win, the only supporters there are going to be various fringe groups.   He's not going to be President guys, I'm sorry.

He's threatened the Speaker of The House, and the Military.   You can't take that back or joke about those, guys.  He's also *literally* the embodiment of all things moderate to liberal democrats hate.  Greed, racism, sexism, it's all there.   It would be a massacre.

Trump's far right is already destroying them at local elections, as you could see by the link.   If they don't excise the far right publicly, conservatism *will* die, because dems will win everything, down to the local.  This is the only way they can save themselves down to a local level.

I'm considering the dilemma of purchasing a home with a lower down payment and paying higher PMI while rates are lower vs waiting until on better financial footing.  Of course in the time it would take to save 20% interest rates may rise.

Of course you cannot predict with certainty future interest rates.  However, looking at historical mortgage rates the change in rates seems to be limited to approx 1% per year.  Even in the 80's with the crazy rates and situation,  you only had a few years where the  average rate changed dramatically in a short period of time.. and even then it was 2-3%.

So, with that being said.  I'm thinking it seems unlikely (although of course not impossible) that mortgage rates would be averaging more than 6-7% any time before 2020.

I send them an affidavit about my Identity Theft, license and police report and they never answer my mail.

personalfinance,Your credit score isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs important. It‚Äôs your cash-flows,"I‚Äôm going to assume the reason people want a strong credit score is because when they need a loan for a car/mortgage/business/etc. they will be accepted. A lot of people probably think that as long as you have a good credit score, you‚Äôll be accepted for a loan and that is simply not true. I recently started working as a credit analyst in commercial lending and your credit score is the *last* thing we consider. This is because your credit score is an accumulation of past repayments, not your *current* ability to repay a loan that you are currently applying for. For instance, there are people who have run a successful business in the past. They always paid back their debts on time since they were able to, and therefore have immaculate credit scores. They are now denied loans because their business is no longer doing well and will be rated as unable to repay the loan. Basically, past ability to repay loans =/= current ability to repay loans. 

**Full disclosure: Do bear in mind that purchasing an automobile / residential home may differ as that is not what I‚Äôm specializing in, but I imagine they would be similar. If anyone works in that department and it‚Äôs completely different, then this thread will only apply to people interested in getting approved for commercial loans. Furthermore, I‚Äôve only worked for 1 bank for a limited time so this may not be true for other banks.**

So what is important you may ask? Whenever an application arrives for a loan or line of credit, the very first thing we look at is the applicant‚Äôs cash-flows ‚Äì we do an analysis consisting of all reoccurring incomes vs. expenditures. Basically all the money that you bring in (wages, income from businesses you own, rental income if you own property, etc.) must be greater by a certain minimum degree than all the reoccurring money that goes out (mortgages, rent, auto, credit cards, etc.) This is called the [DSCR short for debt service coverage ratio]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_service_coverage_ratio) If the applicant does not meet this minimum cash-flow requirement, the application is denied. This is because if your cash inflows are insufficient or your cash outflows are greater than your cash inflows, you do not have the capacity to repay the loan, something that adds *additional* expenditures to your budget. 

Next the collateral is examined. Assuming the loan is secured by collateral (as it often is), it is appraised and compared to the loan amount since it is a second source of repayment (cash inflows are your first). This is called [loan-to-value]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan-to-value_ratio) and must not exceed a certain amount. Simply put, the loan you receive will typically not exceed the value of what it is secured by. If for example you want to purchase a $100,000 house and have $0 to your name, the LTV will be 100% and will probably not be accepted. If you have $50,000 you can use as a down payment and only require a $50,000 loan, now the LTV is only 50% and much more likely to be accepted.

Only when the above two are satisfactory, is an applicant‚Äôs credit score viewed. Even if you have a poor credit score, you‚Äôll be much more likely to be approved if you have strong cash-flows than if you had weak cash-flows but a strong credit score. With that said, obviously you should be working to keep your credit score high and repaying your debts, but if your goal is to be approved for a loan, then your priorities are to secure high earnings while keeping your spending low, and then worrying about paying back debts on a timely manner. 

Lastly, this is why budgeting is key. Since having a strong DSCR (which again is calculated by taking your total reoccurring income and dividing it by your total reoccurring expenditures) is the most important when it comes to loans, reducing your expenditures is the easiest way to improve the ratio (you have two ways to improve your ratio - earn more or spend less i.e. dividing by a smaller number vs. dividing with a bigger number). Note however I‚Äôm not necessarily talking about how much you spend on things like food every month, I‚Äôm talking about things that appear on your credit report (installment loans and credit card usage). This is why PFS emphasizes paying off those pesky loans starting with the highest interest rates. 

TL;DR cash-flows are a better representation of a person‚Äôs current financial standing and in order to be accepted for a loan, you must earn enough to support current and the additional expenditure of the monthly repayments. Thus your income and expenditures are more important than what your credit score is. Having a strong credit score will certainly help, but it is objectively less important.",finance,1457223141

investing,Discussion: Best Fund for each Bond Type,"Hi guys! I wanted to start a thread to discuss good ""non-diversified"" Bond funds. Here's why.

* 1. I'm a believer that efficient frontier/portfolios should be learned by  everyone (not just investors). But as a professional data scientist and modeling hobbiest I also think efficient frontier, markowitz optimization, etc, etc are very misleading and not actually that great.

 * 1.a MVO and risk metrics have weird assumptions, too many parameters to overfit and I feel like there is a lot cherry picking and fooling ourselves. I really don't care what the average correlation of two assets are. I care what their combined performance is during crisis or what their rebalancing opportunities are during low volatility times.

 * 2. I'm a huge hater of market cap weighting. Look at HYG, look at S&amp;P 500 during tech bubble and financial crisis, look at APPL one of my least favorite companies being like 4% of SPY. There are other marketing and low fee tricks that are of a similar vein.
 * 3. if all bonds had a constant negative correlation to stocks we'd all be rich because trading would be stupid easy. However there might be an opportunity to generate rebalancing opportunities in a a portfolio by owning several different bond sectors instead of just owning BND or similar.  Some bonds have a negative correlation to stocks under low volatility like BFK muni. Some have great correlations like TLT but high interest rate risk. Short duration investment grade are good but pretty much require leverage or must be used as purely trading vehicles. I'm hoping we can build a list of lots of sectors and flavours of bonds and rank by fees and ask/bid spreads and other factors. I will definitely be contributing my own lists and I will post some backtesting and results if I find anything good. both ETFs and CEFs are welcome. Happy Discussing/Researching!",finance,1457226729
personalfinance,How to balance paying off consumer debt + saving for emergency fund while in a graduate professional program,"Greetings everyone! This is my first post on PF (and Reddit). I have read the rules, so I‚Äôm hoping that this is an appropriate question, but by all means if I‚Äôm missing the mark please (kindly) let me know. And thanks in advance for any advice you can offer! I have tried to strike a balance between detail and concision, but feel free to ask if you need me to clarify anything.

So I‚Äôm now in my early 30s, and like many others, I was not terribly responsible with my finances in my 20s. I tried using Mint for several years, but always ended up inaccurately forecasting my income/expenses and ended up relying on credit cards. I have finally woken up to this unhealthy practice and found that YNAB was just the method I needed to start to rectify this situation.

Giving every dollar a job and bringing awareness to every transaction has really started to align my spending with my priorities, and though I‚Äôm only several weeks into using the (n)YNAB method, it has already straightened out my budget considerably. I‚Äôve taken almost all of the webinars, though of course I know I still have a lot to learn about this approach.

In a nutshell, this is what my financial situation looks like:

**Assets**

* Been working a job that pays ~47k annually, but serendipitously just as I decided to go back to school for a professional degree, they are closing the office and paying severance
  * It looks like I will get around ~8-9k payout (after taxes)
* Just a small buffer for a few long term expenses and monthly emergency fund deposits in my checking, but otherwise it‚Äôs still paycheck-to-paycheck situation for me
* Around 5k in a 401(k)
* By the time the office closes, I should have around $1250 in Emergency Funds saved (currently ~700)

**Debts**

* One personal loan from Prosper, paying $270/mo (currently ~4000 left), paid off in July 2017
* Credit Cards:
  * Mastercard ~1300
  * AMEX ~2000
  * Visa ~6000
* Car lease until July 2017, paying ~220/mo.
* No student loan debt currently

So here‚Äôs my next step and where I can use the most help: I am going back to grad school for social work next fall and will have to move out of state for the program. I‚Äôm hoping to attend a state school where I will ‚Äúonly‚Äù end up in 40-50k in debt (rough guess at tuition + cost of living expenses) after the 2 year program.

My situation is tricky because I will definitely get a part time job to cover as much of living expenses as possible and continue paying off the debts, but it will be a demanding program and I have a health condition where I will have to manage my energy levels carefully, so I can‚Äôt just burn both ends of the candle during this time and work half or full (!) time while also being in school full time.

Here are my initial, admittedly not terribly detailed just yet, thoughts on how to navigate this situation, which begins in June. My goal for the next two years of school is to NOT accrue any additional consumer debt and instead chip away at what debt I have, while still maintaining an emergency fund and paying as much of my living expenses from my PT job as possible:

* **Severance payoff** 
 
 * Use ~1k to pay off the MC debt (starting with the snowball method for now), as it will be at this balance by the time June rolls around  
 * Put away ~1-2k in emergency funds, leaving me with 2-3k, approximately 1-2 months emergency savings since I figure I‚Äôll have some coverage from student loans  
 * Something like 1-1.5k for moving expenses, apartment deposit, etc.  
 * The rest of the 4-5k (**need help here**): Use part of this for another CC payoff (maybe the AMEX, leaving just the Visa as the ‚Äúopen‚Äù debt) and the rest in another savings account, CD, or just to my emergency fund?  

* **Part time job** ‚Äî use this and whatever loans I get for living expenses + minimal to moderate monthly payment of remaining CC debt.  
  * I figure I can rely on the loans for more of my living expenses, and use more of my part time income to pay off debt (this essentially ‚Äútransfers‚Äù some of my debt to my lower interest rate education loans, if that makes sense‚Ä¶I think that makes sense‚Ä¶this makes sense, right?)  
  * Given my health condition, I think I can reasonably work 10-15 hours a week in addition to being in school full time.  
  * I am looking into some kind of part time consulting work, as I already have a graduate degree and lots of experience, so I was recently advised I could legitimately charged $50/hr. for my services  
   * But I don‚Äôt know how feasible that will be to find/build a client base while in school (and I need experience in this), so I may be stuck doing work study and/or getting paid half that much at a part time job (if lucky).  

* **Living expenses during school**: Based on a very rough estimate of rent + food + healthcare + car + minimal debt payments + etc., I‚Äôm estimating my monthly expenses will be around 2-2.5k, but I could possibly trim this so it‚Äôs on the lower end or a little less ‚Äì‚Äì it‚Äôs just hard to tell because I will be moving to a new area.  

 * **Car** ‚Äî from what I understand, I will likely need this for my internship, so I don‚Äôt think I can drop this (huge) expense for the time being.  

* **Post-graduation** ‚Äî the first few years I will probably only make 40-50k (if lucky), but once I receive a license for private practice, I plan on working enough to make around 60-70k a year (I realize this will take time!)  

* **Retirement** ‚Äì‚Äì not even sure I can put anything away for this right now, but I know there are differing schools of thought on completely paying off debt ASAP vs. more slowly paying and putting some money away in a 401k/IRA  

So these are my initial thoughts. Again, I realize my own plans for what to do are not incredibly detailed, but this is why I posted. So thank you for bearing with me ‚Äì‚Äì I‚Äôm just starting to gain some clarity on my financial situation and finally taking some real action.

Thank you for reading this and for any advice you can offer!

personalfinance,401(k) Loan to pay off Student Loan,"I have a student loan of $43k at 4.5002% variable ((one month LIBOR+4%)*(365/360)).  It is structured as a line of credit collateralized against someone else‚Äôs assets. Because of this, I can borrow and repay as I please. It‚Äôs not really a student loan, but all of the money I‚Äôve borrowed from it has been treated as a ‚Äúrefinance‚Äù of my higher interest (6.8-7.9%) student loans. I have others, but those are at reasonable rates between 3.15% and 6.16%

I can borrow from my traditional 401(k) at Prime + 1 (currently 4.5%). This rate is adjusted on the last day of the month, each month, but is fixed for the term of the loan. Loan term is a maximum of 5 years.

Essentially, I can borrow from my 401(k) at the fixed rate of 4.5% to pay part of this variable rate loan off, which I will otherwise pay off within 3 years (and more likely within 2). The logic being that as the variable rate goes up over the next 2-3 years, the rate on the part refinanced through my 401(k) loan does not. If rates were to go back down, I can move the loan back to the line of credit penalty/pain free. The only thing I couldn‚Äôt recoup would be the $75 fee to process the loan.

My thought process goes like this: On the 401(k) side, I‚Äôm guaranteed a 4.5% return. This is above the typical ‚Äúpay off debt vs. invest‚Äù hurdle rate of 4%. On the ‚Äútoday‚Äù side, I‚Äôm paying the loan either way with after tax dollars, and 4.5% fixed over the next few years is very likely going to be less than the variable rate line of credit I have. To me, it seems the only thing I have to lose is the $75 processing fee. My plan was to do this at the end of the month that the Fed decides to raise interest rates (probably June, maybe March). My other loans are large enough to max out the student loan interest deduction already, and I will likely start to phase out of that deduction this year and be fully phased out next year.

ethereum,Shouldn't the market decide staker returns?,"The POC2 blog post says the maximum return on stake will be 10% with the most aggressive bet. It seems odd that it specifies the return on investment, instead of specifying the aggregate reward like we do with PoW.

When stakers get shares of a fixed total reward, we get stability. If not enough people stake, the return for stakers is higher than the market requires, and more people join in. If too many stake, the return drops and people drop out. The return on stake has an equilibrium around the minimum return people require to stake.

But with a fixed return, we have to hope the return is comparable to investments in the broader economy with similar risk. In a bear market with low interest rates, people will be highly motivated to stake. As more join in, the return doesn't change, so the total staked amount will reach a maximum.

In an economy with high interest rates or a bull market, staking will be less competitive. People might find that other uses for their money are more profitable. As people drop out, returns don't increase, so almost everybody drops out.

So instead of a nice stable equilibrium, we have massive instability. We get a middle ground only when the economy happens to offer similar returns elsewhere, otherwise we fall off the knife edge to either a maximum or minimum.

(If overall inflation depends on the amount staked, that changes things a bit, since more people staking lowers the effective return slightly via inflation. But it's a small effect. E.g. if total inflation is 2% and the amount staked doubles, inflation increases to 4%, reducing effective return by 2% instead of by 50% as would happen in a PoW-style system.)

personalfinance,"[CA] Not understanding why I owe hundreds of $ to Quebec, but am getting a giant federal tax return? (Moved ON -&gt; QC -&gt; ON) - very confused","Hi PF, 

I'm getting incredibly frustrated and have not been able to find the answer to this in the last two hours, after scouring the CRA, RQ, Ufile and TurboTax sites. Maybe I'm missing something obvious. Here's the situation:

I worked January - June in ON as a fulltime employee, with CPP/EI/etc contributions. From July - September I received EI in ON. In September I moved to QC for a new job, and went through the process of changing the following information:

- CRA address
- Driver's licence / licence plate
- Banking information

Thus, permanent address was QC, and place of residence as of Dec 31, 2015 was QC.

Worked September 2015 - February 2016 in QC before getting laid off (though maybe that's not relevant I guess since end of December 31 I was still employed in QC). Now I'm back in Ontario, so my ""current mailing address"" on my tax return is my current ON address (I work and live here now, so 2016 return should be much simpler.)

Using StudioTax: I put in all the relevant info, used CRA auto-fill on StudioTax to get both my ON and QC T4, as well as my ON T4E, tuition tax credits, RRSP contribution room, etc. Added in RL-1 data from my QC job, though there's an income mismatch between QC RL-1 and T4, not sure if this matters? RL-1 shows $100 more than the T4.

Now, StudioTax puts in my Ontario job as a RL-1 as well. Why? I did NOT work in Quebec for this company, obviously, as I only received a T4 from them. I cannot edit out the tax section. When I used TurboTax to do this, TurboTax ALSO added an RL-1 for that ON job automatically, though I'm able to blank out all the values if I wish (cannot do this in StudioTax). Should I be?

Additionally, as I just found out on the [CRA Website](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ncm-tx/rtrn/cmpltng/ddctns/lns409-485/438-eng.html), Line 438 is a Tax Transfer for Residents of Quebec, and I can transfer 45% of my tax to QC. **Why would I want to do this?** I did NOT live in Quebec before September 1 - does QC need to know my income for the entire year? If so, I am being taxed on my ON + QC income, am I not? 

Final numbers from StudioTax:

Federal (Canadian Flag):

- Line 150: 42,273.55 Total Income
- Line 236: 42,273.55 Net Income
- Line 260: 42,273.55 Taxable Income
- **Line 484: 3,527.66 Refund** if I do the 45% tax transfer to QC, which I don't understand.

OR

- **Line 484: 5,819.24 Refund** If I don't do the 45% tax transfer to QC

Provincial (QC? it has a Quebec Flag):

- Line 299: 40,825.31 Total Income - **Why? I only earned $11,270.14 in QC!**
- Line 399: 2,473.97 Non-refundable Tax Credits
- Line 450: 4885.39 Income Tax and Contributions
- Line 478: 0 Refund
- **Line 479: 1599.24 Balance Owing** if I do the 45% tax transfer to QC

OR

- **Line 479: 3890.82 Balance Owing** if I don't do the 45% tax transfer to QC

[Imgur Screenshot of the lines above](https://imgur.com/k7sN2ms)


StudioTax calculates line 438 as $2,291.58 automatically if I enter an absurdly high number, and yes that ends up being 45% of the $5081 out-of-quebec tax I paid on my ON T4 and my ON T4E.

What I CAN'T figure out: WHY do I have to do this? Why does Quebec care about the income tax earned outside the province? Am I doing something wrong or is the info above correct? TurboTax and StudioTax are not matching up either, but I entered most of the StudioTax info myself (Plus, it's giving a larger refund? and it's free) so will probably go with that.

Please help, I can't find any solid answers on what's going on or what I must do. Any other advice, in general regarding taxes would be appreciated. This is my first time doing taxes myself (always gave T4's/T2202A/etc to my dad before I became independent)

**TL;DR in case this is way too long and confusing:** Are the above numbers correct? Am I supposed to pay QC tax for the entire year, and be owing them upto $4000? I'm a new grad, and have plenty of tuition credits. If I do this as an Ontarian (skip the QC part and pretend I have an ON address) I get a $6k+ refund, not OWE $4000!",finance,1457246223

While part of me is happy to help a friend out, the other part of me feels weird about the reasons I was given to help. He claims he needs the money to pay off various credit card debts. Okay, fine. Just last year we got out from under about $13k of CC debt.

btc,Anyone else amazed the price of bitcoin hasn't tanked?,"In less than 30 days 700 million dollars of capital has flowed into Ethereum.  In theory, these are all people who are fed up with the bitcoin drama and want to diversify or otherwise move their bitcoin elsewhere.

http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/#charts

In turn, this would make those who got into Ethereum early, stinking rich and, one would assume, happy to cash out with big fat checks.

I never got onto the ethereum band-wagon in the first place, and I'm not planning on changing my mind any time soon. (I'm not even sure what their token issuance model is supposed to be?)

There are some differences between the market cap of ethereum and the market cap of bitcoin.  The market cap of bitcoin is based on the total number of bitcoins which have ever been created; even though we know that a massive number of those bitcoins are likely lost forever or, at the minimum, not actively participating in any economic activity.

On the other hand, with ethereum, everyone who got into it did so with clear knowledge that it was a 'get rich quick' scheme, and surely holds tightly to their private keys.  Sure, maybe a few ethereum have been lost forever, but I doubt that many,

So, the question is, in the face of an onslaught of bad news for bitcoin, and a whole lot of negative press, and an outflow over 700 million dollars of capital into a competing cryptocurrency, how in the hell is the bitcoin price not crashing?

For weeks now I have seen every large sell-off attempt fail to depress the price.  Even this weekend, with what seemed like a legitimate crash on the negative press, the price is already rapidly rebounding.  It's already back to 411 as I type this.

What this means, I assume, is that someone(!?) is sitting on the sidelines with very deep pockets willing to buy any and all bitcoin for sale so long as the price doesn't rise too much.  This appears to have been happening for a number of weeks.

Who is it that, in the face of a great deal of negative press and some legitimate uncertainty about the future of the project, is willing to buy every single bitcoin offered for sale these past few weeks?

I've been following bitcoin price daily since early 2013 and I have become accustomed to seeing the price react to negative and positive events, generally reflecting the sentiment of the community as a whole.  However this current pattern, of apparently some large investors, willing to buy any and all bitcoin no matter what negative press or dumps that are happening, is amazing to me.

Anyone else noticed this, or have any theories?

**EDIT** 

I realize I probably worded this original post wrong.  Many have already corrected me in this thread, which is great. 

I think I can more clearly voice my concerns.

The market cap for ETH has increased by 700 million dollars in *three* weeks.

I realize this does *not* mean that 700 million dollars moved into ETH.  However, what it does mean is that a relatively small number of people are sitting on 700 million dollars of 'paper' profit, most of them thinking they have realized a 10x return on investment or more.

Now, most reasonable people would expect this bubble to pop.  It will pop because any time you are sitting on a 10x return investment in 3 weeks you would be crazy not to cash in.  People have cars they want to buy, houses they want to pay off, debt to pay down.  

I would fully expect many of these people to at least attempt to sell off a big chunk of their holdings, to capture as much of that paper-profit as real hard returns, and soon.  I certainly know that I would do the same!  

Now, if people try to sell even a hundred million dollars worth of ETH in the next few weeks, most of them will do so by selling ETH for bitcoin, and then bitcoin for USD.  

Now, if people try to realize this paper profit by selling a 100 million dollars or more worth of bitcoin in a very short period of time, won't this trigger a massive price correction in bitcoin?",cryptocurrency,1457279824

personalfinance,Deferring student loans until credit card debt is paid off?,"I'm happy to provide more details but the question is more generally speaking: Is it a bad idea to keep deferring student loans until credit card is paid off? 

The thought process is that: (a) I don't really know if deferring is bad on credit score (b) credit cards have way higher interest rate than student loans, and it'd be better to tackle those completely first, and (c) I can put more towards student loans, comfortably, once credit cards are paid off.

Personal details if they matter:

* Income: $50,000 (after taxes = $2820/month)

* Rent and bills: $525/month includes rent and utilities, $40/month cell, $160/month health insurance = $725 ($2095 remaining)

* Savings = I save $200/month for a car/emergency. ($1895 remaining) note: I only have about $1400 in savings so I wanted SOMETHING to fall back on. But I also realize it takes away from paying off credit cards faster. I'm perpetually torn about savings vs paying off debt 

* Spending = I give myself an ""allowance"" of $200/week. It's a bit high, but it prevents me from using CCs. I am working to lower it to $150/week. But for now this is $800/month for (groceries, public transit, restaurants, saving for flights to see my family, shopping, etc). (I know ya'll are going to tell me to lower this) (I am aware). = ($1095 remaining)

* Credit card debt plan: $18K in CC debt, I put the reamining $1095 towards it. (1) is $4100 at 13% minimum payment $70 but I pay $100; (2) is $5100 at 23% I pay about $800 towards; (3) is $8900 at 16% I pay the minimum $200. I am tackling highest interest rate first and then the plan is to pay off the $4100 which will then be quick because I'll pay about $1000 towards it. Then lastly, the big balance =\

* My student loans are about $120,000. I know $8k will be forgiven immediately because of my job. I have worked full time in public service for five years (while a grad student-- hence why I haven't made any payments yet). and plan to for the next 10 years to qualify for public service loan forgiveness. I don't expect to make more than $65K tops in my job over the next 10 years. With income based repayment, my monthly payment for student loans will be about $300/month. I'm not looking to pay off the entire balance, I'm looking to pay minimums for 10 years so the remainder is forgiven.

** BACK TO THE QUESTION **

My student loans ($300/month) will be starting in Nov 2016 of this year. My ""get out of CC debt!"" plan won't be complete until Summer 2017 at my current salary (don't ask about raises-- not a real thing in my field). 

Should I defer my loans (which defers the ""10 year forgiveness"" plan until I start the first payment) until credit card debt is complete? (I'm 28 btw, so if I'm done with student loans payment by the time I""m 40 I will be very happy... though of course sooner the better. Sigh.) Or, should I pay $700/month towards debt (instead of $1k/month) to accomodate the $300/month student loan-- even if it means I won't finish paying off my credit cards for THAT much longer?

Any insight appreciated! I'm leanign towards deferring another 6 months from November; but also, that sucks, too.",finance,1457287541

My understanding for how PoS works is:

validators (who are staking), when eligible, need to bet on the finality of blocks. More technically speaking, each bet has to specify for each block height: which block will most likely win, and with what probability. Validators will be constantly updating their bets, thereby converging to consensus. So if it becomes apparent that majority of other validators prefer another block (by switching to it and increasing their bets on it), you'd need to update your bet quickly, to agree with the majority, or risk being left on the losing side.",cryptocurrency,1457303041

We live in a very snowy area and honestly, my husband and I share driving the SUV in the winter because the Focus can't get anywhere in snow. 

Now for the advice we would like. We make $80,000 after taxes. We have no debt, besides a mortgage. The mortgage plus insurance is $750/month, but we usually put $1500/month towards it. We still owe $180,000 on the mortgage. Interest rate is 2.75%.

We would like to buy a new Subaru Crosstrek. We would like a car that can drive well in snow and will last a long time to replace the Ford Focus. We plan on driving the Subaru and SUV into the ground. We would put $15,000 down and take out a loan for the remainder $8,000-$10,000. I also particularly like the Subaru for its safety ratings.

In May of 2015, I moved out of my mother and fathers home and into my father's rental property and have lived there since. Because of the ease of my tax situation, my father filed my taxes for me while he was doing his. I made just under 46k in 2015, about 5-6k more than I made the previous year. In the previous years, I received an 800-900 dollar tax return but this year I  only received a $57 federal return and I owed state money. The reason for this is that my father still claimed me as a dependent, even though I lived with him for only 4 and a half months in 2015. When I objected saying that that is not fair, I should be able to claim myself, he stated that he had to do this because I was already claimed on his W-4 for the year so he would have been majorly screwed. He also said that moving into a higher tax bracket because of my higher income was likely the cause for my low return. I also learned that had I been able to claim myself, because I am a full time student I would have received an automatic $2500 from federal. So, not only did I get screwed out of $2500 dollars, I also received the worst tax return I have had to date when I made more money than I ever had. My question is, is my father screwing me over and essentially seeming to be trying to get every penny he can out of me? Or was he genuine when he said what he said?

financialindependence,Speculating in a longer mortgage,"My fiance and I are just about to buy our first house. We have the $55k downpayment (20%) saved up as well as some $20k for fixing it up. We are currently trying to decide whether to take out a 20 year loan at an effective rate of 3.01% p.a. or a 30 year loan at an effective rate of 3.51% p.a. Both loans are grounded in bonds and can thus be paid off at any time by buying the underlying bonds and handing them in - in the case of the 30-year loan this gives an expectation that should the interest rate rise we could buy the bonds back at a lower rate and thus cut a portion off our debt.

I realize this would ordinarily be a question for r/personalfinance, but since we can afford both loans and are merely trying to gauge whether we should take the longer loan and invest the difference in monthly payments into index funds I thought r/fi might have more insight.

As I see it - we generally assume more than 3.5% growth in index funds, but this growth will be taxable (no good way to shelter it in Denmark currently). On the other hand the interest on the loan is deductible.

Any insights will be appreciated.

Edit: In case it matters - we plan to stay in the house for the next 25-30 years and then posssible move abroad for the later part of ""early retirement"". We currently have a savings rate of 55% which will fall a bit (probably to 35-40% excluding the growing equity in the house) after buying the house, but we are both expecting fairly big increases in salary over the next 2-4 years and hope to bring savings rate back to 50+%.",finance,1457354858

personalfinance,Bank suggested to get a home loan with my fianc√© and leave me off of it (fianc√©e here to answer some questions!),"[Here is a link to my fianc√©'s post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/48x2t8/my_bank_suggested_i_get_a_home_loan_without_my/)


I read through all of the advice you gave us and really appreciated it. There were a few questions my fianc√© did not have time to clarify, so I will try. I will also answer anything in the comments I forget to address. 

I am a full-time college student with a few semesters of subsized loans. I am currently for the remainder of the semester out of my own pocket. I am told that if I wait to fill out the FAFSA after we get married, I will be very likely to qualify for Pell grants and a much better deal on loans or even perhaps scholarships, as we will be making much less than my parents, who claim me as a dependent. 

I also have some pretty nasty lupus. It attacks my kidneys and joints and gets pretty ugly some times. I don't say that for sympathy, but if insurance policies have any effect on things like home loans it might be good info to have. 

I am not flaky with jobs, but I have started a new one about four months ago. I ended my last one at the same time, I retail job I had worked at for three years. There was no disciplinary reason for my departure, I just didn't want to work away the years there and it would have been really easy to. If I could do that again I would have sucked it up. Terrible timing. 

The idea the loan officer had is that since my new (very poor) income can't be added to the pre-approval documents, only my student loans, that I would be a negative asset to the loan and mortgage, and my credit would suffer for it. I would still be put on the title of the house after we get married (if we were to find a house before then, which I doubt.)  

I plan on paying a proportional share of expenses, and I do quite a bit to try and lower our expenses whenever possible. I pay my fair share, and will continue to. But I also see that this could potentially be an unfair arrangement for him. If he takes on the loan solely, but splits the house, what if we were to split up, or if one of us died? 

My father is very strongly against any arrangement that does not put me on the home loan, saying it means I could take advantage of him. (He wasn't implying I would do that, however.) and I agree with him, although I have not said anything as I would like to present us as a united front. 

But I need to know on my own. I do not want him to sign onto an arrangement that looks, I'll just say it, like a gold-digger. I don't want to be thought of that way, as I do pay my own, not would I want to him to be trapped if we were to divorce. 

At the same time, however, I am quite aware of my ethics and love for him, I would always pay my share. I don't want to put myself on this loan if it's going to hurt our loan amount of interest rate just to prove a point. The officer pointed out that my credit (a high number but I've built nothing but gas on a Discover card for a year or two.) is hollow. 

Is there a way we can go through with it this way while protecting him? Would a pre-nup be a valuable resource here or not since neither of us have any assets (besides old cars.)

personalfinance,Property - Should you borrow more and leverage growth or borrow less and pay off faster?,"Posted this in /r/RealEstate but maybe this is a better forum. 

Let‚Äôs assume that the property growth rate (5.5%) exceeds the mortgage interest rate (4.3%).

Which of these options yields a higher overall long term Return on Investment (10 years+):

*Option 1: Buy a $400k property and pay it off faster than Option 2.

*Option 2: Buy a property at the upper end of what you can pay off ($600k). After 10 years, you will have paid more interest, and have paid less of the principal off. However, the portion of the property that you do own would experience higher compound growth than Option 1 due to the higher purchase price, and the property growth rate exceeding the mortgage interest rate.

Is Option 2 utilising the concept of leverage, and would that yield a higher ROI?

I am well aware of the risks of the property growth rate stagnating and even regressing in this model.

The area where I will likely train has a very low cost of living.  One can find a a nice, safe home for $130-150k.  I am tired of renting and have investigated physician loans as an alternative for traditional loan to purchase a home.  I have been pre-approved through this program for a 200k mortgage, (I would never spend this much).  I think I have done the necessary homework in regards to the loan, (looked at other banks, looked at the fees, confirmed no PMI even with little down payment, good interest rate, etc.)  My question really is: how much can I afford as a monthly payment?  Here are more details:

- I am married with no children.  My wife is in professional school and has no income. Her parents graciously pay for her school tuition.  We are responsible for her other expenses.  She is 24 so can stay on her parents insurance for about enough 1.5 years.  Her car is paid off.  Currently on her parent's car insurance because it's cheaper.

- My car is paid off but may need another one in 1-2 years depending on how it holds up.

- Will have health insurance though employer in July

- Will probably be paying back student loans monthly on an income based repayment plan, meaning I can expect ~$300 monthly loan payments while in residency.  Other than school loans, I have no other debts.

- My salary will be ~$46k before taxes.

I was hoping to be able to afford a monthly mortgage payment of about $750.  Is this realistic? My other alternative is, obviously, renting, but to find an apartment in a safe area is $850 a month at minimum in this area.  Thanks for your help; I know there are other expenses to consider (utilities, etc)., but I was just trying to figure out if $750 a month is a realistic payment for my wife and me.

From what I understand, when getting an apartment I'll be paying the first and last, as well as a security deposit, so about $1200.

personalfinance,Another panicking dual-citizen (CA/US taxes)...(x-post from r/tax),"**I hope it's okay to post this here - I posted this in r/tax as well but I'm hoping to get a little bit of visibility and hopefully some answers.**

I am so overwhelmed right now.

I was born in California, but left when I was two or three years old and have lived in Canada ever since. I have dual citizenship. It has come to my attention that I was supposed to be filing US taxes this whole time. Approximately the past 8 or 9 years. I haven‚Äôt been.

I‚Äôve been trying to read up on the IRS website, but I‚Äôm just so lost and confused. I've come across both the Streamlined Foreign Offshore Procedure, and the Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program, but from what I am understanding, those are meant for people who will either owe taxes in the US, or who have been avoiding filing tax returns purposely, and want to get up to date without penalty. I don't believe either of those apply to me, but I'm not sure.

I've never made more than 30k CAD in a year since I've started working at the age of 16, I have no assets, I‚Äôm 95% sure I‚Äôve never had more than 10k total in any of my bank accounts, I have no savings, no retirement funds - nothing, as far as I know, to make my tax returns particularly complicated, and nothing to really make the IRS want to ""come after me"". I‚Äôm married to a Canadian citizen. I have a SSN and US birth certificate. I don‚Äôt have the money to hire someone to do this for me, which is why I‚Äôm trying to figure it out myself.

Basically, I am wondering if I need to file using either of these programs (SFOP/OVDP), or if it is adequate enough for me to just file my taxes for each year I missed, and send them all in at once. Or if I should just start filing as of now, and not worry about previous years?

That brings me to my next question. I am unsure what forms I need to fill out and send in. I know that I need to fill out form 1040, and I think form 2555, but that's as far as I've gotten. I'm also confused about the FBAR - does that apply only if I have had more than 10k in my accounts at any point, or am I supposed to fill one out each year no matter what? Are there any other forms I am missing?

I'm hoping that someone else who has had to deal with this can give me a basic walk through, or just some pointers - I have no idea what I'm getting myself into, and am panicking slightly. I am very anxious to get this straightened out, as I am considering renouncing my US citizenship, but that is another discussion for another day. I'm also terrified of doing this incorrectly, and winding up with huge fines/penalties, since I'll be effectively putting myself on the IRS' radar.

**Edit: Also, is there anything I need to file specifically in regards to the state of California? In Canada, we need to file our taxes on a federal level and a provincial level. Is there a similar thing for US tax filing that I need to worry about? I haven't stepped foot in California for over 15 years, and I have never made any income elsewhere in the US.

personalfinance,Loans for Harvard Law School - Monopoly Money?,"I was fortunate enough to be accepted at Harvard Law School for this upcoming school year. I have a question about taking out loans and how to treat those loans in light of Harvard's Low Income Protection Program (LIPP). I'll try to explain my situation as concisely as possible and include all necessary links.

Harvard is going to be expensive. About $270,000 ([Cost of Attendance](http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/sfs/financial-aid-policy-overview/student-financial-aid-budget/)), and that is before interest. I am going to be paying for all of this with loans, so I will be in an incredible amount of debt after graduation.

However, I am under the impression that I will not have to personally pay back more than an incredibly small portion of this because of LIPP. LIPP is Harvard's way of encouraging graduates to take low-paying jobs that serve the public interest. At low-paying salaries, it pays back 100% of your loans, and slowly scales up with your income ([contribution formula](http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/sfs/lipp/participant-contribution/) and [repayment examples](http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/sfs/lipp/lipp-scenarios/)). LIPP is not loan deferment; they actually pay off your debt.

Personally, I am committed to becoming a Public Defender after graduation. In most major east coast cities, they start off at a salary of ~$45k, so 100% of their loans are covered by LIPP. As I receive raises, I would still only have to pay a very small fraction of my loans. In the examples linked above, the hypothetical Assistant District Attorney (jobs that, unfortunately, take home slightly more than APDs) only paid back $13k of her loans in total.

So here is my question: Is it stupid to treat my loans like monopoly money while I am in law school? That is, spend the maximum amount allotted to me by the loan budget. I will have a loan allowance $2,475/month for room and board ([student budget](http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/sfs/financial-aid-policy-overview/student-financial-aid-budget/)), and with dorms at $900-1,300, I will have an incredible amount of left-over to spend on leisure each month. If it weren't for LIPP, I would try to be frugal and minimize my loans. But is there any reason to refrain from spending all of my room/board loans each month? Am I taking a stupid risk or missing something?

The only risk I can envision is if I radically change my professional ambitions, and shoot for a job that makes too much money to be covered by LIPP. But, 1) then I am making a lot more money, and needlessly repaying debt will be frustrating, but not put me in financial danger. 2) If I change my mind and go for a corporate job, I will have shot myself in the foot by going to Harvard on these loans anyway instead of taking one of the full rides at a slightly lower school. That is, I will have to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans that I could have avoided by taking a different full ride, so an extra few hundreds dollars a month is a drop in the bucket. But, again, all of this is contingent on me having a pretty drastic change of heart in the next three years--which I will never say is impossible--but I think it is unlikely.

So tell me Reddit...am I an idiot?


**Edit to add:**

1) To be specific, I received a full ride to UVA.

2) I have a good idea of what I'm getting into with this career path. I have done mock trial (trial advocacy competitions) for six years now. During college, I have interned at the local public defender's office, the local innocence project, and twice at the District Attorney's office. I feel very committed to a career in trial advocacy and I have for many years at this point. I believe I have seen it from enough diverse viewpoints to have a pretty decent idea of what this path entails.

3) LIPP includes many, many more jobs than just that of a public defender. I would still qualify if I decided to work in any low-paying job for a government, non-profit, academic, etc. institution. It even applies to many jobs that are unrelated to law, if I wanted to get out of the field entirely but still work at a low-paying job serving the public interest.

4) I realize that I do not need to attend HLS to become a public defender and if that is all I ever wanted to do, I would be better off minimizing my debt. However, there are a few path in which Harvard will help me. If I wanted to join one of the highly-selective PD offices, like PDS or Bronx. If I wanted to go federal later on in my career; Federal Defender and DOJ offices are both incredibly selective. If I ever wanted to get into politics, policy, academia or the judiciary. If I ever wanted to do other types of high level public interest work, e.g. Innocence Project or ACLU. Etc. I realize that HLS is far from necessary to get my foot in the door at a PD office. It is my career afterwards where I think it will help.",finance,1457380056

personalfinance,Made 20K last year and owe taxes for the first time. Inherited pension.,"Hello,  I've been lurking here for a while and I'm hoping someone may be able to give me some advice.  My uncle died and my mother was the beneficiary of his pension.  However, it was his wish that the money be given to me. It comes monthly and is about 10K/year.  My mother signs over the checks to me.  She is a waitress and makes about 20K/year; she claims 0 on her W-9.  Historically she has always gotten a refund at tax season.  This year with the pension added in she owes federal and state taxes it's about $1500 combined.  We called to see if the name of the checks could be changed but they can not.  My question is: Is there another way to have this money be in my name? Also, our tax preparer this year said she's being taxed a penalty since she's not 59.5 but why does that still apply if she inherited the money?  Any other suggestions?

personalfinance,Credit card payment keeps getting rejected; the fees are mounting. Now what?,"Disclaimer: maybe this belongs in /r/legaladvice, but here I am.

I'm 26, $3,000 in CC debt. I've been dutifully paying it off at about $200-500 a month when I can as I don't have a job. My parents give me money at their whims as I am in grad school, so I put some of that toward the debt each month. I recently had a very nasty customer service dispute with my previous bank and got fed up and decided to switch to a local credit union- couldn't be happier. With that, I switched all of my billing information and payments to the credit union as well.

So far, so good, right? All of my payments have gone through well- smooth transitions. However, I recently had a $1,000 payment bounce back from the credit card company. I had $1,500 in the account that I used and I paid from the account. It took five days before I received any notification. I thought it was awfully strange that it was so slow, and I then received an email stating that my payment was rejected due to insufficient funds. I tried it again, thinking it was an error or that it was an amount that was too high, so I submitted a payment for $500. Same result.

I called my credit card company, and they said that due to the 'insufficient funds', it was my fault, and that they had not only rejected the payment, but that they had assessed a $50 fee for each rejected transaction. I verified my routing and account number- it's the only account on the payment method and it was all correct. Livid, I contacted my credit union, thinking it was their fault. Not only were the funds fine to clear at the time of the transaction, they never received any notification or attempt from the credit card company to collect the payment at all, which explains why the funds never left the bank in the first place.

I'm pretty fucking pissed, to be honest. Not only is the payment now late (the credit card company says they have put a note on the account saying that it is okay to have a later payment, but my hopes are low), but I can't make a payment until this is dealt with and I'm just having fees socked to me all over the place. The credit card company smoothly suggested that I switch to their credit card following all of this rigmarole and I'm considering it, but I'm also wondering if I ought to get an attorney involved because this smells pretty terrible. They're charging me for something that was never meant to be charged. Having dealt with weird creditor situations in the past with attorney friends, I know that a well-written letter can sometimes result in them backing off with a settlement offer. Is this worth it, or is that too much stress and/or a terrible idea, and is it in my best interest to settle this with them and just end the relationship with this current credit card company and switch over after?

personalfinance,Having trouble refinancing my student loans,"Hi all,

I am trying to be proactive in paying off my loans, and one of the first steps was signing over a loan that was in my dad's name into mine. It was then that I realized one of my loans for about $12,000 has an 8.89% interest rate, which is ridiculous!

I have no idea how to go about this?

How does negotiating at a dealership go? Do I go to the dealership and tell them I have a pre-approved loan and am looking to make a $3500-$4000 down payment? Do I give the dealership the down payment or do I give that to the credit union? Do I even mention to the dealership that I am looking to make a down payment? Do I ask them if they can beat my credit union interest rate? If all goes well, does the dealership contact the credit union and take care of paperwork or do I bring something to the dealer and credit union and do the run around before being able to receive the car? Do I contact my car insurance I'm about to buy a new car so they can send stuff over or does dealer do that for me?(in MA a person must have insurance before being able to reg a vehicle).

personalfinance,"ACA and Taxes: Loss of credit/subsidy due to being ""below poverty line"".","This is a last-ditch search for answers on an issue I think is pretty much just not going to go in my favor.  ..and, while everybody talks about the 'cliff' as you go over 400% of the federal poverty level, there's another, less-discussed cliff -- when you elect to receive your credit at the end of the year, but through unexpected deductions, your AGI is below the poverty line -- in which case, you won't get the credit, and may owe quite a bit more in taxes than expected (3k, in my case) than you would have otherwise.

Scenario:
This year, I wasn't sure what my income was going to be.  ..it had potential to be anywhere between 40k and 16k, but wouldn't go below that.  Not knowing what my income level would be, I set aside some money to pay for insurance during the year, ""knowing"" I'd get my credit at the end of the year.  I was, after all, definitely going to be making more than the FPL.

I made around 19k.  However:
* I paid my own health insurance (deduction)
* I sold stocks that were plummeting (at an 8k loss -- I held them too long)
* I opened up an HSA (3k deduction)

..these three factors put me below the poverty line, in the eyes of the IRS, and as far as the ACA is concerned.  ..so, I *should have been* on medicaid, instead of having a marketplace health insurance plan.  My loss, to the tune of almost $3,000.

Incidentally, this problem is acknowledged, but only for people who took their subsidy during the course of the year.  If I had done so, I would still owe the same amount in taxes, but I would have paid that amount less on my healthcare payments, so I'd be better off by around 3k.

..is there any way to resolve this, or is it just pay up on the taxes, hate the law and move on?  I'm not even in a situation where this is gonna kill me one way or the other, but I know people who would be absolutely screwed if they got hit with an unexpected, multi-thousand-dollar loss of their tax credit at the end of the year -- because they took a loss during the year!

tl;dr:  Self-employed, didn't know what my income for 2015 would be at the beginning of the year, so I elected to take the ACA credit at the end of the year.  Deductions from capital losses and an HSA pushed me below the poverty line, now I don't get the credit. ""You lost 8k?  oh, let's make that 11k.""

I'm in my fourth year of university and I have around $2000 of outstanding tuition fees. I won't be able to graduate (I'm supposed to at the end of April) until it's paid off. I know it seems like I left this late but I've been trying to save up some money the past few months (It was around $2500 outstanding but I paid that down.) I'm now in panic mode because I can't figure out how to pay the rest in time. 

My parents don't make a lot of money and were borderline emotionally/verbally abusive to boot. They got better since I moved away for school and will help me out occasionally but they can't/don't help very much. I go to an expensive uni and I've been supporting myself through school since my first year. 

I had an RESP that paid for the majority of my first and second year but I've been paying for my third and fourth year myself (and with the help of a student line of credit which is maxed out at around $25,000.) I also have around $1,000 in credit card debt.

I have 2 jobs and make under $1,000/month (closer to $700-$800 depending on what hours I get.) I pay $550 in rent, around $150 in utilities and internet, around $70 in groceries, around $100 in line of credit payments and $25 in credit card payments. So I make much less than what I need to pay each month. I've been living off my credit and overdraft protection but Now I'm maxed out on both. I have $28 to my name until I get paid on thursday, and I'll only be getting around $150.

Now onto the most pressing issue: my tuition. I can probably beg my parents for rent money next month but if I don't pay my $2000 in outstanding tuition I can't graduate. I'm kind of panicking. I don't want to extend my student line of credit because my dad is the co-signer and he created a whole lot of drama last time I got it extended. (Not getting into that right now.)

I was thinking of calling my bank and applying for a personal loan of $3000 to pay off my tuition and pay down my credit card. Does anyone have experience with personal loans? (If it matters, I'm with PC Financial.) I'm just not sure if I'll even be approved. My crfedit is maxed out, and while I do pay the interest I have paid it late before. I really don't want to increase my debt but I don't know what else to do.

I'm considering asking my school for an emergency loan or bursary but I already did that last year.

I just don't know what to do. If someone has any suggestions I would love to hear them. Thanks a lot.

personalfinance,26 y/o - cash out refinance to invest in 401k?,"I am considering a cash out refinance to get some equity out of my condo and essentially invest it into retirement funds (by spending the proceeds from the cash-out refinance and saving 100% of my earned income into my 401k).

My condo was bank owned and I therefore got a ""good deal"". There have been direct comps in my condo building $20-$40k more than what I paid only two years ago. 

As a result of the higher comps, in addition to the lower interest rates now, I am considering a refinance. But I am contemplating a traditional refinance where I would refinance on the current balance of my mortgage, or a cash-out refinance where I could potentially walk away with at least $20k cash. 

I'm curious to hear the ER Community's thoughts on this. 

The cash-out option would, of course, leave me with a higher principal balance, but due to the lower interest rate, my monthly P&amp;I payment would only go up $50 over what it is at now. 

The traditional 30 year refinance option would lower my monthly payment by $100.

I currently am only 2 years into my 30 year fixed mortgage. 

What do you guys think? I personally think the cash-out option is attractive, but only if I am smart with the money and don't just use it to go on a shopping spree. Given my long time horizon (I am 26) and low interest rates still, this seems like a relatively risk free option but I could see the case for not doing it. 

Alternatively, I can pursue a 15 year or 20 year mortgage as well, but I'd rather do a 30 year given my time horizon.  

The plan is for me to invest it all into tax advantaged retirement accounts over the next few years.  

Some other background:  I am 26, with a net worth (excluding my mortgage) of about $300k.

I am in grad school and have about 10k in loans @ 6.8%. I should not obtain much more in loans as my employer will pay $5200 a year and I am trying to save a little out of each paycheck to pay off the debt by the time I graduate (1.5 years).

**INCOME**  
My take home is $4,120 per month and hers is $3,350. I also get a yearly bonus of ~$8-10k take home each year (this year is the first that I will get this).

**SAVINGS/RETIREMENT**  
I'm putting 10% into my 401k and have a pension plan through my employer. She is a teacher, thus she contributes to the Teacher Retirement System of Georgia and will get a decent percentage of her pay when she retires. I've also been putting a $100 or so into a Roth each month for her.

**DECISIONS**  
We recently spent money out of savings to finish our basement and to go on a trip this summer.

I know the rule of thumb is to pay down higher interest rates first; however, I'm wondering if we should be doing something different. My initial plan is to use the extra income to pay her student loan off and build savings back up. We don't technically have an emergency fund, but savings could be used for that if needed. Once the student loan is gone and savings is built back up we have a couple of options:

A) max out our retirement investments and build an actual emergency fund - what's the purpose of having money in a traditional savings account if not for an emergency (since the ROI is minimal)?  
B) Pay extra toward her car to pay it off, thus freeing up $400 a month  
C) Pay double payments on our mortgage. I believe I figured we could do this for 8-9 years and be mortgage free. We'd also gain the $160 a month once we reach the equity requirements for PMI removal.

We would really like to be mortgage free, but at the same time I understand that 4.5% isn't that high. The thought of owning our home outright is very appealing. One thing to note, my car is getting higher in mileage and I'm thinking about getting a new one in the next couple of years (mine should still be worth $7-9k by that time).",finance,1457413925

personalfinance,30 vs 15 year mortgage and my experience...,"Hello,

I recently purchased my second home, sold first from a move.  While doing that I had a serious debate on whether to go with the 15 or the 30 year mortgage. A little background on myself, I have recently paid off all my debts, make 128k, have a child and wife, and am 30 years old.  Bought a 237k home.  My initial thought was that I would do the 30 year and pay it like a 15.  I remembered then that I also had that thought with my 1st mortgage, and did not follow through.  I decided to go with the 15 year mortgage, at 3%.  I have been happy with that decision so far because I also pay a little extra each month and will have the house paid off in 14 years.  That is exciting.  

Now, at this point I also want to start investing in real estate, mostly some rental properties.  Begin building the equity empire...or whatever.  The problem, it takes money to make money!  Minimum 20-25% down required.  I feel like had I gone with the 30 year mortgage I would have more liquid cash to utilize.  This certainly isn't limited to real estate, but all investing.  There will always be a debate, debt vs invest etc, etc, make the spread on debt interest rate vs investing return...etc.  

Basically I'm just saying, think about all these things prior to buying.  Think about your long term goals long and hard.  That's it.  Thanks",finance,1457417569
personalfinance,Good idea to pay off $12k credit card debt when I have virtually endless 0% APR?,"I have around $12k credit card debt that I can readily pay off, but I usually maintain a 0% APR by simply bouncing it from my credit cards to my wife's, and vice versa, whenever the current promotion is ending (usually 12 months).

The credit card companies always run the balance transfer promos when our cards have a zero balance, so this is virtually endless. I know many here say to pay off debt first as the interest rate is higher than any return you can reasonably expect, but would that be beneficial in this case?

personalfinance,25 years old. Just finished paying off student loans. Unsure where to put my money next.,"The Good:

* Recently paid off $20K in student loans
* I have $10K emergency fund
* I make $80K salary + some contract work which gives me about $1,500 every 2 weeks. About $7K-ish a month take home. I expect the contract work to die down soon once I finish up some big projects in May-ish. Saving money from contract work for taxes.
* I'm contributing 4% of salary into company matching 401k (which is the max matching rate)

The Bad:

* $20K car loan with an interest rate of 2.3% with 4 years left
* Virtually no retirement savings other than the matching I just started with my company when I started a couple months ago
* My general expenses are decently low. About $1200/month for my total monthly expenses including rent, car payment/insurance, gas, food, bars, ect.

investing,Probability of a US recession in 2016 &gt; 60%,"There is a significant and reasonable debate over the possibility that the US economy could enter a recession in 2016. It is certainly not very frequent to see such a negative start to the year in equity markets in the midst of a bull market and a growing economy. However between the bearish warnings of Jim Rogers, who recently claimed that the probability of a recession within the next 12 months was 100% and the ""nothing to see here, everything is fine"" of official spokesmen there is a great deal of latitude for reasonable interpretation.

The base probability of a US economy being in a recession (2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth) is 20% (11 recessions from 1950-2010). However the probability is significantly higher after 6 consecutive years of growth. US GDP has been growing since Q3 2009 so a slowdown is more likely in 2016 than it was in the past few years. The quarterly slowdown in GDP growth since Q2 2015 (+3.9% annualised growth) to Q4 2015 (+1%) also combines with plunging commodity prices and other negative signals. These factors combined probably raise the chances of a recession in 2016 to 40-50%.

For a recession to happen in 2016 we would need to see negative growth at the latest in Q3 2016 and very low growth in Q2. Early indicators of this would be slowing Industrial Production and Factory orders in the first few months of the year. Lower equity markets are also usually a leading indicator. A slowdown in the services sector should also start to appear. 

A stronger US Dollar is sometimes a confusing indicator as it can indicate weakness elsewhere and relative US economic growth, however it does also almost always coincide with a weaker economy as funds flow from equities and risk assets to the relative safe haven of fixed income and money market funds. Rising interest rates are also very often a precursor to a recession, although lag can vary from a couple of quarters to over a year.

The Conference Board LEI (leading indicators index) declined in January 2016 after many months of growth.

All these numbers would suggest the beginning of a slowdown and a probability of US recession in 2016 higher than 60%. Q1 2016 GDP and Industrial production numbers, should they show accelerating economic weakness, would raise this probability to 70%. Industrial Production numbers for February (out on March 16th) will give more advanced warning: a YoY number worse than -1.0% would signal a very high probability of recession.

After the February equity rally the opportunity to open shorts with tight stop-loss levels and a significant downside is clear. The first positions should be opened this week and exposure increased if next weeks data points reinforce the hypothesis. As usual when trying to anticipate the market, stop-loss discipline is a must.

personalfinance,0% APR convenience check question,"I need to make a large purchase ($1775). I have the cash on hand to do so.

It says it's 0% APR (through August 2017), there is a fee of $10 or 3% whichever is greater, and that they will begin charging interested on the transaction date.

Here is a picture of the terms, so you can read exactly what I am: http://imgur.com/xQyKa2T http://imgur.com/xKbFBOS

I have always (probably incorrectly) assumed that APR and interest were interchangeable when it comes to credit cards, that they meant the same thing. However, from the sound of that box, it seems like they will just charge interest as normal on the purchase (per the bottom section). I read the back side and I didn't find it helpful in clarification, in fact the third question made it seem more confusing (when they say 'new purchases' do they mean purchases made with the checks or purchases made after having used the check, with my credit card?).

Can anyone ELI5 this for me? Am I going to have to pay interest on this purchase (or, what will the approximate total cost of this purchase be?)


I do not carry balances on my credit cards, but in this case the purchase I need to make is over 1/3 of all of my cash and I would rather pay it off over time (10 months is what I had in mind) just for the peace of mind of having it in my account. if I have to pay ~$60 (the 3% fee) to do so, I'm okay with that (small price to pay for mental health).

personalfinance,[Taxes] How do I calculating modified adjusted gross income for traditional IRA deduction limit,"Hi, pf. 


I carefully researched and thought about traditional vs roth IRA and landed on a traditional, but some how missed that there is a tax deduction limit based on income and whether you have an employer sponsored retirement plan. So now I think I may need to switch from a traditional to a roth before filing my taxes.


1. going off [this chart](https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/2015-IRA-Deduction-Limits-Effect-of-Modified-AGI-on-Deduction-if-You-Are-Covered-by-a-Retirement-Plan-at-Work). I am filing single, federal exepmtions/allownces: 2.

2. I assume my 401k counts as an employer sponsored retirement plan, because it definitely is. I partake.

3. My gross pay is above the deduction limit entirely, my ""reported w-2 wages"" are within the partial deduction limit (but just barely).

4. I have no other income, capital gains or anything like that. All my investments are in my traditional 401k or IRA, for now. So what I see on my w2 is all there is.


So the question is how can I tell if I am above the partial deduciton limit based on my w2? Had trouble finding decent calculators or articles that were dumbed down enough for my layman tax terms understanding. I figure if I am above the deduction limit entirely I should just go ahead and convert my traditional to Roth and be done with it.

personalfinance,"I'm graduating in May and have &lt;$30k in debt, need feedback on my repayment strategy.","Hey all, 

I'm graduating in May, and after about a year and a half of being on the fence, I've decided to spend a year as an ESL (english as a second language) teacher in South Korea. I'm doing this largely for myself before I jump into the real job market, but I also think it will be a chance for me to focus big on my student loans. 

I expect to make ~$1800-2000/mo after taxes while I'm over their, with living expenses being covered by schools. I want to pay $1000 a month towards student loans, and save half of the remaining, leaving me $4-500 a month to live over there. My goal is to completely pay off a $6500 private loan that has a variable interest rate, and then start on my federal loan, that's $22,000. I'd probably make the minimum payment on my federal loans, and allocate the rest of the $1000 to the private loan until it's paid off. 

I'm curious what /r/personalfinance thinks, the prospect of returning to the U.S. with $12k less in loans is enticing. Especially since I'd probably only be eligible for entry-level jobs on return and the lower loan cost will make minimum payments easier (I'm looking to move to higher COL areas after my time abroad).

Problems I've considered:

1) Not having enough money to live abroad.

If this is any issue, I'll just decrease my repayments slightly. My biggest focus is to get rid of the private loan.

2) Only being able to save up ~$5,000 while abroad.

This could be an issue, because I will need to relocate once I'm back in the states. (I could stay with my Dad for a few weeks, and probably will, but there are absolutely no jobs  other than minimum wage in the area, and I don't have a room there, and sleeping on a couch with no privacy doesn't help your mental health much).",finance,1457442422

She is currently in her final semester of university and has managed to take out only federal loans up until this point. She has ~38k in federal loans. She has done a solid job (imo) of staying away from bad decisions, although she has ~4k in CC debt (I know). She needs about 4-5k in order to pay her monthly living expenses for the next 5 months until graduation. I frequent this sub often and I'm a Finance undergrad so I have a few opinions on what would be best, but I would love to hear from this sub. She has exhausted her federal loan options for this year, so it would seem that her only remaining option for the 4-5k would be a private loan. If so, what is the best lender option for her?

A few more questions: I have two ideas for her CC debt. First would be to apply for the [Chase Slate](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/slate.aspx) and transfer the maximum possible balance from her other card to the Slate, that way she will pay 0% on it for 15 months. The second would be to attempt to take out 9k in the private loan (with hopefully a decent rate) and use 5k for her living expenses while the other 4k is used immediately to pay her CC debt. Not an ideal option but at least she would be trading 23% APR for something in the ballpark of 10% APR.

Finally, if you have any advice on how to make her student loan debt more manageable considering she'll have 43-47k of it by the time she graduates, please include the info as well. I know she can file for IBR on the federal loans etc., and maybe refinancing is a good idea as well; I don't know how loan amounts and rates but I will ask her ASAP.

However, I am not able to get any federal-aid at all until I pay back the previous school. 

Is there any companies out there that would help in my situation with a differed loan? Kind of like a student loan(though I'm not eligible as stated) so something I could pay back after graduating? I have decent credit for my age, in the 700s, but would need about $5000.

personalfinance,"Please Help, SO has ~40k in debt","This is not for myself, but for my SO. She is currently in her final semester of university and has managed to take out only federal loans up until this point. She has ~38k in federal loans. She has done a solid job (imo) of staying away from bad decisions, although she has ~4k in CC debt (I know). She needs about 4-5k in order to pay her living expenses for the next 5 months until graduation. I frequent this sub often and I'm a Finance undergrad so I have a few opinions on what would be best, but I would love to hear from this sub. She has exhausted her federal loan options for this year, so it would seem that her only remaining option for the 4-5k would be a private loan. If so, what is the best lender option for her?

A few more questions: I have two ideas for her CC debt. First would be to apply for the Chase Slate and transfer the maximum possible balance from her other card to the Slate, that way she will pay 0% on it for 15 months. The second would be to attempt to take out 9k in the private loan (with hopefully a decent rate) and use 5k for her living expenses while the other 4k is used immediately to pay her CC debt. Not an ideal option but at least she would be trading 23% APR for something in the ballpark of 10% APR.

Finally, if you have any advice on how to make her student loan debt more manageable considering she'll have 43-47k of it by the time she graduates, please include the info as well. I know she can file for IBR on the federal loans etc., and maybe refinancing is a good idea as well; I don't know loan amounts and rates but I will ask her ASAP.

personalfinance,[planning] going to law school. Spend assets or keep invested?,"Hi everyone.

I'm 24 yo and will be attending law school this August. I currently have about $120,000 in an investment account - $30k is in my IRA (90% stocks, 10% bonds, some international -- vanguard retire 2055 fund) and the rest is in my general investment (80% stock, 20% bonds, some international -- vanguard Lifestrategy growth fund). I also have a bit of money in a Federal pension fund (which I don't want to withdraw) and a bit in the Federal TSP (equivalent to a 401K). No other major assets. Some $6000 or so in my savings account.

Currently I am investing only $100/2 weeks in my IRA, about $100/2 weeks in my general investment, and then I am putting about $150/week into my savings, in anticipation of moving expenses/books/loan fees/etc associated with starting school.
ETA: Also putting 5% of take-home into Federal TSP. All of this can be used for education. I reduced my IRA/TSP contributions due to wanting to put extra money into savings.

So here's the question. Law school is going to be farking expensive. If I were to do all loans and not pay off compounding interest I would probably end up with about $320,000 in debt. In your opinion, is it a better idea to spend my assets down very low (say, leaving $10,000 in a savings account) or to just do loans the whole way? Loans will be about 7% interest. Obviously returns on my investments will track the market pretty well. 

Currently I'm thinking that it's a better idea to do mostly loans. I'm thinking that I will pay off interest as it accrues (as long as the market isn't totally f---ed up) but let everything else just settle. 

Other considerations:

1) The school I will be attending has a generous program in which if you don't make much money when you graduate (I expect to be going into government work) they pay your loans for you. So letting interest accrue might even be a _good_ idea!

2) I think I'll feel better about myself with some money in the bank. *shrugs*

I'm pretty new here. A few minutes ago, to be exact lol. I'm 23 years old, Female, and trying hard to be money smart. Help me become one.

So here's my current financial state: I am employed at a job where I earn $670 per month. I have no debt whatsoever. As for my daily living allowance, I pay almost nothing as I have free housing, my own car and driver, free phone plan, and free food in my work. I love love love my job and if it is my choice, I would stay in this job as long as I can. The person I replaced filed her own resignation and according to my boss, I am doing significantly better.

Anyhow, back at home I am supporting my sister's study costing me $45 per month and my parents and other siblings costing me $200 per month. This is voluntary and my sister is graduating this March so hooray for a $45 reduction to my expenses!

Because of this blessing, I am actively saving up, as in considering half of my salary ($337) as already lost and never to be recovered in my savings account. Sometimes, I get to be lucky and save a little more. 

I have also applied for a trusted investment company here in our country that offers an easy investment program where I can invest in the stock market for as low as $112. I will continue this as this has been a part of my plan since I've learned of the stock market.

But my question is should I buy a 200 sq. mtr. residential land offered to me by the subdivision developer at $8000? This is payable via home loan, but I'm afraid of the soaring interest rates. For 30 years, there's a 10% interest. For 3 years, interest is at 6.8%. 30 with 10% interest will mean a $56 reduction to my monthly salary. However, they said that whatever amount I pay over my reduction will be added to my principal amount. That will mean that I can either lessen my reduction or my years of payment anytime I pay additional to my principal. The land is located 3 kms. away from the international airport being built in our province. The construction will be done in early 2018. Meaning, the land's value will definitely appreciate in time.

To be honest, I am not sure what I will do with the land. I will either build my future home there (location is perf!) or sell it when the airport is done at a much much higher price. What do you think? Any advice is welcome. Thank you so much.",finance,1457513745

Family of 3 (me, my husband, and our infant)

I am a full-time graduate student, expected to finish my doctorate in the next year. My husband works part time, as we can‚Äôt afford outside childcare and have to coordinate our schedules. Combined we bring in ~$2,000.00 a month. Rent is low for our area, $800. We have no car payments, but (unsurprisingly) just having cell phones, internet, and paying for food and gas eats up our entire paychecks. We have very meager savings of ~$2,000 currently.

I have one credit card, with a $3,000 balance and 19% interest rate. I have been paying more than the minimums ($150-200 each month) to slowly pay this down. I have not put any charges on this card in two years.

I have a staggering amount of student loan debt, around $160,000. This is almost entirely in federal loans, not yet consolidated because I‚Äôm still in school, so various interest rates around 6-7%. I am hoping that with my career plans, I will eventually be able to use Public Service Loan Forgiveness for part of this.

I have one private student loan for $5,000, with a variable interest rate of 4.5%. 


**Here is my question:**

I can take out extra in federal PLUS loans with a 6.8% interest rate, and use this to pay off my credit card once and for all. This would seem to me to be the prudent move, as it would be a relatively small addition to my total student loan burden while substantially lowering my interest rate for the debt. 

Additionally, I am trying to figure out if it is worthwhile to use federal PLUS loan money to pay off my private student loan. Though the private loan interest rate is low, it is not eligible for the various federal loan repayment plans. 

So **question 1**: does it make financial sense to use student loan money to pay off my credit card debt?

And **followup question 2**: should I also use it to pay off my private loan debt?

* Electricity: Varies, generally $70-$80 per month
* Cable/Internet: $63/month
* Car Insurance (I'm a very new driver): $95/month (thankfully the car itself was free from my parents, so no payments there)
* Student Loan Payment: $225/month (this is a little more than the requirement of $209/month)

**Amount Remaining (for food, fun, saving, etc.):** $994


Alright, here are my questions:

1) The mutual fund (~$1,200) is from Columbia Threadneedle. It's a ""Global Opportunity Dividend Fund."" It was funded when I was probably 10 or 11 with gifts from some family members. My family doesn't know a lot about investing, and I recognize this fund likely isn't doing me many favors. It has grown, but not by a lot. I have a few ideas of what I can do with it:

* Cash it out and set up an emergency fund (high yield savings account)
* Cash it out and pay off credit card debt, then put remainder into student loan debt
* Cash it out and put it into a better fund (currently thinking Vanguard Index Fund, or something on Betterment)
* Something else?

2) How aggressively should I be paying down my student loan? I'm currently on a ""graduated"" repayment plan, so my monthly payments will be a bit over $200 then increase every few years, until they're a bit over $400. The alternative is to be on a steady repayment plan, which would make my payments around $300 consistently throughout the life of the loan. 

* Should I change plans?
* Should I pay more than I am paying?

3) Is there anything else I can be doing? I use YNAB fairly strictly for budgeting. I lapse sometimes, but I build in some ""stuff I forgot to budget for"" money to cover occasional lapses in judgment/evenings of fun. I check Credit Karma religiously and have a very good score (currently 757, but will likely dip down a bit soon because I just got a new card to take advantage of an airline mile offer). Is there anything I'm missing?

I'm wondering which card balances I should pay off first.  Some say highest interest rate, some say lowest balance.

I don't think I want to pay down my car loan, since it won't affect my monthly payments and I have a good interest rate.  I'd rather pay off the cards, but I included it anyhow.

Now what?,"I purchased a Condo with an ARM 10 years ago, but have never been able to refinance or sell because until now my LTV has been above 100%(for several years the LTV was &gt;200%) and it was a non-conforming loan. After having paid exorbitant rates for the last 8 year and paying down the loan as fast as possible I finally have the opportunity to do something, but I don't know what to do.

The loan terms:


40 year ammortization, balloon payment at 30 years

6.54% interest (a few years ago it was 9.54%)

adjusts every 6 months.

$63,217.03 remaining balance.

$445.27/month minimum payment

HOA Fees: $187.50/month


I receive:$700/month rent.


Options that I see:

1. Continue renting it out and paying down mortgage as fast as possible (at least $1050/month additional principle payment)  (Every extra principle payment seems like a guaranteed 6.54% ROI vs putting the extra money into the stock market and NOT putting it into my mortgage)

2. Sell it. I would lock in my losses and I'm not sure what would happen to my taxes considering that even with depreciation I would be selling at a $70k loss and I wouldn't get any cash from the sale. However, I would be able to put a solid $1000 extra into stocks/bonds per month and get whatever return I can there.

3. Refinance. I could pay it off just far enough to get an 80% LTV conforming loan. Though this may be difficult because the unit above mine sold 4 months ago for 61.5k and last time I checked with a bank they said that it was hard to get loans for under 50k. Interest rates are much lower now and could possibly save me $1200/year.

Age: 25

Salary: $46,000 - Clear $572/wk after 12% RRSP+taxes

Side job: ~ $5k a year, usually my fun money/paying down debt, inconsistently paid.

Yearly Raise: 2.5% minimum ~ $1500/yr More expected

In 2 years I'll receive a P.Eng which should put me at $70k (Quoted during job offer) (~$887/wk after 18% RRSP + taxes) If that really doesn't work out as a P.Eng getting a new job at this salary should be fine in my area.


$14k Car loan, $140/biwkly - 6.7%

$13.5k Student Debt - 4.2% $130/mnth

$4.5k Line of Credit (unsecured) 6.2% ~33$/mnth

Visa:$0, $2500 limit 13% (pay for things pay it off right away)

RRSP: $1500 with about $400/month put into it

Total bills accumulate to about $322/wk so $250 for food/fun/debt

Condo's in my area are minimum $150k, Most I would want are $190-$215k. Would be ideal to buy one to live in for 5 years than rent, but with a 5% down payment (Home buyers RSP program) I wouldn't break even on the rent until living in it for 9-10 years. Condo Fees Avg $350/mnth.

Houses from $250-300k for something that doesn't require $10-20K upgrades. I would essentially need to continue renting for about 4 years to afford the 5% down payment on this. Seems like a significant amount of time that something smaller first would be better. 

I can get a really nice mobile home for $100k, (Large lot, 3bdrm/double bathroom ~1100sqft) but the ones around $50-75k would do me just fine. (2 bdrm, dishwasher, hardwood floors ~900sqft).

So with the Trailer it would add about 15 minutes commute time for me and put me on the outskirts (Downtown/socializing becomes a lot more expensive and time consuming)  Most have a grocery store within a 5 minute drive. If I am going to choose this route my plan would be to try and get an RRSP Loan (1.5% interest with Tangerine) for about $5000-$8000 (Yearly max is 18% income) Use the First time home buys to put that and cash to make the 20% mark. This would let exempt me from loan insurance and give me a better interest rate (As I understand it) and save me monthly.  So I would only need to save up about $5000 for the rest and purchasing fees. So if in 8 mnths I can save up $5k ($100/wk + Second job money) without compromising my RRSP contribution I'd be looking at a $5000 RRSP loan, decrease my RRSP to 4% (Company matches up to 4%) I would be already near max with the $5000 and the extra 8% would make my weekly income closer to $633/wk.


I could then pay about the same in rent ($600/mnth) and have about $30-40k built in 5 years. This would put me at a good spot to switch to a condo or home. 


Is there anything I'm missing with these numbers? Is there a better way to do this? Anyone have experience buying/selling their mobile home? I know most young professionals aren't buying homes because well the ratio of pay/market is stupid in Nova Scotia.  (20-30 age group makes ~ $35-40k) 


Any advise is welcomed.


TL:DR - Tell a story of you or someone you know buying a trailer home.

personalfinance,Paying off car vs. student loan while still a student,"Hey PF,

I need some advice on which of my loans to pay off first. I'm pretty familiar with the idea that paying off the loan with the highest interest rate first generally makes the most sense, but I'm not sure if it as relevant in my situation. I'm in my third year at a university and have one more year before graduation. I currently have a car loan with a remaining balance of $9,440 at 2.9%. Additionally, I have a private student loan with a current balance of $6,640 at 8.7% (I also have federal student loans, but with lower/no interest rates). The private student loan has a higher interest rate, but I won't be required to make payments on it for another ~2 years or so due to a grace period after graduation (I can make payments at any time without penalty, though). My current plan is to pay off my car before I graduate, and then not have to worry about making car payments after graduation. My minimum car payment is $197 a month, but I currently put as much as $500-$1000 month towards it. This will result in paying off the car rather quickly.

The main reason I'd like to pay off the car first is because I owe money on it at the moment, whereas I won't be making payments on my student loans for another couple of years (unless I throw additional income at them before graduation, which is possible). I know the student loan will accrue more interest.

Would it be worthwhile (or legal) to use money from my line of credit and put it into the employee investment program?

Look at it this way : no mining gear to own, no knowledge in mining necessary, all help to the network, isn't that better then calling all the miners greedy ?!?

personalfinance,"Degree, Job, Car, getting married. How am I doing?","Good Morning everyone! I really enjoy reading this subreddit, and this is my first post here! (Second All time!) A lot in my life changed recently, and will continue to do so! Read on, and tell me how I'm doing! I would love any advice, criticism, or disdain you have for my predicament/decisions!


I am a 23 year old male, and recently graduated college with a Bachelor in December. 

Currently my loans are:
Federal Direct: ~$30,300
(5 subsidized, 4 unsubsidized)
~ $1400 of that is interest. Since I have been in school I have not paid anything towards these loans so that's where the interest is from.

Private school loans (The evil SallieMae!)
3 loans = ~$21000 @ 2.5%
1 loan =~6300 @ 7.25% (The first three my father cosigned with me, and I should have had him do that with this last one, but I had enough credit that I was able to sign by myself. I was very excited by the fact that I was able to do something on my own and didn't realize there would be a higher rate. completely my fault for not paying complete attention.)

I started my first job out of college working for my local county government. I love it and it pays ok (lower than I'd like, plenty to support me). I am half way through my probationary period and was told that no one has been let go due to the economy in the ~15 years the director has been here. 

because I work in local government I am eligible for this: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service 
Public service loan forgiveness, which effects my Federal Direct loans. 

Basically I can set my direct loans to income based repayment, pay them for 10 years, and have everything else forgiven (without having to pay tax on forgiven loan amounts)
Before IDR i would be paying 317 per month, after would be 183. Assuming (falsely) that I stayed at the same pay for 10 years, I would end up paying 21960 at which point the remainder of my loans would be forgiven, saving me ~10k overall. 

At my job I bring home ~2200 per month after tax/benefits/pension/etc

Along with the new job came a desire for a car that wasn't 15 years old. the previous car was 25 years old. I had gotten tired of being sick to my stomach worrying about the cars I had breaking down, and since I had started a new full time job I wanted to have a reliable vehicle that wouldn't make my sick with stress/ I wanted to be able to show up to work on time every day. So I went car searching.

I ended my search with a nice base model 2014 hyundai with 45,000 for 14680 (the car was 12500) out the door of the dealer. I turned down all the special packages they offered (aside from the 850 ""Oh we shined the car up and picked the hairs out with tweesers"" crap they ""Do to every car for all our customers"").

I went through a local credit union and received a 72 month loan at 2.89% for $223 per month. This comes out to 223x72= $16056 after 6 years. = ~1400 in interest.
Now I realize that I could have gone with an older/higher mileage/ smaller/whatever car, but I like this one and I am OK paying that interest. (Now in the future, that I have a nicer newer car that should last me longer than my old beaters, I plan on buying cash going forward.)

I have 2 credit cards, Discover IT(1.5 years), and amazon store card(6 months) and have always paid them off month to month. I usually use discover for gas, as well as car insurance. (ive also been an authorized user on my parents card for 8+ years, which is probably why my credit score is ~725-750 (it dropped with the car loan)

I am getting married soon!, (Can't wait!) and my Fiance has similar debt to me (slightly more I think, on the school debt side) and a 10k personal car loan from her grandmother, of which she pays 200 a month.
We are very grateful of her parents, who gave us a set amount for the wedding, and we've been able to get everything, including the honeymoon (Jamaica!!) into that budget, which means all our current savings + gifts from the wedding is ours to keep!

She is planning on going back to grad school in the fall and we want to pay everything out of pocket to save money. While feasible, this will bring our discretionary income pretty close to 0. (but she plans on a new/better paying job, and I purposefully overestimated our monthly costs (food/gas/etc to give us some wiggle room))



The way that I have come to view personal finance (and I would love correction on this) breaks down in this order (what to pay first):

High interest Debt (I.E. Credit Cards) -I have no debt here (neither does she)

Emergency Fund - (currently I have 1k, she has 4k. I would like somewhere between 15k-20k)

School Loans/Car loans/IRA/401K - I really don't know how I feel about these. Should I max out an IRA, or focus on kicking down the school loans, the car loans?. I definitely cant do both.

Vacations/other.




I think where I am is pretty well off in terms of stability and manageability. I am living much closer to my means than I'd like (or I will be once the loan payments kick in) and I'm sure there are many opinions as to how to go about the debt/retirement goals that I have.

Basically, This:

Should I max out my IRA and pay minimums on car and school loans? 

Should I wait on the IRA until my loans are gone? - I would avalanche loans, as I have 1 higher interest loan that is not the biggest (snowball the same interest rate loans)

Should I stop using cards entirely? (I am sure that I buy things I don't need because of them, but I have NEVER been charged interest on a card before)





Before we are married, and after, I plan on having a weekly/monthly budget fully laid out with my wife. I use mint/credit karma/acorns and some others. I'd say we are both pretty frugal. We have already sat down, looked at out monthly spending and know that we are going to be able to cover all of our expenses, but will have less than 1k per month in discretionary income.

I'd just like to know everyone's opinions on how I'm doing, what I've done wrong, and where I can improve. Thanks, you guys are awesome!!",finance,1457548329
personalfinance,Transfer balance or continue paying interest?,"So, a few challenging life situations and some not so great decisions landed me with a huge amount of credit card debt. In 2014, I was approved for an 18-month no-interest credit card with a credit line of $10k, and to get away from the 24% interest rate I was paying on my three other cards, I consolidated everything onto the new card. Things didn't exactly turn around though, and by October of last year, I had almost $10k on that card. Thanks to a Christmas bonus and some tax refund money, I've been able to pay that down to slightly over $2100, but the 18-months no interest period is over, so I'm now getting hit with the 13.24% interest rate. 

One of my old credit cards is offering me 12 months interest free on balance transfers. I know that I could pay that amount off before the 12 months expired, but having paid down almost all of this debt, I've been able to raise my credit rating significantly, and I don't want to mess that up at all. The card I would transfer to has $3,500 in available credit, so transferring the $2100 onto there would take up 62% of the available amount and possibly ding my credit rating for having too high of a debt to available credit ratio.

I turned to the darkside when it comes to my finances and I could really use your help!

**TL;DR - $125K in debt.. Help!**

My family was living the American Dream up until 4 years ago ... $85K/ income, house, 2 cars, maxed out credit cards with perfect credit and Starbucks triple foam lattes every day. 


In 2012, the Death Star went fully operational and sent us into a world of hurt.  After returning from Iraq as a reservist, I decided to go back to school to upgrade my skills. We scraped by, living month to month and pay check to check, tapping out our savings and maxxing out student loans to make ends meet. Our income went from $85K to $45K almost overnight. We went on public assistance and dealt with a very public school accident involving one of our kids.  My wife saw a major reduction in hours at work following the accident- things got ugly fast.  


Every time things seem to get better, they actually get worse. 


In 2013, we lost our only vehicle in a car accident in July, my wife lost her job (not enough clients) and I was laid off from my first decent paying job in almost 2 years after 5 months right before Christmas.  That was the worst, because we had a newborn and had no heat in our home (except for 2 small space heaters) the entire winter.


I found a job two months later that paid almost 20K more a year then my previous job, 1100 miles away.  We moved and thought we were going to stay awhile; boy I was wrong, within 11 months my job disappeared like Obi Wan on the Death Star and I was left searching for answers.  Within 4 months our emergency fund vanished.  We lost our house (short sale) after our tenants trashed the place when they moved out.  


Eventually I found another job 1600 miles away.  The pay is decent ($64K after a recent raise) but my wife still isn‚Äôt working because she has to cater to our child who was injured school and therapy schedule (8 -1 school day 3 days a week and up to 3 therapy appointments a week). We also have a toddler to care for. Day Care is EXPENSIVE!  Oh and I‚Äôm on the road 4 days a week, so I‚Äôm never home. 



**Which leads me here‚Ä¶‚Ä¶$86K in Debt with a FICO score of 599!**



I just found out my wife defaulted on $20K federal student loan debt and our taxes have been garnished.  I have over $9000 in debt from the Military Star Card (The most evil credit card in history) which is in default, and over $45K in student loans in deferment and working on getting them on an income based payment schedule.  My head hurts thinking about how to stupid I‚Äôve been the last few years.  

I'm attempting to negotiate with our creditors. My credit union has offered to cut our car payment by $90 with a 16 month extension and allow us to miss this month's payment ($557) to take care some of our smaller amounts in collections... mostly related to the auto accident.

Nelnet has offered a repayment plan of $50 or a lump sum payment of $2500 for my wife's student loan, however the other company servicing her debt isn't budging on what she owes or how much they want for payment, currently $150. My military Star card credit account wants a payment of at least $2000 before they will even entertain the possibility of a payment plan..

Help!

personalfinance,Salary negotiation help,"Hi PF, this is my first time posting. I recently received my first post-college job offer for what is essentially my ideal job. It is for a research associate position at the Federal Reserve. The annual salary was actually higher than I was expecting, and it also includes a sign-on bonus.

This is my first ever job offer, and I know that you're supposed to negotiate the offer if you can. However, I am unsure if you can negotiate for a salary from the federal reserve since it is a quasi-governmental institution. Also I am unsure how much room for negotiation there is for an entry-level position.

I would definitely like to ask for a little more considering that the position is located in an expensive city (and I would just be welcome to a higher salary in general). But I was also blown away by their first offer. 

I have about a week to get back to them, and I'm looking for salary negotiation advice- how to start negotiations, what is a reasonable amount more to ask for, etc. Also, if anyone has experience working for the Fed, or a similar governmental institution, please let me know if salary negotiations work differently.

personalfinance,What are the flaws in this car loan plan?,"I received a bonus of $5,000 which I told my employer to put completely into my 401(k) to defer paying taxes.  I will then take a loan from my 401(k) in the amount of $5,000 at an interest rate of 4.5%.  I will use the $5,000 loan to buy a car.  This way, the interest on the loan repayment will be paid to myself, rather than a dealership/bank.  The alternative would be to take out a loan through the dealership/bank to buy the car and then the interest will be going to the bank rather than myself.  If I took the $5,000 bonus in cash rather than deferring it then I would need to pay taxes on the $5,000.  At the same time I will lower my deferral amount so the combined loan repayment and new lower deferral amount are equal to my original deferral amount.  This will make it so my net paycheck amount is the same. 
I understand that if I terminate my employment, then the principal on the loan will become immediately due.  Other than this, what flaws are there in this plan?",finance,1457553725

Currently I've got ~215k in federal student loans, and an additional 80k in private undergrad loans, with another 7k in credit card debt from the past 2 years for living expenses/reapplying/interview travel costs. My deferment eligibility is expired for my undergrad loans, so I either have to pay or eventually go into default, with  a monthly payment of $913. I'm hoping to a match with a family med program, but if I don't my backup plan is to begin a biomedical Ph.D program this summer. I'll be receiving a stipend of $19,500/yr, which won't cover living expenses plus loan payments, $1100k/month.  I can take out additional GradPlus loans once I start the doctoral program, so that I can make payments on the private loans &amp; CC debt.

personalfinance,(US - OR) Wife hired as consultant. How do we handle bank accounts and taxes? Anything else we should be aware of?,"My wife just got a job as a consultant for a local company. This is her first consultant job and I'm searching for resources what we need to do financially. She will be paid once a month.

1) We will be opening a new account for her at my credit union. Do we keep her consultant banking separate from her personal banking? I don't believe this will be necessary since she's not a contractor operating under her own company but I just want to make sure.

2) There's no retirement plan so I will be setting her up with a savings account and transfer 2% monthly for now. Once we get a better picture of her monthly income, we'll adjust for a higher rate.

3) Taxes. Her job informed her that they will not be deducting federal and state income taxes (we're in Oregon). Her trainer advised her to save 10% of her monthly income for taxes; a friend advised her to save 20%. Our filing status will be married and filing jointly. We are not sure what the gross pay is as her position is hourly so I am having a hard time figuring out which tax bracket we'll be in. Is there a general number we should be aiming for? A percentage of the monthly gross or a percentage of her annual gross (which we still don't know). I figure 20% wouldn't hurt; if we saved more than is needed, at least we have more money in savings for our emergency fund.

4) A combination of #2 and #3 - should we keep her retirement savings separate from her tax payment savings? Would it all depend on the savings account, as long as we're above the minimum limit?

5) Since I do our taxes, I'm aware that we can claim deductibles for purchases that was required by, for her new job. She will be working from home after she completes her training (and I work from home as well, we will have separate offices). We'll save the receipts for the things we are buying for her new job. A new desk, a new phone, some computer software required by her job, clothes/shoes. Is there anything we should be aware of in regards to these deductions?

The rest of her income will be used to pay down our debt more aggressively.

I just want to make sure we got our bases covered. Appreciate your advice!",finance,1457559501

personalfinance,Raise my Credit Score Safely.,"Hello, I'm looking for good advice regarding my credit score that has dropped terribly low (554 -Credit Karma) Details listed on the site were that I was on time for 95% of all payments, and there were three separate collections.  The primary cause of this was a divorce after being abandoned in 2013.  One year later, in September of 2014 I was informed by social security that I was divorced and didn't know it (October 2014).  
I took several credit hits due to this, my finances plummeted and I used up all my savings ""making it.""  My question first rests on how I can begin to rebuilt this score.  So far, I've reestablished a bank account and that is about it. I work primarily as a substitute teacher for local area schools and I am a full-time college student who qualifies for Federal Pell Grants.  Another noteworthy consideration is that I live with a partner who is willing to help me and has a great credit score (795) but doesn't know quite where to begin considering the complexity of this situation.  
I've been told I could take out a bank loan (haven't checked but it seems unlikely.) I've been told to just find a credit card that will allow people with no credit or bad credit to apply.  Not sure about either of those.  
One major hit on my credit score was from an apartment complex I left (had my husband's military orders to do so) but they still reported it to the credit agency.  All of these financial hits occurred in 2014.  I feel like I'm dragging my feet.  I don't have family who has positive financial experience in order to dish out some honest, useful advice.

It was convenient because the bank was right across my school. I had no problems in the beginning but a couple months later I started experiencing issues with the bank. I was locked out of my online banking &amp; I knew the username and password but it would not let me log on, I went to the bank to fix it and all they ever did was give me a new password but every time i went home to enter the new password, i would still be locked up. I was so fed up i gave up trying to fix it. Later on, I got a new job working at a retail company, for my job i set up direct deposit. A week before I started the job, I put up to 200$ in my checking account to use for the week, knowing I had 200$ in my checking account, I was a frugal spender. I only got things that I needed &amp; they were mostly lunch when I was on break time. Every time I spent, I calculated how much I had left. So a month after doing this, I get a letter in the mail saying I have -400$ in my checking account from overdraft fees (I stopped buying things when I knew I didn't have enough) I went to the bank to figure out why I had overdraft fees up to 400$ and all they told me was I had to pay it off. I checked my bank statements &amp; nothing was adding up. The teller who was helping me thought I was stupid because I'm young. [19F] I was told him ""if the bank has given me overdraft fees over -400$ why couldn't they take the money from my savings account?"" I had over 800$ worth in my savings account. Basically they made this whole process frustrating. I payed off all the fees &amp; they closed the account. I have no idea why, 10 months later I go back to the bank (only because I wanted to start developing my life with this bank) I ask them if i can open a checking account &amp; the teller rudely tells me ""no"" I asked ""why"" he responds with ""The bank doesn't need to give an explanation as to why they won't give you a checking account"".

personalfinance,Best strategy for Fulltime RV purchase,"My wife and I are currently nomads and she has been taking travelling RN positions for the past 6 months or so. She works and I stay home with our son. Currently we pay roughly $12-1300 per month to stay in furnished homes. We want to buy an 5th wheel RV to take with us to cut the cost down for housing. 

We both have good credit history but since we have pretty high credit card utilization we aren't sure which path to take.

She's got a job in Indianapolis lined up that would allow us to save enough money to pay our credit cards down to less than 20% utilization in 13 weeks about $12,000.

So my question is: would it be better to save our money and then use that plus our savings to pay down CC's and restore our credit scores to then find some financing for the roughly $17,000 we want to spend on an RV or is it best to hold our CC debt and pay it with the after we outright buy the RV? 

We'd have no rent payments at this point besides the roughly $5-600 renting a camp ground would cost. Our thoughts are then that the $600 could go towards doubling the minimum payments or tackling one card at a time based on interest rates. Each has roughly $7000. 

We would have near zero other debts besides our $300 car payment at that point and don't really plan on seeking other credit for a while.

investing,"ECB pulls out all the stops, cuts rates and expands QE","The European Central Bank (ECB) delivered a surprise package of measures to kickstart Europe's economy on Thursday, cutting its main interest rates and expanding its massive bond-buying program.

The bank's president, Mario Draghi, said the outlook for economic growth in the euro zone had been revised slightly down ‚Äî mainly reflecting the weakened outlook for the world economy ‚Äî but added that he did not anticipate needing to reduce rates further.

Draghi's comments sent the euro bouncing back off its session lows and yields on US Treasurys rising.

The euro zone's 19 countries are now seen posting average growth of 1.4 percent in 2016, rather than the 1.7 percent forecast in December.

HICP inflation in the euro zone is now seen averaging 0.1 percent in 2016.

personalfinance,Question regarding state tax returns,"So this year I decided I would use a company to do my taxes (being busy/lazy/whatever you want to call it).

After about 13 days after submitting my taxes (and paying a fee of $139.00 for having my taxes done) I received a call to come in and pick up my federal tax return. I showed up and got the check and this is where I became confused. The woman told me that there was a problem with my state returns. According to her the entire state of Georgia's state returns are in the middle of a crisis and I will need to wait until 30 days after I submitted my paperwork to the company (Feb. 18) to even begin the process of getting my state return. The instructions given to me were after the 30 days to go onto gtc.dor.ga.gov or call 18774236711 and go from there.
My question is this : Did they mess up my returns? Should I just silently follow these instructions or what? Sorry if this is an obvious answer, I am only 25 and up until now I've been stationed OCONUS with the US Army and have always had my parents do them for me. Thanks guys.",finance,1457624930
personalfinance,"We have volatile jobs, should we prioritize the mortgage or our savings?","Hey PF,

at the moment we're doing decently with our finances. The only debt we have is our mortgage, we have little over 100 000‚Ç¨ left and the interest rate is ~1% (not fixed, obviously. The rates are expected to stay very low for at least a year or two in the EU area). Our household income annually is 80 000‚Ç¨ pre-tax and our monthly take home is 4 200‚Ç¨. We have 25 000‚Ç¨ saved in long term savings and we're adding ~800‚Ç¨ to it every month. We also have separate savings for our rainy day funds and we've been paying an extra 2000‚Ç¨ - 3000‚Ç¨ towards the principle every year. We've been budgeting actively using YNAB for the past two years and at this point the idea of giving it up feels very weird. :) So the budgeting will go on.

The thing is that our jobs are not exactly secure. I work in IT for a large company that has laid off hundreds within the past two years, and we're expecting more layoffs this year. On top of that the IT jobs are becoming scarce in our area. My wife works in social field in a project which has funding for two more years but  her position is likely to be terminated after the current funding ends. So, how do we prepare for the seemingly inevitable situation where at least one of us is going to lose a job in the near future? Should we save less and throw more money towards the mortgage now that the interest rate is so low, or should we keep on saving?  The area we live in has depreciated and will probably keep on going down, but at least for now we're not upside down with the house. We won't be able to relocate until my wife's project ends, and we're hoping we don't even need to as we have family and friends here. Houses move really slow here so selling might take a long time, but we haven't ruled selling and/or relocating completely out.

personalfinance,What debt should I attack first now that I'm finally making more money?,"Hi everyone! Long time lurker here and I need some advice. I received a small but very helpful salary raise last week of 5k just six months after receiving an additional 5k bump. On top of that I have been given some freelance extra hours on top of my salary potentially making an additional 10k a year if I can find time each week to work an additional 10 hours on top of my 40. Now that I'm making more money I don't know where to start putting it. My goal is to start saving for a house but I also just killed my emergency fund. I'm currently rocking a savings account with about $250 after some untimely dental work this past month.

I owe just about $13250 over 4 student loans (All Federal that I have paid down from 30k in just over 5 years with some help from family and a lucky casino trip).

The breakdown looks roughly like this: 
2950 at 5.7%
5300 at 6.5%
3500 at 5.3%
1500 at 6.5%

I pay $230 per month for all 4 which does little damage to the principle balance. 

On top of this I have a car payment each month that's down to $8000 at .9%. I have 2 years left to pay on that but the interest is only about $6 a month so I haven't paid anything extra on that yet. Should I? I also have 1 credit card with a balance of about $2100 left to pay after previously mentioned dental incident cleaned me out.

After rent, car insurance, gas, food, weekend fun, netflix, etc - I have about $1200 left to save or use to pay something off.

I don't know what to attack first! How much do I put into savings each month? Every time I get paid I panic a little because I have no idea where to put it and I'm afraid I'll just go back to bad habits and spend it on useless things. Any suggestions?

I'm currently finishing up grad school, so my annual income is low. Last year I think I made about $5000, this year I have a paid summer internship, so I will be at about $15000. However, we are applying for a loan now, so I don't have W-2's for that summer internship yet, but I do have an offer letter.

I paid off my student loan debt except for $1000 (because I have a 3rd party scholarship I'm waiting to come in for that amount). I also co-signed with my mom on a car. I think the car payments are $450 a month. She pays for all the payments, so would that still appear as my debt? If so, my income to debt ratio is going to look very off.

I don't know my exact credit score right now, but I'm thinking it's about 734. My husband's is in the 760s. My loan provider considers ""excellent"" credit to be 740. I have googled around and saw that lenders typically look at the lower of the two credit scores. Does that mean we'll get the rates for only ""good"" credit since my credit score is 6 points under excellent?

I intend to speak with my loan provider about this, but she has been impossible to get a hold of this week. Their rates are phenomenal, so I definitely want to go through them, but it's very frustrating to try to contact them. Any advice would be appreciate, thanks! 

Edit- Talked to lender. We have a meeting set up for tomorrow and she's going to run my credit/look at my debts.

So most of the time I don't fall prey to these fucking scams, but I pressed one anyway. If you're a credit card junkie like me, I'm sure you have a few cards and even if you don't carry a balance you want the lowest interest rate and the highest credit limit possible.

Me:""Hello, is this Chase?"" (Dumbass I am)
Him:""Yes, this is Chase calling in regards to your visa card."" (He used the info I told him and lied)
Me:""Oh, ok.""
Him:""Would you be interested in lowering your interest down to 6%? Please note this isn't a balance transfer.
Me:""I never knew my Freedom Card interest could ever drop that low, I thought maybe like 15% or something!""

Me:""Sure. (I give random number starting with 5, it definitely wasn't a credit card number.)""

Bitcoin is going down the shitter and will become/is a settlement network instead of a p2p currency. 

As far as Ive read the founder of litecoin has said that litecoin wont scale on onchain either. So is that the future of this currency then? Are these kinds of decisions made by one person and then carved in stone?

Seems like a missed opportunity. Litecoin couldve been the currency that people would be flocking to, since BTC is destroying itself (refusing to scale on chain). 

EDIT: I think it would be very helpful if the dev(s) of litecoin would issue clear roadmaps for Litecoin so that people will know exactly where it stands with regard to scaling (in the event it is ever needed). Bitcoin had a major problem where they kept deferring decisions to the future and when the future arrived, no decisions were been reached due to conflicts and infighting. 

Edit2: Ok I looked through a recent AMA (https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/3z2ta1/ama_official_litecoin_developers_and_litecoin/) with Litecoin devs and I can see how they are much more open to scaling when it is needed and how litecoin is 4 x faster than bitcoin so blocksize isnt yet so important etc. So BTC problems, if they happen with litecoin will be quite some time away. I have also read that the founder is much more open to experimenting with the protocol as opposed to bitcoin where he doesnt want them to experiment. 

In a way his vision might be that bitcoin is a settlement network and litecoin is a micro-transaction network, which is fine by me. 

A clear roadmap by the devs of litecoin, would probably open the floodgates to people fed up with bitcoin, yet not interested in buying eth-fundraiser-coin.

My tuition is roughly 11k/semester this year so I'll assume around the same next semester (not including living expenses). I don't currently receive any scholarships/grants/etc because of my race/GPA/etc and  I also don't receive much financial aid from FAFSA (only unsubsidized loans) and I'm not willing to take private loans because of high interest rates. 

I have slightly less than 15k in my personal bank account right now and right now and I was planning on taking summer classes so I can graduate early/get a few minors under my belt but now I'm not so sure if I should still do that. I'm also unwilling to leave my current university because I really am quite fond of it here. My rent next semester will be around $400-450 a month depending on utilities and some other small factors etc. Some other random living expenses (food/gas/etc) will probably amount to another 100 a month. 

Basically, my $15 will only stretch about a semester (not including summer classes, which would amount to about 5k total, including rent). 

However, I plan on getting some decent paid internships the following summers which will help cover tuition for my junior and senior year. 

I'm not sure what I should be doing to avoid the least amount of debt and where I can go from here.  I'm just looking for a way to make it until next summer without stretching myself too thin and suffocating under loans.  

Also, is it worth filling out the FAFSA if I know I won't receive much, if anything at all?",finance,1457676554

personalfinance,Tax return amendment question.,"I recently filed my 2015 tax return. It was approved and I received my refund. The problem is I've had an extremely strange working year in which I held 3 jobs. I had forgotten I officially started the 2nd Job I held in Jan of 2015 and not 2014 and technically on paper was paid in Jan 2015 by the first. I also moved apartments so I never received the first company's w-2 until last night when they tracked me down. As it currently stands I have filed two w-2 for roughly an income of 140,000 for last year. I was already paying the max in social security with what is currently filed as well as federal. The amount of the un-filed w-2 is $11663 taking me to 150K and within the same tax bracket the withholdings were very large $2088 fed, $723.14 social, Medicare $169.12. I know to not fuck with the IRS but in this situation it just seems like the government would owe me more money. Filing an amended return can take several months and is obviously a pain in the ass. What sort of risk am I at just letting things stand as is. IE: is there some massive penalty that they could levy on me a year from now or would it just be you need to file that return and deal with the bullshit then. The extra $500 I could get just doesn't seem worth it for the level of work.

I'd appreciate some opinions on what I could be doing better, if you think this is reasonable, etc., just as a sanity check. I have been categorizing and tracking every dollar spent since last December so my figures should be fairly accurate. Lets start with the numbers... 

**Capital / Equity**

* Checkings: $5000
* 401k: $9100
* Yearly bonus of approx. $7200 (after taxes/401k contribution) will be deposited into my account by the end of this month

* Yearly Salary: $65k + $10k bonus 
* Just received a raise effective April for $70k + $12k bonus 

*Total take home (after taxes, 401k, medical, dental) currently is $3540.00

**Debts &amp; Other Expenses**

* Student Loan 1: $25,000 (Federal, 4.7% APR), paying $276/month
* Student Loan 2: $3,649 (Federal, 5% APR), currently in grace period, will begin paying $127/month starting July 2016

* Typical Miscellaneous expenses: $300/month

*Typical Total Expense/Month is about $3000.00

**Final Comments**

I put away 8% of my base salary into the company 401k, where they match 75% of the first 6% of my contribution. In addition 20% of my yearly bonus is set to be put away every year into my 401k. I am not able to build my emergency fund as much as I would like because I am trying to pay down my credit card debt as a priority (minimum payment is $100), all the while trying to build my 401k as fast/early as possible. 

Right now, I can only seem to put away a few hundred dollars every month towards my emergency fund. I have a bonus of approximately $7200 coming in a few days, should I keep this as my emergency fund or pay off my credit card debt fully instead of just aggressively paying it down?

personalfinance,Roth IRA re-characterization and Income Tax,"Hey there PF, hopefully someone can help me with this question.  If not the right place I can try /r/tax.

Wife and I currently have an AGI of 113,000, it's looking like we are going to owe 1400 in federal taxes this year. Both of us have employer sponsored retirement accounts, and in addition I opened and contributed about 4,000 to a roth IRA this past year.  We bought a house this past year, and have been paying PMI both upfront and monthly;  unfortunately the IRS limit for PMI deduction is AGI of 109,000.  

The question: Would re-characterizing my ROTH to a standard IRA for 2015 get our AGI low enough to take the PMI deduction or do the deductions for IRA contributions and PMI not work as I think?

Side notes: We have the money in E-fund to cover the tax bill  leaving us with about 5k in the fund but given we are still new in the house I would rather not have to shell out that much in taxes and keep it in the e-fund.  I am also aware I could hire a tax professional but the 2-300 it would cost vs the 1400 tax bill doesn't seem worth it.

personalfinance,Terrifying Medical Expenses for Parents,"I'm not even sure where to begin but my parents have been sick for a while. I received a bachelors and masters degree in English several years ago but they both got sick. My dad has a more rapid form of palsy but is hanging in there for now. The problem is my mom has long been bedridden after various health problems. 

About two and half years ago she stopped talking and is apparently in a low-grade coma due to dementia/diabetes. The immediate problem is she was hospitalized then suffocated due to throwing up and needed to be put on a ventilator. She was sent to a facility to wean her off of that and has had some setbacks. 

Now, she's at subacute care and they won't give her the 100 days she usually gets on skilled nursing because she used them while on a peg tube for feeding, I'm told. I don't understand Medicare's rules but she has normal medicare but plus Fed Blue from my dad/her husband which covers a lot but her ambulance transports which might force me to pay over a thousand dollars at least but working with them right now. 

Financially the main problem is I just had to set up financing for a sewer line they needed replacing and had put off for nearly a decade which ran to 6500 dollars but paid off like a line of credit. My dad has a credit score just a few points below 800 but about 15,000 in total debts previous to this mostly for repairs and medical expenses.

They've burned through savings accounts for medical expenses in the past and are left with around 20k total savings for emergencies. Their monthly income from retirements as a teacher and federal employee are 3200 and 2950 a month filing jointly. They do have a trust so far as the house (own it) but are terrible with keeping their important papers in easy to find places.

My fear is I don't know as much about Medi-Cal (this is in the Los Angeles area) or what options are available to them and I've been run ragged because I don't have a job trying to care for them and I'm not sure what to do next about what will probably be a large co-pay for mom's rehabilitative ventilator care. 

I know I should get to a social worker but it's a long wait and I'm not sure how to tackle all the problems and get myself work in the long-term (I'm a writer in what time I get aside from caring for them right now). I'm waiting to hear back from a person at the facility mom is at.

I'm scared the best thing is to let mom die when those weren't her wishes and she's a fighter. But financially I'm afraid the burden will be too much for my dad and me to bear. My dad is in the hospital right now due to exhaustion and I'm feeling close to that myself. 

They also have private caregivers who are giving me some support and only cost about fifteen dollars an hour with flexible hours. But there are many medical expenses, especially when my mom was being taken care of at home.

Any advice about how to tackle this problem without being buried in bills would be appreciated.",finance,1457719172

personalfinance,Should I start an HSA for investment/retirement purposes?,"I'm in a fortunate position, and recently got a new job. For the first time ever I have the option to pick a HDHP plan with a $2600 deductible that lets me contribute to a HSA plan (as opposed to a PPO or HMO). Normally I'd go with a PPO with ~$1000 deductible as I travel frequently enough that I don't want to risk an HMO.

I have enough money put aside that I can cover the deductible in an emergency. However, I would say that I have rarely needed to take full advantage of my health insurance. Additionally, I'd be saving ~$45/month over a PPO plan.

I understand that there are significant tax benefits to having an HSA, but I don't understand the complexities. I'm behind in retirement savings and have recently started contributing to my Roth IRA (never had a 401K match option). I'm in the fortunate situation where my income is now too high to fully contribute the max to a Roth IRA (Thanks California cost of living!). My salary is $115K plus a potential max bonus of $10K. It'll be a bit less than $125K as I had all of January at my previous company at $97K.

Normally I'd just go with the easy, less risky PPO option. But everything I've read about HSA's is they are such a great long-term investment option I should consider it.

It should also be noted that I owe ~$24K in student loans from the federal government at ~4.5%. And now I do get 401k matching.

Does contributing to an HSA reduce my MAGI enough to even matter so I can contribute to more to the Roth since it'll start phasing out? Adding to the triple tax benefits of contributing to one?

Should I get the HSA regardless of the Roth IRA situation?

In my head, I'll contribute the max amount to get matched for the 401K, max out my Roth IRA to the phased amount, max out the HSA, and if it reduces my MAGI, contribute more to Roth IRA (plus the small amount more I can contribute because of the student loan deductions).

personalfinance,Trying to get credit card debt as well as savings under control...,"I'm trying to get my finances together and have been milling over a few options so that I make the best decision possible. I figured I'd see if someone more well versed in this had any insight.

Basically, I have between $6500 to $7000 in credit card debt that is starting to cause problems. I didn't rack all of this up just buying things I couldn't afford; it started from about $4000 I had to spend fixing my car. Since then, the monthly finance charges have been getting tougher and tougher to deal with. It's at a point where I'm paying about $300 per month to try to keep it in control. The minimum is now at about $180 and keeps going up. I'd like to pay at least $100 less per month on this debt.

I've thought about doing a balance transfer to a credit card with another bank. $260 fee to do this and then no service charges for 24 months. If I do this I'll probably pay about $200 month. This won't pay off the debt before I start to get service charges from this bank.

The other option is a personal loan. The interest rate I was given as a rough guideline in a meeting with the bank was about 10.5%, but I suspect it will be higher. This would be a 5 year loan and I'd be paying $138 per month.

What would the best option be? Or have I not thought of the best option? If I was to do a balance transfer, I'd likely try to do it again in 24 months to continue avoiding service charges. All I know is that I have to do something. It's getting to a point where I spend so much money paying off the credit card that I have no money left to buy groceries. I end up using the credit card to buy the groceries and I continue the viscous cycle.

Also as an aside, I recently got some tax return money that I'm trying to put aside for a small vacation later this year. I want to get it out of my checking account so I don't mix it up with my usual funds. Should I use a savings account? Or open a 2nd checking account with another bank? The reason I was considering a 2nd checking account is that I thought it might cause the new bank to be more willing to give me a good loan or approve a credit card.

I will soon inherit a townhouse rental property from my mother.  The mortgage on the property has been paid off and it is currently being rented out for $3,950 per month (the property is located in Sunnyvale, CA).

I currently owe approximately $50K in student loans.  Approximately $20K of these are govt. subsidized loans (Federal Stafford Subsidized) and the other $30K are Federal Unsubsidized Loans).  The average interest rate between all of my unsub loans is approximately 4.1%

1. I will continue to rent this place out at the current monthly rate for the rest of 2016 and 2017.

My siblings and I were the first generation of my family to get bachelor's so none of us really knew what we were doing, and I was dumb enough to choose a prestigious private school because I thought that attending the best school you could get into regardless of other factors was the Right Way to Do Things. Anyway...

I have a mix of federal and private loans. I have no intention of consolidating the federal loans, because I work in the non-profit sector, meaning they will be forgiven after I've been working for 10 years (so only 5 more years to go!). Also, I don't want to lose the protections offered by federal loans. My private loans have widely varying interest rates, the lowest at 3.25% and the highest at 8.75%. I've been paying the minimum on all my loans since I graduated and throwing extra money whenever I can at whatever specific loan is my priority to pay off. I started out prioritizing my smallest loan, which I just paid off a couple of months ago (yay!) and now I've moved on to targeting my highest-interest loan. With the highest interest loans, making the minimum payments barely staves off the mounting, compounding interest, and seeing these few loans stay relatively stable over the last few years while I throw so much money at them has been pretty demoralizing.

My question: does it make sense to keep doing what I'm doing? Or should I attempt to refinance ALL of my private loans? Or should I only try to refinance my private loans over a certain interest rate? If so, what cutoff should I use? 

Any and all advice would be very, very appreciated.",finance,1457750679

personalfinance,Should I refinance student loan debt?,"I currently have about $43,000 in student loan debt with Wells Fargo (I have about another $30,000 with great lakes, but they are federal and seem to have better rates), that I refinanced a little over a year ago to get it out of Sallie Mae (they weren't pleasant to deal with). The interest rate is currently at a fairly high 9% and equates to a payment of roughly $460 per month. 

Should I consider refinancing with someone like SoFi? It looks like they offer better rates that would come in lower, I just don't know the implications of refinancing so soon. I'd likely try and get as close to the same term length as I have at this time, which was likely 15 years. Also, I've read some articles that do say to actually go with the lower variable rate, as it's unlikely to go over the LIBOR rate from 1989 which I believe was around 9% (where I currently am)...so it may make sense to get a lower payment now and potentially slightly higher at the end, when I'm also likely a higher earner. I honestly only have a basic understanding of this though,

personalfinance,Tax Exemptions vs. Allowances on Paycheck. Difference?,"I'm confused about the difference between a tax ""exemption"" and an ""allowance"" as it pertains to my paycheck.

I noticed on my paycheck today that I suddenly jumped from 0 to 1 exemptions, for both Federal and State (CA). I recently adjusted my W-4, increasing my claimed allowances from 0 to 1 (I got a large tax refund for 2015 and I'd like to keep more of that money in my net pay). We also received mid-year bonuses on this paycheck, if that's relevant.

What would be the cause for the change in exemptions? Is it the updated W-4? I'm still showing 0 allowances for both Federal and State (it is possible my new W-4 hasn't gone into effect yet, in which case I'm even more confused about the exemption bump).

crypto,The Blast Shack (NSA vs. WikiLeaks),"The Wikileaks Cablegate scandal is the most exciting and interesting hacker scandal ever. I rather commonly write about such things, and I‚Äôm surrounded by online acquaintances who take a burning interest in every little jot and tittle of this ongoing saga. So it‚Äôs going to take me a while to explain why this highly newsworthy event fills me with such a chilly, deadening sense of Edgar Allen Poe melancholia.

But it sure does.

Part of this dull, icy feeling, I think, must be the agonizing slowness with which this has happened. At last‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat long last‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe homemade nitroglycerin in the old cypherpunks blast shack has gone off. Those ‚Äúcypherpunks,‚Äù of all people.

Way back in 1992, a brainy American hacker called Timothy C. May made up a sci-fi tinged idea that he called ‚ÄúThe Crypto Anarchist Manifesto.‚Äù This exciting screed‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI read it at the time, and boy was it ever cool‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwas all about anonymity, and encryption, and the Internet, and all about how wacky data-obsessed subversives could get up to all kinds of globalized mischief without any fear of repercussion from the blinkered authorities. If you were of a certain technoculture bent in the early 1990s, you had to love a thing like that.

As Tim blithely remarked to his fellow encryption enthusiasts, ‚ÄúThe State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be traded freely,‚Äù and then Tim started getting really interesting. Later, May described an institution called ‚ÄúBlackNet‚Äù which might conceivably carry out these aims.

Nothing much ever happened with Tim May‚Äôs imaginary BlackNet. It was the kind of out-there concept that science fiction writers like to put in novels. Because BlackNet was clever, and fun to think about, and it made impossible things seem plausible, and it was fantastic and also quite titillating. So it was the kind of farfetched but provocative issue that ought to be properly raised within a sci-fi public discourse. Because, you know, that would allow plenty of time to contemplate the approaching train wreck and perhaps do something practical about it.

Nobody did much of anything practical. For nigh on twenty long years, nothing happened with the BlackNet notion, for good or ill. Why? Because thinking hard and eagerly about encryption involves a certain mental composition which is alien to normal public life. Crypto guys‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää(and the cypherpunks were all crypto guys, mostly well-educated, mathematically gifted middle-aged guys in Silicon Valley careers)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääare geeks. They‚Äôre harmless geeks, they‚Äôre not radical politicians or dashing international crime figures.

Cypherpunks were visionary Californians from the WIRED magazine circle. In their personal lives, they were as meek and low-key as any average code-cracking spook who works for the National Security Agency. These American spooks from Fort Meade are shy and retiring people, by their nature. In theory, the NSA could create every kind of flaming scandalous mayhem with their giant Echelon spy system‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut in practice, they would much rather sit there gently reading other people‚Äôs email.

One minute‚Äôs thought would reveal that a vast, opaque electronic spy outfit like the National Security Agency is exceedingly dangerous to democracy. Really, it is. The NSA clearly violates all kinds of elementary principles of constitutional design. The NSA is the very antithesis of transparency, and accountability, and free elections, and free expression, and separation of powers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin other words, the NSA is a kind of giant, grown-up, anti-Wikileaks. And it always has been. And we‚Äôre used to that. We pay no mind.

The NSA, this crypto empire, is a long-lasting fact on the ground that we‚Äôve all informally agreed not to get too concerned about. Even foreign victims of the NSA‚Äôs machinations can‚Äôt seem to get properly worked-up about its capacities and intrigues. The NSA has been around since 1947. It‚Äôs a little younger than the A-Bomb, and we don‚Äôt fuss much about that now, either.

The geeks who man the NSA don‚Äôt look much like Julian Assange, because they have college degrees, shorter haircuts, better health insurance and far fewer stamps in their passports. But the sources of their power are pretty much identical to his. They use computers and they get their mitts on info that doesn‚Äôt much wanna be free.

Every rare once in a while, the secretive and discreet NSA surfaces in public life and does something reprehensible, such as defeating American federal computer-security initiatives so that they can continue to eavesdrop at will. But the NSA never becomes any big flaming Wikileaks scandal. Why? Because, unlike their wannabe colleagues at Wikileaks, the apparatchiks of the NSA are not in the scandal business. They just placidly sit at the console, reading everybody‚Äôs diplomatic cables.

This is their function. The NSA is an eavesdropping outfit. Cracking the communications of other governments is its reason for being. The NSA are not unique entities in the shadows of our planet‚Äôs political landscape. Every organized government gives that a try. It‚Äôs a geopolitical fact, although it‚Äôs not too discreet to dwell on it.

You can walk to most any major embassy in any major city in the world, and you can see that it is festooned with wiry heaps of electronic spying equipment. Don‚Äôt take any pictures of the roofs of embassies, as they grace our public skylines. Guards will emerge to repress you.

Now, Tim May and his imaginary BlackNet were the sci-fi extrapolation version of the NSA. A sort of inside-out, hippiefied NSA. Crypto people were always keenly aware of the NSA, for the NSA were the people who harassed them for munitions violations and struggled to suppress their academic publications. Creating a BlackNet is like having a pet, desktop NSA. Except, that instead of being a vast, federally-supported nest of supercomputers under a hill in Maryland, it‚Äôs a creaky, homemade, zero-budget social-network site for disaffected geeks.

But who cared about that wild notion? Why would that amateurish effort ever matter to real-life people? It‚Äôs like comparing a mighty IBM mainframe to some cranky Apple computer made inside a California garage. Yes, it‚Äôs almost that hard to imagine.

So Wikileaks is a manifestation of something that has been growing all around us, for decades, with volcanic inexorability. The NSA is the world‚Äôs most public unknown secret agency. And for four years now, its twisted sister Wikileaks has been the world‚Äôs most blatant, most publicly praised, encrypted underground site.

Wikileaks is ‚Äúunderground‚Äù in the way that the NSA is ‚Äúcovert‚Äù; not because it‚Äôs inherently obscure, but because it‚Äôs discreetly not spoken about.

The NSA is ‚Äúdiscreet,‚Äù so, somehow, people tolerate it. Wikileaks is ‚Äútransparent,‚Äù like a cardboard blast shack full of kitchen-sink nitroglycerine in a vacant lot.

That is how we come to the dismal saga of Wikileaks and its ongoing Cablegate affair, which is a melancholy business, all in all. The scale of it is so big that every weirdo involved immediately becomes a larger-than-life figure. But they‚Äôre not innately heroic. They‚Äôre just living, mortal human beings, the kind of geeky, quirky, cyberculture loons that I run into every day. And man, are they ever going to pay.

Now we must contemplate Bradley Manning, because he was the first to immolate himself. Private Manning was a young American, a hacker-in-uniform, bored silly while doing scarcely necessary scutwork on a military computer system in Iraq. Private Manning had dozens of reasons for becoming what computer-security professionals call the ‚Äúinternal threat.‚Äù

His war made no sense on its face, because it was carried out in a headlong pursuit of imaginary engines of mass destruction. The military occupation of Iraq was endless. Manning, a tender-hearted geek, was overlooked and put-upon by his superiors. Although he worked around the clock, he had nothing of any particular military consequence to do.

It did not occur to his superiors that a bored soldier in a poorly secured computer system would download hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables. Because, well, why? They‚Äôre very boring. Soldiers never read them. The malefactor has no use for them. They‚Äôre not particularly secret. They‚Äôve got nothing much to do with his war. He knows his way around the machinery, but Bradley Manning is not any kind of blackhat programming genius.

Instead, he‚Äôs very like Jerome Kerviel, that obscure French stock trader who stole 5 billion euros without making one dime for himself. Jerome Kerviel, just like Bradley Manning, was a bored, resentful, lower-echelon guy in a dead end, who discovered some awesome capacities in his system that his bosses never knew it had. It makes so little sense to behave like Kerviel and Manning that their threat can‚Äôt be imagined. A weird hack like that is self-defeating, and it‚Äôs sure to bring terrible repercussions to the transgressor. But then the sad and sordid days grind on and on; and that blindly potent machinery is just sitting there. Sitting there, tempting the user.

Bradley Manning believes the sci-fi legendry of the underground. He thinks that he can leak a quarter of a million secret cables, protect himself with neat-o cryptography, and, magically, never be found out. So Manning does this, and at first he gets away with it, but, still possessed by the malaise that haunts his soul, he has to brag about his misdeed, and confess himself to a hacker confidante who immediately ships him to the authorities.

No hacker story is more common than this. The ingenuity poured into the machinery is meaningless. The personal connections are treacherous. Welcome to the real world.

So Private Manning, cypherpunk, is immediately toast.

No army can permit this kind of behavior and remain a functional army; so Manning is in solitary confinement and he is going to be court-martialled. With more political awareness, he might have made himself a public martyr to his conscience; but he lacks political awareness. He has only his black-hat hacker awareness, which is all about committing awesome voyeuristic acts of computer intrusion and imagining you can get away with that when it really matters to people.

The guy preferred his hacker identity to his sworn fidelity to the uniform of a superpower. The shear-forces there are beyond his comprehension.

The reason this upsets me is that I know so many people just like Bradley Manning. Because I used to meet and write about hackers, ‚Äúcrackers,‚Äù ‚Äúdarkside hackers,‚Äù ‚Äúcomputer underground‚Äù types. They are a subculture, but once you get used to their many eccentricities, there is nothing particularly remote or mysterious or romantic about them. They are banal. Bradley Manning is a young, mildly brainy, unworldly American guy who probably would have been pretty much okay if he‚Äôd been left alone to skateboard, read comic books and listen to techno music.

Instead, Bradley had to leak all over the third rail. Through historical circumstance, he‚Äôs become a miserable symbolic point-man for a global war on terror. He doesn‚Äôt much deserve that role. He‚Äôs got about as much to do with the political aspects of his war as Monica Lewinsky did with the lasting sexual mania that afflicts the American Republic.

That is so dispiriting and ugly. As a novelist, I never think of Monica Lewinsky, that once-everyday young woman, without a sense of dread at the freakish, occult fate that overtook her. Imagine what it must be like, to wake up being her, to face the inevitability of being That Woman. Monica, too, transgressed in apparent safety and then she had the utter foolishness to brag to a lethal enemy, a trusted confidante who ran a tape machine and who brought her a mediated circus of hells. The titillation of that massive, shattering scandal has faded now. But think of the quotidian daily horror of being Monica Lewinsky, and that should take a bite from the soul.

Bradley Manning now shares that exciting, oh my God, Monica Lewinsky, tortured media-freak condition. This mild little nobody has become super-famous, and in his lonely military brig, screenless and without a computer, he‚Äôs strictly confined and, no doubt, he‚Äôs horribly bored. I don‚Äôt want to condone or condemn the acts of Bradley Manning. Because legions of people are gonna do that for me, until we‚Äôre all good and sick of it, and then some. I don‚Äôt have the heart to make this transgressor into some hockey-puck for an ideological struggle. I sit here and I gloomily contemplate his all-too-modern situation with a sense of Sartrean nausea.

Commonly, the authorities don‚Äôt much like to crush apple-cheeked white-guy hackers like Bradley Manning. It‚Äôs hard to charge hackers with crimes, even when they gleefully commit them, because it‚Äôs hard to find prosecutors and judges willing to bone up on the drudgery of understanding what they did. But they‚Äôve pretty much got to make a pur√©e out of this guy, because of massive pressure from the gravely embarrassed authorities. Even though Bradley lacks the look and feel of any conventional criminal; wrong race, wrong zipcode, wrong set of motives.

Bradley‚Äôs gonna become a ‚Äúspy‚Äù whose ‚Äúespionage‚Äù consisted of making the activities of a democratic government visible to its voting population. With the New York Times publishing the fruits of his misdeeds. Some set of American prosecutorial lawyers is confronting this crooked legal hairpin right now. I feel sorry for them.

Then there is Julian Assange, who is a pure-dye underground computer hacker. Julian doesn‚Äôt break into systems at the moment, but he‚Äôs not an ‚Äúex-hacker,‚Äù he‚Äôs the silver-plated real deal, the true avant-garde. Julian is a child of the underground hacker milieu, the digital-native as twenty-first century cypherpunk. As far as I can figure, Julian has never found any other line of work that bore any interest for him.

Through dint of years of cunning effort, Assange has worked himself into a position where his ‚Äúcomputer crimes‚Äù are mainly political. They‚Äôre probably not even crimes. They are ‚Äúleaks.‚Äù Leaks are nothing special. They are tidbits from the powerful that every journalist gets on occasion, like crumbs of fishfood on the top of the media tank.

Only, this time, thanks to Manning, Assange has brought in a massive truckload of media fishfood. It‚Äôs not just some titillating, scandalous, floating crumbs. There‚Äôs a quarter of a million of them. He‚Äôs become the one-man global McDonald‚Äôs of leaks.

Ever the detail-freak, Assange in fact hasn‚Äôt shipped all the cables he received from Manning. Instead, he cunningly encrypted the cables and distributed them worldwide to thousands of fellow-travellers. This stunt sounds technically impressive, although it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs pretty easy to do, and nobody but a cypherpunk would think that it made any big difference to anybody. It‚Äôs part and parcel of Assange‚Äôs other characteristic activities, such as his inability to pack books inside a box while leaving any empty space.

While others stare in awe at Assange‚Äôs many otherworldly aspects‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähis hairstyle, his neatness, his too-precise speech, his post-national life out of a laptop bag‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI can recognize him as pure triple-A outsider geek. Man, I know a thousand modern weirdos like that, and every single one of them seems to be on my Twitter stream screaming support for Assange because they can recognize him as a brother and a class ally. They are in holy awe of him because, for the first time, their mostly-imaginary and lastingly resentful underclass has landed a serious blow in a public arena. Julian Assange has hacked a superpower.

He didn‚Äôt just insult the captain of the global football team; he put spycams in the locker room. He showed the striped-pants set without their pants. This a massively embarrassing act of technical voyeurism. It‚Äôs like Monica and her stains and kneepads, only even more so.

Now, I wish I could say that I feel some human pity for Julian Assange, in the way I do for the hapless, one-shot Bradley Manning, but I can‚Äôt possibly say that. Pity is not the right response, because Assange has carefully built this role for himself. He did it with all the minute concentration of some geek assembling a Rubik‚Äôs Cube.

In that regard, one‚Äôs hat should be off to him. He‚Äôs had forty years to learn what he was doing. He‚Äôs not some miserabilist semi-captive like the uniformed Bradley Manning. He‚Äôs a darkside player out to stick it to the Man. The guy has surrounded himself with the cream of the computer underground, wily old rascals like Rop Gonggrijp and the fearsome Teutonic minions of the Chaos Computer Club.

Assange has had many long, and no doubt insanely detailed, policy discussions with all his closest allies, about every aspect of his means, motives and opportunities. And he did what he did with fierce resolve.

Furthermore, and not as any accident, Assange has managed to alienate everyone who knew him best. All his friends think he‚Äôs nuts. I‚Äôm not too thrilled to see that happen. That‚Äôs not a great sign in a consciousness-raising, power-to-the-people, radical political-leader type. Most successful dissidents have serious people skills and are way into revolutionary camaraderie and a charismatic sense of righteousness. They‚Äôre into kissing babies, waving bloody shirts, and keeping hope alive. Not this chilly, eldritch guy. He‚Äôs a bright, good-looking man who‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälet‚Äôs face it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcan‚Äôt get next to women without provoking clumsy havoc and a bitter and lasting resentment. That‚Äôs half the human race that‚Äôs beyond his comprehension there, and I rather surmise that, from his stern point of view, it was sure to be all their fault.

Assange was in prison for a while lately, and his best friend in the prison was his Mom. That seems rather typical of him. Obviously Julian knew he was going to prison; a child would know it. He‚Äôs been putting on his Solzhenitsyn clothes and combing his forelock for that role for ages now. I‚Äôm a little surprised that he didn‚Äôt have a more organized prison-support committee, because he‚Äôs a convicted computer criminal who‚Äôs been through this wringer before. Maybe he figures he‚Äôll reap more glory if he‚Äôs martyred all alone.

I rather doubt the authorities are any happier to have him in prison. They pretty much gotta feed him into their legal wringer somehow, but a botched Assange show-trial could do colossal damage. There‚Äôs every likelihood that the guy could get off. He could walk into an American court and come out smelling of roses. It‚Äôs the kind of show-trial judo every repressive government fears.

It‚Äôs not just about him and the burning urge to punish him; it‚Äôs about the public risks to the reputation of the USA. The superpower hypocrisy here is gonna be hard to bear. The USA loves to read other people‚Äôs diplomatic cables. They dote on doing it. If Assange had happened to out the cable-library of some outlaw pariah state, say, Paraguay or North Korea, the US State Department would be heaping lilies at his feet. They‚Äôd be a little upset about his violation of the strict proprieties, but they‚Äôd also take keen satisfaction in the hilarious comeuppance of minor powers that shouldn‚Äôt be messing with computers, unlike the grandiose, high-tech USA.

Unfortunately for the US State Department, they clearly shouldn‚Äôt have been messing with computers, either. In setting up their SIPRnet, they were trying to grab the advantages of rapid, silo-free, networked communication while preserving the hierarchical proprieties of official confidentiality. That‚Äôs the real issue, that‚Äôs the big modern problem; national governments and global computer networks don‚Äôt mix any more. It‚Äôs like trying to eat a very private birthday cake while also distributing it. That scheme is just not working. And that failure has a face now, and that‚Äôs Julian Assange.

Assange didn‚Äôt liberate the dreadful secrets of North Korea, not because the North Koreans lack computers, but because that isn‚Äôt a cheap and easy thing that half-a-dozen zealots can do. But the principle of it, the logic of doing it, is the same. Everybody wants everybody else‚Äôs national government to leak. Every state wants to see the diplomatic cables of every other state. It will bend heaven and earth to get them. It‚Äôs just, that sacred activity is not supposed to be privatized, or, worse yet, made into the no-profit, shareable, have-at-it fodder for a network society, as if global diplomacy were so many mp3s. Now the US State Department has walked down the thorny road to hell that was first paved by the music industry. Rock and roll, baby.

Now, in strict point of fact, Assange didn‚Äôt blandly pirate the massive hoard of cables from the US State Department. Instead, he was busily ‚Äúredacting‚Äù and minutely obeying the proprieties of his political cover in the major surviving paper dailies. Kind of a nifty feat of social-engineering there; but he‚Äôs like a poacher who machine-gunned a herd of wise old elephants and then went to the temple to assume the robes of a kosher butcher. That is a world-class hoax.

Assange is no more a ‚Äújournalist‚Äù than he is a crypto mathematician. He‚Äôs a darkside hacker who is a self-appointed, self-anointed, self-educated global dissident. He‚Äôs a one-man Polish Solidarity, waiting for the population to accrete around his stirring propaganda of the deed. And they are accreting; not all of ‚Äòem, but, well, it doesn‚Äôt take all of them.

Julian Assange doesn‚Äôt want to be in power; he has no people skills at all, and nobody‚Äôs ever gonna make him President Vaclav Havel. He‚Äôs certainly not in it for the money, because he wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with the cash; he lives out of a backpack, and his daily routine is probably sixteen hours online. He‚Äôs not gonna get better Google searches by spending more on his banned MasterCard. I don‚Äôt even think Assange is all that big on ego; I know authors and architects, so I‚Äôve seen much worse than Julian in that regard. He‚Äôs just what he is; he‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt yet have words for.

He‚Äôs a different, modern type of serious troublemaker. He‚Äôs certainly not a ‚Äúterrorist,‚Äù because nobody is scared and no one got injured. He‚Äôs not a ‚Äúspy,‚Äù because nobody spies by revealing the doings of a government to its own civil population. He is orthogonal. He‚Äôs asymmetrical. He panics people in power and he makes them look stupid. And I feel sorry for them. But sorrier for the rest of us.

Julian Assange‚Äôs extremely weird version of dissident ‚Äúliving in truth‚Äù doesn‚Äôt bear much relationship to the way that public life has ever been arranged. It does, however, align very closely to what we‚Äôve done to ourselves by inventing and spreading the Internet. If the Internet was walking around in public, it would look and act a lot like Julian Assange. The Internet is about his age, and it doesn‚Äôt have any more care for the delicacies of profit, propriety and hierarchy than he does.

So Julian is heading for a modern legal netherworld, the slammer, the electronic parole cuff, whatever; you can bet there will be surveillance of some kind wherever he goes, to go along with the FREE ASSANGE stencils and xeroxed flyers that are gonna spring up in every coffee-bar, favela and university on the planet. A guy as personally hampered and sociopathic as Julian may in fact thrive in an inhuman situation like this. Unlike a lot of keyboard-hammering geeks, he‚Äôs a serious reader and a pretty good writer, with a jailhouse-lawyer facility for pointing out weaknesses in the logic of his opponents, and boy are they ever. Weak, that is. They are pathetically weak.

Diplomats have become weak in the way that musicians are weak. Musicians naturally want people to pay real money for music, but if you press them on it, they‚Äôll sadly admit that they don‚Äôt buy any music themselves. Because, well, they‚Äôre in the business, so why should they? And the same goes for diplomats and discreet secrets.

The one grand certainty about the consumers of Cablegate is that diplomats are gonna be reading those stolen cables. Not hackers: diplomats. Hackers bore easily, and they won‚Äôt be able to stand the discourse of intelligent trained professionals discussing real-life foreign affairs.

American diplomats are gonna read those stolen cables, though, because they were supposed to read them anyway, even though they didn‚Äôt. Now, they‚Äôve got to read them, with great care, because they might get blindsided otherwise by some wisecrack that they typed up years ago.

And, of course, every intelligence agency and every diplomat from every non-American agency on Earth is gonna fire up computers and pore over those things. To see what American diplomacy really thought about them, or to see if they were ignored (which is worse), and to see how the grownups ran what was basically a foreign-service news agency that the rest of us were always forbidden to see.

This stark fact makes them all into hackers. Yes, just like Julian. They‚Äôre all indebted to Julian for this grim thing that he did, and as they sit there hunched over their keyboards, drooling over their stolen goodies, they‚Äôre all, without exception, implicated in his doings. Assange is never gonna become a diplomat, but he‚Äôs arranged it so that diplomats henceforth are gonna be a whole lot more like Assange. They‚Äôll behave just like him. They receive the goods just like he did, semi-surreptitiously. They may be wearing an ascot and striped pants, but they‚Äôve got that hacker hunch in their necks and they‚Äôre staring into the glowing screen.

And I don‚Äôt much like that situation. It doesn‚Äôt make me feel better. I feel sorry for them and what it does to their values, to their self-esteem. If there‚Äôs one single watchword, one central virtue, of the diplomatic life, it‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscretion.‚Äù Not ‚Äútransparency.‚Äù Diplomatic discretion. Discretion is why diplomats do not say transparent things to foreigners. When diplomats tell foreigners what they really think, war results.

Diplomats are people who speak from nation to nation. They personify nations, and nations are brutal, savage, feral entities. Diplomats used to have something in the way of an international community, until the Americans decided to unilaterally abandon that in pursuit of Bradley Manning‚Äôs oil war. Now nations are so badly off that they can‚Äôt even get it together to coherently tackle heroin, hydrogen bombs, global warming and financial collapse. Not to mention the Internet.

The world has lousy diplomacy now. It‚Äôs dysfunctional. The world corps diplomatique are weak, really weak, and the US diplomatic corps, which used to be the senior and best-engineered outfit there, is rattling around bottled-up in blast-proofed bunkers. It‚Äôs scary how weak and useless they are.

US diplomats used to know what to do with dissidents in other nations. If they were communists they got briskly repressed, but if they had anything like a free-market outlook, then US diplomats had a whole arsenal of gentle and supportive measures; Radio Free Europe, publication in the West, awards, foreign travel, flattery, moral support; discreet things, in a word, but exceedingly useful things. Now they‚Äôre harassing Julian by turning those tools backwards.

For a US diplomat, Assange is like some digitized nightmare-reversal of a kindly Cold War analog dissident. He read the dissident playbook and he downloaded it as a textfile; but, in fact, Julian doesn‚Äôt care about the USA. It‚Äôs just another obnoxious national entity. He happens to be more or less Australian, and he‚Äôs no great enemy of America. If he‚Äôd had the chance to leak Australian cables he would have leapt on that with the alacrity he did on Kenya. Of course, when Assange did it to that meager little Kenya, all the grown-ups thought that was groovy; he had to hack a superpower in order to touch the third rail.

But the American diplomatic corps, and all it thinks it represents, is just collateral damage between Assange and his goal. He aspires to his transparent crypto-utopia in the way George Bush aspired to imaginary weapons of mass destruction. And the American diplomatic corps are so many Iraqis in that crusade. They‚Äôre the civilian casualties.

As a novelist, you gotta like the deep and dark irony here. As somebody attempting to live on a troubled world‚Ä¶ I dunno. It makes one want to call up the Red Cross and volunteer to fund planetary tranquilizers.

I‚Äôve met some American diplomats; not as many as I‚Äôve met hackers, but a few. Like hackers, diplomats are very intelligent people; unlike hackers, they are not naturally sociopathic. Instead, they have to be trained that way in the national interest. I feel sorry for their plight. I can enter into the shame and bitterness that afflicts them now.

The cables that Assange leaked have, to date, generally revealed rather eloquent, linguistically gifted American functionaries with a keen sensitivity to the feelings of aliens. So it‚Äôs no wonder they were of dwindling relevance and their political masters paid no attention to their counsels. You don‚Äôt have to be a citizen of this wracked and threadbare superpower‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää(you might, for instance, be from New Zealand)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin order to sense the pervasive melancholy of an empire in decline. There‚Äôs a House of Usher feeling there. Too many prematurely buried bodies.

For diplomats, a massive computer leak is not the kind of sunlight that chases away corrupt misbehavior; it‚Äôs more like some dreadful shift in the planetary atmosphere that causes ultraviolet light to peel their skin away. They‚Äôre not gonna die from being sunburned in public without their pants on; Bill Clinton survived that ordeal, Silvio Berlusconi just survived it (again). No scandal lasts forever; people do get bored. Generally, you can just brazen it out and wait for the public to find a fresher outrage. Except.

It‚Äôs the damage to the institutions that is spooky and disheartening; after the Lewinsky eruption, every American politician lives in permanent terror of a sex-outing. That‚Äôs ‚Äútransparency,‚Äù too; it‚Äôs the kind of ghastly sex-transparency that Julian himself is stuck crotch-deep in. The politics of personal destruction hasn‚Äôt made the Americans into a frank and erotically cheerful people. On the contrary, the US today is like some creepy house of incest divided against itself in a civil cold war. ‚ÄúTransparency‚Äù can have nasty aspects; obvious, yet denied; spoken, but spoken in whispers. Very Edgar Allen Poe.

That‚Äôs our condition. It‚Äôs a comedy to those who think and a tragedy to those who feel, but it‚Äôs not a comedy that the planet‚Äôs general cultural situation is so clearly getting worse. As I sit here moping over Julian Assange, I‚Äôd love to pretend that this is just me in a personal bad mood; in the way that befuddled American pundits like to pretend that Julian is some kind of unique, demonic figure. He isn‚Äôt. If he ever was, he sure as hell isn‚Äôt now, as ‚ÄúIndoleaks,‚Äù ‚ÄúBalkanleaks‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrusselsleaks‚Äù spring up like so many filesharing whackamoles. Of course the Internet bedroom legions see him, admire him, and aspire to be like him‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand they will. How could they not?

Even though, as major political players go, Julian Assange seems remarkably deprived of sympathetic qualities. Most saintly leaders of the oppressed masses, most wannabe martyrs, are all keen to kiss-up to the public. But not our Julian; clearly, he doesn‚Äôt lack for lust and burning resentment, but that kind of gregarious, sweaty political tactility is beneath his dignity. He‚Äôs extremely intelligent, but, as a political, social and moral actor, he‚Äôs the kind of guy who gets depressed by the happiness of the stupid.

I don‚Äôt say these cruel things about Julian Assange because I feel distant from him, but, on the contrary, because I feel close to him. I don‚Äôt doubt the two of us would have a lot to talk about. I know hordes of men like him; it‚Äôs just that they are programmers, mathematicians, potheads and science fiction fans instead of fiercely committed guys who aspire to topple the international order and replace it with subversive wikipedians.

The chances of that ending well are about ten thousand to one. And I don‚Äôt doubt Assange knows that. This is the kind of guy who once wrote an encryption program called ‚ÄúRubberhose,‚Äù because he had it figured that the cops would beat his password out of him, and he needed some code-based way to finesse his own human frailty. Hey, neat hack there, pal.

So, well, that‚Äôs the general situation with this particular scandal. I could go on about it, but I‚Äôm trying to pace myself. This knotty situation is not gonna ‚Äúblow over,‚Äù because it‚Äôs been building since 1993 and maybe even 1947. ‚ÄúTransparency‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscretion‚Äù are virtues, but they are virtues that clash. The international order and the global Internet are not best pals. They never were, and now that‚Äôs obvious.

The data held by states is gonna get easier to steal, not harder to steal; the Chinese are all over Indian computers, the Indians are all over Pakistani computers, and the Russian cybermafia is brazenly hosting wikileaks.info because that‚Äôs where the underground goes to the mattresses. It is a godawful mess. This is gonna get worse before it gets better, and it‚Äôs gonna get worse for a long time. Like leaks in a house where the pipes froze.

Well‚Ä¶ every once in a while, a situation that‚Äôs one-in-a-thousand is met by a guy who is one in a million. It may be that Assange is, somehow, up to this situation. Maybe he‚Äôs gonna grow in stature by the massive trouble he has caused. Saints, martyrs, dissidents and freaks are always wild-cards, but sometimes they‚Äôre the only ones who can clear the general air. Sometimes they become the catalyst for historical events that somehow had to happen. They don‚Äôt have to be nice guys; that‚Äôs not the point. Julian Assange did this; he direly wanted it to happen. He planned it in nitpicky, obsessive detail. Here it is; a planetary hack.

I don‚Äôt have a lot of cheery hope to offer about his all-too-compelling gesture, but I dare to hope he‚Äôs everything he thinks he is, and much, much, more.",cryptocurrency,1457763058

personalfinance,"Trying to start saving early for my various goals, but my situation is about to start changing repeatedly.","I guess I should try to be as comprehensive as possible.

I'm 18 years old and about to finish up my freshman year in college. This year, I lived in the dorms. For the first semester, I didn't really work. For the second semester, I worked a lot and saved aggressively; I'm looking at a little under $4k by the time classes end. While I'm very happy with this, because I have to buy a car (used but functional), I am starting to feel very burnt out because of how much I'm working on top of school and how little of that hard earned money I'm actually getting to use.

Next year, and likely for the year after that, I will be living at home with my parents and commuting. This will mean my only real expenses are going to be tuition (not bad with fed. loans and living off campus), gas, a gym membership, and maybe some money for food (my family doesn't always eat as healthily as I try to). So obviously not big expenses. After that, my senior year, I'll probably get an apartment that I share with my boyfriend (if everything goes according to plan), so my expenses would change then. 

Now that expenses are covered, I guess I should talk about income. I am a waitress at a fairly popular restaurant. Right now I work ~20 hours a week Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, but that's only because the restaurant and my college are in different towns and I don't currently have a car. Working weekends like this, I can make between $300 and $400. I am currently saving $200/week to meet the deadline for buying a car (I really need to have one shortly after classes end). Over the summer, I'll likely ramp it up to 30-40 hours a week, so money would, in theory, double. Once my sophomore year starts up, however, things get a little unclear as to how they will go.

 I will probably still try to work about 20 hours a week, though, just maybe not all on the weekend so I don't feel so burnt out. I've also considered getting a new job as a waitress in my university's town, just to help cut down on gas prices (I live in a different town than both my university and my restaurant), so if I do that, then who knows how much I'll be making. I do plan to keep working through college. I might have to take a summer off eventually to work an internship or something similar. 

OKAY, so now my goals! I know some of these are more important than others, so I'll try to prioritize them by how soon I'll need that money and by how bad I want it. 

1. Tuition. I'm taking two summer classes, which will each be about $800, one in each summer session. Living off campus with federal loans, when school starts back up I think I'll need about $2,000 per semester. I think I can save this fairly easily.

2. Cosmetic surgery. This is something I've thought about for a while, but I don't have the specifics nailed down. In the United States, a BA costs about $10,000 if I am correct. There's a lot of variables about this, though. This would likely be done some time during my senior year as a graduation present to myself. 
3. Travel. I don't plan on studying abroad, but I want to try and take quite a few trips. I have terrible wanderlust, it's just that the idea of having obligations (like class, grades, etc) while trying to travel and experience new things sounds horrible to me. So one or two week trips would be ideal. Unfortunately, plane tickets are super expensive. 
4. A wedding/house. This one is really either/or, I guess, and also kind of both? Because I would marry whoever I buy the house with, and we would both help with the costs of the wedding, and we would both help with the down payment. My domestic dreams savings. This wouldn't be for a while, like maybe ten years from now, but it's really never too early to start.

So that's basically it? I'm just not sure what to do. Try and save really, really aggressively this summer and into the next two years when I'm living at home and expenses are low? Put everything in one big savings account and draw from it as needed for those goals? Start a different account for some/all of the goals? Only worry about saving aggressively for goal x and y, but put a little money away every two weeks for goal b and c? I feel like I have too much that I'm trying to do all at once, and I don't know where to start.

Sorry this is so much info, I just wanted y'all to have the best picture of everything so that I could get the most helpful advice. Thanks so much!",finance,1457764741

-**End the ‚Äúcarried interest‚Äù tax break, which benefits hedge fund managers and private equity executives.**

Economists consensus: Good (20 good, 2 debatable, 0 bad)

Supported by: Trump, Clinton, Sanders

&gt;‚ÄúThis would be a very good thing indeed. There is no economic logic for this tax break and it subsidizes a sector of the economy with dubious social value (and some of the highest earners in our society).‚Äù ‚Äî Daron Acemoƒülu


-**Lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent.**

Supported By: Rubio

Consensus: Debatable (10 good, 10 debatable, 2 bad) 

&gt;‚ÄúIt is a good idea, but with one big caveat. U.S. corporate tax rates are among the highest in the world. U.S. companies are competitively disadvantaged as a result. That is why so many U.S. companies keep foreign earnings offshore and why so many are taking part in inversion acquisitions to become taxable elsewhere. The caveat is that if we lower the corporate tax rate, it is important to raise rates elsewhere to make the change revenue neutral. ‚Äù ‚Äî Steve Kaplan


**Create a ""National Infrastructure Bank"" seeded with public money to help finance infrastructure projects.**

Supported By: Sanders, Clinton

Consensus: Debatable (9 good, 9 debatable, 4 bad) 

&gt;‚ÄúI‚Äôm in favor of more infrastructure but I think that the government can carry this out directly. I don‚Äôt think we need a special bank for the purpose.‚Äù ‚Äî Oliver Hart

&gt;‚ÄúThe nation‚Äôs infrastructure is in a pitiful state, with negative consequences for US economic growth. Something needs to be done about it. I‚Äôm not sure whether this is the best proposal, but it‚Äôs probably better than nothing.‚Äù ‚Äî Daron Acemoglu


**Make tuition free at public colleges and universities.**

Supported by: Sanders

Consensus: Bad (1 good, 1 debatable, 20 bad)

&gt;‚ÄúThis proposal is too indiscriminate. Many students can afford to pay a considerable amount toward their higher education. It is wasteful to give them a free ride.‚Äù ‚Äî Eric Maskin


**Make tuition free at community colleges for students who contribute earnings from working 10 hours a week.**

Supported by: Clinton

Consensus: Debatable (5 good, 9 debatable, 8 bad)

&gt;‚ÄúThis proposal does a much better job than [free tuition for all] at targeting the students who need the tuition assistance.‚Äù ‚Äî Eric Maskin

&gt;‚ÄúWe know that one of the biggest problems is completion ‚Äî so I worry a little about conditioning this benefit on working.‚Äù ‚Äî Hilary Hoynes

&gt;‚ÄúBorrowing at a decent rate and paying it back through withholding would be better than forcing some students to take bad part-time jobs.‚Äù ‚Äî Pete	Klenow


**Impose a ‚Äúspeculator tax.‚Äù Stock trades will be taxed at 0.5 percent and bonds at 0.1 percent.**

Supported By: Sanders

Consensus: Debatable (4 good, 6 debatable, 12 bad)

&gt;‚ÄúThough a case can be made for a transactions tax, these rates are really high.‚Äù ‚Äî Richard Thaler

&gt;‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know whether the exact numbers are right but I think that there are good reasons to throw a little sand into the gears of stock and bond trading.‚Äù ‚Äî Oliver Hart

**Raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.**

Supported By: Sanders

Consensus: Bad (2 good, 4 debatable, 16 bad) 

&gt;‚ÄúSome increase in the minimum wage would be good. $15/hour may be too high.‚Äù ‚Äî David Cutler


**Trump's tax proposal: ‚ÄúIf you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households -- over 50 percent -- from the income tax rolls.‚Äù**

Supported By: Trump

Consensus: Debatable (2 good, 9 debatable, 11 bad)

&gt;‚ÄúFirst and most importantly, it is highly unlikely to raise enough tax revenue to fund current (or even reduced) government spending. Second, it is not a good idea to create a culture where more than 1/2 the country does not pay taxes.‚Äù ‚Äî Steve Kaplan

&gt;‚ÄúThis may be a pretty effective way to redistribute to the bottom half of the income distribution, assuming that it is done in a revenue neutral way by taxing the rich more.‚Äù ‚Äî Abhijit Banerjee


**Switch to the ‚ÄúCruz Simple Flat Tax.‚Äù Everyone pays the same 10 percent tax rate. It retains some version of the earned income tax credit and deductions for lower-income families.**

Supported by: Cruz

Consensus: Bad (1 good, 21 bad)

None of those issues were serious roadblocks for slow and steady growth in the U.S. and the globe, argued Nixon, who used her down-home way of explaining complex economic issues to talk clients out of cutting and running to safety. 

&gt; Quite the opposite. Instead, Nixon urged them to use the rout to buy riskier assets. One Northern Trust client with more than $15 million did just that.

1. Immigration
2. Refugees
3. The economy going foward
4. Education
5. The military
6 the constitution

  Every country needs and almost all have immigration laws. Try to go illegally into Mexico or some other country. Maybe we could use some changes to our immigration laws, but they have to be obeyed adn violators should be deported. Mexico would not be so dysfunctional if it were not for the drug lords, and it could be fixed. Relaxing our current drug laws will only enrich those barbarians in Mexico and enrich some Americans invested in the business, and will not help our young compete for jobs in the increasingly high tech world, in fact it will have very negative effects. Raise your kids responsibly and crime and drug use will decline dramatically. The laws and prison are not the problem, it is lack of responsible parenting !! And yes, immigrants have taken almost all the new jobs in the last 5 years.  And research has shown that a very large % of illegals do in fact collect various forms of welfare !!

  Refugees are a problem. WE as well as the Europeans have come to realize that as these different groups are escaping the countries that they have allowed to become so dysfunctionsal and dangerous, but with them are a significant number of radicals and many that demand this and that and do not appreciate the generousnes of the countries they are coming to. One of our governments most important missions is to protect the American people. The current policits says on one side we need to pause and figure out how to identify the radicals and track those who are allowed in. We are offering alot to these people, and they have done nothing for our country, so they will have to be patient, or go back to their home country and make the sacrifices and fi it. It must be remembered that Americaq has wlcomed more people from more parts of the world than all the world added together, so to get angry with our caution is not reasonable. Americans have worked hard and sacrificed much to get tobe the country that everybody wants to come to. 

  Our economy is struggling currently, and no matter how much the President tries to hype how great a job he and his team have done, in fact they have done a very poor job. Historically, since the Great Depression, recessions have turned positive in 18 months. Ours has been flat at best. The BEA ( thats the Bureau of Economic Analysis a federal agency ) has pointe3d out that since they first began keeping data ( 1929) the past 10 years has been the only 10 period that has had every year during that period with below 3% GDP growth. Not a good performnce, and a good example of their incompetent performance. We have the highest Corp taxes in the developed world. We are so over regulated that it is very difficult to compete without govt help. Our total national debt is about $20,000,000,000,000, thats trillion, and has doubled under Obama. Entitlements have exploded. Consumer debt, student debt, mortage debt have also exploded. And our $$$ has lost 90% of its value since the 1970's. Under Obama the money supply has increased by more that 300%. People in govt have gotten enriched, Wall Street has been enriched, while taking bailouts and contributing to the Democrat campaigns mostly. Companies like GE and Solyndra get govt favors and GE paid no corp taxes for a few years. 
This is supposed to be the smartest people i the room, maybe we need to improve our education system to teach them to be smarter thinkers !!

Read Tony Wagners ""Most Likely to Suceed"" and you will understand why we have many of these problems, and why we seem to put people in positions of power and don't understand why things are going wrong.

  Why are we making our military weaker, Russia, Shina ISIS etc would or should dictate a smarter and stronger military and tell them the mission and let them carry it out, stop Washington from making all the decisions, they are not trained for it.

- We can also remove plenty of regulations because people aren't coerced to work.

- Reduction in Petty Crimes, Work Stress

- The most powerful tool to fight deflation.

- Since the poor will spend 100% of UBI, all the money pretty much goes back to capital holders increasing their revenues (and overall GDP), which also increases asset prices.

- The Poor, The Working Class and The Rich all benefit from this.

- Easily financed by taxing the top 0.5% or outright debt monitization i.e print money and send checks to citizens.

- Another tool for Fed/Treasury to easily control Inflation/Deflation by adjusting UBIs. i.e if for some reason there is demand for labor (signalled by wage inflation), the government can respond by reducing UBI)

Why UBI?

Exponential (Digital) Technologies always act as massive forces of deflation on Economies (See Japan, Europe and lately USA).

So, Holders of Capital have two choices

Hold on to their Capital for ‚Äò-‚Äôve interest rates and watch their assets slowly deplete (including bouts of deflationary death spirals or outright destruction of their wealth) (See Japan, Europe and mostly USA in the near future)

OR

Invest in the deflation-defeating ‚Äòidea‚Äô of Socialism. Capital invested in Socialism in a deflationary world will provide higher returns.

The Poor will spend 100% of the money which flows right back to the producers (In a digital world, marginal cost for producers is $0).

This results in higher Revenue, higher asset prices and higher ‚ÄúReturn on Capital‚Äù for the Capitalists.

**Of the many places/ideas to invest, Capitalists can do far worse than investing in the idea of Socialism**

personalfinance,"I paid off $26,000 in student loan debt in 18 months, making $50,000 a year before taxes.","I took out six federal loans and one private loan while in school. My private loan had a 9% floating interest rate on $5,000 (Lol Sallie Mae). I tackled this loan first in the first 6 months of student debt pay off, using the entire paycheck I made from my on-campus job (I think I made $10.50 an hour). 

I found a full time job January 2015 during my last semester of school. I worked 40 hours a week while taking 18 credits, and received paychecks in accordance to the $50,000 before taxes. I also put 10% of gross pay towards a 401(k). My living expenses per month were &lt;$800. I had a roommate, limited groceries to $150, paid for my phone and Internet and did not have a car (public transportation, which my company reimburses). I allocated $50 to other necessities (hygiene products, cleaning products, the occasional meal out, etc) however this money was rarely used. By this point in time I hadn't bought clothes in 3 years (other than a couple of shirts and 1 pair of pants for work [bought at H&amp;M]). I also hadn't had a haircut in 3 years (I'm a woman, I can get mildly get away with this :) ), taken any trips that I paid for (there was a study abroad, but it was all paid for with scholarships), or done anything else that would increase expenditure. For some this might be miserable, for me, I knew paying off my debt in less than 2 years would make it worth it. 

A couple of unpredictable situations came up as they usually do. I moved to an apartment where I live alone and away from public transportation, so I had to get a car [2003 Sonata, $2.5k on Craigslist]. Even with these new expenses, I still kept my monthly expenses (both fixed and flexible) &lt;$1,500. 

The occasional ""treat"" did sprinkle its way in (even I had to stay sane), but again, I always kept my eye on the prize of student loan pay off. 

I also took a weighted risk, I didn't save a ton of money for an emergency fund [which as someone on their own with no family support isn't a very intelligent thing to do] and I also did not invest other than my 401(k). The emergency fund, I just happened to get lucky. Nothing occurred that I couldn't pay for by either lowering a payment or pulling it out of my checking account. As for investing, a year lost on interest is something I can easily make up now that my student loans are paid off. 

What I did was risky, to not have that emergency fund, lucky, to have a well paying job, and at times miserable, to live so below my means that sometimes I doubted my methodology. When I made that final loan payment, I couldn't have been happier that with hard work and self-discipline my debt was finally gone.

If this post is a little sporadic, my apologies.I always liked reading these posts when I was in school/freaking out about repayment. 

Edit-- The point was to live frugally while in school and in loan repayment. My future finances have allotments for the things I enjoy along with building a strong emergency fund (12 months living expenses) and investments.",finance,1457818526
personalfinance,A few years ago I put myself into a crappy situation by cosigning for student loans that are now due. Questions and despair inside!,"Hello! Cross-posted (partially) from r/legaladvice.

When I was younger and naive, I cosigned 5 student loans from Sallie Mae for my now ex-boyfriend. The loans are now out of the deferment period and have payments due on 3/22/16. Total amount of the loans is ~$103,000 and the monthly payment amount for all 5 is $1131.60. Interest rates are abhorrently high, between 9.25%-9.75%. I have a FICO score of 735 per Sallie Mae yesterday, and 705-740 per Credit Karma, also yesterday.

Currently after tax I am bringing in $1600/month. Rent/utilities is $665, car payment of $323.91 (remaining balance is just over $16,000 @ 3.14%), credit card balance of $2875 making more than the minimum monthly payments. Currently in school in a 2-year program (higher earning potential than right now) that my grandfather is paying tuition for.

I called Sallie Mae to see about their options, because he is unemployed and I will probably need to make some payments on this. His idea is to opt into forbearance for all 5 of the loans until he gets a job in his field. The maximum amount of time available for forbearance is 12 months through the life of the loans. 12 months of interest gathering on all 5 of the loans adds another $8-9000 to the balance.

3/5 of the loans qualify for graduation repayment, where the payments are only the monthly interest for a term of 12 months, then I would have to either defer them or pay the full payment amount. This option results in a ~$369/month payment on those 3 loans. If we were to start forbearance on the 3 loans that qualify for graduation repayment, it would not be an option afterwards, whereas we would be able to do graduation repayment and then forbearance if need be. The other 2 loans are too old to qualify, and their monthly payments together are just over $600. Graduation repayment on the newer 3 loans + regular monthly payments on 2 older loans is still just under $1000, which is not really feasible for me. 

As of right now, my plan is to start graduation repayment on 3/5 that qualify, and forbearance on the other 2. After the year of graduation repayment is up, I would put those 3 loans into forbearance and start paying on the 2 older loans. If my ex calls Sallie Mae before I do to put forbearance on all 5 of the loans, I would still plan on paying towards the interest. I'm planning on talking to some lawyers this week to explore any other options, even if it means going through bankruptcy just to get my name off these damned loans (through searching google and here, I realize this is probably not going to happen). 

I'm already looking for ways to cut costs and am going to get started with MINT or YNAB to keep myself in check further. I guess my questions are the following:

* Given the circumstances, does my plan sound pretty reasonable? The financial counselor I spoke with yesterday thought so if the legal route doesn't pan out.
* Can I, as a cosigner, claim payments towards the interest on these loans on tax returns? I believe I saw on Sallie Mae that cosigners receive no tax benefits from student loan payments.
* How would this impact getting married in the future? My understanding is that pre-marital assets/debts do not get assimilated by the spouse after marriage unless they're both signers for it. However, I've also seen that certain repayment plans may look at both spouse's incomes in determining reduced payments, regardless of whose name is on the loan. Also, I think those repayment plans that were affected by both incomes were NOT private loans, so I just wanted some clarification there. 
* Realistically, would I even be able to consolidate these through an outside company/bank/lender? Sallie Mae suggested Wells Fargo since they don't offer consolidation, and I saw on CreditKarma a bunch of options of institutions that I've never heard of, but even with a stellar credit score, is a bank really going to give me an unsecured $100k loan? Also I don't want to just assume this debt from him, so any insight on that process/him cosigning just to put his name on the loan would be welcome.

Thank you for sticking through reading that mess, and for any insight you have!

Ex link&gt;(http://www.financialsamurai.com/mortgage-interest-deduction-limit-and-income-phaseout/).  Some links also say in California you can ""double dip"" the interest deduction.

personalfinance,Having a hard time thinking through my payment options.,"Okay, Reddit. I am having a very hard time thinking through my student loan situation. My student loan account has a balance of $19,587.66. My minimum monthly payments are $204.73/month. The average interest rate for these loans is about 4%. I have no issue making my monthly payment. My question is whether or not I should try to pay extra on these loans, and here is the reason: I will be eligible for Title I Student Loan Forgiveness in August of 2020. As far as I understand it, after five years of service in a Title I school I am eligible for a one-time ""lump-sum"" forgiveness that amounts to anywhere between $5,500 and $17,500 (depending on my income at that point). It is also my understanding that the minimum is $5,500 no matter what - even if I was miraculously making $1,000,000/year at that point. (If anyone has any knowledge otherwise PLEASE let me know). 

I have no other debt. My savings goals are well on their way to being met (emergency fund, retirement, home down-payment, etc.). My thought is to pay the minimum until August of 2020 (at which point the balance would be somewhere around $11,000), see how much the program actually forgives, and then aggressively pay off the rest. Is this foolishness? My calculations (that, admittedly, could be wrong) show that even if I paid the minimum for 10 years, the total amount of interest on the loan would be about $5,000. So, it seems that I could essentially pay the minimum amount on these loans and end up paying $0 in interest and even a $500 principal reduction ($5000 in total interest - $5,500 forgiveness). Or, if I paid the loans aggressively after August of 2020 I could save even more money. There is, of course, the possibility that an amount greater than $5,500 would be forgiven. 

So, given this information, what do you think I should do?",finance,1457830475

personalfinance,Defaulted Student Loans - Best Solution?,"Dear /r/personalfinance,

I currently have two defaulted federal student loans with a combined balance of around 9k.The loans were sent into collection last May, so just under a year. Good news is that, by the end of this month, I will have enough cash to pay off the loans in full.

My issue is that, throughout my desperate searching of the Internet,  I cannot seem to find any good sources of information regarding which payment option is ultimately best for my credit score. I'm young and recently started a good paying career, I will need a new car soon and have yet to take a mortgage out on a house, so having a decent credit score at the moment is an important goal for me. 

I'm aware of rehabilitation programs, but if I have the money now, why spend the next year making payments? Why does this seem to be the only good option in terms of improving credit impact? (The only logical reason I can think of is to prove responsibility via on time payments? Is this a correct assumption?) What benefit is there compared to a settlement?

I called the collection agency and the agent went through the options, when he explained the rehab program, he spoke very fast for what seemed like 5 minutes, it was almost like it was intentionally difficult to follow.. I requested them to get the least amount the government would take as a full payment and will speak to him again next week. No agreement has been made yet. 

So my main question is: What is best for my credit score? Follow through with a 90 day settlement agreement or do the rehabilitation program?
Is there any leverage I have into getting them to put the account in good standing (show up as payed / remove defaulted status)? Is there a way to get them to delete the account from the report if payed in full with collection fees? (A long shot I'm guessing)

financialindependence,One Year Update,"I [posted about a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/308xtv/on_track_to_re_by_50/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) regarding my wife and mine's plans for retiring by about age 50.  Here's a little update on our current progress over the last year.

Current ages:  30 and 29.  We have one child, with another on the way this summer.  Our arrangement with paying my MIL for childcare (and utilizing an FSA) is working out very well, but with the new little one on the way, we're planning on having the older child in daycare in a few months (for socialization, and so our infant gets 100% attention from my MIL).  This will unfortunately increase our childcare costs by a significant amount.

Combined pre-tax income:  About $153k (*~6% increase*).  Unfortunately, my wife's workplace doesn't offer maternity leave, so she will go a couple months without pay this summer once her vacation time runs out.

**Assets:**

Cash/emergency fund:  ~$35k (*little change*).  We considered increasing this last year, but eventually decided to start a taxable investment account instead.

Tax advantaged Retirement/HSA accounts:  ~$189k (*14% increase*).  Not a great year for our investments - we put in well over $30k to our tax advantaged accounts but they only went up by ~$24k.  But it's kind of hard to rattle us, considering we've been doing this since 2007.

529 accounts:  ~$6k (*new*).  Started a new 529 account for our kid.

Taxable investments:  ~$8k (*new*).  Maybe jumping the gun a bit here since we aren't completely maxing out our 401k's yet.  But we're thinking of this as another tier of medium term savings, to be used for potential home renovations or as another line of emergency savings.  Although it could eventually help with early retirement to help with waiting periods for Roth account rollovers and such.

Vehicles:  $35k KBB value of three cars (*-17% decrease*).  Same cars as last year, biggest depreciation hit was on the newest kid hauler car.

Home:  We changed how we're doing our ""conservative"" home estimate from the purchase price to using the MSA home index for our area.  Using that measure, our home value is now ~$446k (*5% increase using the same methodology*).  Zillow estimates of course, are crazy volatile, and is currently at $465k (*-12% decrease*).

**Debts:**

Car loan:  $11k at 1.75%.  Got some heat for paying extra towards this last year because of the low interest rate, still don't care.  Would rather have the increased cash flow by paying it off early.

Mortgage:  $306k at 3.125%.  Still no plans to accelerate payments on this.

**Net Worth:**

$421k using Zillow (*-3% decrease*), $402k using MSA home index (*15% increase*).  Overall, not a great year financially, but not terrible either.

**Current plans going forward:**

Continue maxing out our Roth IRA's.  We're up to ~$16k/year towards my work's 401k, and ~$9k/year towards my wife's 401k (until very recently, my wife's plan only offered funds with very high fees, but fortunately things have improved).  We should be able to max out mine in the next year or so, then will work on increasing my wife's contribution rate.  Plan to have both maxed out before 2020.

Continue to contribute about $3k/year to the kid's 529, and start a new one for the soon-to-be infant later this year.

Start shoveling spare cash towards that taxable investment account.  Current estimate is roughly $5-10k a year towards taxable investments, but depending on our career growth that could accelerate.

Shooting for $200k combined income by 2020.  I think with our current trajectory, we might hit FI by about 2030 (~age 45 for us with about $1.5-2M Net Worth), not sure if we'd really step away from our jobs at that point, we'll see how it goes.

Penn Fed rate is at 3.625% with closing costs of $5884, no PMI and cash out $11,616 to put me at an 80% LTV.

Quicken is at 3.75% and an APR of 4.022%.  They advised no PMI and could cash out the amount that I needed.

personalfinance,401k Roth contributions or Pre-Tax 401k?,"Hello /r/personalfinance. Big fan of the sub, been following for the past few months and have been making better financial decisions in my life based on the advise and discussion found here.

My employer just started offering 401k ROTH contributions as an option to their plan starting this year. I have been contributing 5% pre tax since I started the job in June 2014. (They match the first 3% 100% and then the next 2% they will match 50%, so a total of a 4% match basically).

My question is now that they offer ROTH as an option, should I change my contributions from pre-tax to ROTH? I know I do not want to convert my current pre-tax balance because I will be hit with a huge tax bill next year, but I am not sure if I should change my contributions going forward.

FYI - Currently looking into setting up a ROTH IRA as well, is having two different ROTH accounts counter productive?

personalfinance,How manageable is $80k-100k in student loans?,"**Background/Where I'm at right now:**

I'm currently a senior in high school and I'm at the stage where I'm deciding where to go to college. My number one choice is a school (UMD) that costs about 24k a year with in-state tuition and expected living expenses included. I'd be studying business, but I'm deciding on finance, accounting, or management

Now, my family has never made a lot of money. Neither of my parents went to college (I'm the first in my family to go, which makes this whole process a lot more confusing), and my mom makes about $40k a year working two jobs, with my sister and I as dependents. With this, I qualify for some federal aid (FAFSA says I'm elligible for a $3900 Pell Grant). I'm also waiting to hear back to see if I received any financial aid or scholarships from my first choice school.



**Question/What's My Plan:**

I believe in investing in my education. However, I don't really know the point of where cost outweighs benefit. Like I said, I don't know a lot about the college process. I'm not really sure how federal aid and scholarships turn out, so let's assume the worst (no aid), possibly a little better ($4k aid). I take out $80k-$96k in student loans to pay for my four years.

I guess what I want to know is if an $80k (w/ interest) loan worth it, as an investment? Is it worth it to obtain a degree from a school like UMD, or do I just take the cheaper route and get a degree from a community college? 

Obviously there are other experiences that come with going to college, but I'd like to look at it from a purely economic standpoint here. To the people who have loans like these and possibly went through the same decision process I am now: was it worth it? How long does it take to pay these off, and how comfortable will I be living while paying them?

personalfinance,Paying off school loans when employer matches payments.,"Have a question about paying off school loans.  

I know someone who works for a company that will match school loan payments, up to $167/month, for a total of $10k over 5 years. The company won't pay more than the $167 a month, and they just started this policy.

He has about $30k total in two loans, with a sub-8% interest rate. and is making about $40k per year, gross. 

I personally think that he should only pay the minimum that he can on the loan, as long as it is at least the $167.  Since his interest is less than the market average, I suggested he decide how much over the minimum payments he would want to spend on school payments, and instead put that toward his (currently) non-existent retirement.  
After the end of the payment matching, then he should aggressively pay off the loans.  

My thoughts are that he doesn't want to pay off the loans before the 5 years, because he would lose out on free money.
 
I know there is something to be said for being debt free, and not having school loans hanging over your head, but isn't it better to take full advantage of the employer matching while funding retirement accounts?

Thoughts?

I make $40,000 a year and I'm putting 3/4 of my income toward these loans (I have two other loans that total $300/mo but they are federal and I don't have trouble paying those). I thought I would be able to budget for this, but it seems nearly impossible to finance this, especially if I have no emergency fund and am putting off important expenses like fixing my car or getting my glasses fixed.

I've been doing some research, and from what I have read, my options are as follows:

1)  Filing for Chapter 7 or 13 bankruptcy if my loans qualify as an ""undue hardship"" 

2) Simply ignoring my loan payments, allowing them to default and be harassed by a collection agency, impacting my credit score, and crossing my fingers that the collection agency doesn't sue be within the statute of limitations of three years (in the state of Maryland) and also live a life where I don't have anxiety about loan payments and I can do enjoyable things like visit my family or get an oil change

3) A settlement where a third party company settles my debt and I then pay the third party back with whatever the lower and adjusted debt ends up being

4) Change nothing and continue paying my loans and be broke for the next 20 years while I end up paying roughly $260,000 (after interest is added).

I additionally have roughly $55,000 in federal student loans but I understand those are nearly impossible to negotiate and I can afford their monthly payments since they are based on my income.

My private loans don't negotiate based on my income or other expenses, they simply want $1,400/mo no matter what the circumstances are.

The $50,000 federal loans I had to take out for my Master's degree not because I had to pay for that degree, but because my private student loans from my Bachelor's degree refused to defer my payments (and my stipend barely covered my entire monthly payments), I had to take federal loans out to pay my private undergrad loans, wonderful cycle.",finance,1457893471

personalfinance,Cash savings bonds in for student loan?,"I have about 16K in one student loan (held by the federal government). I now pay $195 a month. We can afford this, barely. But we really want to just pay the whole thing off. 

I also have approximately 15K in savings. We REFUSE to touch this because we occasionally have emergencies. Last year, my husband suddenly lost his job and we were very lucky to have some cash reserves. 

My parents purchased a lot of saving bonds during my teenage years. Basically, the current value of these is approximately 44K. About half of that value comes from the accrued interest. So, if we were to cash these out, we would have to pay maybe 8K in taxes. That's my rough estimate, but I could be wrong. And these bonds haven't yet matured. Once they mature, their total value will be approximately 65K. 

We are conflicted. We were initially going to cash in 16K worth of the bonds to pay off the student loan. We thought we could deduct the interest because it was going toward education. But apparently, the IRS won't let you deduct bond interest for student loans. 

Should we just cash in the bonds, pay off the taxes? Would this save us a lot of the interest that we pay toward the government over the next ten years while we pay off the 16K?

I contribute $100/mo to a HSA as I have a bronze level, high deductible health insurance plan.

* Paid about $8000 in student loan principle
* 401k currently has $5200 in it (fully vested)
* HSA currently has about $800 in it

There were also a lot of expenses in 2015 as I got my life back in order after living in poverty for the past decade of my life (dental work, health expenses, end-of-life expenses for old dog, professional wardrobe, car maintenance, car got totaled so had to get another one, etc.) Big expenses for 2016 is I will be moving this summer to be closer to work as I am currently commuting 2.5 hours a day. Rent will probably increase significantly due to moving closer to the city.

I looked into refinancing my loans. SoFi gave me a projected interest rate of 6.1%. Lender Club 5.9%. There was another one at 6.2%.

I have been irresponsible in my budgeting in the past, and it is finally catching up with me. But, I want to be proactive. I have $77k in federal loans from my undergraduate and graduate degree. 

Here is the breakdown:

$14500 subsidized
$62500 unsubsidized

I have one credit card with a $5500 limit that I keep a $2500-$3500 balance on. Still no interest on the balance for 6 more months.

No car payment, no mortgage, no dependents.

I have just accepted a job (Fuck yeah!) that pays $65,000/year. 5% 401k matching. Company covers my health insurance cost as I'll be a manager. Company car and gas card. What I am trying to figure out is how much I should budget for loans/month. I want the direct plan, and would rather repay them sooner than 10 years if possible.  Here is my current plan, I would appreciate constructive criticism, and advice.

Taking into consideration the state's tax rate, I should be taking home right at $50,000/year ($4170/month). Subtract my 5% 401k contribution (I know this is actually pretax but for a rough estimated) =-$270/month. So now I am down to $3900/month. Now for my expenses:

I will be moving soon to a new city, and am going to be renting. 
I have set my budget for rent at $1000. (Probably $1150 with utilities) ........down to $2750/month

-Car and renters insurance-$100/month.....$2650/month

-Gas/month (non company car) $200.......$2450/month

-Paying credit card to 0 balance $400/month.....$2050

-Climbing gym membership $50/month.....$2000

-Food/going out, $400/month (I like to go out but will limit).....$1600

-Miscellaneous $200/month.....$1400

If I have the potential to have $1400/month in left over income, should I put $1200/month towards my loan? This would shorten the term of the loan by 3.4 years to just 6.6 years (instead of 10). If I throw all my extra income ($1400) at it it shortens the loan term to 5.4 years...but I have no rainy day fund. Maybe this is too unrealistic.  After 6 months I should have an extra $400 to start splitting between my student loan repayments and savings fund. 

My realistic thought is that for the first 6 months I pay $1000/month, after 6 months I'll raise it to $1200(salary re-negotiation at 6 months as well per the interview as well). Reevaluate in 3 months at try and raise it again to the $1400.

I graduated from college in August 2015 and started working for a major US telecom company in September 2015. I love the job and I don't see any major career changes for the next few years. 

I currently live with my parents; they don't ask for any money from me for anything. Marriage and children are still a few years away. 

Here are the numbers: 

* Checking: $2,500 and Savings: $7,800. With every paycheck I transfer the previous balance from my checking into my savings. The bank has 0.39% dividends on the savings account.
* Base annual salary is $85,400. Of that, I pocket $61,488 because of state and federal taxes. 
* I contribute 6% of my base salary to my 401k, with a full company match. 52.3% is allocated to my company's shares fund, 35.9% to the stable value fund, and 12.11% to the large cap US stock index fund. Current balance is $4,633.73 with a personal rate of return YTD of 6.6%. 
* In summer of 2014, I purchased 22 shares of VNQ at $88.01/share. I haven't touched it since and I've earned dividends every quarter. 
* I started with about $12k in student loans when I graduated college. In 6 months I've brought it down to $4k and I plan to pay it off in the next two months by contributing $2k each month. The interest rate on this loan is 6.8%. 
* Auto loan is through a credit union with a balance of 12k with an interest rate of 2.49%. I pay $250 per month.  
* Leisure expenses amount to $300-$500 per month. My credit card limit is $500 and most of my expenses go on it. I pay it off in full every time I get a statement. 

The dilemma I'm having right now is that I don't have any real expenses and most of my money is going straight into my savings account. The only real financial goal at this point is to have enough money to put a down payment on a home. But that's not for at least another 3-4 years. 

While I still have some time on my hands and no real responsibilities, I feel like I can be a little more risky with my money or I can put it somewhere with a higher rate of return than my savings account.

I'd want to get the SE fully loaded so roughly 35000, or a monthly payment of almost 600. Obviously less if I traded in my Corolla and put a down payment.

I know 600 is ridiculous and then there's the factor of insurance. But here's the thing. I'm a nurse and one shift of overtime is roughly 500 or so after taxes. I aim to pick up at least one per week (if available) so that's roughly an extra 2000 a month. Sometimes they offer double time which is even more than 500 a month. When the census gets lower, I plan to do some nursing on the side as well. 

Would it still be ridiculous to spend that much on a new car? I plan on keeping this car for a while. I currently have a 2007 Corolla that has 150k miles on it and starting to feel it's age. Still runs great but just getting older and making more noises.

The main reason I'm considering is because of how low interest rates are right now. I'm nervous that by the time I run my Corolla into the ground, interest rates will be up and then I lose the value of my Corolla as a trade in.

I am already maxing my Roth and 401a. I also would still have enough to save $1200 a month for general savings. Already have a 10k emergency fund.

There is another vendor named sofi which gives loans up to $100k, but only to US citizens or permanent residents.

My question is, could I take multiple loans here, in the US, which would help me finance my house purchase in my home country, or are there any providers which would give me a loan up to $100k with an interest rate of around 5-7% ?

Thank you in advance.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I can save up to $3900 X 12 X 3 = $140400 according to my current saving strategy, and hence can repay the loan in 2.5 - 3 years, if i get a 5-7% interest rate.",finance,1457930414

personalfinance,"Currently offered a promotion at both part time jobs, but I can only pick one. Which one provides better income?","for starters, I live in Idaho. also, all wage-earned numbers represent my post-tax income.

I currently have two part time jobs, and am currently being offered a promotion at both jobs. 

I am offered a promotion from a substitute school bus driver to being a regular school bus driver. I would average about 20-25 hours per week, 8.5 months out of the year. My wage would be $10.50/hour, and I don't pay federal income tax with this job because i'm a state employee. If I pick this job, I can still work at the call center for the other 3.5 months out of the year, averaging ~$700/month.

I have been offered a position as a supervisor at the call center I work at. The pay would be ~$9.50/hour, working 25-30 hours per week, every week of the year.

if I want to maximize the income-per-time spent working, its a no-brainer, because the school bus driver position would be the better bet. 

at the same time, the supervisor position might be a better long-term bet because of the skills and more resume-worthy job experience.

also, if I pick the supervisor position at the call center, I can still (luckily) work as a substitute bus driver in the mornings. If I do that, I can still average $200-$250/month as a substitute school bus driver, so that would supplement my income as a supervisor.

currently (with my current schedule) I earn $1,150/month of post-tax income for 8.5 months out of the year, due to working both jobs during the public school season. for the other 3.5 months out of the year, it would be more like $700/month because i would only be a dialer at the call center.",finance,1457936124

personalfinance,"Should I pay off high interest loan first, or high balance no interest credit card?","TL;DR: Need to figure out if I should pay off high interest loan first or credit cards in grace period.

I've got some extra money coming my way the next couple of months. I'm trying to pay off my debt and want some sound input. 

The way I see it is I have two options when it comes to using my extra money. I can either pay the extra amount to a high interest personal loan I have, reducing interest paid in the long run and paying the loan off by the end of the year. 

Or I could pay off one of my high balance credit cards that are still in the 12 month grace period of no interest. This would lower my credit utilization and improve my credit score.

I'm not planning on buying a car or house in the next three years, so I could suffer the lower score from having such a 50% credit utilization as i make minimum payments to the cards and focus on paying off the loan. I should be able to have the loan paid off though if I focus on that and then use the freed money from payments towards the credit cards.

I'm afraid if I focus on paying off the loan and just make the minimum payments to the credit cards, that when the grace period ends the interest rate on the credit cards will be high due to poor credit/high utilization. The amount I have on the cards is roughly 2k more than the amount of the personal loan, so I don't think I can fully pay them off by the time the grace period ends.

Is it smarter to pay the no interest credit cards now to improve my credit score, or should I pay the high interest loan off and not worry about my credit score?

Edit: Numbers:
Personal loan - 23.98% interest. Payoff amount is currently 4176.28
1st Credit Card Fred Meyer VIsa - 3958.56 with grace period ending Jan 2017
2nd Credit Card Chase Slate - 1900 with grace period ending April 2017, amount from balance transfer from third card.

By the end of next month I will have paid off a third card at 21.24% interest with 1100 currently remaining.",finance,1457945127

We are both going to be attending a large public university a few hours from our hometown. Some backround on our situation: My family is middle class and is able to provide but does not have enough to help me in college. I will be receiving no federal aid from the fafsa, but am an exceptional student and will hopefully do well with scholarships. My boyfriend is low income with a deceased parent. He receives the full Pell Grant and receives $650 a month (federal money) because of the passing of his parent. Our university requires students to live on campus the first two years so in the fall we will be living in dorms, which is an additional 11k on top of 10k tuition. Now my question: We have been seriously discussing marriage lately, not only out of our love for each other but from a financial stand point. Out philosophy is, if we know it's what we want to do might as well do it at a time that we can receive the most benefits. We have looked into marriage housing on campus which is a year lease and $500 a month including all utilities. If married I would also be able to receive the Pell Grant. The catch is he would no longer receive the $650 a month, which would last until he is 22 if he remained single. Other pros of marriage is the possibility of getting food stamps and other federal assistance beyond student aid. Are there any obstacles or aspects we should be weary about? I did a financial analysis and even losing the $650 a month we still save 10k over a 3 year period as a married couple versus single.

personalfinance,Student loan nearly doubled overnight?,"So I've been out of school more than a few years and have a student loan with My Great Lakes. I make a steady six figures at this point and have always had auto pay setup on my account, never really looking at it until about a year ago. I decided I'd had enough of debt and made a spreadsheet to total all my debt and figure out when I could be 100% debt free. I have literally tracked every source of debt for around 14 months now on a daily basis. The account with My Great Lakes has been dwindling as expected.

As of Friday, the amount in the account was $2,434.74 with 3.0% interest and a monthly payment of $152.76. The interest and monthly payments have never changed.

This morning, I opened the site to find an outstanding balance on my account summary of $4,293.89 with my standard payment of $152.76 due on April 10th, just as it is always due on the 10th. I checked my payment history and confirmed that every automatic payment has gone through as expected, for at least the past 12 months of history shown.

I checked my account details page to the find that my original solitary loan of $2,434.74 @ 3.0% has somehow been broken into two separate loans for the same university with different loan dates and balances; one is a current balance of $1,828.34 and the other is $2,465.55, both at a new interest rate of 3.32%. Both loan dates are from 2004.

What's even more worrying is that the future payment due section reflects my normal $152.76 due on the 10th, as well as a new line stating ""Total Due by 4/10/2016: $1,985.88"".

I'm not really sure how this could happen. As I've said, I have noted my exact account balance for around 14 months and there has been no fluctuation at all. Both of the new loan dates are listed as 2004.

I guess I'm looking for advice on how to proceed before I make any phone calls. I have taken screenshots of everything, including past billing statements showing only the original loan. I have screenshots of my payments made as well.

EDIT: Just took a closer look and I'm more confused now. My most recent billing statement said the following:

Original Loan Amount: $10,390.00

Remaining Balance: $2,583.29 (before my payment on 3/10)

Lifetime Amount Paid: $13,290.12

Total Principal Paid: $11,210.02 (more than the original loan amount?!? Not sure how that works, but I'm an engineer not an accountant)

Total Interest Paid: $2,035.10

Now that the account is split into two loans, it is summed up as the following:

Loan 1 had an original amount of $6,000.00 and a current balance of $2,465.55

Loan 2 had an original amount of $4,390.00 and a current balance of $1,828.34

So the Totals there add up the original loan amount, but suddenly I find myself with a significantly larger new balance, a significant portion of which is due in full by April 10th.",finance,1457964293

1) $25k federal loans through one servicer. Interest rate varies per ""chunk,"" 4-7%

2) $4k federal loans through another servicer. 6% interest.

3) $8k private loan through my university. 4% interest.


These loans have been weighing on my for some time. I've had to defer most of them for the past few years (I was on a stipend and couldn't make payments).

I'm finally in a place where I can start to pay these off. At the moment, I have about $15k cash in my bank account. I make about $4k per month in pure income (after housing/bills).

Because I'm finally in this place, I have to urge to just start paying these off as soon as possible. But, does it make sense?

I am making a good income at the moment, but there is absolutely no guarantee that will be true 6 months from now (I'm in a rather volatile industry).

On the other hand, I finally have some sort of a nest egg for a rainy day, and I'm not sure it's wise to lose that.

Would it make more sense to just make the required payments?

Would it make sense to maybe pay off the small loan, then make monthly payments on the others?

Basically, I don't know if it's wise to blow all of my cash to pay off loans that are, relatively speaking, low interest.

My husband and I live in California and I started doing our taxes last night using Turbotax Online.  I put everything in and it says we owe ~$6000 in federal taxes and we're getting ~$2000 refund from the state.  This is wacky because, on the federal side, it's literally a 180 from last year.  Last year we got about $6000 federal refund and $2000 state refund.  

Looking at the comparison of 2014 and 2015, there really aren't many differences, but here are some facts a few things that are in play:

-  We got married in October of 2014 so 2105 was our first full year married.  We changed our W-4s shortly after getting married and last year was the first time we filed jointly and we're doing so again this year.  We just double checked the W-4s and my husband, for unknown reasons and obviously wrongly, put down 3 exemptions (I have 2).  We also discovered that we are both marked as ""Single"" for state taxes (very weird for me as I did all the research and was very diligent in making sure I changed everything correctly).   So, W-4 issues are definitely coming into play, but are they really making all that difference, especially since they were also in play for a short part of 2014? 

- We refinanced our condo mid-2014 so 2015 was the first full year with the new mortgage and with our property taxed included in our mortgage payment.  I can't imagine this is making much of a difference, if any, though.

- I don't get bonuses but my husband does each year.  His total income, including the bonus, was about $140,000 with $20,000 of that being the bonus.  My income is about $70,000.  Our W-2s are very different in that my SS and Medicare wages are the same and also higher than my wages, tips, and other compensation.  His are all different and his wages, tips, and other compensation is the highest.  I assume this has something to do with the bonus, but even if you subtract that it's higher.  Is that how it should be?

- I finished paying off my student loans in early 2015, so I have much less interest to report this year (but our income is too high to get any credit anyway so i don't think this matters).  

So what gives?  Is this all just the result of messed up W-4s resulting in way too low withholdings?  If so, why weren't our 2014 taxes affected by this? Because we were only married 3 months of that year?  Or is there something else going on here?

Right now I am behind on everything as I just recently was employed.  I want to take care of it, but I have no idea where to start.  My payment that is due right now is over $1800, which I can not afford.  

My credit is poor because of this, and I don't think I will be able to get the loan refinanced.  I was able to consolidate the loans through the fed loan site awhile back.

By my rough calculations it's gonna be about 7 more years until we hit the magic 78% loan balance and can drop our PMI. 

We don't want to refinance because we have a great interest rate already and expect to stay put for a while, so it doesn't seem like it'd work in our favor. But that PMI payment every month really irritates me... So it occurred to me this morning, if we put an extra $100/month toward principal, it could shave a couple years off the PMI payments ‚Äî which according to my back-of-the-napkin math would be a roughly 50% return on investment.

Am I overlooking anything that would make this not a good idea? Our extra income is limited at the moment, so this would basically be happening instead of putting that $100 toward investments, which are obviously more liquid than equity in the house. But damn, 50% return!

- Went to college in Maryland, just graduated May 2015

- Currently living and working in DC

So in 2015:

- Jan-May I was still in college and living in Maryland. I worked part-time (work study) and made ~$1,000. Had federal but no state tax withheld on my W2.

- After graduation, went back home (Ohio) for the summer, but did not work.

- Moved to DC in September for a full-time job, and am currently still living there. Had DC taxes withheld on my W2 and made ~$30,000 from Sep-Dec.

Do I need to file my tax returns as a part year resident for Maryland and DC, and pay taxes to both states? Do I need to pay taxes to Ohio if I did not work there? Since the amount I earned in Maryland is small, do I need to pay federal/MD state taxes on it or is it under the threshold?

Also, am I still considered an Ohio resident? I still consider my parents' house there to be my ""permanent"" address, even though I currently live and work in DC. I did not register to become a DC resident because I am planning on moving in the fall to attend graduate school.

I wanted to run this situation I am in by you financial gurus and get your input.

Recently my employer paid out $1000 to me for referring an employee to them. I planned to use this money towards a down payment on a new car.

I got the referral bonus and my normal paycheck today on two seperate checks/stubs. **On the stub for the $1000 referral the federal govt tax withheld was $250**. I was also taxed for  Social Security, Medicare, State, and Local fees on this referral bonus bringing it down from $1000 to $632.

**The funny thing is my normal paycheck which is for $1,153 was only taxed $84.50 by Federal** on top of the others already taken from my referral(SS, Medicare, Local and State). After taxes my check was for $866.

So why is a referral bonus being taxed so hard? I feel my employer is being shady since the numbers do not add up in comparison to my normal paycheck.

personalfinance,Housing Loan Question,"So I'm looking to buy a house at the end of this year.  I'm looking at houses around $150,000 and plan to put a down payment of around $30k.

The company that my works 401k is through offers a loan from the 401k.  Up to $50k for 15 years.  The loan is tax and penalty free with an interest rate of 4.5%.  The interesting piece here is the interest from the loan goes back into the 401k.  So I'm basically loaning myself the money.  Figuring a 7% return on the $50k if left in the 401k, it would cost me around $12,000 in lost gains to take this money out.

However on a 30 year mortgage putting down my $30k and the $50k from the loan leaves me paying off a mortgage of $70k and the total cost of the loan being around $120k.

Only putting down my $30k leaves with a $120k mortgage and a total cost of the loan being around $204k.

Looking this over, it seems it would save me around $72k after subtracting out the lost potential gains on the 401k.

Am I missing something here?  The initial fee for the 401k loan is really small compared the the amount I'm able to take out.  It seems like its almost a to good to be true thing and there is some catch that I'm missing or some numbers that I'm looking at wrong.

The only downside I see taking the loan from my 401k is that if I leave my current company, then I have to repay the loan in full.  Though I'm not planning on leaving anytime soon, but a lot can change over the course of a 15 year loan.",finance,1458002937

OK I will try to keep this as generic as possible to avoid anything that could give away specifics about me.  I returned to the US after 5 plus years out of country.  When I returned, my credit had virtually disappeared, which was in most ways great as I was horrible with money in my early 30s.  

I returned to working life in September of 2010.  I write database software for a living, so was incredibly easy to find work when I was ready.  The first thing I did was get a free Capital One credit card to get simple credit in my name.  I worked a couple of different contract jobs and was able to save money incredibly fast.  I took a job working for a consulting firm doing work for state government.  

I write an ancient language called Powerbuilder and consider myself at the top of my game.  So it is incredibly easy for me to find work, however I love my current job and do not see me leaving it for at least 5 more years.  I have been at this job for 4 years now.  

I got in to flipping houses and have paid some contractors of a friend to flip two houses for me.  You can buy property in my area for under $30,000 in great neighborhoods with ease here.   The last flip is what has gotten me in big financial ""trouble"" as far as liquidity goes.  I bought a house for under $26,000 but put almost $54,000 more in to it.  So I put about $80,000 total in to the house all inclusive.  

I was able to sell it for around $110,000 to a great family on land contract.  They financed $100,000 at 6.5% which is on the lower end for interest rate for a land contract.  I was told I would be able to get $130,000 with ease, just never panned out.  However I still think if this land contract works out it is going to be an amazing deal for me, in the long term.  The contract has been re-written to get rid of the baloon payment so it is basically a 30 year loan that I collect 6.5% guaranteed income.  I also own another small starter home I rent out for $600/month and the tenant has approached me to buy the home.  I bought the home for under $30,000 put zero in to it, and have been renting it out pretty well for 3+ years.  

**Here are all my assets**

* My life - Never been married, no kids, no real bills.  Just my mortgage which is $1200 a month because I pay extra.  My salary is a little over $105,000 with amazing company benefits.  

* My home - $80,000 above water.  It is a 30 year mortgate that I have been paying an extra $400 a month above the mortgage.  Should have it paid off in 8 more years.  About $95,000 left on the mortgage at 3.5%.

* My rental property - $40,000 paid in full.  I only pay taxes on it now and have a tenant who makes her payments on time.

* My flipped house - $100,000 land contract that I collect 6.5% on.  I would keep this for the full 29 years if I could.  I love the terms and 6.5% guaranteed I think is pure profit for me.

* My car - I regret a little buying such a high end car brand new, but I paid it off in full last month.  I had the auto loan for 3 years.  I could easily sell this car for $27,000 now.

**Here are my bills**

* I have about $25,000 in credit card debt from flipping the house left.  75% of the credit card debt is 0% cash advance that is not due until middle 2017.  I am paying off roughly $3000/month on the non zero percent credit cards.

* I owe my Dad $4000 that he loaned me when the flip starting getting more expensive than I could handle.  I have a plan to pay him off in full come July.  He is not worried if I go longer, I just hate having a loan to him.

* Basic bills - Cable, HOA fees, Cell phone, Food, Insurance, Property Taxes, Normal life stuff is about $1400/month

**Here is the big problem.  I am not liquid at all now.**  My bank account only has $1000 in it because I am paying so much on my credit cards.  Taxes are going to hit me pretty hard I have a feeling this year...  I have no idea how I am going to do my taxes.  I need professional help without a doubt this year.

* So a recap of my cash flow.  Salary about $6000/month after taxes.  Flip house $750/month.  Rent $600/month.

* My credit is very good, but not amazing.  In the 740-760 range between the three agencies.  I have only just started to receive the flip payments and the auto loan just dropped off this month so that is going to help a WHOLE lot I hope.

**It just seems that I am treading water and not moving up fast enough with my salary and rental property....  I really need help on how to leverage what I have to take advantage better than I am doing.**

342,750 contract price, 10% down payment for $308,475.  1 Point for 3084.75 reduces interest rates from 3.875 to 3.625.  PITI estimated at $1860.22 with PMI and known taxes.

We plan on paying $3300 a month.

Running the total PMI and interest for the higher rate vs. the lower, we save ~5900 over the 10.7 years it takes to pay off the house.  More than the point.

Am I missing something?

Should I instead be comparing the opportunity cost... if I take the 3084.75 and invest it for 10.7 years, I need a yearly APR of ~6.3% to break even.

Over 30 years I wouldn't take it... but over 10?  10 year returns are such... a spectrum.  The less we pay below that 3300, the more value we get out of the point too right?

Also, not certain, we we're probably in itemization territory for 2016.

- ~16k in state income tax

- ~5700 in interest

- ~3k in a point

- ~1.5k in charitcable donations

That's itemization territory right?  Anyways, I am just curious what hidden concerns I am missing with buying a point.  Just seems like a slam dunk... or maybe an easy lay up.",finance,1458010063

Currently making $90,000/yr base, averaging $45,000 in bonus/yr. However, for this discussion, lets just assume the base salary is my only income. 

New home is a 3 bed 3 bath in a younger ""high end"" neighborhood, asking price is $365,000. The average interest rate I am being quoted is 4% on a 30 year note. So if you average out monthly, the mortgage, property tax and insurance, I get $2250/mo.

Currently, I spend around $1700/mo to live. In addition, if I were to buy the new home, I would generate around $800/mo in rent at my current condo ($45,000 value). Rent net income would be $5,000 yr after HOA, insurance and property tax but before income tax.

I looked at the gross salary divided by 40 rule, as well as 33% rule. The $2250/mo cost seems to run right up against it. So I'm look at getting roommates as well. I believe I can get 2 roommates at $700-$800/mo per. Does anyone have any horror stories about renting out the rooms to roommates? What should I assume as far as monthly maintenance cost? If roommates fell through, can I afford this on my own? Or is it too much home and I'll be ""house poor""?

I'm 27 and I've always been quite bad with money; when I have money I spend it. I'm fed up of constantly being skint at the end of the month. 

I've followed this subreddit for a while and I know I need to set up an emergency fund and probably as well I need a savings account just to separate my funds and my funds in my mind. At present I have two accounts: my main one and another one I don't use/use occasionally. I also have a credit card which I just got last week. It has a tiny limit and I only have it build up a credit score and to occaionally rent cars; I have no intention of running up serious debts. 

I should probably add, I work as a teacher in Spain. My main income is from 2 different academies (around 900euros). One pays me every 2 weeks, the other pays me monthly halfway through the next month. I also have a side job doing skype classes online which can pay between 100 and 200 euros a month. I also have some private classes which equate to around 200-300 per month. My main problem is: all this money comes in at different times, a lot of it, by nature, is cash in hand and undeclared, and at the moment, due to only working this 'system' for the last few months, I haven't really got a handle on things. My outgoings are just as convoluted I pay my phone bill and my ""self employment fee"" (I'm not surprised spain's economy is screwed based on how expensive it is to be self employed) at the end of the month, my rent goes out in the middle of the month and obviously food bills etc are weekly. All of this is making it extremely difficult to figure things out and I'm struggling with how to get a handle on the situation/my finances.

I also expect to finish the academic year with about ¬£3k+ In savings. My financial plans are to buy my own house in the next 2 years in the region of about ¬£100k - ¬£130k. My parents are saving up a large sum to lend me so I can put a larger deposit down on the house, hopefully securing me a better mortgage with lower interest rates.

I'm aware that the company I'll likely be working for match pension contributions up to 5% of salary, and I intend to put the entire 5% in.

I also predict I'll have probably around ¬£33k in student debts, though I'm told I don't need to worry about it very much.

I live pretty cheaply, pretty much just spend money on food and transport and the occasional Xbox game. I'm not at all interested in a fancy car or anything like that, though I do like to travel. I have told myself that I won't go on any expensive holidays for a few years while I get my shit together, though.

As stated in the title, I want to put any spare money I have into investments, but really know very little about them. I've tried teaching myself via google, but the terminology is very overwhelming and I find myself constantly flicking between tabs asking myself ""what's that thing again?""

Where should I begin, reddit? The more simply you can explain things to me, the better. Any help much appreciated.

EDIT: I should also mention that I'm not looking for any relatively quick returns. I just want to supplement my income, and leave myself with a little more money when I'm older.",finance,1458042885

personalfinance,How do I handle student loans?,"So I am 22 and just graduated college in May 2015, and my student loans are driving me crazy. I have a total of around $82,434 in loans as of now, broken down into 6 small federal loans through My Great Lakes, and 3 large private loans through Sallie Mae. I cannot afford to pay the largest Sallie Mae loan right now, so I put it into forbearance until April, and I will be able to put it into forbearance for another 9 months. 

I am currently living with a roommate in Bridgeport, Ct and I am paying $675/month for rent, but I may end up having to pay $900/month to move into a safer neighborhood. There is little wiggle room there, as I cannot move anywhere closer to work as the price of living will almost double.

My monthly expenses are:

 * Rent - $675 (might be $900 in June)

 * Utilities - $150

 * Car Loan - $241

 * Car Insurance - $205

 * Food - $300

 * Gas - $100

 * Credit Card - Currently have $1,300 in CC debt. I try to pay $100/month

 * Misc. Spending - Around $200 

 * Direct Deposit Savings - $200

**Total Expenses**: $2,121 ($2,346 w/ $900 rent)

Here is what my loans look like, totaling to around $1070/month:

**Private Loans - Sallie Mae**

Loan 1 - $15,804 @ 7.5% interest with 120 month repayment plan
 
 * $192/month payment

Loan 2 - $28,108 @ 8.5% interest with 96 month repayment plan
 
 * $460/month payment **(IN FORBEARANCE)**

Loan 3 - $11,521 @ 7.5% interest with 144 month repayment plan
 
 * $124/month payment

**Federal Loans**

6 small loans consolidated into a $294/month payment which is adjusted by how much income I make.

That puts me over my $3,000 income by about $200. I can lower my monthly spending and maybe put a little less into my savings each month, but I also don't have much in my savings now (~ $3,300) so I want to try and build that up.

I bought my house in Virginia about a year ago as a foreclosure for $252,000.

&gt;Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).¬†¬†I appreciate the time you have taken to inform me of your thoughts on this issue.

&gt;In December of 2010, the FCC adopted its ‚ÄúOpen Internet‚Äù order that required broadband providers to disclose their network management practices and barred them from blocking legal traffic on their network. The rules also prohibited fixed broadband providers from unreasonably discriminating against internet traffic.¬†¬†On January 14, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down a portion of the agency‚Äôs 2010 rules.¬†¬†

&gt;On February 19, 2014, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler announced that the agency would not appeal the federal court‚Äôs decision but instead would pursue new rulemaking on the rules that the federal court struck down. On February 4, 2015, Chairman Wheeler announced his intention to reclassify broadband as a public utility.¬†¬†On February 26, 2015, by a 3-2 vote, the FCC approved plans to adopt net neutrality rules that reclassify broadband service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act.¬†

&gt;While I am supportive of an open and vibrant internet, implementing 1930s era rules to reclassify 21st Century technology sets a dangerous regulatory precedent.¬†Not only will the FCC‚Äôs decision result in burdensome litigation that could increase costs and limit service for consumers, but it will also deter future expansion, innovation, and investment of broadband services. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 1212, the ‚ÄúInternet Freedom Act,‚Äù which will block the FCC‚Äôs Net Neutrality rules by stating that they shall have no force or effect while also prohibiting the FCC from reissuing new Net Neutrality rules.

&gt;As a member of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, I know that there must be legal certainty, consumer protection and investment clarity for both users and builders of the internet. As Congress continues, I will support unfettered access to the internet that ensures that consumers remain in control of their online experience while also cultivating innovation and investment that will bring remarkable new technologies to all Americans.¬†¬†

personalfinance,How to best use incoming tax return?,"My wife and I are digging ourselves out a financial crisis due to many mistakes we made over the first ten years of our marriage (we married young and are about 30 years old). We are receiving almost $9,000 in our income tax return. We have two young children and are expecting a third in August. We are in need of a bigger car because we have 2 compact cars that simply aren't going to be practical when you're talking about driving around with 3 children either in car seats or booster seats of some form.

We want to keep one of the cars for me to take to work (commute about 30 minutes away one way) and to let me wife, who is a stay-at-home mom right now, have the larger vehicle for around-town, grocery store, preschool pickups, playground visits, etc.

We currently own a 2005 and 2007 Chevrolet Cobalts, both paid off but not worth a whole lot (maybe $3000 each?). We are thinking of trading one in or selling it and using that along with some cash to purchase a larger vehicle.

At the same time, we are trying to dig ourselves out of this financial crisis. We currently foreclosing on our home. We had to move out due to the fact that the house was hazardous to the health of our children and are living in an apartment and we weren't able to pay for a house we weren't living in plus an apartment.

We also have a large chunk of credit card debt that we are trying to get under control that helped get us into the mess. I have negotiated low interest repayment plans with most of our creditors and closed all of the accounts.

Income: $2,667/month ($32,000/yearly). I am a store manager at a small book store.

Monthly Expenses:
Rent: $775

Internet: $35

Cell Phones: $140

Gas &amp; Electric: $100

Car Insurance: $85

Debt:
Credit Card #1: $25.00/month. Current balance $403. APR: 0% but promotional interest is expiring soon. I need to pay this off by July.

Credit Card #2: $20.00/month. Current balance: $977. APR: 0%

Credit Card #3: $22.00/month. Current balance: $1,259. APR: 0%

Credit Card #4: $49.00/month. Current balance $1,560. APR: 0%

Credit Card #5: $44.00/month. Current balance $1,792. APR: 0.99%

Credit Card #6: $80.00/month. Current balance $3,340. APR: 0%

Also a couple student loans. Currently deferred due to economic hardship. Not required to make payments at this time. Balances:
Loan 1 - $3,855 - interest rate 4.5%
Loan 2 - $7,627 - interest rate 6.8%

Everything left over goes to necessities like food and gas. We have cut out virtually any unnecessary expense. We canceled cable, don't go out to eat, rarely purchase any clothing, etc.

TL,DR: How can I use this incoming money to best help us out in this situation? Should we try to pay off some of the credit card debts or worry more about the car we need?

We want a larger vehicle (6-7 passenger) that is going to be reliable. Should we try to just use our trade in plus cash and buy one outright, or should we try to finance one? Our credit has been trashed from everything so we're likely to get a high interest rate for a loan. At the same time, if we buy it outright would we have enough to afford the car that we need? I haven't been car shopping in nearly ten years. Or should we focus on trying to pay down more of the credit card debt and get rid of those extra payments?

personalfinance,Continue or cash out life insurance?,"Some backstory - Parents purchased a whole life insurance for me when I was 3 (currently 24). Due to recent news about MetLife, they want to change providers to MassMutual which is how I found out I had a policy. I searched the sub and most posts indicate that whole life is not worth in most cases and that life insurance in general doesn't make sense if you have no dependents. Although I agree with those statements, does it still hold true since the policy was taken out so many years ago? In the event I cash out, I think it's fair to return the money to my parents. However, if I choose to continue the policy, I will continue the payments.

personalfinance,Help With Planning for 2017 Taxes (Multiple big changes in my life),"Good afternoon - I have a number of things going on that are likely going to affect me in a major way for tax season next year.  I am hoping that someone can give me a little guidance on what to do to ensure that I am handling things correctly.  I'll try to explain the best I can.  So here's the basics..

- I was laid off last week and am receiving four months of severance pay, being delivered on my regular schedule of payments (1st and 15th).  

- I have an outstanding 401k loan that because of the tax implications, I believe my best option will be to cash it out so I do not have to pay the taxes back out of pocket (from what I've been told, if I roll the money over to a new 401k, the taxes will come due).  The amount of the 401k loan is about $20,000, and after they withhold 20% for taxes, I'll only be cashing out about $45,000.  

- I am planning on having a new job in the next couple weeks.

So, here are the questions...

1. Is the money that I am receiving from severance taxed differently if it's being sent as any normal payment (insurance withheld, etc.).  Taxes are being paid, but are there additional taxes I'll be responsible for, or it is taxed like any other payments?

2. I understand they will withhold 20% for taxes from the 401k cashout.  My understanding is that covers some of federal taxes, but not state.  Counting all income, I will be close to $150,000 (income, cashout, severance) if I find a job soon.  I assume 20% will not be enough to cover the taxes I'll have to pay.  SHould I plan on holding back more personally?

3. Since I'm cashing out the 401k, I'm planning on using the money to build my daughters college fund.  I am still relatively young and will be contributing to a 401k plus roth IRA when I have the chance in the near future...so I'm going to use this unfortunate event to build for my daughters college.  Is there a good way to invest this to help her increase money prior to needing it, while also helping me offset some of the taxes?

4.  All in all, and I know this would only be a guess...how much of the 401k cashout should I plan on hanging on to to help cover the taxes that I'll likely have to pay in 2017.  The tax requirements on the severance and state 401k cashout likely play a big part into this estimation...but I want to make sure I'm completely covered when the time comes, especially if I'm placing the money I'm using for my daughter into an account that can't be touched for a period of time.",finance,1458059330
personalfinance,"26, single, making $65,000+ a year and broke - help!","So, I'll start this off by stating I have Master's Degree and I'm not a dumb guy - just financials is something that I struggle with. :/

I currently make ~$65,000 working full time in a cheap area to live in. I purchased a house for $169,000 last September ('14) and put $69k down and took a home equity loan against my parents house for the last $100,000. I had my father do this, transfer the money to myself, paid off my house in cash, then took a home equity loan against my own house to pay his loan off. Essentially, we discovered this would get us a lower interest rate (2.9%) and no closing costs ($10k saving). My monthly payment varies ~$550 over 20 years (Still have 19 more to go!). 

I recently purchased a new car since my last one died. I took a 4 year loan and pay $325.01 a month, starting last August. I've never missed a house or car payment, they both come out automatically.

Electric bill is ~$50 a month, gas is ~$60, water id ~$20 a month, internet cable and phone ~$120. 

My issue is I just can't seem to save money. I feel like after taxes from my pay deduction, then house, car, and utilities; I'm usually left living paycheck to paycheck. Every time I try to save money, I get hit with another property tax bill, or I'm buying new stuff for the house. I dunno. Essentially what I'm asking is how much should I be saving a month to live comfortably. I know if I find a girlfriend/ wife life would be way easier with two incomes and I'm working on it (ha). 

My property taxes come every March and October; March being ~$2,000 and October being ~$3,000. Both times when I started to save money I had to use all my savings for them. 

SIDE NTOE: I just checked and I did put some stock sales towards my home equity loan and I owe ~$86,000 on my house; I have a credit up to $150,000 so worst comes to worst I can borrow into that if I ever get hit with a big bills.

To start, I had $98,000 in loans for my undergraduate and postgraduate degree. My undergraduate degree was earned in the United States (i am a US citizen). After graduating from the undergrad, I moved to London and started a Master's course in the UK. A few months into my Masters I started receiving repayment information and past due bills for it all. Prior to coming to the UK i called them and made sure I was all on deferment and didn't need to pay because I was continuing my education. They said no problem.. but then obviously there was. I called them, emailed them, etc and told them I was still studying and that this was a mistake. Their words are that they, FedLoan, do not count the University of London as an ""accredited institute of higher education"" and that as such, they count me as graduated and entered into the repayment period after the six month's grace expired. I haven't had a single cent in income in the last 5 years as I went to school full time and used the loans to support myself. I told them i couldn't afford the payments (they wanted ~$700 a month) and since I lived in the UK i didn't get the postings and didn't even know I was sent into repayment until past due notices with warning signs on the envelope began showing up which prompted my father to open them and see what was up.  I explained that the loans were currently being used for my master's degree and there was no feasibly way for me to make any payments, and that I shouldn't have to considering I am still in school and therefore should be on deferment. They said tough shit, and continued with the forced repayment. I am now defaulted and have no idea what kind of recourse I have. When i call them they are belligerent and tell me they have no record of my master's degree (i have sent them validation and enrollment information multiple times) and claim there is nothing they can do for me unless and until I bring my account current. To do this, I owe several thousands of dollars and my interest has since ballooned from 98k to 103k. What kind of help can I acquire for this, considering they are adamant about not helping me or acknowledging that I even have a master's degree or was matriculating while they sent me into repayment?

I worked full year in WV but I stay in Ohio almost weekly. The difference is if I file as full-year WV resident I'll have to pay $650ish in. Filing as part year resident I get back $150ish. My taxes are simple, no special deductions, just income reported. 

From TurboTax:

A part-year resident is an individual who changes his/her residence either:
- from West Virginia to another state, or
- from another state to West Virginia during the taxable year.

I guess going by that I wouldn't qualify as a part-year resident then. Any input would be appreciated.

Also Turbo tax says:
&gt;Since one of you are a non-resident of West Virginia, you must not file a joint return. 

File your federal return now, and then create another federal return only for the person who has to file a West Virgina return, under the married filing separately filing status. Then you can proceed to file your West Virginia state return as married filing separately.

That won't come off my report till next year. I disputed both of those, but unfortunately they weren't removed just updated. Report after the dispute just gave the dates of when they will be removed.  
What can I do to at least get the collections that is coming off next year, removed sooner?  
Also I want to get the Wells Fargo charge off removed, If I have to i'll pay it off ($933) but i'd rather pay half and get it removed.  
So the only card I have is a Capital one that I opened up about 5 months ago with a $300 limit but just recently was raised to $800. I hardly use it and when I do use it I pay it off in full every month.  
  
Sorry this post is all over the place. What can I do to improve my credit score? Ideally i'd like to try and get a card with a higher limit ($1k?) and rewards since the capital one i have has none. Should I open a new card?",finance,1458072567
personalfinance,"If I do nothing, will my credit score degrade over time? Or is my CU pulling a fast one?","Here is my situation for context:

In March of last year I finished payments on an auto loan through my local credit union. At the time my credit score was 666. I go in today to start a new auto loan on another car and find my score has dropped to 624. After reviewing my credit history, we see that the first loan was never reported as paid, in fact it has been sitting there with a debt of $308. The CU acknowledges this as their error, says they will report it as paid and that my credit score will come back up in 30 days.

A little later they call me and say that this has not been negatively affecting my score; instead my score has simply degraded over time because I have not created any new instalments in the past year. This seems ludicrous to me.

The only other activity on my score has been a secured credit card, which I created under their advice to improve my score and I believe I was advised incorrectly. When I first got it, I was told to use it only for emergencies. In March 2015 I was told this was not optimal, instead use 10% and pay it off every month. Today I was again told this was not optimal, instead I should not pay it off every month and carry over a small balance.

What in the world is going on here? Is my CU incompetent? I feel like my credit score has been negatively effected due to their error, and now if I were to get a new loan through them I will be paying an unduly higher interest rate, meaning they make more money off of their own mistake.",finance,1458072660

After scholarships and a federal loan from fafsa, I'm going to be looking at another 16-17k. I'm currently working part time as well. I applied for the federal loan in August and also applied for a private loan in August. I couldn't get one because I had 0 credit history. Now that I have a job, I applied for a credit card to start building credit (it's a Wells Fargo college card, no deposit). I activated it last week and the letter said my experian score was 680 something, but it was the only one given. I made a couple purchases using it totaling to about $60 of the $1200 limit and immediately made the full payment once the purchase showed up on my bank account (my checking and savings are at Wells Fargo too and everything is connected). Today, I signed up on creditkarma and it told me my transunion score was 722 and Equifax was 702.

 Is it normal that these three all have pretty different numbers for someone just starting their credit history? Also, what score does Wells Fargo look at for their student loans? Can I improve my credit score enough by August to have good interest rates on the private loans? Other than always paying the card in full when a payment is due and not going over 30% of my credit limit, is there any good ways to improve it faster? Is there any difference between making lots of transactions for a little bit (paying them all off instantly) and just a few transactions that were money (still paying off instantly)?

I went to school for five years and graduated with over 110k in debt. The debt was a combination of federal and private student loans with the lion share in private (70-30 split). I have extended the federal payments to the maximum length to make the payments as manageable as possible. The private lender told me I cannot do anything about it. 

After graduating I had a hard time finding a job so I went in to the world of fully commissioned sales making a very unstable 45k. I was able to barely make my monthly payment obligations to my lenders and still eat. Up until three months ago I was faithfully paying the devil that is Sallie Mae (now navient). When the sales slowed down it forced me to go in to a three month deferment to navient which is ending next month. 

Today I started my new job as a technical recruiter that pays a salary of 40k plus commission of $500 per placement which would be about 5-6 months down the road before that happens. 

Also I am being forced to move out of my current living arrangement of $700 a month since my landlord decided to move back in to his house. I live in northern Virginia. $700 a month was a blessing. 

I made a mistake with my w-4 and did have the correct amount withheld. So I now owe the IRS and state about $1000. 

My debt to income does not allow for credit cards. 

Student loans: $1228
Rent: $700 (about to increase)

personalfinance,Need advice regarding new employer's health insurance in my situation.,"I'm 23 years old. My mom is a federal employee and I'm going to stay on her insurance until I'm 26. I just got a county level job &amp; they ""require"" that all employees are on their insurance. 

There are two options, one is free..the county pays $691/month and the other is $126/month with the county paying $691. It's in a very small town/low population county and the HR guy admitted he's confused and doesn't know much about the new health insurance rules. He relies on the payroll/admin woman to explain it to him.

So he's telling me (as he understands from the admin lady) that employees are required to be on their insurance. ""And hey, you'll be double insured. I'm sure you can just not tell doctors about our insurance and go through your moms or her's can be your primary"". 

After some research, I think he's confused. They may be required to offer me insurance so they wouldn't face a penalty if I bought insurance through the marketplace claiming my employer didn't offer affordable insurance. And I don't believe that's how primary/secondary insurance works. From what I've read, double insurance is a pain in the ass. 
I don't want to be on their insurance. I'm going to meet with him tomorrow or Thursday to hand in all my forms, how should I go about this?

Also, I've read about certain employers offering some sort of part of the $691 they would have had to pay if I was on their insurance. Should I even inquire about this?

Then I received an email from Experian's ""ProtectMyID.com"" -- a year service I currently have for free because of the T-Mobile security breech a few months ago. 



On the alert, it shows that ""I"" recently applied for 3 different credit cards on Thursday, Friday and yesterday.  So someone clearly has my SSN because I did not apply for anything (and neither did my husband nor mother on my behalf -- the 2 other people that know my SSN).


So, I clearly have a problem on my hands.  I am going to call the Fraud Resolution Service in the morning (through my ProtectMyID.com account...they were closed tonight when I just tried).

**What do I need to do/watch out for and for how long?  This is my first identity theft I've been a victim of and I don't know anyone that personally has been affected either.**


The Fraud Resolution hotline states they will help me with the following:

**1. Notify banks, creditors and service providers**
We'll be on the phone with you to assist with notifying your creditors, medical benefits company, your bank or other financial institutions, and your utilities. And if correspondence by mail is required, we'll draft letters for you to sign.

**2. Place fraud alerts on your credit report**
We'll help you place an immediate, 90-day alert on your credit report at all three major credit bureaus, to warn lenders and other potential credit grantors that you may be a victim of identity theft. Plus, we'll help you renew the fraud alert if necessary, or add a 7-year alert if your identity proves to have been stolen.

**3. Report the fraud to government agencies**
We walk you through the steps of contacting your local law enforcement agency to file a report regarding the fraudulent activity. This report becomes your official ""Identity Theft Report"" a document that creditors and credit bureaus may ask for. If you wish to file a report with the Federal Trade Commission, we'll help you with that too.

**4. Check your credit reports**
In the event of an identity theft, we'll review your Experian, TransUnion and Equifax files with you so we can help you identify possible fraudulent activity you may be unaware of. We'll immediately get started helping you resolve any issues we find.

**5. Cancel or request new credit, debit or insurance cards**
Depending on the situation, you may need to cancel or change some or all of your accounts as a result of the identity theft. We'll help you determine which accounts to close. We'll guide you through contacting your card issuers, medical benefits companies and/or financial institutions to close your current accounts, report stolen checks, stop payments on outstanding checks you've written (if necessary) and transfer any recurring charges from your old accounts to new ones.

**6. Secure and reclaim your identity**
We'll help you gather the necessary information you'll need to make telephone calls or to send letters to your creditors, your bank, the credit bureaus, and any others who may be involved in the process of securing and reclaiming your identity.

**VIEWPOINT:**

Time to look again at radiation safety

Five years after the nuclear accident at Fukushima Daiichi, the scientific community is ready to assess what the real health consequences have been and put them into perspective with other risks in our lives, Gerry Thomas told the BBC in an interview.

With hindsight, she said, we can look back and say the risk to local residents was overestimated, ""and actually it would have been far better to treat this as if it was like a chemical toxin. And what are we told then: Stay indoors, your windows and doors shut, and we'll come and get you when it's safe - if we need to evacuate you. And it gives you time to appraise what the doses would be, what the releases would be, and time to put a proper plan in place.""

""We were brought up to believe that the next atomic weapon that went off would probably finish our species on the planet,"" she continued, ""and we seem to have confused the two in our minds and therefore find it very difficult to move on from there.""

personalfinance,"$55k in student loans, only making $13.50 an hour","Ok so I guess reddit probably isn't the best place to get this information, but I'm at work and I don't know where else to look. 

Basically my situation is this:
I have $23k in federal loans (Subsidized and unsubsidized) and about $22k in PLUS Loans in my fathers name. 

I recently got a full time job with great security and all that, but only make $25k/year. At the moment I don't know how to go about dealing with my student loan debt. I don't want my parent picking up the tab for me, but I could be facing roughly $600/month in bills, and after rent, my car insurance, bills and other expenses I don't know if that's even possible on my current wage. 

I guess I'm wondering primarily if A) I can/should consolidate all of the loans into one, B) if I did that would it be possible to do PAYE and C) What other options I have to make it so the massive debt dragon doesn't come down from his castle and demolish every semblance of my sanity and happiness.

Help me r/personalfinance you are my only hope (Unless there is other hope I don't know about, then you are one of a few) 

Also, I apologize if this is in the wrong place. If that is the case I will post it somewhere else instead.

personalfinance,"Buying second house (separation), trying to figure out most financially responsible plan.","Appreciate any insight, been trying to work through it all and want to make sure i'm making best decisions.  I understand that there are other options such as ""don't get separated"" or ""have wife get job"" but none of these are really options at the moment.  Feel like my plan is necessity (even the purchasing vs renting a place).

Going rate for livable house in my area is about $350k with taxes of $10k.   Currently owe 230k on house wife will remain in.  Valued at ~$450k so considerable equity.

I have 40k in emergency fund.   10k in checking/savings.  130k in investment account.  200k in 401k.

So issue is I don't have 20% for down payment (70k) and closing costs (~10k) without liquidating investment accounts.  


I see my options are:

- Liquidate emergency fund for small down payment and closing.  Higher monthly payments. Pay PMI for foreseeable future.  No emergency fund anymore.

- Liquidate investment accounts for 20% down and down payment.  Lower monthly payments.  No PMI.  Hurt my eventual retirement.

- Take home equity loan for down payment and closing costs.  At considerable lesser interest rate than mortgage, however not deductible?  Put my wife's house in jeopardy if i lost my job.  lower mortgage payment but repayment on loan.  no PMI.


I feel like option 3 makes the most sense, but having trouble figuring the actual benefit/costs as it pertains to deductions, PMI, etc.

Anything else i'm missing.  Hoping maybe there is a plan I haven't thought of or something better.

If it's needed:

Net takehome - 91k (after 18k 401k contribution) - also have profit sharing, so worst case. i'd like to base on that.
Wife's house - 25k yearly (mortgage, tax, interest)
Our Expenses - 26k yearly (utilities, living, cars, insurances, etc)

Leaves ~40k year or about 3k a month.

- 350k mortgage at 4 = $1650

- 10k taxes = $833

- insurance = $100

leaving me about $500 bucks for utilities, etc a month.

Loan amount: $10,000  
Length: 48 months, not really sure as I'll pay it off in 2.  
Payment: $225 for first 18mos @ 12% from Kawasaki/CapOne, then interest rate climbs to 20%.  
Insurance: ~$100/m.
Burn rate: $1100/m. (30% is just the bike!)  
Cash: $8,000.  
Debt: $0 CC, 20k Student Loans @ 4%
Income: Unemployed but I make $1000/m consulting when I feel like working.  
Searching for a job that starts at 45-55K. Wife is employed and has her own cash pile.  
I have enough money and irregular income to cover everything I need until the end of this year (with leftovers), plus in an emergency I can sell my guns, cars, tools, electronics, etc. Not a good safety but I'm fine with it. Going to start flipping cars ($200 in current project, expected to sell for min $2000) and maybe delivering pizza if the mileage reimbursement is good and I'm bored enough.
  
Options:  
1. Put loan on 0% APR/12m card and save ~$1000 in interest. Transfer in a year if needed to another 0% and pay fee if required. I can also use wife's cards and 0% cheques to do the same.  
2. Use wife's money later this year and put bike on 4% secured loan.  
  
I called my local CU and was denied refinancing due to them wanting to see 18mo of payment history on the bike already. I applied myself without the wife. Our credit scores are similar around 675 with student loans and 2+ years of perfect credit history. $150 from 2011 in collections, they won't give me any assurances and I won't pay until I get a PFD in writing.  
  
I'm considering selling the bike since it isn't crucial that I have it anymore. I needed reliable transportation and none of my VWs met that criteria earlier. I'll either buy a project bike as a replacement or I'll just swap car B's engine into car A, then flip car B to recover costs and make a profit.  
  
Would putting the bike loan on a card and then either transferring in a year, or even shifting to a secured loan be a wise move in order to save money on interest, and $25-50/m on bike insurance, plus be able to easily sell it on the spot if needed?",finance,1458155586

personalfinance,"I can't seem to save any money, how can I get there in my student loan situation?","Hello r/personalfinance!

I am hoping for some opinions on loan consolidation, and my finances as a whole.  To start with, I do not have any type of budget setup for myself, but my major expenses and income are as follows.

Income: $2530 after taxes every month (4 weeks technically), which is pretty good in my area (SC) for someone only two years out of college.

Fixed Expenses (Per Month): 
Student Loans- $500
Rent- $577
Utilities- ~$100
Gas- ~$80

So leaving out anything else, this gives me $1237 a month of cash.  Factor in my TV &amp; Internet at around 100 bucks this drops to $1137.  Averaged out over time, after groceries, clothing, and other miscellaneous items every month I feel like I can save around 500 bucks a month without buying anything extra.  However, this usually ends up getting spent on other items that come up over time.  I saved for a long time to get $3500 for my current vehicle, and I am hoping to get another 2-3 years out of it.

My loans will not be paid off until around 2023, if my calculations are correct, and if I keep making the minimum payments I feel like I am going to spend the next 7-8 years of my life with virtually no savings, just trying to get by.  I don‚Äôt go on trips anywhere, I don‚Äôt go out to eat very often, and I live a pretty mundane life for the most part.  To break the loans down, I have ~$15,000 to Navient, and $28,000 in federal loans.  I am on a graduated plan with the federal loans as well, so that payment has to be going up soon.

I have an engineering degree, but do not see myself making a ton more money for the next 3-4 years until I can get my P.E. license.  I have been trying to save about $3000 for a motorcycle for almost a year now, and I just can‚Äôt get over the hump.  Not to mention, if I do get the bike, then I put myself in a situation with zero savings.  However, I haven‚Äôt made any major purchases lately, and have been a bit depressed with the working life and I really want the bike badly.  

The biggest issue is my loan payments, of which about half are for private variable interest loans (around 9% for each).  I want to consolidate all of them, but if I do that then I lose the government loan forgiveness if bankruptcy ever had to be declared and I don‚Äôt want to lose that card.  Are there any options for me to lower these payments per month?

Mainly, what would everyone do if put into my situation?  Any opinions on this situation are welcome, I just don‚Äôt have any direction with my finances and I feel like I will be breaking even for the next 10 years.  Please let me know your thoughts‚Ä¶",finance,1458162461

personalfinance,"What ""gotchas"" should I look for in a loan from my 401k?","Hi PF:  My wife and I got ourselves pretty overextended on credit cards during the last few years, remodeling our house.  We haven't actually *used* any of these cards (except one) for more than a year, but I'm pretty much just keeping up with the minimum payments instead of knocking them down.

The one card we *are* using has us in a bad cycle:  It's an AmEx where I need to pay the recent activity every month, and I basically screwed up the first month that they required full payment, so I needed to give them my full paycheck at the end of the month.  Then I needed to use the AmEx for daily expenses during the following month because I had no cash, then give them my whole paycheck *again* at the end of that month, and so on.  I'm having a hard time ""making space.""

So that's the bad news.  The good news is that around August or September I have a ""windfall"" coming:  A deferred cash sign on bonus coming due, RSUs vesting, and a ""targeted"" salary bonus, all at about the same time.  Even very conservatively, even after taxes, this will pay off all the cards except for the AmEx.

I am considering taking out a pre-approved loan from my 401k at 4.5% (much lower than any of the consumer cards) to pay off the cards and ""make some space"" with the AmEx.  Then using the August/September windfall to pay back the 401k, so I only actually end up paying interest for 6 months or so.  Does that make sense?  I've seen plenty of mailers for debt consolidation loans, but when I've dug into them they've turned out to have some catch, high origination costs, or interest rates comparable to consumer credit, or early repayment penalties, things like that.

Is the 401k loan just a much better deal because it's already ""my money"" or are there some other catches I need to watch out for?",finance,1458164002

personalfinance,17 year old looking for college-related financial advice,"Hey there everyone. To begin, I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm doing any of this wrong. I‚Äôve lurked this board and I have found a lot of really good information and would like some advice for myself. I THINK I have an understanding of at least some of what I need to know, but I am looking to be corrected as well as informed for any improvements to my plans and I am looking for any help possible.


I am currently 17 years old and a senior in highschool. My goal is to go to a community college for an Associate‚Äôs degree then get a BS in Mathematics or Computer Science at UC Davis. My family has been poor for as long as they‚Äôve been alive, and I want a future that is much more financially stable as well as prosperous. I currently do not know what I need to do to get prepared for college, specifically. 


I am planning on living with a roommate (Specifically, my girlfriend. To note before anyone brings it up: if we (knock on wood) break up, we still intend to roommate together or I can find another roommate easily, so the $ split should remain generally the same) in a private owned apartment in Woodland or Sacramento CA.  I currently live in the Modesto/Ceres/Turlock area, so it is about a 100 mile move.


I created a budget that is similar to what me and my girlfriend live on at our homes now, and it comes out to around $1600/month. At this rate, I would have to take out around $21,000 in loans for the first year to ensure everything may be paid for, and during that time I can search for a job and I‚Äôd like to start paying it off immediately. This is not accounting for moving fees because I am unsure of the current rates.


    Budget Breakdown:
    $800 rent
    $300 groceries
    $100 Utilities
    $100 car ins
    $80 Internet
    $50 misc
    $150 personal
    ______
    $1580/m
    ~= $20,000/yr


I qualify for the Pell Grant at $5,700 and the tuition at my community college could be free with a BOG fee waiver or would cost at $60/class (as a full time student, this would probably come out to ~300/semester). In either situation, I can afford my tuition and textbooks in whole due to Pell, the rest of my required income (rent, groceries, utilities) I intend to use my loans for. This is the only  guaranteed scholarship that is available for me this year, but it is renewable all four years. I qualify for the CAL Grant B at $1,600, which I can start to redeem once I transfer to Davis.


My girlfriend qualifies for CAL Grant A at $12,000. In addition, she qualifies for $2,000 from the Davis Honor Program. Her tuition costs around $13,500, I allocate around $1,000 for textbooks, that‚Äôs $14,500 tuition. Her tuition and textbooks should come out to roughly free (or much cheaper, at least) so she is in nearly the same situation at only needing room and board expenses.  Theoretically, we could stay at home, but we both have very bad relationships with our families and I‚Äôd much rather go into debt than stay home.


We may both qualify for additional scholarships, but these are ones that are already approved and (basically) guaranteed as far as I know.


After we are done with college, we have plans to teach English in South Korea. This can save around 10-15 thousand each per year there, so that may be solid money to throw at some loans in the future.


I understand that it is optimal to maximize first Federal Subsidized loans -&gt; Fed Unsub. -&gt; Private loans? Which private loans should I look at? What, specifically, makes a loan desirable or undesirable?


Another point that comes to mind is credit. I have absolutely no credit, and would like to begin building it ASAP. Someone brought up the AmEx Blue Cash card and it looked very appealing to me, and I‚Äôd like to build my way up to it, or another card with similar rewards. I don‚Äôt intend to spend much money on travel, but the cash back can be really helpful. I already understand that it is best to pay credit card bills in full at the end of each month and use it more like a debit card in order to not fall into [crippling] debt. 


What are some good cards or methods to getting credit for someone with no credit such as myself? I don‚Äôt even know how to actually check my credit.


Is there anything else I need to know? I need any help I can get here, I would really appreciate it. If needed, I can clarify anything as well as I know how, and I can follow up with any necessary additional information. Thanks guys

personalfinance,How to invest ~150k of home equity in rental property.,"I am currently in a fortunate situation where I bought my first house at the bottom of the market, and I currently have about 150k worth of equity in my home (90k left on mortage). I have a 25k Emergency fund and no debt, I make ~75k annually at the same job for over 5 years now, single with a credit score of ~760-770.

I would like to invest in real estate, specifically doing a long term rental strategy in order to invest my money to gain passive income. As well as snowball this into more rentals to in a sunny day scenario set myself up for a good retirement.

**Current thoughts to obtaining the equity are:**

i) Take out a cash-out refinance to pull 150k equity out at a 3.75% interest rate. 30 year 240k Mortgage. (1100/mo PI payment)

ii) Invest in rental properties...


**How should I go about financing investment properties?**

**How quickly should I buy properties?**

Theoretically, the optimum strategy would be to finance 3-4 rentals at 20% down 30/yr fixed. (disregarding the fact that technically 'interest only' would be optimal in a perfect scenario to maximize cash on hand versus equity). 

In the real world though things take time, and you want to weigh risk/reward, and lenders won't give me loans with little no history of income revenue from the investment properties.

**Current Strategies:**

**a) Purchasing Cash**

-Pros: Makes buying process simple, no closing costs on loans, nets ~12k a year cash (assuming 1200/mo rent).

-Cons: I'll have no cash to purchase additional rental properties for about two years. Unless I cash out refinance the rental property.

**b) Financing the investment (25% down).**

Pros: This nets the lowest rates, easier for lenders to approve the loan, ~110k left over

Cons: Paying interest, requires an additional 9k (vs 20% down), ~110k cash sitting in high yield loses money to inflation.

**c) Financing the investment (20% down).**

Pros: More cash left back (120k)

Cons: Paying interest (half a point higher interest rate than 25%), ~120k liquid cash sitting in high yield loses money to inflation.

Am I overly optimistic?

The principal will be $270k if unsecured debt is ""rolled in"". The cost to refinance this way would be an additional $800 vs. renewing just the remaining principal $250k.

What's the best option? Without refinancing, she says she will probably be able to pay down the CC/LoC debt in 1 year.",finance,1458180906
personalfinance,Is student loan debt really THAT BAD. My perspective.,"Hi everyone,

I'm a grad student studying education and because of some personal issues and a lack of family support, I will have 60-70k worth of debt in student loans when I'm done with my program. While I do have some sticker shock, my loans are all federal, so I'll be eligible for income based repayment (which is forgiven after 25 years.) I didn't have any debt from undergrad (paid for by family/grandparents.) I may need to take out a few more grand if I choose to finish the extra class needed for my master's degree, get a few more endorsements (which are often necessary to stay employed in education) or a certificate. 

Yes, I learned the hard way a career change is expensive. That being said, am I supposed to be freaking out about the rest of my life because I will most likely be paying 10% of my income to student loan debt for the next 25 years? I feel disheartened every time I read a lot of personal finance advice, because i feel like without having wealthy parents or a long history of making smart career and financial decisions (choosing a college major that led me into a career I enjoyed, not taking several years out of college to figure out what I wanted to do) everything is telling me, I should just give up and live life on the street in a cardboard box.

For the record, I'm okay not being ""wealthy"" as long as I can live a reasonably comfortable life, whether that is with my boyfriend of almost a year, or on my own. Although money is important, and I'd like to use it wisely, I don't envision a lifestyle in a 700K mansion, driving new luxury cars, taking ski trips, etc. 

Is this a healthy mindset? I'd like some feedback, thanks.",finance,1458182318

personalfinance,(USA) Student loan income driven repayment renewal ignored?,"I cant find what i did wrong. I submitted my first application for income driven repayment (IDR) on 03/05/15, and it was approved. In january of this year, i received an email saying i had to reapply, so i did. The student loan website shows i submitted it on 1/15/16, and my servicer (mygreatlakes) showed a link in the front page that said 'view the status of your income driven repayment request'. Clicking on that, the website stated that my application had been aproved on 1/23/16. 

Fast forward to last wednesday. I got an email saying i had until friday the 11th to submit my application, or my payments would go up.Huh? I tried to go onto the federal student loan website and was met with a 'site will be down through sunday, as will our call centers' message. In comes emotional freakout. I finally calm down and figure it was a weird mistake, and it will right itself. Wrong. Payments now over 50% of my monthly income, first payment due April 13. And the website still says im under income driven repayment... for the record, i made just over $18,000 last year, which all calculators and projects showed my payments would be under $100 still (last year, my payments were about $50 with about $17.5k income the year before).

Advice? Of course i plan to call when i can (i work early mornings and am a caregiver to my grandmother and mother the rest of the day. I rarely find time to sit down for a long haul ordeal except at night, after call centers close).Ive submitted another application on the website even though my last one is clearly on record,  yet clearly ignored. Though i do assume i made a mistake, i just cant figure out what.

(I checked through my emails in the relevant time period, and the message center at the mygrreatlakes website and see nothing saying i was denied or anything. The only weird thing is the recent email that suggested i hadnt even applied, yet i clearly did.)

personalfinance,Seriously need your guidance rebuilding - Numbers and details inside,"Hello! I‚Äôm 24 years old trying to hit 720 before my 26th birthday. In high school and college I was pretty dumb regarding credit scores and comprehending how much it mattered. Post grad I‚Äôve realized how much in life can be decided by my credit score! I‚Äôve managed to raise my CS from 588 in January 2016 to 661 in about 2 months (TransUnion) Below are all my juicy numbers:

**Scores as of March 2016**

TransUnion 661

Equifax 663

Experian 657 

**OPEN ACCOUNTS**

Installment Debt

Chase Auto Loan (opened Jan 2016) $21,562

Discover Student Loan $6,0635

Wells Fargo Student Loan $903

Federal Student Loan $33,296

Sallie Mae $7,493

*Details - As you can see I have a ton of student loans. For complicated reasons I had to open private loans as well as federal ones. The privates have worst interests rates than the federal one. I‚Äôm considering if refinance is worth it for the privates. My auto loan was open recently which resulted in a bunch of hard inquires unfortunately. This was opened when my CS was 588, considering refinancing now that my score is higher as well.* 

Revolving Debt

Capital One Credit Card $0

JCrew Store card $0

*Details - My Capital One credit card is my oldest and first credit card opened May 2011. I had a credit line of $750 for a while and I applied online to get it increased last month and they bumped it up to $1750. My Jcrew store card I haven‚Äôt used in probably 5 years* 

**NEGATIVE MARKS**

Late Payments - This is where young me is very stupid. I was late for 3 months on my Capital One credit card July-August 2013. Essentially I didn‚Äôt have a job for that summer and went through some pretty serious hardship. I have been on time ever since. I‚Äôm going to attempt to write a goodwill letter and see if they can remove those three months. Not sure how successful people are with this. My next biggest late payment is July-August 2015 on my Wells Fargo Student loan. This is my own stupidity. I applied a $150 payment on the account (monthly payments are $50) thinking it would apply toward the next two months of payments, WRONG. I‚Äôm going to attempt to write a goodwill letter as well explaining my situation to see if they‚Äôll remove those two months. 

Hard Inquires - Again unfortunately since I was looking for car loans I applied for a lot of loans looking for the best rate. It resulted in about 9-11 hard inquires (average between the three) around December-January 

I have 0 delinquencies or collections on my reports!

**Current Financial Situation**

I have $5,000 in savings/emergency. Roughly $1,000 in my checkings and $0 on my Capital One card. I‚Äôve been at my current job for about 16 months where I make about $65,000/year. I work in sales so it‚Äôs tough to estimate monthly income. It can range from $2-7k/month (take home). I live at home with my parents so there is no rent. Below is my minimum financial expenses typically including minimum payments on accounts:

Discover SL - $50

Wells Fargo SL - $50

Sallie Mae SL - $150

Federal SL - $200

Chase Auto - $380

Gas/Ez Pass - $150 

**Now how the hell do I improve everything???**

*So my questions are the following:*
1. Out of the three scores which is the most important? And why is Experian so low?

2. With my auto loan - should I refinance? Recommendations with who? Will that result in an inquiry? I‚Äôm assuming since my score has increased significantly since I applied it would be beneficial 

3. With my student loans - lol fml - Should I refinance/consolidate my private loans? If so recommendations? Should I just PIF the Wells Fargo Loan ($903)? I‚Äôve been holding off thinking that making payments on it would help build my score rather than just PIF. 

4. With my credit card I know that I need to increase my available credit. With a score of 660 range I‚Äôm scared of getting denied and further plummeting my score. The two cards I‚Äôm debating is the AmEx Everyday Preferred or Chase Sapphire Preferred, am I likely to get denied with these cards in mind? 

5. Has anyone had success contacting lenders and getting late payments removed? Those late payments are destroying me and if I can get those removed that would be amazing. Any tips on how to do this would be great.

6. Where would my $5000 best be served? Is there any loan in particular I should PIF or apply a chunk of monies toward? I do want to have some sort of cushion in case something happens to my family.

WELP! That‚Äôs essentially everything. I know it‚Äôs a lot but all this is pretty overwhelming to think about. This sub has been so helpful in keeping my personal finances in mind. I just need some help and guidance in rebuilding my credit. Thank you so much!!",finance,1458189303
personalfinance,"I'm already $42,000 in debt from a failed attempt at college. Now Im halfway through my first semester back. How can I finish college financially?","I've found myself in an unfavorable situation financially. In June of 2015, I [26M] began planning to return to college in January of 2015 for a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. My now ex-fianc√©e and I spoke endlessly about the decision and we both agreed it would be best for both of us in the long run. Just like in the past when I worked while she attended college, she would pick up some of my slack as far as bills were concerned since she had a steady, decent income. After the first semester, I was guaranteed a part-time job at the the same company she worked for because the general manager is a friend of my dad's. I would get the minimum amount of loans, and after several years I would be able to support myself even more by working as an intern at an engineering firm. 

It seemed like a good plan, but it all fell apart so quickly.

She left me near the end of January 2015, three weeks into the semester. I was doing well so far and making good grades but it didn't last. I was completely devastated by the sudden breakup of my 7 year relationship with the woman I planned to spend my life with. I was forced to dropout.

Over the course of 2015 I received $42,000 in private student loans, of which I've spent all. Money was spent, primarily, on tuition for three semesters, all ending in me dropping out, so I have nothing to show for that. I also gave my ex $6,000 for credit card debt we acquired together over time. I only owed her $3,000 - which before we broke up was our mutually agreed upon amount -  but she lead me to believe I would have more of a chance of getting back with her if I paid the full amount. It didn't improve my chances and she used my desperation to get more money from me. I also relapsed hard into Heroin after being clean for around six months and spent so much money there. Luckily I kicked the habit again and haven't used since October 3, 2015. 

At the moment my dad is paying for me to take two classes but after this semester I'm on my own financially. I need to successfully appeal my college's financial aid Satisfactory Academic Progress requirement to qualify for federal student loans. So far, this is my only plan. 

My question is a simple, broad one:  Where do I go from here? What are my options? I am determined to earn my degree so I can have a fulfilling career that I know I will excel in, but I'm not quite sure how it's going to happen. 

Any advice would be helpful.",finance,1458189463
personalfinance,Should I refinance to a 15 year? Currently fha with pmi. 4.35 rate and 188 per month pmi.,"Edit: mip on an fha not pmi....... 

My hopes are... That I could drop some cash towards lowering ltv below 80 percent. Then I could do 15 year mortgage and potentially get a similar monthly payment with lower interest rate (2.8 to 3.2 is what I am hoping for a 15 year). I however don't know if this is realistic. Would it really be similar monthly payment? I currently have 4.35 on a 30 year with 165000 owed. Value is likely at 185000. I could come up with enough to lower the ltv. 

Is this a smart move or worth considering? I just hate to pay the pmi and I could have a much better interest rate. I did the math and it appears that I'd save almost 400 in interest per month and 188 without pmi so that's almost 600 a month saved. I'd build equity much more quickly with only a equal or slightly higher payment. My concern is that closing costs will make this unattractive and I'll be stuck with pmi forever. 

I'm mad that I was so uninformed at closing, I had the money and could have and would have put a higher down payment if I knew about pmi and that it's permanent after July 2013 even if I get ltv within range... Grrrr

I don't exactly need the money monthly, and I assume I would pay the same 35%~ I pay in state and federal on it at tax time. 

I thought about having them withhold 400$ for taxes, then split the remainder with my brother, putting my part into savings. He also left a $1200 bank overdraft that my grandmother had to pay since she helped him open the account, so I'd like to give the first monthly payments to her to help her offset that cost (acounting for taxes I would owe obviously). But a few questions. 

#1. Is it safe to assume that if I withhold the 400$ that I won't owe more in taxes than that at tax time (slight overpayment to be safe), is this kind of benefit taxed differently than income?
#2. I would likely just be saving my portion, is there a better way than to pay taxes, then sock it away?
#3. Am I in the clear if I just give my brother 230$ monthly, via Google Wallet or Paypal, i.e. the tax liability is his for the transfer of money to him from myself.

Friends, help me understand this. When I opened up a new utilities account, I paid my deposit in cash with 5 $20 bills. one of the bills wasn't whole, but was over 50%. they counted all 5 and accepted them. I was given a receipt. Account set up, boom.
Well, my latest bill had an extra $20 on it unaccounted for. I called and asked about it, and they said that the bank was unable to accept one of the $20 bills, the bank kept that $20 bill, and that I still owed $20 to the utility company. I said, well y'all took the money, transaction complete. They said no, I'm still on the hook for the $20.
I said, well, if I went to a gas station and paid $10 for a six pack, and the bill was torn, and they took it, if the bank doesn't accept it, they won't put up wanted signs and hunt me down for $10, they just may adjust their policy to no longer accept torn money. Also, I'm pretty sure a bank accepts and will exchange torn money as long as over 50% of the bill is there. And in the off chance that I somehow got a fake $20 in my stack, and the torn bill was fine, the onus as from what I remember is on the holder of the money.
So I asked to be contacted by a supervisor when the nice girl I was talking to kept repeating that the bank didn't accept the cash so I still owe the utility company. I feel like it's their fault for taking it, not like I was trying to rip them off. But they said the bank kept the bill, but wouldn't accept it... which is odd. so that means I am out $20 and still owe $20, and have no way of speaking to the bank about the $20.
in my mind, once you take the cash, you take the cash. if they hadn't accepted the torn bill, then I would've had to go to a bank myself and exchange it. I'm pretty sure any decent bank collects mutilated money and can exchange it with the Federal Reserve, who destroy's the mutilated money. how do I know? https://www.frbservices.org/‚Ä¶/mutilated_currency_and_coin.h‚Ä¶
So I'm curious for y'alls thoughts. thanks for the rant space, hope to learn something one way or another from this. 

UPDATE: finally spoke to someone in charge. they tracked it all down and found that only the $80 had been deposited and that they had ""tried to contact me"" about the ripped $20. Their CSR was wrong about the bank keeping the money, and that they still have the my ripped bill. they said I could have it back, so I'll just pay them another $20 and take my janky $20 somewhere else. but he said they're going to revisit their policy and have review the calls to have a chat with their not so nice CSR, so hopefully no one else has to deal with this.",finance,1458227016

personalfinance,Student loan question: PSLF form rejected because of a silly reason.,"I'm working at a non-profit university. My student loans has been consolidated into a direct loan under FedLoan Servicing, Inc. I downloaded the PSLF form for my HR office to fill out (so the payments I make after my forberance ends will be counted towards PSLF). I sent the form over to FedLoan. I got a letter recently from FedLoan saying that additional action was required, and that the form I sent in was missing a checkbox that would say ""certifying that all information was correct."" 

However, it looks like there are two versions of the PSLF certification form floating around - with the exact same OMB number (1845-0110, approved 12/31/2007). The one I downloaded and had HR fill out looks exactly the same, only on the bottom part of the page where HR fills out, it says something to the extent of ""To certify that all information was true, blah blah, sign and date this form."" No checkbox. The form FedLoan attached and gave me had a checkbox and next to it, ""Check here to certify that blah blah."" 

So, is there any way I can avoid having to ask HR to fill this out all over again? It's really dumb that they'd reject/need more action over ONE checkbox, and the end result is the same because it needs to be signed anyway, and the original form did say ""to certify, sign..."", so there's no real difference here. Any suggestions? It makes no sense, because both forms had the exact same OMB number and approval date.

The interest rates on these cards is high. I'd like to consolidate it all at a lower interest rate as I am taking over our finances so we can begin saving for a house someday. 

Our net income is $1200/week (just to be clear, after taxes). Our rent is $1000. Aside from credit cards we have no other major expenses. We already have a savings account with an emergency und that is growing but not yet at 6 months. I'm working on that. 

My current plan is to try to go to.Our credit union and get a personal loan for the two of us to consolidate. If that doesn't work we got something in the mail from discover to try to do it through them up to $30k @6%. 

Any thoughts or guidance are appreciated.",finance,1458232159

investing,Rates and forex. USD.GBP,"Need someone to explain some questions to me as I was looking at investing in a GBP vanguard etf on the LSE. 

Yesterday the fed kept rates the same. My understanding is that this tells the market the U.S. Economy is not as strong as previously expected earlier in the year. This would cause USD to drop and it did. 

This morning Bank of England also chose to keep rates the same. This would mean that the UK economy is not stengthening also. This should cause the GBP to drop. However it has risen today. 

These two no changes of rates should cancel each other out however the GBP has risen. 

I am newer to investing and was hoping to pick up a UK GBP etf as a long term play in hopes that the GBP will appreciate and inhance my returns.   I would then sell and switch to a similar USD etf. 

Obviously I should not go through with this plan now as the two announcements have made this a play I do not understand.

personalfinance,150k in student loan debt...any advice?,"My story is a big complicated, but I'll try to summarize it very quickly.

I come from a poor family (parents net income &lt; 20k annually) in rural PA. I have a bachelors in biology and two masters degrees, one in cancer biology and the other in bioinformatics. I probably could have qualified for some educational opportunity programs for undergrad, but I had no idea of their existence until I was almost done with undergrad. Nonetheless, I did not let my socioeconomic status deter me away from pursuing a career in science.

I am currently a 2nd year PhD student in genomics. I receive a full tuition scholarship and an annual stipend of 28k + health insurance. I am technically employed at the university affiliated cancer hospital (paychecks say 20hrs/wk - although I really work ~50hrs/wk). I have about 3 more years in this program. As such, I do not have to make student loan payments yet because I am still ""in school"". I don't have much extra money month to month, but I probably could start budgeting a little better.

I am quite naive when it comes to student loan repayments and student loan forgiveness. I was wondering since I am technically working at a non-profit organization, would it be advantageous of me to start making some payments now? Otherwise I was going to wait until I'm done with my PhD. I'm planning on working in the industry and hope to be making at least $80k when I start and ideally $100k+ within 5 years. 

All of my student loans are federal loans:
4500 (5.6%), 
2860.44 (6.8%),

gaming,"I have discovered the truth behind bad video games, and in turn, why there is no half-life 3.","I finally figured out the secret formuoli in the video game industry that leads to decrease in quality and and an increase in bad.


It has come to our attention that, while researching for the perfect noodle recipe to receive good grades in our mechanics and nucular medicines classes at the University of Keiser, we have stumbled upon the great trend that has cursed m'video game industry, as well as the film industry. While we were enjoying some nice Netflix as we were researching, we noticed that the best of the worst movies out there always had trilogies.

Think about...Human Centipede 1-3, VHS 1-3, Sharknado 1-3, Star Wars 1-3 as well as Star Wars 4-6 and soon to be 7-9. All these movies just keep coming in threes, like a FAMAS set to burst fire mode, and it only shoots shit. All throughout the film industry, terrible movies always to somehow come in Three Musketeers. So that got us thinking, ""What about the video game industry?""

And that is when it hit us like a drunk truck. It all started coming back to me like my dad never did. All these trilogies of games that just get worse and worse the more there are. Halo 1-3. Assassin 1, 2, and Brother hood. Then Ass Creed Revelations, 3, and 4. Then Asaasin Kreed Unity, Syndicate, and Bloodlines. And so many more, I mean just look at Pacman. Pacman 1, then Pacman 2: The new adventures, And even Pacman Word 3. They all just decrease in quality. And dont even get me started on Final Fantasy.

But why does this even matter? because my friends, it is time to understand why our overlord Gae Newell has been saving us from the trragedy that will Half-Lie 3. Because he too, has known the secret formuoli to the krabby patty. he knows that if he puts a 3 at the end of half-life, it will all just go downyhill from here. He knows, because he's already made a trilogy that was terribad. ""But he doesn't know how to count to 3"" you might be saying to yourself. Or not because who fucking talks like that. Well my misunderstood friendo, I will point them out to you know. Behgold the trilogy that is Counter Strike, CounterStrike Sauce, and CounterStrike Global Offended. you can clearly see that at the third game, the quality in gameplay was severely reduced due to the focus on the  addition of dank hard to get skins that I will never afford and people will make fun of me for not having them. We all thought it was bad, and we all knew that Newell had fricked up. But you know who else knew that he goofed? Gabe Newell. And that is why he is trying to defend us from the forces of the evil 3. He knows that all bad come come to 3. Like Super Mario Bros 1-3 and Zelda 1 - 3.

We have only discovered this because we are true Keiser scientists, with great observational skills. Thasnk you for your time and we hope game developers learn to not use threes anymore.",technology,1458242719

MachineLearning,How do RNN's handle providing output with different dimension than input,"It seems like an RNN has to have the ht-1 needs to be the same size as the input vector since they're being added to one another, but if you're doing something like modeling to another language or classification, how would you handle this? I'd imagine you'd just have a fully connected layer that would predict the output, but I was wondering if there is a standard convention?

Basically, I don't understand how the encoder is mapping a RNN sequence to a different size vector than the input since it's feeding the output back into itself every time.



[edit]
Perhaps I'm not being clear.  I'm curious where the dimensional transformation is happening mathematically, in an example like an LSTM for translation where there is an encoder-decoder.  I am under the impression they project the phrase to an 8000x1 dimensional vector, but if you look at an example like this: http://image.slidesharecdn.com/l07nnrnngrulstm-151108140716-lva1-app6892/95/recurrent-neural-networks-lstm-and-gru-33-638.jpg?cb=1446992496
I don't see where an LSTM would be able to transform the vector to a different dimension.  That's why I'm assuming there is a feedforward layer on top of the LSTM because if you look at h(t-1), it has to be fed back into the LSTM with the same dimensional size as x(t) so they can be added together.  So if the LSTM was outputting something of different size than the input vector, they wouldn't be able to be added.  Is that more clear?",technology,1458262977

personalfinance,0.0% balance transfer offer to consolidate debt?,"Hello PF. I've been working on getting rid of a bit of debt I acquired during a divorce with a litigation-happy ex. I'll give the numbers first and then fill out my question.

The debt I'm looking at dealing with is in two places:
1. A credit card. Current balance is $7033.20 with a 12.24% interest rate. Minimum payment depends upon the balance but on the last statement was $142. I usually pay $200/month.
2. A personal loan with my bank. Current balance is $6795.07 with an 8.99% interest rate. Minimum payment is fixed at $211. I pay $211/month.

My credit card gives offers to transfer a balance to it with a promotional 0.0% interest rate until a stated date - usually just over a year in the future. A fee of 4% of the balance transferred is charged. Does it ultimately do me the most good to use this offer to move my personal loan balance to my credit card to take advantage of the 0.0% interest rate for 14 months? Considering the immediate $271 fee for the transfer and that the loan balance would be moved to an account with an interest rate 3.25% higher?

It seems like it pans out in my favor at my first glance, but I'm not sure how to calculate the numbers to know for sure. I would love help understanding whether this is wise and why. Are there spreadsheets out there I could use to dump numbers in and run this myself? I've carried this debt for a while and am indescribably relieved to finally start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just want to speed up the process and get this off my back.

Help me plan please!,"I'm currently 23 years old and living with my parents. I graduated with a B.A. in Journalism 2014 (no loans, parents paid for college) and have been working for 2 years at a job making 24k a year. Due to no living expenses by living with my parents, I managed to save 30k in two years. 

This August I have two major life events happening back to back that will both greatly affect my finances. Getting married on a Saturday and starting law school that next Monday. 

I have never paid a bill in my life, so jumping into living on my own + taking on around 60k of student loans is intimidating to say the least. 

* After the wedding, I am planning on starting law school with around 35k in savings. 
* I will be moving into future husbands house. He bought it in 2011 for 125k and it is now worth 215k (about 90k in equity!!)  BUT...
* He makes about 1k a month, his bills/expenses are about 1,300 a month. It's been this way for about 3-4 years.  He has been covering the extra with credit cards and is now 10k in debt. Meaning he is not able to financially support both of us while i'm in school, as I will have no income. 
*  With future husband paying rent + parents offering to pay bills while i'm in school (car insurance, phone bill, etc.), I am planning on living off my savings since I won't have an income and need to pay for food, etc. Planning on living off 750 a month. Meaning by the end of my first year, my savings will go from 35k to 27.5k. If need be I can go part-time for 2L and 3L so I can work, but i'm just trying to plan one year at a time for now. 
* Law School will be 20k a year for 3 years, From what i've researched, I'll probably be getting a federal loan with 5.8% interest.
* With the job market/state I live in combined with the school's employment data (yes the real data, not the data the school puts out), I hope to make from 50-70k when I graduate. I'm aware that it's slim pickings out there, and i'm not going into it thinking i'm gonna get out and make 6 figures. I've done a lot of research on the legal market right now and still want to go. 
For all intents and purposes, lets just say backing out of law school/the wedding isn't an option.

So my 3 main questions are:

1) What should I be doing with my savings? Using as much of it as possible to take chunk out of student loan? Paying off future husbands credit card debt? Leave it alone?

2) I feel like something could be done with future husband's 90k equity. Suggestions?

3) General advice on how I should plan/proceed?

How to minimize the damage?,"So I had the initial phone interview for a job and, as the title says, I made the rookie mistake of revealing my current salary. I knew going in that this was a bad idea, but I had interview jitters and just answered as a knee-jerk reaction.

&amp;nbsp;


The issue is this - I currently work as a data analyst(1st job out of college, been there a year) but am most definitely underpaid. My current job required a STEM degree which I don't have. I work for a federal contractor and essentially to fill the government client's little check boxes, I am getting paid about 15K less than I would have otherwise for doing the same job. (Essentially the feds have a set of requirements and if you don't meet them, they can't/won't put you in the corresponding pay grade). However, given that a lot of HR depts probably discarded my resume the second they saw my lack of STEM degree, I decided to suck it up and compensate for that by getting a year of work experience. 

&amp;nbsp;

Since starting this job, I've taken 5 grad classes in data science, become proficient in R and Python(data libraries), and generally became much more marketable. 


&amp;nbsp;


I recently applied for a Data Scientist job. I meet all of the qualifications (they don't even require a STEM degree so long as I have analytics/programming experience). However the average salary is 45% more than I currently make (One of my friends is a tech recruiter and has placed people at this company so I'm not guessing at the salary here). I know this sounds like a ridiculous increase; but given that I was definitely low-balled for my current job and have expanded my skills to meet the qualifications for this Data Scientist job, I feel I deserve this average salary.


&amp;nbsp;


I'm now worried that they are going to completely lowball me. I know that I need to sell them on my experience - and I think I can present the facts well. But I feel like they are going to lowball me anyway because honestly, they are in a great position to do so.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a second interview next week with the hiring manager. What strategies in terms of speaking / not coming off as a cocky upstart should I use? Other than straight up listing my qualifications, any tips/tricks to recover from my blunder? I plan on making it so they list the salary range first before giving my ""this is the lowest I would consider"" number. But I'm worried I'll get laughed out of the interview unless I play my cards right. Advice?

tl;dr I accidentally revealed my current salary to a potential employer in the first round of interviews. I meet all the qualifications for this job I applied for, but the salary avg for this job at this company is 45% more than I currently make.

personalfinance,College Student Seeking Advice for Investing in Treasuries,"Hi everyone,
I am currently a college student and I seek to invest in some U.S Treasuries. My reasoning behind this is that although I study finance and investing in school, I do not have the knowledge or funds to begin investing in equities.

With that being said my money sits in a savings account at a local bank with an APY of 0.150% .... which is absolutely nothing. Obviously treasury yields have incredibly low rates as well (I am looking at 2 year notes with roughly 0.87% interest that pays semi-annually), but I am a humble guy and if I am willing to make a little extra money safely even if its a couple bucks than I will. 

So if that means in a 2 year span I could make 30 cents on $100 in a savings account (assuming that the interest rate is constant, which it is subject to change) or $3.48 over two years for a $100 treasury note, I will take the treasury. 

My question(s) for whoever reads this is am I missing anything here? Will this not be worth it since I will be taxed at the federal level for this so called ""income""? How much would I be taxed? Would it be better to go with a bill, note, or bond and at what length? Are there any better options that I haven't considered?

Once again I am a broke college student that wants to save up some money, and I figure why not make a few extra dollars on my savings. Any information, articles, links, or videos that you could provide me with would be so greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",finance,1458279549

I have about $1.6M in tax free muni bonds, paying 5-6% interest. I purchased those two years ago, there's a nice unrealized profit of $50k-$60k but I'm interested in monthly income, not a capital gain of any kind.

Now, there's $300,000 sitting in cash earning a whopping $45 bucks per year. On one hand, I would like to invest the $300K into the same muni bonds and earn an extra $1,300 per month or $16,000 per year. On the other hand, the 30 yr treasury will rise over the next 10-20-30 years which means the NAV (principal amount) is at risk of going down. In the bigger scheme, maybe it doesn't matter if I plan on holding it for 10, 20, 30 years because i've learned that safe muni bonds aren't really like stocks and they do normalize even when there's a dramatic dip. Also even if the principal goes down, the monthly income stays the same. Obviously if the NAV went down and stayed down, the income would offset the unrealized principal loss.

Anyway. I can't decide to pull the trigger because a buddy keeps telling me that interest rates WILL go up over the next several months or years and I should sit on the cash and wait until the NAV goes down significantly so I don't watch my principal go down. Another buddy tells me I'll be waiting 6 months, a year, two years, maybe three, maybe five, and I will have lost the opportunity of $16,000 per year in that time.

The only reason I got the car was because it had under 40k miles on it and I wanted to get her a car that had low mileage. It was my first time buying a car and I made a lot of mistakes (not getting preapproved, buying a warranty, etc.). 

Anyways, the car payments have been a thorn in my side and my wife is going on 8 months pregnant. With a baby coming very shortly, I would really like to refinance the loan so I don't have to have a ridiculous interest rate and monthly payment. I tried calling around but most places refuse to refinance a car older than 8 years (mines 9) OR said it's not even worth applying because of how low my credit score is. I need help trying to solve this issue.

A few facts:
The car now has around 46k miles on it and is in great shape. 
I work full time and make around 27k a year plus benefits.
My wife works as a nanny part time, makes around 15k a year.
Current creditor does not refinance loans. Local credit unions do not refinance loans for cars older than 8 years.

Options that I thought of: I could try to aggressively boost my credit (which I think would be hard because I don't qualify for an unsecured credit card, my limit would be $200) and apply before the car is too old for ANY creditor to refinance, try to get a personal loan after boosting my credit, or as an absolute LAST resort I can ask my well off uncle-in-law for a loan from him that I can pay back with an agreed upon interest rate (which he may say no to). 

If you guys have any suggestions, please help!",finance,1458310545
investing,IRA investment question - 100% deductible?,"Hi, I'm using minimum amounts here because larger may have different advantages...

I'm just wondering if putting my money in a Traditional IRA by April 18th will be 100% deductible and therefore guarantee me a refund rather than paying in to the Fed this year for taxes.

So, let's say:

I owe... $350

I'll invest... $500 in a Traditional IRA

Will I get back a refund of $150 from the Fed? Or will I still owe some percentage of $350?

energy,What percent of solar energy is generated by private landowners?,"While utility companies and other non-residential entities are definitely the largest solar energy generators, both in terms of the amount produced and the number of new installations each year, private landowners are quickly closing the gap. [According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA)](http://www.seia.org/research-resources/us-solar-market-insight), there were over 135,000 installations in the first half of 2015 alone. They project that nearly 784,000 U.S. properties have now gone solar. This is a significant number in regards to reducing emissions, equivalent to removing roughly 10 million cars. But, why is this happening and what does it mean for America and the planet?

**Rising Utility Costs**

The average price, in cents per kilowatt hour, has steadily increased from 1990 to present, from a US total electric industry figure of 7.83 in 1990 to 12.52 in 2014 according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). For some Americans, this has triggered a desire to produce their own electricity with rooftop solar power systems. In fact, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the [U.S. rooftop solar capacity jumped 76% in the first quarter of 2015](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-09/u-s-rooftop-solar-capacity-jumps-record-76-in-first-quarter).

**Rising Utility Needs**

It isn‚Äôt just that utility costs have risen; it is also how much a typical homeowner perceives how much it uses that can influence them to switch to solar power. According to the EIA, the [average consumption per household in 2014 was 10,932 kilowatt hours](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&amp;t=3). Surprisingly, this hasn‚Äôt fluctuated by much over the past 15 years. We may have more electronic devices, but because they are now more energy efficient our average total consumption hasn‚Äôt changed dramatically. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean our perception can‚Äôt be different and could easily trigger a desire for a solar system.

**Lower Costs for PV Systems**

Many factors are causing a reduction in the costs involved with solar panel system installation, making them affordable and within reach for more Americans. In fact, some states have programs to help even low-income neighborhoods afford solar installations. There are both state and federal programs in place designed to lower costs and provide incentives for installing a solar system. Between rebates, SRECs and tax credits, many households are opting to supplement or replace their utility company power usage.

**How Does This Benefit America and the World?**

According to the SEIA, the [extension of the Federal Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC)](http://understandsolar.com/solar-itc-gets-extended/), will be a big factor in sustaining growth in the solar industry. This will equate to more jobs in this sector, perhaps more than 200,000 jobs over the next four to five years. This doesn‚Äôt just improve our economy from an employment aspect, but also because of the increase in investments that it will spur. Their projections are that the solar industry will be adding more than $30 billion annually to the economy by 2020.

When you couple this with the lessened emissions, you get a win-win for America. According to the SEIA, at the current rate of growth, by 2021 we could see emissions reductions comparative to 20 million cars or 27 coal power plants.

**Bottom Line**

The average growth rate annually in global solar energy capacity is currently 102 percent with private landowners a growing segment of the new installations. Currently, the world is saving 75 million barrels of oil a year. While the United States is currently being outpaced by Germany, Spain and Japan, as more Americans recognize the real and perceived reasons for installing solar, our planet and future generations will reap the benefits. In the end, it doesn‚Äôt matter what percentage of our solar energy is being generated by private landowners, as much as it matters that we all do our part in making sure advances in alternate energy resources continue.",energy,1458316825

personalfinance,How can a low-income student get financial support to pay outstanding tuition bills and complete his degree?,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm trying to help a friend (I‚Äôll call Allen), who is an undergraduate student, make a plan to address the financial problems preventing him from completing his degree. I‚Äôm hoping others might have some advice. Here is his situation, as best as I understand it‚Ä¶

Allen is a year or two from completing his bachelors degree (at a large 4-year public university). He is in his early-thirties. He‚Äôs a low-income student and a student of color, and he is stuck in limbo on his degree because he is unable to pay his last summer tuition bill (about $3,300). He had a combination of federal and pell grants during the regular fall/spring semester, but these didn‚Äôt cover his bill for summer classes, which is what the outstanding balance is for. He is in good academic standing with his university, but he will not be able to register for any more classes until his outstanding summer tuition bills to the university are paid, and he cannot afford to pay them. Although Allen is very active in local electoral politics and community activism, he is currently unemployed and homeless, presently staying with a friend. He is trying to find a job, but has thus far been unsuccessful. He has applied for private loans to pay for the bill, but was denied. He doesn‚Äôt have anyone he could ask to co-sign on a loan for him. He has tried to apply for another Pell Grant to cover the outstanding bill, but those forms of financial aid cannot be used to pay back existing balances. A bill of $3,300 may not seem like a lot, but it‚Äôs currently an insurmountable amount and he needs help making a plan to address it.

-Are there any forms of fellowship, loans, grants, etc. that could be used for outstanding tuition? 

-Any advice on routes a student could take if they want to complete a degree but can‚Äôt afford to pay outstanding tuition bills? 

-Anyway other forms of financial advice or resources you think he might look into? 

Right now, he has been trying to crowd source some financial support from the community, but that is not a consistent form of support and likely won‚Äôt deal with the more substantive debt issue that is holding him back from completing his degree.

Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

Payment type: termination

Tax year: 2016

I currently have unemployment benefits since I was laid off this year from a different job.

What should I do with this check that they gave me as I'd like to not put a hold on my unemployment benefits that i'm receiving.  Google tells me that rolling it into a IRA would be viable option.  My current income is not very good (only unemployment benefits atm - not very much either $350 every two weeks) but I am sitting on some cash in my bank account that is helping me out with bills.

Given the following:

 - not making much (unemployed)

- I'm in a safe but volatile place (bank account money just sitting around.  Moved back in with parents, few bills to worry about atm)

- i'm 23 yr old going to school

- priority is to not complicate my unemployment benefits at the moment and 2016 tax return later.

The idea of a retirement investment is nice and sure i'll contribute to something like that when I have a stable income.  Since the figure is so small ($212) is rolling into an IRA a viable solution or should I treat it as a emergency fund that I cash now even though i'm not in an emergency situation, i'm doing okay despite making little right now?  Is a savings account possible with this distribution where it won't effect my benefits or tax return?  

I'm embarrassed about mentioning the unemployment benefits complication to a banker so I've come here first to seek guidance.

investing,College Student Seeking Advice on Treasuries,"Hi everyone, I am currently a college student and I seek to invest in some U.S Treasuries. My reasoning behind this is that although I study finance and investing in school, I do not have the knowledge or funds to begin investing in equities.
With that being said my money sits in a savings account at a local bank with an APY of 0.150% .... which is absolutely nothing. Obviously treasury yields have incredibly low rates as well (I am looking at 2 year notes with roughly 0.87% interest that pays semi-annually), but I am a humble guy and if I am willing to make a little extra money safely even if its a couple bucks than I will.
So if that means in a 2 year span I could make 30 cents on $100 in a savings account (assuming that the interest rate is constant, which it is subject to change) or $3.48 over two years for a $100 treasury note, I will take the treasury.
My question(s) for whoever reads this is am I missing anything here? Will this not be worth it since I will be taxed at the federal level for this so called ""income""? How much would I be taxed? Would it be better to go with a bill, note, or bond and at what length? Are there any better options that I haven't considered?

We are looking to buy a home for $280,000.

Backstory. In 2011 I filed for bankruptcy because I was no longer able to pay my student loans on my $20k a year salary. My lawyer did advise me this would put a five year deferment on my student loans, and that they would incur interest on the time they are sitting idle. 

In that five year mark, I was able to double my salary, buy a decent used car in cash, get my life back in order, and pay back the people I had borrowed money from. I made minimal payments to my student loans in that five year mark. Minimal meaning I threw a couple hundred here and there at them. 

Im finally settled mostly, and feel I can start paying some of these down, and I want to pay them off early. I have so many questions, and I'm so lost on where to start. I'm actually excited about beginning a road that leads me to being debt free. 

That being said, with the amount of debt I have, I'm unsure I actually can pay it back in a good time, and I have so many interest rates, I'm not sure which one to give priority to, or if I can at all. 

Loans:
2 private loans. One is totalled at $72,620.84 with a 10.5% interest rate. (yep!) The other is totalled at $13,093.33 with a 8.75% interest rate. 

4 federal loans, all with a 6.4% interest rate, and all roughly $4k. 

I know I could do the snowball debt payoff where I pay down the smaller ones first, and work my way up, but honestly, should I not try to kill the outrageous $72k bill as much as I can? 

I know I'm going to be eating beans and rice for the rest of my life. I know that I will be paying this loan until I die. But I at least want to know that I am paying them in the right order until I die. I'm hoping at some point I have other options than to live like this, but I am completely lost on where to start.

Is it worth paying off the loans quickly or should I just pay it off over the full length?  Will this help or hurt my credit score vs. paying it down within the year?",finance,1458354235

personalfinance,Best way to pay charged off credit card debt (NFCU),"There is a charged off credit card on my credit reports with Navy Federal that was opened by my dad in my name back in 2005 that went delinquent in May 2014 when my dad filed for bankruptcy. I've explored every option from filing legal action for the falsified application to letting it go per SOL to paying it in full and given it a lot of serious thought. 

My new goal is to pay it in full by the end of the year because it is the fastest, simplest route and I know I want to have the option of using NF's services in the future. So, after my upcoming salary increase goes into effect in mid-April, I am looking at applying roughly $1500/mo after expenses to the $13,913 debt to be aggressive and reach my goal.

I don't have any other credit accounts on my report at all which makes this an even more important issue to address. This leaves me with three questions:

1)Would it appear better on my credit report to make monthly payments of the $1500 which NFCU would then report to the three bureaus?;

2) Should I just put the money in my savings each month and then make one lump sum payment at the end of the year?;

3)Does anyone with a similar experience with NFCU have advice or input in pushing for a written agreement to delete the account from my report once it's paid? Is that something that NFCU would consider?",finance,1458358084

politics,"To Stop Trump, Don't Be Surprised If Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders End Up Running Together","By Stewart Lawrence

It sounds like an absurd plan. Hillary Clinton has largely vanquished Bernie Sanders as an alternative to her candidacy from the left. She has a lock on African-American voters, and to a lesser extent, Latino voters. She generally beats the 74-year old self-described socialist among women, especially older women. She runs extremely well in the South, the stronghold of the Republican Party. 

Should Clinton win the nomination this summer, which seems likely, what would she need Sanders for?

The answer is simple: party unity. Sanders has exposed a deep rift inside the Democratic Party that Clinton alone will be unable to heal. Most Sanders supporters are strongly opposed to Clinton; they see her as ‚ÄúRepublican-Lite.‚Äù They don‚Äôt just disagree with her on policy they vehemently oppose her as a figurehead of a corrupt political establishment that has caused poverty and misery for many Democratic base voters. Clinton may well decide to ignore Sanders and choose a running mate more to her liking ‚Äì Julian Castro, the charismatic former mayor of San Antonio who currently heads up the federal housing authority HUD, is often mentioned as a prospective VP choice. So is Tim Kaine, the former DNC chair and current Virginia senator, who might help Clinton carry a key battleground state in the general election.

The problem? These candidates, while flashing liberal credentials, may not be able to galvanize Sanders supporters, especially his overwhelming support among youth and working class voters. In a year of the political outsider, in which GOP front-runner Donald Trump threatens to cross over and scoop up disaffected Democrats, including Sanders supporters, this could prove fatal to the Clinton campaign unless Sanders himself is on the ticket.

Recall that Barack Obama faced a similar dilemma in 2008. Clinton ran neck-and-neck with Obama and even bested him in the last month of the campaign. Clinton supporters were so upset at her loss that they demanded that Obama put her on the ticket. For a while, it even appeared that this might happen, and for much the same reason that Clinton must now consider Sanders. Without the active support of Hillary and her base ‚Äì she bested him 2-1 among Hispanics, for example ‚Äì Obama‚Äôs team worried he might not have a unified party behind him.

Obama, in the end, worked out a different deal. He quietly offered Clinton a top post in his cabinet, as well as future White House support for a second Clinton presidential bid, which apparently mollified her. But for VP he chose a ‚Äúgraybeard‚Äù ‚Äì Joe Biden ‚Äì a member of the white male Democratic political establishment that could vouch for his candidacy among wavering independents. In hindsight, it was a brilliant stroke. 

The difference with Sanders is at least twofold. First, Clinton has nothing to offer him that might lead the Vermont senator to broker such a deal. At his age, he is in the twilight of his political career. Sure, he could accept a token nomination as Secretary of Labor, but in the American executive branch, that‚Äôs a junior appointment at best. Sanders has emerged as a leading voice in the Senate on immigration and veterans issues, and consigning him to such a narrow portfolio would be practically an insult.

Second, and perhaps more important, there‚Äôs a real chance that Sanders ‚Äì or his supporters -- will stay neutral ‚Äì or tepid ‚Äì if Clinton is the nominee. His disagreements with her go far beyond the rifts that developed between JFK and LBJ among Democrats in 1960 or Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush among Republicans in 1980. Sanders is not even a Democrat and though he caucuses with the party in the Senate, he has a real independent streak on guns and trade and military intervention, for example. And pressure from his own base ‚Äì including calls for a third-party bid -- could also keep him from fully backing a Clinton ticket in the fall. 

In the end, the real problem for Clinton is that her candidacy draws most of its energy and legitimacy from Sanders. Prior to his entry into the race, she was planning to run as a center-left candidate to the right of Barack Obama. To win Obama‚Äôs support and to accommodate the party base, she has since shifted most of her domestic policy positions to the left. It‚Äôs worked sufficiently to overtake Sanders in the race for the nomination but it has left the Sanders movement ‚Äì and Sanders - with an unusual degree of moral authority and gravitas that she now avoids at her peril.

The chief argument against putting Sanders on the ticket is that he pulls the Democratic ticket even further to the left. But many Democratic strategists believe the party needs to concentrate more on mobilizing its base than wooing a relatively small sliver of independent voters. And don‚Äôt forget, Sanders actually polls far better than Clinton does against the entire GOP field, especially Trump. Is he really such a liability?

Just as some Republicans are anticipating an unwieldy Donald Trump-Ted Cruz pairing as a way out of an ugly impasse on the right, don‚Äôt be surprised if a Clinton-Sanders ticket emerges for the same reason on the left. Both parties desperately need to consolidate and unify their warring internal constituencies. And once they do, it could turn the November race into an unusually fierce and unpredictable contest.",cryptocurrency,1458363469
personalfinance,Help us budget to pay for school,"Hi all,

Starting in August of this year, I am planning on entering a teacher credentialing program. I will be able to complete this program while continuing to teach full time, which is very advantageous. The main problem is that the program is considered a ""fifth year undergraduate"" program for FAFSA purposes, so I can only get $12,500 in federal student loans max. This leaves me with about a $9,000 gap (due for the last semester in about May 2017). 

My partner and I have resolved to try to save most of the $9,000 by then, so that I will not have to take out a large private student loan. Please tell me if this budget looks viable. (And no, our rent is, unfortunately, not outrageous as we are in the Bay Area). All the below is per month. 

Combined monthly income (post taxes, 401ks, and health insurance): $6,800

Rent: $2,830

Utilities: $100

Car payment: $500 (to partner's parents-no interest or minimum payment amount, but we would like to keep this up)

Current student loans: $600 (we're currently paying $1600 a month, which is way over our calculated monthly payments, but we will reduce this temporarily to pay for my credential program. $600/month is still more than the minimum). 

Groceries: $300

Car insurance: $133 (both under 25 and partner had an at fault accident less than 5 years ago)

Savings: $400

Phone bill: $70

Subscriptions (Netflix and Ipsy): $22

Misc. spending money: $300

I have calculated that we should, in theory, be able to save about $1500/month towards my future schooling. Does this look unreasonable? Is there something I am missing? We are both very lucky to have our employers covering health insurance 100%, have no credit card debt, etc. 

If this is reasonable, how can we budget to ensure that we are actually saving this amount? 

Edited to add: I am also looking into working part time this summer, as I have the summers off from teaching. Perhaps as a camp counselor or customer service at a gym (in which I have a lot of experience from college). Thinking this would also be helpful to save a couple extra grand. 

Thanks!",finance,1458363879
personalfinance,"Early 30's married couple with $104k student loan debt and meager retirement savings, trying to figure out a game plan","As the title states, my wife and I are in our early 30's with $104k in student loan debt.


My wife has $67k in federal loans at 6.8% and is currently on a graduated repayment plan. Her current minimum monthly payment is $570/ month (and that will go up to around $700/month in another 18 months). Current salary is $77k/year and her employer has an amazing up-to-10% match on a 403b (she has contributed the full 10% from the start and will always continue to do so). Currently she has $37k in a TIAA-CREF Lifecycle 2050 Fund (and that is the full extent of our retirement savings so far). Her job is very stable as she is a tenure-track professor at a major research institution, but the salary is not likely to climb much higher, ever (the highest paid professors in her department, who each have at least 20+ years of experience are in the mid-$80k range).  

 
I went back to school for an undergrad degree at 29 and I will be graduating in a few weeks at the age of 32. I took out $37k in federal loans, of which $11k is at 3.86% and the remaining $26k is at 4.29%. I have job lined up already with a base salary of $67k per year (before performance bonuses). While in school, I have been working as well making about $27k/year, but most of my take home went back into school expenses, food, and building our emergency fund (which was unfortunately recently depleted).


Other expenses we have are $1200/month for a mortgage and $270/month for her car payment (for two more years). We use credit cards extensively (for reward points), but neither of us have ever carried a CC balance in our entire credit histories. My car is paid off, but is also 10 years old with 135k miles on it. My new commute will be 35 miles each way (my current commute to school is 3 miles each way and I work remotely from home right now), so I may want to get a newer car before the extra 300+ miles a week causes any major issues (and my gas mileage isn't all that great either, about 23 mpg). 


Anyway, so in terms of getting out of student loan debt, right now our plan is to defer my loans for the first six months after I graduate. We want to use that six months to put 100% of my new take home pay into our emergency fund (we currently have only $3k left in there after some recent plumbing issues with our house). From my calculations that should put us at around $25k in the emergency fund. Then, we'll put my student loan on a graduated payment plan which should put my minimum payment at $250/month for the first two years. We were thinking of basically covering living expenses and savings with one salary, and dumping the entire other paycheck into the student loans (starting with the highest interest rates first) for as long as we can. Does this make sense to do? Since we are in our 30s with basically no retirement savings, after hitting the employer match level for her 403b and my 401k, should we be maxing out Roth IRA contributions instead (since we can never get a missed contribution year back) and then work on the student loans? 


Also, I might as well ask here since all our other info is here, but regarding my car. Am I foolish to even consider the upcoming Tesla Model 3 as my next car? I do tend to keep cars for a fairly long time; I bought my first car with 70k miles when I was 16 and drove it for 10 years until it had about 170k miles on it. It still ran great, but was starting to get impractical as I got older (it was '95 Toyota Celica). My next car after that is my current car, which I also bought with about 70k miles on it ('06 Nissan Altima). I know that the idea of buying a new car is already usually pretty foolish from a financial standpoint, but the $7500 tax credit makes it appealing. Realistically I know that I'll probably just end up buying another reliable used car, but the Model 3 is still something that I'd like to dream about a bit more.

Direct Unsubsidized Stafford $771.30 @ 6.550%

I know its not much, but she's got about $150 extra at the end of the month. Right now we have no 401k or IRA or anything, but she's got $7,000 in her savings for when it rains, so I'm thinking we're at a point where she can pull $1,000 on a Roth IRA deposit and get some small monthly contributions going in while she climbs the ladder at work, right? 

I guess my biggest question is at what point would the interest gained from an IRA outweigh the interest lost on her loans? Does it make sense to throw the $150 at the loans now or what?

We got an extra $1700 and my husband is doing piece work til they need him back at his job. We have $2340 in the bank now which will cover our next month's rent and insurance. He said that they don't need him back yet because the machines aren't working and they need somebody to come fix them before he could do his job. The temporary piece work is back breaking labour but pays amazingly well, not sure how long he can do it for. Dr told him to rest his injured knee but he can't as after posting this we had a talk about our financial affairs and I expressed my concern about how worried it all makes me. He says it is no big deal really, and when he can get back to his regular job he'll take overtime and we can pay it off quickly. He says that the possibility of homelessness is small (I was quite worried after reading all of these comments) because we still have $20,000 on our credit cards if it ever came to an emergency like that. Obviously that would be a possibility if we continued on our current course long-term, but it is not some kind of pending disaster and that the troubles we are in at the moment can reasonably be reversed. That I am just getting anxiety because of hormones and such. 

We think it is a good idea for me to take in some other children to help pay off our current debt sooner. We were thinking maybe one child all day at ~$40/day plus after school care for ~4 children for 1-2 hours for $10 each so another $40. Ending up with an extra $80/day or $1600 a month. But he doesn't think I should do it until our baby is a little older and I have recovered some postpartum. With the $1600 for me and the $4800 from him, we should be able to make $6400, minus our expenses $3700 for $2700 to the debt, minus $400 for the interest means $2300 to the principal each month and we should have it paid off in a little over a year. 

I completely support him staying home with me for this postpartum period and see nothing wrong with it, and was surprised by the personal attacks when I simply asked for advice on a personal finance message board. He had to stay home. The children had to be kept separated. I was told that pneumonia could lead to baby's death. What father wouldn't cut work to be with his child in the hospital? Clearly I can't bring a newborn baby there and neither of us could live with ourselves if she had to be in there all alone. My husband said that the thought of homelessness is melodramatic, likewise the thought of moving into cheaper housing, and I'm being negative and discouraging. Our current rent is the average norm where we live. Rentals are hard to get here and there is huge competition for them - way more people wanting to rent than there are rental homes available. It took us two months to find a rental here. He says it is better to be in debt than to live in the ghetto where our children would be in an area with crime, drugs, and so on. Not long ago in the papers a child was raped over there. Better to be in debt a little longer. And even if we wanted to move, why and how would we break our lease? Our home and our landlord are both great. They have a semi-government funded housing complex here in town, but I looked it up and ALL of the units are on hold for the coming syrian refugees. 

Our situation is not all that unusual. We live in suburban Canada and there is no public transit. The average person has $21,000 consumer debt according to the most recent survey, a gallon of milk is $5, beef is ~$20/kg. The urban areas are more expensive and the rural areas have no jobs. 

What did us in was the frequent moving, car issues, and the driving without insurance fine. The fine was $7000 on a credit card and his insurance afterwards ended up being $500. Most insurance companies would not even insure him. He had purchased a used car for $800 from a friend and it ended up needing thousands of dollars in repairs, we thought it would have ended up being a good deal in the end but it was not worth it in the end. After sinking so much money into it, he sold it for $200 and got a better car that we are making $130/month payments on. My husband injured his back in my 9th month of pregnancy and could not work, and that was when I did lots of cash advances and we racked up a huge amount of debt in that period. There was also a failed business attempt that was hard too. 

The moving was extremely expensive. We first rented a cheap crappy bachelor basement apartment ($750), and ended up moving because it was far too small. Then we lived in a 1 bedroom basement ($950), but we had many issues with the landlords and they would not fix anything. Same with another cheap place we tried. Then we decided to go up a little in rent and try our luck with that, but the tenant in the basement apartment had a dog that barked all day if it was inside and roamed free jumping on people if it was outside. Tried for so long to stick it out but he and my husband argued so much and there was so much tension over it. Eventually phoned the police over the dog, and he got fined for its barking and for it not being registered, and he went ballistic and threatened me and I was afraid so I begged my husband to negotiate with the landlord to break the lease, and he did. The next place we moved to had an ok rent ($1500) but there were so many repairs, new things would break every week and the landlords would refuse to fix it, so we went to a higher end place ($1750) thinking we wouldn't have the same problems if we were willing to pay more. This place was great but somebody kept trying to break into our house and there were always footsteps in the backyard, police didn't catch the person, and I was afraid and again asked my husband to please break the lease so we could move. So we did, again, and now we are in this place. 

I did always cook from scratch for many years, baking my own bread, all of that, I invented my own homemade dry cereal and homemade protein bars. Every time we moved, and with each new baby, I would stop and get takeout food for a season. I have examined my own habits and feel selfish and bad about it. We eat a lot of meat and have to cut down on that now. Aside from that we are going to try to lower our interest rates on our credit cards, lower our insurance, and ask the tax agency if we can set up a payment plan to pay it off long term. We did taxes with tax software, would it be worth the time to do it by hand and see if we get a lower figure? Are there ever errors with the software? I was shocked by the large figure. If I did it by hand it would take all day ~8 hours would I be wasting my time?

Ironically I went to private school for finance (hah), quit after a year because it wasn't what I wanted to do (was pressured into it by my father, once he was out of the picture I quit immediately) and it took me a year of hard living and not eating to pay off that school debt. I worked with show horses after that, but haven't worked since I first got pregnant 5 years ago and have no resume. We intended to have a traditional family with me staying home, but I am ok with working to help pay off the debt. I may try applying for a coffee shop or something or try to get some part time work in my old field with horses. The jobs I've had have been through word of mouth and I don't even remember when exactly I worked at which facilities and it might be tricky trying to make a resume and track down old contacts to help me as references. My midwife does not think I should work, but maybe in a couple weeks or something it will be ok to. I am skilled in childcare and housework if that counts for anything. I am especially great with tiny babies so I might try a night nanny or something like that which I think could pay well. 
 
I am getting mixed answers about the cloth diapers and the deep freezer and I am not sure whether to go ahead and invest into them or not. We are spending $100 a month on diapers now as my daughter who is about to turn 4 regressed and stopped going potty right after she watched my husband injure his back. I think it stressed her out some and she is troubled by it, and nothing I do seems to make her go back to using the toilet and I have her back in pullups for now :(

The new meal plan I have made has homemade cereal for breakfast, sandwiches with homemade bread and canned fish for lunch, fruit and vegetables for snacks (cheaper ones like apples, oranges, carrots). For suppers I am going to do only 1 night of good meat, 1 night of sausages, 1 night of chicken, 2 nights of eggs, 1 night of liver, and 1 night of rice and beans or mac n cheese. Mostly served with homemade broth and cheap vegetables like onions, carrots, cabbage, frozen veg, seasonal/sale. And then do the last week of the month with really dirt cheap meals like peanut butter toast and rice and beans every night for one week to save a little extra money. 

Once we run out of products I am going to go back to making my own like baby wipes and laundry soap, and try some other ones like deodorant and body lotion. 

I was kind of overwhelmed and found it hard to reply to all the responses, tried to cover everything in this one post. 

I am still feeling anxious and depressed about it but trying my best to stay cheerful for my husband and children. Feeling good with some hopeful solutions ahead :)",finance,1458373699

A little over a year ago, I refinanced with my credit union. My current balance is $34.5k with a 1.79% interest rate. The vehicle is ""lemon worthy,"" but I am stuck with it it would seem. I am sick of the higher payment and the constant troubles with the vehicle. Even though the vehicle is a CPO, the car has gremlins. The trade value is about $10k-12k difference from pay off. 

What are my options? 

TL;DR - Stupid car trade lands idiot into 10k difference. Hates car due to car problems and wants out. Only option to continue to pay on the car until it catches the negative equity or other miracle options?",finance,1458405270
personalfinance,Money in a Fixed Annuity Income Plan,"I'm 25 years old, and have about $4200 in a Fixed Annuity Income Plan with Northwestern Mutual, and I'm not really sure what this means. The account started with about $3000 ten years ago, which I believe was from my mom's life insurance policy when she passed.

The interest rate is 3.5%, and as far as I can tell, the interest collected is the only way this account has gained money--though I only have documents back to 2010, since it looks like the account was migrated/consolidated from somewhere else at that time. Is it a good idea to keep this money in there for the foreseeable future? The interest rate is much better than any savings account, and I have about $30k in my savings already (I'm a grad student making about $28k / year), so I don't immediately need the money or anything. Is there any drawback to keeping it in there indefinitely, i.e. until retirement?

personalfinance,I have 23K in Student Loans at 6.8% interest. Will refinancing (which requires consolidating) them to a lower interest rate ultimately hurt or help my credit score?,"I have a decent credit score for how damn poor I am and how much debt I have, ~740. I also have 30K in student loans, 23K of which are at a 6.8% interest rate.

They are current in good repayment standing and when I *don't* reapply for IDR this October my payments will pick up again (currently on IDR for 12mo paying $0/mo - told you I was poor!).


My question is: if I refinance my 23K in loans that are at 6.8% (the other 7K have a reasonable rate), and that refinancing requires consolidating the loans - but will probably reduce my interest to 2.5-3.5% - is it worth it in regards to what will happen with my future credit score?

**I don't know anything much about how refinancing and consolidating can hurt, or help, someone's credit and that is the main part of the question.**


Also, note that I am currently in route now (now that I got a good job) to pay off all 30K in probably only 3 years. 4 years MAX.


Considering that as well, is it even worth it to worry about refinancing or should I just go with my game plan and pay these puppies off in 3 years?

Edit: Regarding the car. I bought a 2013 Ford Fiesta in July of 2013. It had transmission problems since the day I got it. It has been in the shop a lot to try and fix it. I talked to Ford and they have no way to fix it permanently. I traded in that car for $5000, and rolled the other $5000 left due in that loan into the current one.

Edit 3: I could always talk to a credit counseling service and roll the personal loan payments into a Debt Management Plan.

Edit 4: I'm currently figuring  $400 to $450 extra per month from the part-time job.

personalfinance,Are there any advantages to not consolidating student loans?,"I have 16 student loans that I took out when I was in University, totaling ~$60,000. I have a job that pays pretty well (~$70,000), but I haven't really been paying much towards them besides the minimum required. Obviously I haven't made much of a dent in them, but it hasn't been a huge burden on me (...yet...), but I'm assuming it will come back to bite me later on... I haven't really looked into consolidating, since paying these the way I have been isn't really a big issue (except for the fact that I'm basically wasting time/money attempting to pay them via their minimums). Is there an advantage to paying these loans off in their current state (16 separate loans, across two loan providers/handlers; 5 federal subsidized, 5 federal un-subsidized, and 6 private), or should I seriously consider consolidation?

If I don't consolidate, I want to start paying down the highest interest loans (most are ~5% interest; but there are 4 at 6.8%, and 3 at ~8% that I want to pay off first). I get a statement from the loan servicing companies every time I need to make a payment, and it seems that it just has a total minimum, not a minimum across all of the loans serviced by them. Is it possible that I could 1) increase payments and 2) put all of a monthly payment towards one loan instead of the others? I'm going to be calling the loan servicing companies on Monday to get more information about this, but I thought I'd ask here as well.

I'm also just looking for some advice in general... I've been handling my loans poorly from the beginning, and now I think I need to really get a handle on them before I can't pay them easily. I don't anticipate issues, but I don't want these loans lingering around if something bad were to happen to me or anyone close to me. I can provide more specifics, but I was kind of trying to keep it a bit generic (hence the reason why I'm using a throwaway).

**EDIT:**

Also, forgot to mention earlier, I have about $1500/month extra after budgeting for 2016. I'm planning to put this full amount towards loans. I'm also spending the majority of my yearly bonus to pay off one of my 16 loans that has 8% interest and is serviced by a separate servicing company then the other loans.

personalfinance,Considering taking out extra in a student loan to buy a used car. How bad of an idea is this?,"I'm an undergraduate student graduating in May, and preparing to attend grad school. I have a GA position and will be attending in an area with a low cost of living, so I will not have to take out anywhere the maximum federal loan ($20,000). In fact, I'll probably taking less than half that.

However, I also would really like a car. I'm not quite in the category of *needing* one, however in the three years I've been without (my last car broke down and wasn't worth fixing), it's been a massive inconvenience, and the lack of a vehicle is affecting where I can reasonably live next year (most housing is far enough away from campus that walking isn't a reasonable option for me). It is also a major inconvenience to rely on friends to get to the grocery store, only see family when they can come to me, etc.

My plan would be to take out $3,000-4,000. My income from my position as a GA will be enough to cover gas and insurance. Saving up that amount of money will take at least one semester (five months), which doesn't solve the immediate housing issue.

I have fair, bordering on good, credit (probably 700 by the time I would actually purchase the vehicle), but an immediate car payment would put a lot of stress on me, on top of paying for food, housing, and so on (part of which will be supplemented by my student loans, but I will still be relying on an income from the GA position).

a) My employer never took out state taxes, only federal

b) My employer, based out of California, has been deducting pay for California's SDI (disability) that I should not be paying into.

If turbotax is being used to prepare the taxes, what should I do to fix the incorrect SDI being withdrawn, and how do I correct for the state taxes never having been withheld?

personalfinance,Can you refinance part (but not all) of your existing federal student loan balance?,"Hello PF, 

I have $20k in outstanding loans, and expect to have it all paid in a year's time (very frugal, work in management consulting). My workplace has a deal with SoFi that grants a $300 sign up bonus if we choose to refinance our loans. I'm a sucker for free money, and I enjoy the current thought experiment.  

My current federal effective rate is 4.58%; the low end of my proposed SoFi variable rate is 4.66%. Should these conditions hold and I pay the balance in year as I plan to do, the transaction has a roughly $275 net benefit for me. It's still profitable until the variable rate hikes up to around 6.2% (the fed is getting awfully comfortable with the economy though... rates are looking up).

So, the best way for me to snag as much of the $300 as possible would be by refinancing the smallest allowable portion set by SoFi ($5,000). THE QUESTION: Can you actually do this? Can you only refinance/consolidate a part (but not all) of a federal student loan? Would this adversely affect credit score?

I'm someone who identifies as a Democrat (I'm very liberal on social issues, but slightly more cantered on fiscal ones) who is yet undecided. I agree with most of Hillary's positions on the issues; or at least what she claims her position is. My scepticism comes from my notion that she is wholly dishonest. To me she seems like an untrustworthy and Machiavellian politician. I have spent probably 10+ hours researching Hillary and over and over I find what seems to be evidence of mendacity. She lies about smaller things like her claiming on multiple occasions to have landed in Bosnia under sniper fire, when in fact she was clearly in little to no danger as she greeted a small child, a class of seventh graders, and military personnel for an extended period of time. Small things like this, to me, give insight into her morals and what she‚Äôs willing to do for political gain. I know that many people like to disregard the email server, but to me it‚Äôs extremely important. Previous secretaries of state did indeed conduct State business on their personal email, but this was occasional. Hillary on the other hand had a personal server specifically set up to handle ALL emails, state and personal alike. Claiming this was for convenience is really no excuse as it is a clear breach in government protocol. Multiple sources close to the FBI including a former Federal Prosecutor have stated that the FBI is going to recommend indictment to the DOJ. Hillary deleted 30,000 emails that were ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù but in no other situation would this be accepted. It is impossible for her to discern what is related to her job and what isn‚Äôt. Beyond this, her leadership in the Benghazi affair was disastrous. She claims to have not read communications from THE	AMASSADOR TO LYBIA and many others stationed in Benghazi regarding the security concerns. In my opinion she should have read these correspondences. Even if she was too busy to have read the messages, she surrounded herself with people who made poor decisions about the security situation and in any light shows an utter failure in leadership. Her ties to the Clinton foundation are equally troubling. The foundation (legally) accepts donations from foreign and domestic parties. The influence her foundation wields and those who can contribute to it represent a clear conflict of interest, there is no way around this fact. To most of you I probably seem like a rambling Republican who is just mudslinging, but I really have done extensive research from as many sources as I could find. I find it hard to not question her character and cannot justify voting for a politician like Hillary Clinton. I would like to know your guys responses to these issues so maybe I can see her in a different light. I‚Äôm happy to expand on any of my points or answer any questions you have about my claims.

Company X made $32,000 this month.
Overhead (product, electric, water, ect.) Comes to a total of $3,200 or 10% of this months resources.

Now take say 5% ($1,600) and put it towards the community that Business X resides in.

March 16, 2016 ($33.63 intraday) Update

Thesis:

We have owned this at an average cost of around $102.60. We had a smallish position for us of just under 2.50% allocation. With deterioration, we are now at about a 1% position. I would consider owning Valeant at these prices for portfolios that can tolerate the very high risk. There is not enough data, nor management trust to believe the numbers, and the chance of implosion is quite real. Yet, the potential for reward is there, and Valeant should have revenues well in excess of $10B in Fiscal 2016. In any case, any position we had would be &lt;3% (probably well less) of anyone‚Äôs portfolio. My gut tells me that we will just stay status quo, but as days and months go on, that could change.

Observations:

The risks to Valeant are numerous and material, yet we will continue to hold Valeant, perhaps to its death star. Of course I see some type of possible positive outcome, or I would just sell the shares.

Valeant held a conference call yesterday discussing current events, expected 2015 numbers, and guidance for 2016. The market destroyed the stock by a 51.5% drop.

William Ackman wrote to investors yesterday, ‚ÄúWe continue to believe the value of the underlying business franchises that comprise Valeant are worth multiples of the current market price.‚Äù 

Pearson is claimed to have said, ‚ÄúOur business is not operating on all cylinders, but we are committed to getting it back on track.‚Äù

Analysts have been discussing that lenders very possibly will not force a default, since cash flow is being presented and guided in a positive light. The clock is ticking, loudly.
The company is being accused of accounting irregularities and federal fraud violations. It is possible, that if so, a death spiral could or would quickly occur. Perhaps value would occur for bond holders, if equity holders were wiped out.

Valeant released an 8-K yesterday. Here are some notes I gathered from the release:

1. ‚ÄúPreliminary unaudited fourth quarter results were impacted by softer-than-expected sales of the gastrointestinal business, as compared to previous guidance issued in December, driven by reductions in the wholesale and retail channel in reaction to Valeant‚Äôs announcement of an agreement with Walgreens.‚Äù

2. 2016 Total First Quarter Revenue expected to be $2.3 - $2.4B, prior guidance was $2.8 - $3.1B. Total 2016 Revenue is projected to be $11.0 - $11.2B, prior guidance was $12.5 - $12.7B.

3. 2016 non-GAAP eps is expected to be $9.50 - $10.50, prior guidance was $13.25 - $13.75B.

4. ‚ÄúIn discussion with the Board, we have assumed lower growth in our U.S. dermatology, gastrointestinal, and woman‚Äôs health portfolios, as well as certain geographies like Western Europe, while keeping our expenses largely unchanged. We plan to work hard to improve these metrics by delivering higher revenues and reducing our costs and, if successful, we hope to beat this guidance in the quarters to come. In the meantime, we are comfortable with our current liquidity position and cash flow generation for the rest of the year, and remain well positioned to meet our obligations.‚Äù Michael Pearson CEO

5. ‚ÄúOn the revolver, we ended the year with $250 million drawn on the revolver and we're now at $1.45 billion. We obviously are generating cash in the first quarter.

The risks include:

1. A formal investigation by the U.S. federal prosecutors for overly aggressive pricing and potential insurance fraud.

2. Drug price policy reform by the U.S. government. This would be a concern for most of the specialty pharmaceutical industry.

3. Excessive debt levels, which could become difficult or impossible to maintain. Valeant mentioned they will be able to meet debt levels, but of course that can be taken with a grain of salt.

4. Default risk with delays of releasing its annual statements (10-K). Valeant claims they are negotiating with lenders to cure the late filing default provisions. It is my understanding that if this is allowed; it will often come with a cost, which could be 1% of the technical defaulted obligations.

5. The presentation of Non- GAAP numbers are concerning, primarily because management has given us no reason to trust them. The non-GAAP looks to eliminate all the bad stuff such as stock compensation, various asset step ups because of business combinations, acquisition related costs, impairment charges, restructurings, amortizations and foreign exchange. All a bunch of crap, especially from a company who doesn‚Äôt seem to know its ass from its head.

6. Potential exodus of employees departing in mass.

7. Lack of liquidity exaggerated by inability to divest non-core businesses.

Valeant has some meaningful institutional ownership:

 Bonds

The credit default swaps are not deteriorating as much as the stock is. Yet, an article in the Wall Street Journal today stated: ‚ÄúThe cost to insure Valeant bonds against default using Credit Default Swaps spiked.‚Äù This contradicts the chart below. Keep in mind, I am hardly an expert on Credit Default Swaps, and could in theory be using faulty data.

Bonds are showing deterioration, but not death star (yet):

Bonds 2020 ‚Äì 2025 seem to be trading (bidding) at the 10% to 11.5% range. Pricing ranges from 75bps to 85bps. Bonds at this point do not appear to be showing imminent death.

 Morningstar wrote today

‚ÄúAs long as the company can stabilize performance and address near-term volatility from the discontinued Philidor relationship, we currently envision Valeant can produce sufficient cash to pay its $1.6 billion cash interest payments in 2016 with some leftover to help pay management‚Äôs target debt reduction of nearly $1.7 billion. At the end of the year, Valeant‚Äôs senior secured leverage ratio of 2.1 came in under the 2.5 debt covenant, and EBITDA interest coverage of 3.3 similarly surpassed the 3 times covenant requirement. However, the company‚Äôs delayed 10-K will remain a concern as management attempts to negotiate with lenders on a cross-default risk by missing its financial reporting covenant. As long as Valeant can file its 10-K by the end of April, we anticipate the company is likely to avoid a technical default with lenders.‚Äù  Morningstar 3/15/16",finance,1458488082
personalfinance,Handling an inheritance in light of giant student loans,"I'm a 29 year-old single government attorney. I make ~$56k, with around $6,000 in savings. I currently owe $130,000 in federal student loans, which I can't come close to paying the principal on. I'm on IBR and my plan has always been to put in my ten years in government and then avail myself of public service loan forgiveness. Unfortunately, two years in I dislike my job immensely and the private sector looks more appealing every day. Sometimes I think about abandoning the ten-year plan and instead searching for a high-paying private job that will let me start digging out of the $130k.

Enter the inheritance. It's going to be around $35,000, lump sum. I have no idea what to do with this money. If I intend to stick with government, then obviously it would be a waste to pay down loans that should be forgiven in 8 years anyway. But if I leave and go to the private sector, then what? My law school experience didn't touch on any personal finance, so unfortunately I'm flying blind. I'm looking for advice on what to do with the $35k if **(a)** I stay with the government and rely on loan forgiveness, or **(b)** move on to a higher-paying private job but lose the loan forgiveness option.

personalfinance,Scholarships on 1099-MISC taxable or non-taxable? [federal income tax law],"My nursing student wife received money in HRSA Nurse Corps scholarship awards. HRSA writes the amount in 1099-MISC in box 3 as ""Other income."" In all the brochures, the HRSA program itself makes it very clear that this is taxable income. 

However, there's a local accountant who has successfully filed the scholarship money as non-taxable for many nurse scholars last year. He attaches a sheet, which claims that scholarship money can't be taxed, since it goes directly to the schools. Further, the IRS website says this:

&gt; Do not use Form 1099-MISC to report scholarship or fellowship grants. Scholarship or fellowship grants that are taxable to the recipient because they are paid for teaching, research, or other services as a condition for receiving the grant are considered wages and must be reported on Form W-2. Other taxable scholarship or fellowship payments (to a degree or nondegree candidate) do not have to be reported by you to the IRS on any form. See section 117(b)-(d) and Regulations section 1.6041-3(n) for more information.

For what it's worth, I also found [this thread on the TurboTax forums](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2101940-how-do-i-enter-nurse-corps-1099-misc), which seems to invalidate the use of the 1099-MISC form for scholarships. I'm wondering whether the accountant and the internet thread are misinterpreting the tax law. Or is there some error by HRSA and the amount should **not** be taxable?

I don't want to report money as untaxable, which actually is taxable, and get hit with the fee when I'm audited. What in your opinion is my best course of action?

btc,"Using colored coins, smart contracts, and oracles to create a currency pegged to dollars","Just as an interesting experiment I thought it would be cool to think of how to accomplish this . I can see that it might be useful for a few people:

*Those wanting to ""short"" bitcoin temporarily without needing an exchange that shorts.

*Those wanting to have dollar liquidity (move dollars around like you move bitcoin around)

*Those wanting a loan in a more stable currency than bitcoin so that the real cost of their loan does not rise over time.

&gt; So I was trying to think of a way to introduce a currency through colored coins that was pegged to the value of something stable such as either gold or dollars. Problem is that alt coins usually have the same volatility that bitcoin does, they go down when it goes down.
So it would work like this: 1. create the smart contract and have a pool of bitcoins in it. Lets say 200 bitcoins. Issue colored coins (lets call them greenbacks). So each colored coin would represent a dollar value. A person who sends their bitcoin into the contract would receive these colored coins in return. The person running the contract would need to have another stash of bitcoins on an exchange. Lets just say that is also 200. When the smart contract receives bitcoins the same amount are sold on the exchange. There would be some percentage taken when this is done.. Lets just say 1 % would be profit towards the runner of the contract. These colored coins are redeemable so at any point in time the owner of the coins can send them back to the contract and they will receive bitcoins in return. When that happens the same amount of bitcoins are then bought on the exchange by the contract owner. There could be some minimum set for the amount of the bitcoins in the fund. The idea is you want to guarantee that the person using this contract will not get ripped off. So you could have 200 coins in the contract, with a rule stipulating that 100 coins must always remain in and the point of the other 100 coins would be a buffer of sorts.
Problems: Someone could just hang on to the coins indefinitely and it would cost you money because holding funds on an exchange is a form of risk. Solution: Introducing some sort of negative interest rate. For instance you could set the negative interest at 1% so that if the colored coins are not returned within 1 month, they are worth 1% less. this gives the owner of the contract at least 1% from the initial trade and then 1% a month thereafter. Problem 2: You need to amass a certain amount of capital to get things going and since you need buffer room you could probably only use half your capital to earn interest. problem 3: You might need to find a country to do this where there aren't any capital gains taxes. Buying and trading coins on an exchange might look suspicious if you never report your taxes. The risk is the exchange. problem 4: some people might try to use your service as a mixer so just make sure that you charge more than typical mixing. So maybe 1.5 % out and 1.5% in. You would probably need an oracle for the price of bitcoin and maybe one for the time as well (unless you could calculate the negative interest by the colored coin themselves somehow). With this scheme money laundering is impossible since you are just trading a virtual currency for another then back again and never exiting to real money. Therefore you shouldn't need to take identity information",cryptocurrency,1458498287

personalfinance,Is it ever a good idea to buy a home and pay off mortgage in 2.5 - 3 years?,"Background:  Age 28.  Single, no kids.


Annual Income: ~140k; Take home:  ~6.6k per month.  I've been working at this current job for a little over 1.5 years now, and so far it's been going okay...


Maxed out 401k - ~$18k/year; I also have 5k in an IRA from 2 years ago which is still with my bank and I haven't done anything with it.


Zero debt (parents paid off my school loans in 2014, and I then helped pay off parents' mortgage in 2015)


Current Savings: $50k in Ally savings account, generating 1% interest.


Home I'm looking to buy - 2 bed 2 bath condo, ~$160k


Current expenditures:  ~$1095 a month on rent, ~$40/month on internet and $30/month on phone, ~$400-$500 a month on credit card (mostly for food); everything else in my paycheck I've been putting into my Savings account.


Apartment lease will be up at the end of August this year, and I'll need to have bought my home by them.  I'll be planning on putting at least a 20% down-payment - which will be taking ~$32k out of the $50k I have now.


Interest rate won't really concern me all this much if I'm planning on paying ~$5k per month towards mortgage and principle to pay it off in 2.5 years.   I'd be putting the rest (~$1k/month) into replenishing my Savings (until I get back to at least $50k, after which, I might try my hand at that whole investing boglehead-thingys that I've read about on this subreddit).


My question is, is it a good idea to pursue this course of action of paying off a mortgage in 2.5-3 years?  


The reason I'd like be completely debt free by the time I'm 30 is because I don't know how stable my position is.  I'm fairly certain I won't be fired or laid off in the next 2-3 years.   So if I can be completely debt free, I shouldn't have to worry even if I do lose my job in 4-5 years down the line.


Oh and the reason I want a 2 bed 2 bath is because I'd like to rent out the second bedroom to someone, so it can help cover the HOA fees each month and most of the annual property tax.


Once I have those things covered, the only expenditures I really have to worry about are just internet and phone, and food.


Is this a good plan for my situation, or should I be doing something more optimal in my current situation?

personalfinance,Paying for college - is there any way I don't have to burden my parents?,"Hi everyone. I will hear back from all of the colleges I applied to soon - before April 2. I have been accepted into every one that I have heard back from so far, including a couple that I never expected to get into. 


One of these colleges, which I didn't really expect to get into, also gave me their Financial Aid response. Here is the breakdown per two semesters of the ""awards"" that they gave me as shown on their applicant link (I used quotes because I don't really know if some of these can be called awards):


**Aid to Be Credited to Student Account:**

* Grant: $35,000

* Federal Perkins Loan: $3,000

**Other Awards:**

* Federal UnSubsidized Stafford Loan-Additional: $2,000

* Federal Subsidized Stafford Loan: $3,500

* Federal Work-Study-Academic Year: $2,000



This college has a tuition of around $49,000 and is 4 hours away from home, so I must dorm there, which, including food, will cost about an additional $14,000. Adding up the Grant and Loans that they gave me, the ""award"" for the 2016/2017 year that I would receive is $45,500, but this includes all the loans that they included. 


Who pays for these loans and when must they be re-payed? My parents aren't in a very good financial situation but they said they will do whatever they can financially to get me into the school that I want to go to. Obviously, I don't want to burden them any more that they already are and I was wondering about these loans that they included in my Financial Aid ""award"". When must these loans be re-payed and who pays for them? Is it the responsibility of the student after graduating, or do the parents have to pay during the course of their child's time in college? Also, is it expected that the amount for room and board and the meal plan will be payed out of pocket, because I don't think my parents are in the position to write $14,000 checks every year.

The issue is that we're both recent grads, with little income history. My husband is a programmer, and makes &gt;100K/yr, but took a year off and didn't make much in 2015. (Though he did work in 2013, 2014, and has a job currently).

I just graduated and started my own business, and made around 54 K in 2015. But that's my only income history.

My mom is willing to co-sign with us, she is retired and makes around 40K/yr. 

The mortgage broker we spoke to is offering 4%, while other banks, such as TD is offering 3.25 with 1 point, or 3.15% with 1.7 points. The monthly payments at 4% are somewhat doable, but would be a strain on the budget.

He says that big banks like TD like to pre-approve people, but will back out or change the terms significantly at closing. 

Does anybody have experience with this? Would our somewhat unusual income history bar us from getting good interest rates, even though we both have excellent credit and will make &gt;170K this year?

personalfinance,Graduate students maybe buying a house?,"Hi PF! My (soon to be) wife and I are finishing up our undergraduate careers and moving on to our next step. I recently accepted an offer for a PhD in Physics from Duke that covers all of my tuition as well as my health insurance. 

The 9-month stipend they offered is just under $30,000, I also can (and will) work in a lab over the summer for an additional ~$5,000 making my income $35,000 a year guaranteed. I've also been awarded an additional $10,000 in a one year fellowship, with the option to apply for additional pay from the institute in the future. For the purposes of being conservative, this money will not appear in the calculations as they aren't guaranteed.

My fiancee intends to work for the first 6 months and then do an accelerated nursing degree which will take about 16 months. The cost of this should be next to nothing considering her family's income is below the poverty line and assuming that her financial aid is the same as it was last period (and there were no significant changes) it should be basically free (may include federal loans, which will be accounted for in a hot sec).

We combined owe $109,000 in student loans currently and to be safe lets assume we accumulate $11,000 due to not getting what we expected in financial aid and to round it out to $120,000. None of these need to be paid until I'm finished with school (~5-6 years) and she's done with her schooling (after the nursing degree and perhaps after getting an advanced practice nursing degree).

Our annual expected pay for each item:

Food: 3600
Utilities: 2600
Gas/Car: 1000
Random: 2600
Taxes: 5300

Leaves us with: $19900 annually. 

This leaves us with about $1650 monthly to account for housing. Housing options seem to be interesting in NC. The average rent for a 1 bedroom is about $720 a month including any extra fees or what have you. The obvious pro's of this are the lack of worrying about things going wrong and having to cover them with our emergency fund.

Looking at a 30-year loan we could get a house for $90,000. Throwing this into a loan calculator and taking into account our surprisingly decent (720ish) credit scores we can expect about $600/mo in a mortgage including insurance and taxes. This is assuming only $4500 down. The state of NC also has first time home buyers perks including up to an additional 5% down and some substantial tax credits (up to about 33% off), which will make things much cheaper still. There's also the advantage of renting out the house after our 5-6 years are up and keeping the house in the physics grad student lineage to try to keep the tenants someone I can know.

Additional information:
-We're getting married in June and most of the expenses have been covered. We're asking for money to help pay off our student loan debt instead of normal gifts
-My fiance plans on working too before and after her nursing degree. She won't make a ton before with her Psych degree and only a 6 month window, but after the starting salaries for a nursing degree in the area amount to about $50,000-60,000 which will drastically change our financial situation. This has been omitted because anything can happen.
-I could also get the odd fellowship (NSF, some Duke based ones, etc.) or she could get some scholarships. Again not accounted for.
-I have a car that's paid off (and in surprisingly good shape) that will serve as our vehicle, we may or may not be picking up another one that is paid off from my parents in the future.

Is there anything I'm missing?

I was very recently laid off from my job. I have already applied for unemployment and figured out what monthly services to cut. Just weeks before being laid off, I paid off my car which reduced my savings by $5500 but also eliminated the $300 monthly payment. I want to be able to use my savings (about $7k plus 2-6k severance/final paycheck) to last as long as possible in case I don't find another job quickly. Student loans are my only debt.

I have about $12,000 left in 2 student loans both through Great Lakes. Before being laid off, I had a plan to have these paid off in less than 18 months (adding the car payment into student loans) but now I'm not sure how to proceed. Both loans have an interest rate of 6.55%, but I think if I'm not enrolled in auto pay, it goes back up to 6.8%.

Do I take the $15k from my sell and buy the newer truck outright, and continue paying monthly on my previous loan? Or do I pay off my previous loan and use the remaining $7k as a cash down payment and get a new loan to finance the remaining $8k? I should note that the new truck is a 2005 so it may be troublesome finding a bank that will do a low interest rate loan for a truck 10+ years old.",finance,1458515491

I'm a stay at home mom and before that a housewife. I have terrible credit, medical bills that went to collection when I was young. We just paid off our car, in husbands name, and are thinking about buying a new car so he can use the old one to commute to the city instead of taking the bus. And that gave me an idea...

I want to buy the car in my name with my bad credit. I understand the interest rate will be high and that would mean we would be throwing away a lot of money in interest on the loan. BUT! If we can afford the car payment, high interest rate and all, wouldn't it be worth it as an investment in my credit? Instead of ""wasting"" the money I'm thinking of it as paying to build my credit. And can't I refinance when my credit score goes up? 

Does that make sense or is this a bad idea. I'd like to bring it up to my husband soon but I want to make sure this is as good of an idea as I think it is. Thanks for any/all advice!",finance,1458536855

personalfinance,Help me help my parents get out of crushing credit card debt with no escape in sight. Should I take out a loan for them to lower their interest and monthly payments and provide a way out?,"**TL;DR: My parents have a ton of high interest credit card debt and can't afford the monthly minimums + their slightly underwater mortgage + bills without overdrafting and using *more* credit. Their credit sucks now too because of some recent shenanigans with my younger sister missing payments and this insane credit card utilization so they can't consolidate. They want me (late 20s, good job, good finances) to get a loan for them at a low interest level for 5 years for the balance, so that they can actually work on paying down the principle every month and afford the payments. Trying to figure out if that's really the best option for them and how to best (for me and them) help them out.**

My parents racked up $45,000 in high interest (~20k of it is at 20-28%) credit card debt and can't keep up with the minimum payments + mortgage they can't get out of yet + bills (even with lowering their spending as much as possible) and end up in a cycle of more and more debt (from overdraft protection) while almost never paying down the principle. And now they have shitty credit, thanks in large part to my little sister (who also is a reason for much of the debt)'s poor use of credit, so they can't get any sort of reasonable debt consolidation loan with smaller interest rates and monthly minimums.

They're in a shitty mortgage on a house they bought pre-bubble. If the housing market recovers and their house hits break even (it's definitely trending that direction and getting close), they can sell it and use the proceeds to cover the debt and dramatically lower their monthly expenses as mortgage + taxes was pricey.

Basically, they're stuck and they see no way out.

I'm lucky and fortunate enough to be somewhat successful and financially secure (late 20s, ~150k salary, $35,000 cash, $35,000 liquid investments, no debt, $80,000 401k) and would like to help them in the best and most reasonable way I can. Best both for me and for them.  I want to help them because they raised me and spent plenty of money on me growing up and now I can help them back. I wouldn't be where I am today without their support over the years. This is not a ""bad family"" situation, we are still very close and live in the same city (for now). I just want to do it in the smartest way.

To manage and pay their debt down, my parents asked me to take out a $40,000 loan for them with a low interest rate over 5 years, slashing their minimum payments and interest paid each month and giving them a path towards balance 0 and allowing their credit scores to recover. Then they'd pay down the loan each month and at least have some breathing room to live, instead of constantly getting into overdraft to pay off the minimums and bills, thus increasing the cycle of debt and eventual interest. They cannot get this sort of loan themselves because of the bad credit situation, but I can. I'm cautiously optimistic that they will be able to pay it every month and fix their finances, but I know that this is a big risk for me, but also one that my financial situation won't be destroyed by should the worst happen.

Before I help them, I want to see real action on their part. They say they've already cut spending as much as possible, but I will make sure. I'm helping them make a full spreadsheet budget of their cash flow each month and ensuring that every option is considered. I'm good with numbers and excel and mint.com and I can basically cook up any scenario.

There are two end-games, my dad says... 

1) With the CCs paid off and utilization down to 0, his credit score will recover. Once it recovers enough that he can get a personal loan for the remaining principle of the loan I take out, he pays off that loan with his loan, and then the debt isn't on me any more and they can keep paying down the principle. 

2) When(if) the house gets to that break-even point, they will sell the house, use most of the equity they'll get back to pay off the loan and they will move to an apartment they can afford.

I want to hope and trust that if we did this, they'd be able to pay it off monthly in reasonable installments and everything would be fine, but I live in the real world and I know that there are still risks -- if the market crashes, another recession, etc -- I'd likely end up on the hook for the remaining debt. The only good thing is that I can eat it if I have to due to my financial situation, should it ever come to it (and I doubt it will -- I do really trust them and think they can do it).

Does anyone have any other ideas on how I can help them? Maybe without me taking out a humungous personal loan?",finance,1458544503

personalfinance,Is paying off my student loans early a good plan?,"I have about 12k left in federal student loans, at interest rates if 6.55% and 3.8%, I think. Split up between about 6 smallish loans (a subsidized and unsubsidized each from 3 years of college). I also have a credit card I pay in full each month and never spend more than $300 of the $1000 credit limit. I have no other debt, and the way the landlord handles utilities means that everything is in his name and we pay him, so that's not helping with credit.

A relative wants to help me out after I helped her out when her husband died. She wants to give me about $500/month explicitly to get me debt free. In addition to the roughly $200-400 I throw at the loans each month (on top of the minimum) this would have me paid off in the next... year and half? There's still at least five years left on the oldest loan. 

I'm actively trying to build credit. My most recent credit score was 691, when I got the credit card in January. I have heard other people on this sub say that their scores have dropped when they have paid loans off early. Is it smart for me to pay off these loans completely and have no installment debt? It's an attractive concept, to dump a bunch of money in now and pay less in interest long term, but I am looking to buy a home within the next two years and I don't want my score to drop.

personalfinance,Looking for reputable lenders for consolidating high-interest CC debt,"I graduated college in Spring 2015. I had a manageable amount of student loans but hit a funding problem senior year and took on credit card debt. I realize in retrospect this was a stupid decision but I didn't educate myself well on private student loan options.

I'm now 10 months out of college and making progress on the debt. However, the interest rates on my credit cards are pretty high. By my estimate I pay about $226 per month in interest on consumer debt. My goal is to refinance all of my credit card debt through a private lender at a lower interest rate than what I pay now.

Current debt picture:

* 7 credit cards with an average APR of 19.05%. Debt of $11,858 on total limits of $19,150 for a utilization of 61.92%
* 1 personal loan (from my credit union) at 16.99%, balance of $2,676.
* Federal student loans at an average of 4.00%, balance of $15,479
* 1 private student loan at 8.00%, balance of $5,398

**Total debt: $35,412 at an average APR of 10.63%**

Credit Overview:

* According to CreditKarma: TransUnion 653, Equifax 661.
* Utilization: 71% (will be 62% once my reports are updated for my latest payments)
* Payment History: 100%
* Derogatory Marks: 0
* Average Account Age: 2 yrs, 2 mos
* Total Accounts: 13

I get a lot of mail from various lenders offering to refinance my credit card debt but I'm skeptical of trusting any lender who sends me mail about refinancing. I've received promo materials from:

* Lending Club - sound questionable from what I've read
* Prosper - sounds fairly reputable
* Fortiva - can't find much info one way or another

Note: I know that a common response is to try to get 0% APR credit cards. I already have gone through 3 of those over the past few years (Amex Blue Sky, Amex Every Day, Chase Slate, and Citi Double Cash) and due to my current credit picture I don't know what else to apply to or how good my chances would be. 

Last but not least, relevant overall financial information:

* Income: $70k annually, about $3800 per month after taxes
* Rent: $980
* Utilities/monthly recurring expenses (excluding debt payments): ~$400.
* Generally able to pay about $1500 towards debt per month including minimum payments

In particular I'm looking for advice on refinancing options to lower my monthly interest (I can make monthly minimum payments without any issues), but I'm also open to any other advice about my situation.

I recently started budgeting again and it's going well but slow, so my monthly expenditures (just bills - $1911) are taken care of.  I'm just having a hard time knowing how much I should be putting in each of my savings areas and also would like to know how much I should be spending on my everday expenses because I'm worried I should be putting more money aside then I am.

I've just started budgeting again, so when I wasn't my accounts took a pretty big hit just because I was spending recklessly.  I didn't like it and decided to make a change.  I really do need to get my extra spending under control because I'd like to get more out of my money.  Just from budgeting again I've seen how bad my spending habits have been (spent almost $350 on stuff like groceries, gas, food, going out in only 7 days)

So anywho, I received $3000 of the $5000 I am going to get from various school reimbursements and taxes.  I want to use that money to the best of it's abilities and also to kind of understand how much I should be putting in savings and what a realistic Everyday expenses might look like at my income level.

Ok so let me put it all out there.

Assets

* $865.77 - Savings
 * $200 - Buffer - Currently using YNAB's method so this could also be called my ""emergency fund"" or whatever.
 * $415.77 - ""deep savings""  - money I don't want to have to ever touch.
 * $100 - House fixing
 * $150 - Vacation

* $500 - Checking. obviously this number is changing constantly, that's where I keep my money for everyday expenses and bills in.


Here are my debts:

 * $1911 - Monthly bills (includes car loan, house payment, car insurance, cable, netflix, phone, hulu, internet)

 * $844.18 - A best buy credit card- 0% until Jun 2016
 * $1200 - TSP loan, set to be paid back at the end of next year. - $50 payments back to my TSP from paycheck.
 * $1461.62 - Credit Card with bank
 * $12,000 - Car loan - 350/month but I make $400 payments
 * $135,000 - A home loan - $1000/month - includes taxes and insurance
 * $5000 - in federal loans that are on deferrment for the next twoish years with no more debt related to school forseen due to tuition assistance.


My main goals are as follows:

* Pay off debt (credit card debts)

* Fix up my house to include some new flooring and a new kitchen, but i know that'll be a project that'll take up quite a bit of time to save up for.  I would like to pay for it all in cash and just save money up for each new project and then do it.  Hence the ""house fixing"" category in my savings account.  With the initial cash I'd like to at least be able to pay for the new flooring in my basement and potentially a new bathroom (about $3000ish) but wouldn't need to buy it all up front so some of that money could come from allotments I make to that ""category"".

* Pay off car loan early and then roll extra money into house payments and house renovations

* Have 3 months of buffer so that I can pay my months bills at the first of every month and then just repay the account so I'm not living paycheck to paycheck.

* Build savings and eventually start maxing out my TSP contributions as well as contributing to other investment accounts.


OK, so TL;DR:

Where should I put $5000 of extra cash?

What should I be contributing to each of my savings and spending areas based on my monthly expenditures and income?

What should I be focusing on first as far as house renovations, emergency fund, and ""deep savings""?

I am 25 years old and as I stated earlier I recently purchased a house (my grandmas house as she passed). I currently have a Student Loan payment and a Car loan payment as well as other monthly bills which are listed below.

I currently work full time and make about $43,000 a year ($1,122.50 paid bi-weekly after taxes, 401k, and insurance). I also work with a friends family business on weekends when they need help which can bring in any where from $100-$400 a month depending on how much I work. I have not taken this part time jobs income in my finances as the amount I work can change quite a bit.

Bills:

* Mortgage - $810.90 
* Car Loan Payment - $272.21
* Car Insurance - $72.85 
* Student Loan - $292.43 (2 loan payments on 2 account $206.60 and $85.83)
* Cell Phone Bill - $78.20
* Gas/Electric Bill - $110 (average based on first month in house)
* Water Bill - $50 (guessed as I have not received a bill yet for this)
* Time Warner TV/internet - $108.82 

Bills total $1,795.41 and take home money is $2,245 which leaves $449.59 a month for food for any other expenses. ( I feel like this is very low and will mean I have to cut it close each month)

Loans/Credit Cards

* Student Loan Account #1 - $17,293.83 (6 loans in account with different interest rates from 6.5% to 3.1%)
* Student Loan Account #2 - $5,607.12 (6.55% interest rate)
* Car Loan - $8,792.92  (about 3.5% interest rate)
* Best Buy Credit Card - $25 current balance (I pay off this card in full every money)
* Kohl's Credit Card - 0 balance (not used much but paid off when ever used)
* Chase Freedom Card - 0 balance (new card and have not used yet but planning on paying off in full each money if used)

Savings/Retirement

* Savings Account - $1,191
* Checking Account - $22,493 (more in checking as at my bank I get a better interest rate in checking compared to savings account)
* 401k - about $3,000 currently I put in 6% and my company matches 50% up to 6%
* Roth IRA - About $3,000 put into Target Date Funds

I don't believe I missed anything but if I did I will add it. 
My plan is to pay off my small student loan account today ($5,607) to save the $85 dollar payment each month. I want to keep at least $10,000 in the bank as a emergency savings. I am unsure if I should put more toward student loans or retirement right now as I am just about to start making payments on the house.

If there is anything that I seemed to have overlooked or anything that stands out please let me know. I appreciate any insight or criticism, thanks.

personalfinance,How I Overdraft All The Time and Never Pay Any Fees,"I accidentally figured this out after the Federal Reserve enacted Overdraft reform for banks. I made sure to opt out of all ""Overdraft protection"" programs from my bank. 
One day I had about $5 or so in my account and went to pump gas and accidentally pumped $10 worth. I had used my zip code verification for my debit card. I see the charge on my online statement as $1.00 hold. The next day the $10 shows up and overdraws my account by $5.00. I was never charged a overdraft fee.

I still continue this practice a day or two before I know Im going to get paid. And it works on funds obligated for Pre Authorization holds that never settle too! Im not sure if banks are aware of this loophole, but I think BOA mentioned it in this document http://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2008/August/20080804/R-1314/R-1314_15803_1.pdf?bcsi_scan_2687365ababd2c82=5sLpOD7xEv84VmIrj9ifS8s2IU8gAAAAkdbKmg==&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=R-1314_15803_1.pdf

personalfinance,Taxes - Zero Income - What to File,"Hello.

This past year a friend and I started an LLC together. He has paid for all of the expenses for the LLC over the past year. We have not made any income yet as the product was not finished. To make matters even worse I didn't have another job (and thus no W-2) and the LLC is legally based in my friend's state (and would need to file 2 state taxes). 

Since my financial involvement with the company is nothing for this first year, both the person he hired to do his taxes and my father (who has owned his own business my entire lifetime) are saying that I just don't file the Schedule C. This would also have my 1040 saying that I both made and spend nothing; putting me under the filing threshold for federal and both states (PA and NJ). 

All of this is making it sound like I don't need to file taxes this year, but I am really uncomfortable with that. Is there something I overlooked or some paper to submit that says I made nothing?

Would a 1040EZ work, even without a W-2 and I don't need to do anything with the company?

Do I spend the money to get TurboTax Business and submit it by mail? (I already went through the motions with TurboTax, but it is running into the issue of not being beyond the federal threshold)

Is there another tax software that may help more?

I would just like some advice from some different people.",finance,1458581798
personalfinance,Budgeting! How does this plan look to relieve my debt within a year?,"So I'm just now really looking into a strict budget to get rid of my debt within a year. I'm currently sitting on almost $10k in debt that I feel I could get rid of quickly (this being auto loan, credit card, medical bills, and some other misc debt).

How my debt currently looks:

**Credit Card** - $3,996

**Medical Bills** - $762

**Cell Phone Payment** - $486

**PayPal** - $1,486

**Auto Loan** - $2,526

**Total** - $9,255 and some change

I'm 23 (yeah I had some dumb choices with the credit card, but I had to do some payments for my medical bills on it early on) making roughly $3,300/mo plus bonuses that range anywhere from an additional $300-500/mo, but I don't want to use those for my repayments. All other expenses (mortgage, utilities, insurance, etc..) come out to about $1,800/mo so I have some money to play around with to repay all of this. I do not want to just throw all the extra money into the debt because I want to have a savings built up just in case. I currently have almost 2/mo worth of savings built up, but I would really like to up this. 

I'm getting $3,000 later today that I plan to use a small amount to get the ball rolling. I plan to use only $1,100 of this to pay back some stuff to free up money that I can then use to throw extra at other expenses. Currently my cellphone bill is roughly $110/mo so I'd like to pay off the phone I have through Verizon (using a payment plan because I needed a phone that day for work) and then switch to Project Fi. Doing this will drop my cellphone bill down to $40/mo. I'd then use the other ~$600 and some extra money in my checking to pay off the medical bills. Those two free up an extra $200/mo that I could spend knocking down other debt. 

With those two taken care of, I plan on throwing the extra money at the PayPal balance (PayPal Credit still on 0% interest until July (I know, it's a mistake, but again work related)). I want to try and get rid of this while it's at 0% so I don't have to get murdered by the interest rate after. Getting the PayPal Credit taken care of first is a major concern for me because of the interest rate. 

After I take care of the PayPal Credit I'd like to focus on my credit card. With the PayPal Credit, medical bills, and phone being taken care of I feel like I could start throwing roughly $500/mo at the card to really knock it down without hurting the amount going into my savings. This here will take the longest time to cut down, but this should still put me within the year to pay everything off. 

The only reason I'm not putting the car into this payment process is the car payment is $88/mo. Paying it off may help some, but the extra money I get from paying the other bits off help at knocking down the bigger debts much faster. 

**TL;DR Breakdown of the payment plan**

Today: 

Pay off Verizon debt and medical bills along with switching my carrier to Google.

**Extra $170/mo minimum**

Monthly Breakdown until July:

PayPal Credit! $400/mo Until payed off (Should be 2 weeks before the interest rate kicks in. I may try to pay it off sooner to not give any possibility of the 20%+ interest rate to kick in)

**Extra $400/mo**

July -&gt; Card pay off:

With the other debts taken care of I can easily throw anywhere from $500 -&gt; $700 at the credit card until it's paid off or down to $200. Paying more allows me to put less into my savings than I would like, but would help out tremendously. If I paid $500/mo it would take me roughly 9 months to pay off the card. 

This is just a simple budget I'm setting up in high hopes I can get rid of this debt fairly aggressively without hurting myself if 
something goes wrong.

The medical bills are relatively low in terms of payment cost per month ($50/mo roughly), but I want to get those taken of because it's such a low amount. I'm most worried about the PayPal Credit amount because of the coming interest rate. Would it be smarter to put off the medical bills and use the $762 to go towards the PayPal Credit payment first? The payment program for the medical bills is really, really forgiving. I can skip payments because I have never paid the minimum for it at no cost (I called them to confirm this because my minimum payments for the longest time have been $0) With the cellphone bill dropping by almost 2/3, I could then use that extra money, while paying the minimum on my credit card, to chop away at the PayPal debt even faster freeing up more money to pay off the medical bills. I looked at this at first as getting rid of the small debt first then working on the bigger. I'm adamant on getting both the PayPal and credit card paid off within a year. 

In regards to monthly expenses, yes it's high. My work requires me to have a good internet connection and sadly TWC charges an arm and a leg for the speeds I need. Mortgage by itself is up there ($703/mo) but it's my first home and it was exactly what I wanted/needed. The vast majority of my monthly expenses could be cut down significantly when my roommate(s) move in, so I that will help. But as with everything here, I'm trying to do my entire budget based off of me living alone as that would be worst case scenario. 

First time going on a hard budget, how does this look? I've been browsing around the last few months reading what people say and looking at other's budgets and this is what I've come up with for myself. Any comments, critiques, or even blatant asshole remarks are welcome. I'm trying to secure a pretty strong financial future and I'd rather the reality checks come in the form of text on Reddit than final notices in the mail.

personalfinance,Help Avoiding The Appearance of Structuring,"Hello PF-

Wanted to reach out for a quick opinion. Just became recently engaged and am planning our wedding for later this year. While visiting family, they decided to provide our wedding gift(s) early in the form of $19,750 between a grandparent and an uncle. 

I'm curious as to how to deposit these funds without appearing as if I'm structuring.

Check A: $9,750.00
Check B: $9,998.00 + $2 bill

Check A was just given to us on the first night we got to town. 

Check B was given to us on our way out of town after the weekend. The amount was sort of a coincidence--she intended to give us $10,000.00 but shorted it $2 as I had standing bet with her recently-deceased husband on two NFL games last year which she provided to me in a $2 bill that he had written the score of the game on prior to his passing. 

My question for the group is how do I deposit these funds without appearing to be structuring....if that's even a risk in this case? Both checks indicate that they're wedding gifts and are from family. My bank is USAA and my deposit limit is $10,000/day so I can't deposit these together, even if I wanted to. 

Any thoughts on here for watchouts--I know banks automate reporting to the feds based on their own behavior tolerances, but I wanted to make sure that we didn't actually do anything wrong here.

personalfinance,(CAN)Under student debt and taking care of my family. Asking for first finance planning help,"Hello PF,
This is my first post in this forum but ive been lurking and watching people‚Äôs success stories for a while now.
So financial history.

Im about 60k in student loan debt with an unnatural interest of 13.5% ( just a private bank and I was desperate to study so I took it). I make about 78k before taxes annually and after taxes around 55k.

My fixed spendings are $1000 towards student loan. $1000 to support my family ( our dad chose to casually walk out on us) and about 1000 in rent. Leaves me around 1200 a month on personal spending.
Out of that I send on groceries and gym membership. I have a number of ‚Äúunexpected spending‚Äù like health problems,sister education fee that have occured out of nowhere in the past year for myself and my mother and sister,im on a work visa so fee for applications, driving lessons etc.
Ive been working for around 9 months now and have taken two major trips and everything said an done, I have about 18k in liquid with no debt except the suffocating student loan.
I know everyones first recommendation will be pay off the loan but I cant. I don‚Äôt have anyone I can depend on in case of an emergency. Our father froze all our assets and gives no money to my mom or sister so I am theirs and mine only  hope if something goes wrong(eg accident,/ any other financial emergency). I do plan on moving to a cheaper house and will probably knock off about 300 in my rent. But that‚Äôs about it. Where I reside the average rent is 1k with the lowest being around 7-800. 

I really want/need to buy a car. Im in a new city with not a lot of friends and have no way to get around for groceries etc except paying cab which can really add up. and if i do that, it comes out of the 1200 i have left over for spending. which means i contribute LESS to my savings AKA scary

How can I plan my finances better? Is my financial situation really fucked?
Should I be investing? If so, how ? 

Should I take a loan with a lower interest rate to pay off the student loan and then pay off the second one slowly?

Because of this iv'e been looking at buying another car. At first I was going to buy another cheap 2000$ beater, but then I realized that it wouldn't be a bad idea to take out a car loan to build my credit. 

I currently live with my mom, and like I said I'm 20 years old yet I have ZERO credit history. So of course the interest rate is going to be atrocious, but I am putting down between 4500-5000$ down payment for this car. To me that's better than having to get a co signer just to get approved...

I'm looking at buying something between 10000-12000$, If I put down 4500$, according to the CIBC car loan calculator I will be paying 280$ on a 3 year loan or 225$ on a 4 year loan. Now keep in mind that my budget is only 10000-12000$ so I'll probably be buying something around the 2012 model year. That means if I get a 2012 Ford Focus on a 4 year loan I'll be paying it when the car is 8 years old. Is that a smart idea? 

I'd prefer the 4 year loan because with the 3 year loan I only have 400$ left over every month after gas, food, ins, board and other things. On the other hand I don't want to be making payments 3 years from now on a unreliable 7 year old car...

I had terrible credit (around 600 score with $30,000 student debt) at the time and very little money, but I knew I was about to have a pretty good job since I had just commissioned as an officer. I decided to go with one of those ""bad credit okay"" loans with a 7 year payment schedule. I started paying more attention to my finances last year and decided to finally get serious about paying down my debts this year. 

I had already done the SCRA letter to them since I technically bought the car before going active duty and they had lowered my interest rate from 14% to 6%. This was still my highest interest chunk of debt, though. So, I was throwing $1000/month at the loan for the last 3 months. I finally started seeing real headway with the amount owed dropping substantially month after month.

Today, I got a letter from my car loan servicer (Santander Consumer USA) stating that because of my SCRA benefits, they had dropped my interest rate to 0%. They also said a refund check of $10.65 will be mailed to me for the difference in interest between what I've already paid over the period since they made the reduction.

Anyway, I have two questions:

- Is anyone else in the same boat with Santander Consumer USA? Their website still says the policy for SCRA is 6% so I'm wondering if they made a mistake. At the same time, I don't want to call and lose this great interest rate if they did make a mistake...

- This changes which of my debts are highest interest rate. This technically means my mortgage ($139,000 $675/month plus escro) is my highest interest rate debt at 3.75% followed by student loans at 2.3% (but I'm planning on PSLF for those and minimum payments with IBR are under $100/month) and a credit card with $1900 balance with 0% interest, no payments for another 15 months. Should I continue trying to pay off the car so that I don't owe much when I need another car? Or should I switch my focus to one of the other debts?

I plan to continue paying the $1000/month regardless of if I could technically possibly be making better returns in the market, but I can't decide which I should be paying it towards. I just want to make the best decision with my money. Does anyone have any advice?",finance,1458606395

We have been using the snowball method of paying down the loans, focusing on loan 1, loan 3, then loan 2 last. I understand that this will result in more interest, but we're happier with the idea of the psychological feeling of paying down the loans, and being able to snowball our payment. We also throw an additional $1000 a month minimum at the smallest loan.

My question is this. My husband DESPERATELY needs a new car. We live in a city where driving is mandatory, and his car is 10 years old, transmission is rough, suspension is about to go, A/C is gone, and fixing a few other minor things (squeaky breaks, broken door lock, broken electric window) would cost more than the car is worth. He got an estimate, and the car is barely worth $3,000 at this point. Should we buy a new car outright with the money? Or should we pay down Loan 1, use the left over as a down payment, and get a car loan with a better interest rate than Loan 1?

My thinking is paying down the loan and getting a new car loan with a lower interest rate is a better plan... but getting rid of debt to just add more debt feels wrong to me :-/

What should I do?,"As the title says, our HR rep sent all of our tax info in the form of W-2s to a scammer parading as our company president. I don't know why or how, but he didn't question it or call to confirm before sending.

Regardless of how it happened, what can I and other employees do to protect ourselves? I'm miffed that the higher-ups haven't yet notified us directly. Time is of the essence here. The standing IT guy was saying ""They'll just sweep it under the rug."" He's the type where you can't quite tell if he's joking. I hope he was.

I already went ahead and changed my bank passwords and submitted a fraud alert to the credit bureaus. What kind of future am I looking at in terms of preventing future fraud, now that my info is floating around out there? Am I going to have to maintain some kind of fraud alert or monitoring for life?

Edit: My apologies folks! I was trying to go all meta with my title and refer to a similar post in the recent past which featured someone's HR falling for the same scheme. This is the first time that my HR rep has released info like this--that we know of.

**One more edit:** My supervisor just showed me this [IRS web page.](https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Alerts-Payroll-and-HR-Professionals-to-Phishing-Scheme-Involving-W2s) The third quoted scam email was in the email to our HR rep, word for word: 

""I want you to...Kindly prepare... to me asap.""

It's definitely not how the president writes his emails... Pretty spooky.

**Aaand another edit:** It's 2pm CT. No official word yet from the company higher-ups. As someone commented below, it's understandable that they have to get their ducks in a row (I think I said ""ducks in order"" before...I'm bad with colloquialisms) before approaching all of us. At the same time, it's bothering the hell out of me that we're still in the dark. I'm credit freezing as we speak. Will update when I hear something!

**And another:** Just wanted to follow up now that the work day is over. No word officially. I was called down to my manager's office for what I was hoping to be a discussion on the events detailed here, but it turned out to be a meeting to discuss a potential client that has historically been known by others to be difficult, unclear, and not really worth my time. Basically, they sat down with me to warn me about a future job that wouldn't be a good fit. Even though in the back of my mind, I was like, ""What are you people going to do about this breach that no one's mentioned yet?!,"" when it comes to my actual job and its duties, they were looking out for me.

Now, I don't want this to sound like some sappy story in order to back up the fact that my company is a good company to work for, but I do believe that. So I won't be suing anyone but will be doing my best to protect myself with the tips in comments below.

We set a date and started planning so I thought it would be a good idea to address our finances and debt. 

I make more than him. He has a lower paying job. I have a child from a previous marriage, with full custody and I claim her on my taxes. My ex lives in another country.  I love him, we get along, all the components are there for a healthy marriage except for a few things. 

He hasn't filed taxes in two years because he owes an offset due to student loan default. The student loan debt isn't huge but I imagine it is intimidating at his pay rate.  He doesn't yet have his wage garnished and it doesn't look like he attempt to pay any of it back yet.  Three years ago the IRS began to take an offset for the debt (Fed loan) so he just stopped filing. 

I am worried about my taxes, my exemptions and having to pay for this debt for him. 

We don't live in a community property state, I know I can try to claim the injured spouse exemption but does that always work? The debt was obtained well before I met him. 

I'm always worried about him having avoided filing for two years. We can't file separately obviously because I can't take certain exemptions if we do. 

Is there a way to protect myself here, tax-wise?

It could take years of offsets to pay this off after interest and penalties. What should I  do here?

I know the obvious answer is don't marry until he pays off that debt. That would be the smart answer but let's say I am dumb and I marry him, is there a way to protect myself from this debt?

I'm got married 1 year ago, and starting about a year before the wedding, my wife and I began digging ourselves out of the debt we accrued when we were both younger. We managed to eliminate our credit card debit entirely but still have 1 car loan for $13,000 and we're going to have to start paying her student loans come June. 

We used out wedding gifts to kickstart a savings account for a home down payment and I've been kicking what I can into that savings account while working to get rid of our credit cards for the last year. We've saved up a nice chunk of change, but here on Long Island, house prices are crazy and I'm planning to save a lot more before pulling the trigger on our first home. 

Now I have a small business and leave a nice chunk of funds in the business to account for any tax responsibilities I might have each year. This year, I guess I planned well and ended up not needing to pay any additional tax so I was able to move the money I was saving into my personal account after filing. 

So now I have enough money in my checking account to cover the remainder of the car loan, but I'm second guessing myself. I can't figure out if it makes sense to just put the money into the car and be done with it, so I can use what I would previously pay towards the car to help build the down payment fund a little faster. Or if I should continue making monthly payments on my car and instead just dump the $13K into our down payment savings account.

The minimum payment is only going to be like ~$50 and I'm not a big spender to begin with, so I could theoretically pay it off in a matter of months. I'm not sure what the benefit of paying it off so early would be though if I have 10 years to pay it off and at 3.4% APR, I'm looking at basically ~$1k in interest over the 10 years. The way I look at it, I could put the money I would put forward to paying off my loan early, into a Roth IRA, or hell even buy a T-bond with it and probably come out ahead. And I get the added benefit of a 10 year loan on my credit without a missed payment (I actually have enough cash in other investments that if SHTF, I could pay the whole thing off in one fell swoop if need be).

personalfinance,Debate: Pay off credit card debt with 401K or slowly pay the debt down,"I'm getting married this year and I found out my fianc√© has roughly $20k in credit card debt. She also has enough to pay it off saved in a 401k. Regarding her credit card debt: she says that it's roughly 13% APY over different cards but I think that's a conservative figure. 

The way I run the numbers, it sounds like she's looking at $2600 per year in interest, assuming she keeps the balance the same. On the other hand, her 401k, which she's mainly had through the downturn in the market (since 2006 or 2007), has not made much money. 

My understanding is that you're penalized 10% for early withdrawal (she's in her 30s) and taxed at your regular income rate (hers would be roughly 20% for state and federal income taxes at her income level) for only the amount withdrawn that is earnings.

So, hypothetically, if she pulls $20,000 from her 401k, and $4000 of it is profit, that would have her paying $1200 in taxes and penalties, PLUS the lost future earnings from her 401k.

But I'm looking at it from this perspective: The amount of appreciation that's earned on 401k is risky to begin with. Even if it grows on average 8% per year, the amount the debt is increasing at 13% greatly outweighs that, right? So therefore it would make sense to go ahead and pay it off, right? Then, she could use the money she was paying into interest to put back into her 401k.

One thing I haven't factored into the equation: What about employer matching to contributions? Are the employer matches penalized and/or treated as income? Because that would be one very important factor.

So my story is my bank just got bought out by Great Southern Bank and noticed both my Checking and Savings have a $1 fee for upkeep with the savings having essentially no interest and checking with no interest. Its literally costing me money to keep it in a bank.

I have currently 2.5k in my Checking and 5k in savings. My work is matching my 401k contribution to 6% which is what I pay in to.

After my excessive student loans and other bills I can put away about $300 assuming no other outside circumstances. I also receive a reduced interest rate for having a checking/savings with Great Southern for a Car Loan.

I haven't received the final numbers, so perhaps I won't be able to get a good answer yet as I am still pending final approval.

I am an attorney looking to refinance my loans. Right now my payoff amount is 206k. My salary is 160k, so I can likely manage a 5-year payment plan. Right now my student loans are still on a federal program in forbearance (stupid I know, I just haven't gotten around to taking care of business since I just started graduated/took the bar/started job). I've been saving my salary so I have ~30k saved up, and I have another ~30k in an overseas account that I'm expecting to pull out to put towards my loans. I only have a small car payment (interest rate on that is ~4% I believe), and my rent will be ~1400 since I am splitting the cost with my fiance. That leaves me a lot of room to dump money into these loans.

The interest rate on my federal loans average at about 6.5% (some are in the 5s, others in 7s). One bank has offered to refi my loans, and the variable rate they offer starts between 2.38 and 5.72%. The fixed rate is between 3.75 and 7.1%. The variable rate adjusts every 3 months based on the 91 day LIBOR rate, and the potential max is 9%.

Now, I don't know that much about credit or finance but I think I will probably get a rate closer to the lowest (my credit score is 743). I know the answer to my question depends on what numbers that I get.

If I assume some numbers here, what would be the best long term choice, considering how interest rates have been generally? Let's say that my starting variable rate is 2.5% and I pay the loan off in 5 years. Would that be a better option than a 4% fixed rate?

This Add-To-Anytime CD requires a minimum starting deposit of $500, but I am able to start it with $1,000. I can obviously add to it any time, so I am planning on adding $100 per week to it. The interest rate is 0.3%. The CD has a minimum time of 6 months, with no expiration date. She explained that after the 6 months I find myself in need of that money, I can close the CD, take out what I need, and reopen another one with the remaining money. It just sounds too perfect for what I need, but yet I've never even heard of it.

Is this a smart way to save for my future loss of income?
Is there another similar option that I might not be aware of?

I'll be 35 in a couple of weeks.

I'm currently making around $58k/year. My student loan debt is fairly low (around 5-6k) with a relatively low interest rate, largely because I got out before things got too crazy, and didn't go to grad school. Aside from student loans, my only other source of debt is a car loan, which I only slightly regret. I live in a studio apartment in a city with rent control, in a reasonably safe and/or trendy neighborhood close to public transit. I can't complain about the location or rent, but space is at a premium, and I'm not sure I can afford a market rate apartment in my area.

personalfinance,Gambling winnings taxes - Did my friend get screwed?,"Hey all, quick question about gambling winnings with real figures:

My friend just won $4,310.05 on virtual poker in the state of Iowa. This was at a casino. He said he walked out with $2,800.00, saying the teller ""took the taxes out"".

I have never heard of this before. From everything I've seen, you claim the gross winnings at the casino and then it is your responsibility to report them to the IRS.  If the win was very large I assumed you get a 1099 or W2-G for it.

Did he somehow get screwed? In my head it seems like now he has to report the $4k gross to the IRS and pay state + federal taxes out of that $2.8k he received at the casino.

personalfinance,"Time to grow up, need to get financially responsible! (First real job, clearing debt, and planning for 1st mortgage)","Hey Reddit personal finance,
Long time lurker first time poster here!
I am at a point in my life that I am finally settling down and trying to put my irresponsibility behind me.  I have made some pretty terrible financial based decisions in the past (terrible use of CC, auto loans I couldn't afford, ect.).  My questions are basically based around what next steps should I take in my life as to be financially stable/responsible, clear my debt, and start planning on buying a home. Here's a little break down of my life position and financial situation:
I am 26 years old and up until about 2 years ago I was making roughly 26k-28k a year.   And in that time I was a  stupid kid; as soon as I thought I had some money like an idiot I bought a car I couldn't afford, opened a credit card and over spent on it.  At the time I pretty easily still was able to break even every month and build a decent credit score even with my stupidity (I lived with 4 friends in a rent house so I had almost no other expenses).  I did always make my payment and always pay all my bill on time if not early.
Fast forward to around 2 years ago I quickly started to pull my life together, got much more responsible with my money; clearing my debt, saving, ect.  At my job I was promoted and went from making 26k-28k to making 44k and my quality of life and my responsibility sky rocketed, I met the girl of my dreams married her 6 months ago, ect.  So now I am wanting to give my wife the best life possible.  I recently changed jobs and that boosted my income to 69k and my wife also makes 36k.  I over the past couple years have cleared most of my debt but, when my wife and I got married we consolidate her debt and mine to try and stop her CC interest rates from killing us.  I never went to university or trade schools so I have no student debt but, my wife does still have a small amount of debt from her time in school.

So all of this to ask these questions:
What is more of a priority: clearing out all of our debt or saving for a home now?
Should I sell my car (I'm still underwater on it) to kill that car payment?
When we are looking to buy, what price range would you recommend for our income? 
What % down should we put? Do we save the whole 20% fown or just do 5% to get out of renting?
What debt should we focus on clearing first?

Also here is a break down of our expense and our income:
Income:  $105,000/YR combined income (5k/mo take homeish)
Rent- $950
Cars- $300 (Wife- total owed $6300) and $400 (Mine- total owed $14,000)
Car insurance- $300 (roughly $150 each)
Health insurance-$340
Cell phones, Internet, and utilities- $300
Food budget- $600
Wife's student loans- $100  (She still owes 12k total)
Play money- $400
Out standing debt (excluding car loans)-16000 (We consolidated all but one of her cards and have $12500ish on a personal loan at 3.49% APR. The rest is on a card we pay all of our money into each month but, also use for all our spending (rent included).
We also put $200 each month into an emergency fund for an emergency fund (We have only about 2k put away).
And I just started a 401k through my job (I do 5% matched and 3% extra) and my wife has a IRA that she started about 5 years ago (She does 3% matched and 2% extra)

Sorry if this is a stupid post or confusing to anyone.  Just hoping to pull my life together as best as possible and become responsible!  If I can do anything to clarify my post or give any further information please let me know!
Thank you all so much for your time and advice!

TL;DR:
I was a stupid person, clearing debt, trying to get more responsible and give my wife a better life.
What is more of a priority: clearing out all of our debt or saving for a home now?
Should I sell my car (I'm still underwater on it) to kill that car payment? $400/mo 14,00 total owed.
When we are looking to buy a home, what price range would you recommend for our income? (105k/yr income)

So over six years, the amount of time that they said it would affect my record, that will cost me 28,000. So why would anyone ever just not pay outright for the expense of the damages of the vehicle? That's like a 50% annual interest rate on a 3000 dollar loan, which you **cannot** pay off early. In many scenarios it would be better to buy the person a brand new car than it would be for your insurance to fix even a minor collision.

I could have put that on a credit card and taken a couple years to pay and still have paid less than what the insurance companies are offering.

Hell, I could have found a loan shark to offer me a better deal.

I was not aware until recently, but apparently after owing taxes last year she took out a Lending Club loan at 13% to pay it off and to help with the credit cards, I'm not sure where it all went but obviously she is working on paying it down.

I may be able to get her signed up for retirement payments from an old job for an additional $700 or so a month. 

I'm honestly not sure what the best option would be here because all of her credit cards are high interest rate (one, from Bank of America, is **29.99%**) and she obviously hasn't paid many off since I was a kid and saw her using her cards everyday. She does use her debit card for groceries and other such things now thankfully, but I will meet with her tomorrow to see where her money goes each month.

In the meantime, does anyone have anything I could look into for her? I know bankruptcy is extreme but she has mentioned it a couple times and I don't know if it (chapter 13 ?) would be a proper answer.

ethereum,The Ethereum DAO Bank,"Hi Everyone , 

I have been really excited about Ethereum , but when I try to make sense of it's place in the real world I just cannot see how any of its DAOs or projects succeed without an effortless bridge from the current system to the block chain. Even if they collected in sovereign currency, the path back to Eth to pay their DAO members has too many hurdles. This barrier needs to be bridged and this post is about how I see this happening. 

Eth to me in its current state is a horrible choice for business. Eth is in a catch 22 situation it is too small a currency to maintain a steady value and because of that it is unable to get to the market cap where it can be stable currency. So how can the block chain business succeed when the currency it depends on has little to not chance of becoming stable? Well we create DAO bank of course. Some of you may be thinking well who is going to back the bank with their ETH? Well the answer is .. no one. Eth will not be the currency of this bank, Eth will remain a currency of those that wish to live within the block chain but it will not be the currency the mainstream uses. 

So what will be the currency this bank issues? None. It does not issue currency it allows you virtualize your real world money and unvirtualize it. The banks will issue tokens that are pegged to the currency of the depository institution(Bank,etc) allows them. For example the total amount of USD deposited in the DAO bank accounts will be equal to the total number of tokens issued. This will mean everyone can cash in and out any time with real world money since the deposit account is 1:1. 

To the average consumer or business it goes like this. They go to the DAO bank site and it tells them what banks in their country have DAO deposit accounts. They register their sovereign depositing account number, bank transit info etc and the Ethereum account they want the tokens sent to. This is put into the ethereum block chain so they can verify it and the DAO bank can use it. This also means when they trade their tokens back for USD it knows where to transfer that money as well. If you are moving the money within the same bank I suspect fees will be waived. Over time banks may even have Token account just like they have checking accounts for example.

How do you get the banks on board? This is one of the best parts , they love deposits! I expect the DAO would be able to leverage this to get better  interest rates,transfer rates and technology integration access to their tech if integration is needed. Not only that, the banks can now start advertising the fact that all their customers can transfer money freely into and out of the Ethereum DAO bank account as a bonus for doing business with them. Over time the banks may even takeover the operation entirely and compete with one another with all sorts of incentives. 

In the end game the Ethereum DAO bank whose members consist of all the enterprises within the Ethereum chain ends up the warden of this bridge. Most if not all Ethereum ventures will depend on the Ethereum DAO banks token exchange being transparent, fluid and efficient. Eth may even one day see its market cap raised to the point it can stand alone as a global currency in the long game.

The current goal though at this time is to give all the currencies of the world seamless access to their respective tokens. By doing so all the businesses and consumers in their markets can really start jumping into all the opportunities Ethereum will it provides. I think this is very possible and if the banks are shown the true vision of what is coming with super liquidity, and the fact that this an evolutionary requirement for survival , they will get on board.

Well that was just a thought on my car ride home I wanted to share. I am interested in others thoughts on this which is why I am posting. I could not find any good discussion on this idea so hey , why not start one.",cryptocurrency,1458692564

personalfinance,tax refund decrease,"Sorry if this is the wrong place for this!

Last year after I filed my taxes, I got a relatively high tax refund for the 2014 tax year (~3k). I did not work the first 3.5 months of 2014. As I'm preparing to file this year, my estimated refund for the 2015 tax year is much less (~1.4k). I did not make any changes to my claimed allowances on my W-4 between 2014 and 2015. I did receive a slight pay raise towards in August 2015 (3%/3k), but it did not bump me up a bracket. Why did my refund go down so much? My guess is it has something to do with me not working those 3.5 months at the beginning of 2014 and the pay raise at the end of 2015. If it was solely due to the pay raise, I wouldn't expect the decrease to be so drastic.

How does the IRS know how much money to withhold from each paycheck? I understand the basics of tax brackets; what I am really looking for is how they know your total projected income for the year in order to determine the deductions. Does your employer provide it? So for example, did they calculate the withholding for all my paychecks in 2014 assuming a salary of X for the whole year, but since I didn't work those 3.5 months and did not receive that income, they withheld too much? Was the refund was returning what was over-withheld by calculating the difference between what they withheld what they should have withheld given that my actual income was Y for 2014?

Finally, two (hopefully) quick questions:

1) Do I have to declare the tax refund I received last year on the tax return I file for 2015 this year? I received both a federal and state refund last year, but I did not get a 1099G form this year, which I think I was supposed to?
2) If my interest in my savings/checking account was ~$1.00 for the whole year, do I still need to declare it?

I am a high school senior, and I will attend the University of Kansas next fall. I have two groups of related questions about student loans. Also, before anyone brings it up, I'm not taking advice solely from Reddit. I will be referring to other resources before I make these decisions. 

These questions are pretty simple really, but I need to lay some stuff out. I recently received my Financial Aid Award Package and I'm trying to decide how much to accept. I also need some general advice.

A rough, high-ball estimate for how much my freshman (and subsequent) year(s) at KU will cost me (personal expenses included) is about $24,000.

I was offered about $12,500 in grants and scholarships

I was then offered another $5,500 in subsidized and unsubsidized loans.

Another $6,500 was offered in parent loans. I can reduce this amount before I accept it. 

Also, a conservative estimate for how much money I will have saved by August is $4,000

I have the goal of paying for as much of my college as I can by myself, so parent loans will not be factored in YET.

Math time!

$24,000

-12,500

-5,500

-4,000

_______
~$2,000


So, after I have taken federal loans, used grants/scholarships, and used my personal money, I will be about $2,000 short.

Here is my first set of questions... After a short statement.

My parents have agreed to take out parent loans if I need them, and it looks like I will. Part of them at least. I understand that my parents will be taking the loans and that the loans are in my parent‚Äôs name, but, for simplicity, I will be speaking as though I am them for the following questions.

My questions:

**Should I accept all $6,500 just in case my calculations are wrong?**

**Can I pay back what I don't need immediately so that it doesn't accrue interest?**

**Are there any unforeseen, negative consequences to taking all $6,500 when I only need $2,000?**

**Is there any general advice you have for someone in my position?**
______

***That*** *is the first and most likely to occur scenario*
____

There is another possibility that changes the math and the loan questions.

I recently received word that I am a finalist for a scholarship that, if I receive, will pay up to $40,000 over four years. This means I won't **need** loans at all. (For covering my expected expenses that is.)

New Math time!

$24,000

-$12,500

-$10,000

-$4,000 
______

($2,500)

You see that in this scenario, I actually have a small surplus (remember that part of it was personal money).

My second set of questions... after another short statement.
 
I won't know if I will receive this scholarship until after the due date for accepting or declining these awards, so this scenario will have no effect on whether or not I accept the aforementioned awards.

**If I end up not needing these loans because of this scholarship, can I pay them back immediately and be charged no interest?**

**Would it be wise or unwise to hold on to the subsidized loan and set it aside (untouched) as an emergency fund in case I need it?**

**If I set it aside for four years and don't need it, can I pay it back after I graduate without it accruing interest?**

**Are there any unforeseen negative consequences to doing this?**

**Any general advice?**

**2 Months Later**   Today I received two alerts from chase fraud department via email to look at my notifications.  The first notification said they had found the walmart.com charges to be correct after their investigation and my account will have the walmart credit removed March 30th. 


**The Calls**I called chase fraud department and the first woman calmly reassured me the walmart charge had been removed and the credit was being removed for that reason. I was relieved and ended the call. I felt uneasy though and checked my statement to verify. The walmart charge from January was still on my statement so I called back to inquire. A different woman from chase put me on hold for 10 minutes and returned to tell me they had received proof from the merchant that the purchase was authorized. I was flabbergasted because I have never created or purchased anything from walmart.com. I asked her what the proof was, and asked her why, after being notified in less than 24 hours of the fraudulent claim I was still being charged. She claimed the items purchased were delivered and signed for on the 19th of January. I pushed for more information on how that was possible, I had not received or signed for anything. She then told me she could not tell me and would have to mail me the proof and it would take 7 to 8 business days. At this point I want to vomit from the stress and tell her this is unacceptable. I tell her I did not make the purchase, I notified them immediately, I've never created a walmart.com account, and I have not received anything. She finally breaks and tells me the address was verified with the merchant and it matched my address. At this point we had been on the phone an hour and I don't know that she was being truthful, she seemed like she wanted me off the phone. I would have escalated but I had to go to work.  Im going to call again tomorrow but it is difficult as I work two jobs. 8am to 430 pm at a hospital and 5pm to 9pm in the evening at bloody walmart.


**Questions/Recourse/Worries**  What recourse do I have? I am far from a financial expert and my worry is they may pull the same thing with the Home Furnishing charge as it still shows on my statement with a credit next to it. I did a google search and found a thread of a guy in a similar situation. The gist seemed to be to reply with my grievance in writing to chase. Im working on drafting a letter tonight and having my girlfriend mail it tomorrow. My worries are the Fair Credit and Billing Act says I must send the letter within 60 days of noticing the bill containing the error. It been just past that. This amount may seem small, but it is a huge amount to me and to have it casually brushed aside by chase feels like a punch in the gut. Im terrified of the thought of being out up to $700 with no recourse. If they continue to refuse to help me what can I do? I want to contact walmart, but I cant find my card with the stolen information. I have no information to give them because I didn't create the cock-sucking account. 

**Update 3/23** I left work early today to call the fraud department. I spoke to Ivey, who was able to tell me the item sent was a refurbished Dell I555 Touch Screen Laptop. She informed me again it was mailed to my home address and signed for 1/18/16. I was in disbelief, but she was consistent with what she told me yesterday. I escalated the call to Timothy. Timothy informed me that when a fraud claim is made, they contact the merchant. The merchant will provide proof the claim is authentic or issue a chargeback. The merchant of RC Willey and Macy's authorized the charge back. Walmart allowed it to go through, waited for it to be sent and picked up, then sent the Fed Ex tracking information as proof to chase. I am waiting for the documents provided by walmart to be sent to me and then I will be filing a police report. Timothy said he believed me, as I have been a Chase account holder for over ten years and have not had a single issue. He conjectured it was possible that someone in the city I live in intentionally mailed it to me and intercepted the package by tracking it through their email address associated with their walmart.com account created in my name. I have to go to work now, but I will be calling walmart.com customer service, however I have virtually no information to give them. I don't expect it to be fruitful, but hopefully the police can get farther with walmart than I  can.",finance,1458702025

personalfinance,[Update] Dealing with a severe medical emergency (infant daughter's near drowning): both short term and long term costs,"Thank you to the very kind people at PF who responded to my initial thread about dealing with immediate and long-term financial consequences of my daughter during her near-drowning incident. I wanted to post an update because when I would google for info, my original reddit thread would often pop up.

So after an immediate family medical tragedy, what can you do to keep your finances in order? I don't have all the answers, but here are a few tips I learned since July 2015 and with the help of suggestions from my original post to PF. Many of these notes occurred in unison.

1) Have a well established emergency fund. Food, hotels, clothes, immediate bills. You don't want to have to scrounge for money at this point. My emergency fund worked well and did what it was supposed to do. It got us through the emergency. You want cash on hand or at least you want to know you can manage the credit card bills coming in.

2) Keep a spreadsheet of the medical bills coming in. There will be a lot from different entities. You have about 3 months before most go to collections. This 3 month period becomes important when searching for additional insurance and/or state/federal funded programs. Track your bills, call the companies responsible. The companies will try to get you to pay immediately. They don't care if you've signed up for XYZ plan. They want money. Know that you have time to pay those bills. Ask them how long until it gets sent to collections. Note this on your spreadsheet. Do not pay until all insurance/state/federal agencies have finalized their claims. One sheet with all the info is better than rummaging through many letters.

The largest bill to hit was [this beast at $288K](http://imgur.com/zfeOUzS) and I'm still working on it. Only $88 to go! I've had many other bills and a handful in the tens of thousands range. Keep track on the invoice date, invoice numbers, patient ID numbers, account numbers, phones numbers, dates of service, service provider, service facility, actual service, when you contact the billings department and notes on discussions. If you can forward this info to a social worker, they will appreciate you so much and it makes their job easier.

3) Search for additional state/federal insurance. The American Healthcare Act was great in that it prohibits insurance companies from having lifetime maximums. The can't kick you now for billing too many/much claims. Even if you have health insurance, seek out state/federal programs for additional coverage. We qualified for a sate plan that costs $1500/yr and we have already billed more than that to it. Well worth the investment. There are other plans out there and grants. Find them.

4) Get a good social worker. This is a point where we're lacking. Fell through the cracks? The social worker assigned to our hospital floor when this all happened left to take another job. That meant we had fill-ins from other hospital floors. They were not invested in our case. Through numerous programs, we're now finding a social worker to be our champion and help find programs to fund our daughter's needs. Once we found a plan and a great social worker, she ended up getting assigned to another department. So goes government work. Keep your notes and keep working.

4.1) Call when you haven't heard something within a week. We had a wheel chair on order and Medicaid said they never received paperwork. The physical therapists had claim numbers. I read them the riot act. It was still held up. The insurance company said they never received paperwork. AGain, physical therapists had fax receipts and claim numbers. I read the insurance company the riot act. You are a number, you need to follow your numbers. Be polite. Be courteous. Sometimes honest mistakes happen. You will know when you're getting the run around.

4.2) Beyond social workers, talk with your nurses, doctors, therapists, etc. They know people. They will want to help. They will know the ""good"" people to connect with. Listen to them. It will make life easier.

5) Let friends help. Our friends and family are our champions. We would have had to struggle to do it on our own. People in your network will know providers - other doctors, therapists, people in financial institutions, people at insurance companies, legal professionals. But I was surprised at the people who came out of the woodwork.

6) For a near-drowning in a pool, file a claim against a party's home owners insurance. This will vary based upon incidence. Through our broadcasting on facebook, we found a lawyer friend of a friend to take our case. He's filing a claim against the homeowners policy. But, through subrogation, my health insurance company is trying to lay claim to that money for my daughter. This lawyer is fighting that - claiming that this money is for our daughter's future and that the health insurance company will already pay much more than the claim over the years of help she'll need. The insurance company has basically refused to respond, so we're gearing up for a case. We don't expect anything, but if there is a claim, it can go to a trust for long term care.

7) Get your will in order. We were lucky that my wife had lawyer services of estate planning included in her company benefits. It was bare bones, get a will in place. But, we were able to establish the groundwork for a medical trust for our daughter with the near-drowning incident. Getting the will in place took a few appointments - establish what we want, get it in writing, sign off on it. It was fairly painless.

8) Establish a trust for our daughter. We're still working on this. Depending on what happens with he claim against the homeowners insurance policy plays out. If we can get a few hundred thousands for her future, we can make trust. But a few thousand? Not worth it at this point.

9) Seek out groups on social media. My wife has been great at finding help groups on facebook. Finding resources for medical equipment, people offered advice on what they've went through, offered advice on what to expect. Having that knowledge will help you in your predicament to make better informed financial decisions ( buy this, don't buy this, this therapy is traditionally covered, this therapy you have to fight for and here's how, etc.).

10) Let your employer know what's going on. My company has been great. MY HR department (at the strong goading of my CEO) has been top notch. They have gone to bat for me against my health insurance company. They have helped me review insurance paperwork. 

I imagine I've forgotten some tips. I hope others chime with theirs. Just note that you are your family member's advocate. What would you want? Get it for them. Make the phone calls. Know that people are human and mistakes happen. Be persistent and get things straightened out.

stocks,$BCM.V Bear Creek Mining - This Silver Bear Is Starting To Wake Up,"Bear Creek Mining - This Silver Bear Is Starting To Wake Up
Mar. 22, 2016 7:42 PM ET

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3960359-bear-creek-mining-silver-bear-starting-wake?page=2

Copy and pasted for those who are not seeking alpha members(you won't get the graphs and charts):

Bear Creek Mining is a strong silver play that features: high-quality assets, 290 million ounces of reserves, $20 million of cash in the bank, and no debt.

Leverage to an advancing silver price is strong; arbitration award for Santa Ana could be ~$200 million.

Shares are up 125% YTD.

With the recent strong performance from gold and gold mining shares, one might want to ponder and ask, ""How is gold's little brother silver doing?""

As of the time of this writing, the spot price of silver is trading at $15.83/oz, up 15% YTD.

So, pretty good... relatively speaking. Silver is starting to climb out of its hole (thanks partially to a dovish Fed), and these strong gains have also translated their way over to silver stocks as well.

One particular exploration company, Bear Creek Mining (OTCPK:BCEKF), has so far flown under most everyone's radar, but if the recent surge in silver is a sign of more things to come in the future, this slumbering bear will be sleeping no more...

Bear Creek Mining

Bear Creek Mining controls two noteworthy silver assets, Corani and Santa Ana, both located in Peru. With 290 million ounces of proven and probable reserves between the two projects, it's safe to say that this company is well endowed with plenty of silver. And in a rising silver price environment, leverage is key to unlocking upside potential, so the more ounces you control, the better; Bear Creek thus holds immense appeal in this regard.

Let's now examine each of the company's core assets.

Corani

The Corani silver-lead-zinc deposit is 100% owned by Bear Creek, and its flagship project. Corani is one of the world's largest, undeveloped primary silver deposits. It features a life-of-mine (LOM) of 18 years, with annual silver production projected to be 13.4 million oz/year (years 1-5), or 8.4 million oz/year (LOM).

Proven and probable mineral reserves include 228 million ounces of silver, 2.8 billion pounds of lead, and 1.8 billion pounds of zinc.

A Feasibility Study was first performed in 2011, with an updated Final Optimized Feasibility Study completed in July 2015, which shows improved economics (a reduction of CapEx by $54 million to $664 million total capital expenditure), mostly due to the switch to dry-stacking of concentrator tailings, along with other optimizations.

The following slide highlights the Key Economic Parameters:



(1) 5% discount rate, after tax, at base case metal prices ($20/oz silver, $0.95/lb lead and $1.00/lb zinc)

(2) 5% discount rate, after tax, at recent metal prices ($15/oz silver, $0.75/lb lead and $0.75/lb zinc)

Source: Bear Creek Mining

At $15/oz silver, the Net Present Value of Corani is only $52 million, with an IRR of only 6.7%. Quite simply, the project just does not work at these low metal prices.

At $20/oz silver, the NPV jumps to $643 million, with a much more attractive IRR of 20.6%.

According to the company:

""Corani NPV increases approximately $120 million for every $1 increase in silver price (with proportional increases in lead and zinc prices).""

At the time of writing, the spot price of lead was $0.83/lb, and the spot price of zinc was also $0.83/lb. Like silver, the base metals have also been showing signs of a moderate recovery over the last few weeks.

Although, clearly, there needs to be a far more brisk rebound in overall metal prices before Corani can become economically viable. With that said, the company currently has no plans to optimize Corani any further; there will not be another Feasibility Study performed.

From the latest corporate presentation, the project is more or less ""shovel ready"", pending final permits.

Santa Ana

Bear Creek's secondary project, Santa Ana, is the most interesting one. Compared to Corani, Santa Ana is much smaller in scale (CapEx of just $70.8 million), but also more economical at today's low silver price environment, with average cash costs of $8.72/oz.

The Santa Ana project features a LOM of 11 years, with annual silver production projected to be 5.0 million oz/year (years 1-6), or 4.3 million oz/year (LOM).

Proven and probable mineral reserves include 63.2 million ounces of silver.

The following slide shows the highlights from the 2010 Feasibility Study:


Source: Bear Creek Mining Corporate Presentation

Although the economics for Santa Ana appear to work at this time, the problem with getting the mine into construction/production over the last few years actually has nothing to do with dollar figures at all; there's more to the story than just that.

The Santa Ana deposit is unique in the sense that it is located within a 50 km border zone in Peru that requires a foreign entity to obtain a Supreme Decree N¬∞ 032-2011-EM for operations.

In May of 2011:

""The Peruvian government agreed to put an end to a private mining project in Puno, following the deaths of five protesters in clashes with police on Friday.

The decision followed more than 10 hours of talks between government ministers and indigenous Aymara leaders as the two sides tried to put an end to an indefinite strike that has gripped Puno for a month. The protests are against mining and drilling concessions in the region.

On Saturday, a repeal of a 2007 decree that gave permission for the silver mine in Puno was officially repealed.

As a result, operations at the Santa Ana mine, owned by the Canadian Bear Creek Mining Corporation, were canceled. Also, the deal gives local indigenous communities the power to approve or deny any mining or drilling operations in the area. 'If the communities don't want mining, it can't be forced,' said Fernando Gala, vice minister of mines.""

This began a very lengthy battle, as the company worked to regain its lost operating permits at Santa Ana. In August 2014, a formal notice of Arbitration Action was initiated by the company, which is expected to drag on for the duration of 2016 and into 2017.


Source: Bear Creek Mining Corporate Presentation

Peruvian courts have already ruled in Bear Creek's favor on key issues.
Arbitration process concludes in 2016; ruling and damages award judgment anticipated within the second half of 2017.
Arbitration does not preclude Bear Creek and the Peruvian government from pursuing a settlement of the dispute.
In a most recent presentation in September 2015, Bear Creek Mining CEO Andrew Swarthout expressed confidence that the company would be able to obtain an award settlement with the Peruvian government to end the Santa Ana dispute. Requested damages are $525 million, which represent the value of the Santa Ana asset in 2011 at the time of the incident. According to Mr. Swarthout, the company would expect an arbitration award to fall in between 40% and 60% of the requested damages numbers, based off of previous award history data for mining assets. This would provide the company at a minimum of ~$200 million, which would presumably be used to help partially fund the construction of Corani.

Jurisdiction Risks

Although Bear Creek Mining has faced its share of issues and challenges with the Santa Ana project, as a whole, the country of Peru is generally regarded as a safe, hospitable region for mining. Granted, Peru will never be confused with first world jurisdictions such as Ontario or Quebec, but it does rank in the upper quartile globally. 


Source: Behre Dolbear 2015 Ranking of Countries for Mining Investment

Among many mineral deposits, Peru is home to the following: Antamina's (strategic partnership between BHP Billiton (NYSE:BBL) - 33.75%; Glencore (OTCPK:GLNCY) - 33.75%; Teck Resources (NYSE:TCK) - 22.5%; and Mitsubishi Corporation (OTCPK:MSBHY) - 10%) massive copper and zinc mine, Freeport-McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) Cerro Verde copper and molybdenum mine, Hudbay's (NYSE:HBM) Constancia copper mine, and Southern Copper's (NYSE:SCCO) Toquepala copper mine, etc.

Peru is currently the sixth largest gold producing country in the world; it ranks third for both copper and zinc.

Balance Sheet Position

In a recent corporate presentation from September 2015, the company highlighted the following as a bullet (selling) point:

""4+ years working capital cash on hand (USD $26.5 M at Q2 2015) and no debt; G&amp;A cost-cutting ongoing to extend longevity.""

From the latest January 27, 2016, press release:

""General and administrative expenses are being lowered as much as possible, staffing levels are being reduced to core functions only, and the Company is preparing to replace a significant percentage of the cash component of director and management compensation with non-cash alternatives.""

The most recent February 2016 corporate slides now show $20 million of cash and no debt as of Q4 2015.

Upside Potential

The spot price of silver has performed admirably so far this year, up about 15% YTD. However, this does not tell the full story. Silver is often classified as a hybrid metal, part industrial (like copper), and part monetary (like gold). When push comes to shove, the most important question investors will want answered is ""Which direction will silver follow?""

To find out, let's chart the performance of the following holdings from January 04 up to February 11: the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:GLD), the iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SLV), and the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:COPX), along with BCEKF and base metal peers: BHP Billiton, and First Quantum Minerals (FM.TO) (OTCPK:FQVLF).


Here is what we find:

GLD up 17.35%
SLV up 13.33%
COPX down -17.19%
BCEKF up 30.57%
BBL down -17.78%
FM.TO down -43.24%
Since the major indices have all rallied hard these past few weeks, I selected a cut-off date of February 11, earlier this year, when the ""fear trade"" was more intense and base metal commodities were tanking. As can be clearly seen above, in the event of a market sell-off (when the ""fear trade"" is running rampant), silver and silver stocks will follow more the path of gold and perform like a monetary metal as opposed to that of an industrial metal like copper.

YTD, the performance of various silver stocks has been staggering: BCEKF, First Majestic Silver (NYSE:AG), Pan American Silver (NASDAQ:PAAS), Endeavour Silver (NYSE:EXK), and Alexco Resource (NYSEMKT:AXU).



BCEKF up 125%
AG up 105%
PAAS up 65%
EXK up 85%
AXU up 153%
They say that mining stocks lead the way of the physical metals when coming out of a bear market; if this is indeed the case, these silver stocks could be foreshadowing a more explosive move to the upside for the spot price of silver in the near future.

Downside Risks

As mentioned earlier, the company's core asset Corani is not currently economical at today's low metal prices. If this mini-rally in both silver and base metals starts to fade, shares of BCEKF could be under pressure again, potentially giving up some significant gains, which is what happened when the stock fell from $0.70/share to $0.34/share from October 14, 2015, to January 19, 2016.

Further, although the Santa Ana asset is currently in arbitration and the company feels confident that either the courts will rule in its favor or that a fair and just settlement with the Peruvian government can be reached in advance, there are no guarantees of either outcome.

With no other prospective exploration projects currently under development, and very limited capital available for funding (without further share dilution), the company's near-term success hinges heavily on events that are very much outside its own control.

These are some risks investors will need to carefully consider as they form their own investment thesis.

The Right Timing

At first glance, BCEKF may look like your typical start-up exploration stock, but Bear Creek Mining has actually been around for over a decade; this company (and its projects) is quite mature at this stage of the game. As such, shares have experienced their fair share of volatility - rising from infancy to a pre-subprime apex, to hitting rock bottom like every other stock post-Lehman in 2008, to surging back to another peak, riding the commodities bull into 2011, to finally dropping off a cliff again and hitting a nadir of $0.34/share earlier this past January.

What a rollercoaster ride, indeed...

Luckily, for any prospective shareholder who is just getting interested in the Bear Creek story today, shares are currently far closer to the bottom than any conceivable top (if we use history as a guide); this is most evident by not only revisiting the company's share price history, but also by looking into past press releases and observing the fact that the last financing deal was closed in 2010, when the company issued 17,650,000 common shares (the ""Common Shares"") at a price of $6.40 per common share for gross proceeds of $112,960,000.

Shares of BCEKF are currently trading for $0.949/share. While the stock has already doubled so far this year, with a current market capitalization of only $84 million and an enterprise value of $57 million, there is clearly still plenty of room to the upside for this stock with a rising silver price.

A benefit for anyone buying ""late"" into this story is that you'll be able to do so for ""pennies on the dollar."" Capital structure is tight, with only 93.1 million shares issued and outstanding and 101 million shares fully diluted. As mentioned above, the last financing in 2010 alone raised more capital than the entire company is worth today.

Past performance is not indicative of future success, but not too long ago, BCEKF was trading at over $11/share in 2011. Interestingly enough, it is worth noting that exploration/development-stage companies like Bear Creek Mining have led the way in 2016 and outperformed the mid-tier silver producers thus far YTD.

Doing Next to Nothing

Bear Creek Mining is a company that is flying under most everyone's radar right now. With metal prices having been caught in a perpetual slump since 2011, the company has more or less gone into full-blown ""hibernation mode."" For instance, in the case of Corani, now that the resource has been refined by the way of the latest July 2015 Final Optimized Feasibility Study, no further work is currently pending (outside of obtaining final permits); the ounces in the ground aren't going anywhere, so it makes sense as to why the company has decided to continue doing exactly what it has been doing over the last six months... as little as possible.

In a brutal downmarket, doing ""next to nothing"" is probably the right thing to do; it makes little sense to dilute your shareholders by attempting to raise more funds at a time when the markets won't be rewarding you for any additional work you undertake on your projects. But unlike a producer that has to service debt and pay for mine operating costs constantly, an exploration company like Bear Creek (with an advanced-stage deposit defined but not in construction) has the ""luxury"" of being able to essentially close up shop until better days return.

Conclusion

Although it would be easy to do so, investors should not lose track of the Bear Creek Mining story. Now that the spot price of silver is starting to move in the positive direction again, silver stocks have started to follow, and BCEKF is no exception.

With a market cap of only $81 million, decent cash in the bank, no debt, 228 million ounces of silver reserves held at Corani, a potential ~$200 million award awaiting Santa Ana, etc., Bear Creek Mining provides tremendous leverage to the upside for anyone hoping to capitalize on an advancing silver price.

Yes, it is true that this bear has been in a deep slumber these past few years, but that time may be fast approaching an end; Bear Creek Mining is just starting to wake up again, and thus shares of BCEKF may be ready to roar.

Is it reasonable to ask if there's any chance of increasing the salary at this point and, if so, how would I go about bringing it up gracefully? Is it normal to not be informed of other benefits?

I've been living in mom's basement ever since I left school. This helps me save on living costs but more importantly to help mom run her business in a (for the most part) non-paying role.  

When I was in school, my head was all over the place from: party mode to depression mode to survival mode and finally redemption mode. Thank my lucky stars I went to an in-state public university (SUNY), my immaturity would have wrecked me financially had I gone to a private school with higher tuition costs. I laugh at the 17yr old me that wanted to attend college on the opposite side of the country in California where I felt adventure lie and my parents did not; thank you USC for that rejection letter.    

All in all I received $30,000 in **subsidized**(this will be important later) federal loans (with a present average interest rate of 6.5%) and a lot of grant money (I will never forget this Uncle Sam!). 

Upon my fathers request, I also took out a $10,000 private bank loan that I handed entirely over to him to help him out of a situation. **Don't** do this guys. Or if you do, count on paying that money back yourself. If they pay you back, great. If not, you weren't expecting that money back in the first place so count it as a blessing.   

Looking back, its kind of alarming at the ease a 19yr old had getting that loan at a major bank. To my surprise, the private loan started accruing interest off a principal of $10,400 although the loan was for an even $10k. The bank charged me $400 to do business with them and threw that on top of my original loan amount. Add in an interest rate that is now close to 7% and you got yourself a main source of worry in adulthood.
    
At present, that $10,000 has grown to $13,000 after running out my in-school deferment and only making the minimum monthly payments of $110 for the past 2 years now.   

My total student loan debt is approx $40,000. My Credit Card debt is approx $10,000 spread amongst 6 cards (2 of those maxxed out cards recently came out of intro rates of 0% to more or less staggering rates like 24.15% making my monthly interest payments between $50-$60 respectively). The moral of this credit card debt is that, repeating the same assumption that you will be in a ""better"" place 10 months from the day of applying for a card with a 0% apr for 10-14 months, is the definition of insanity. Regardless of your benign intentions for the allotted credit. You're better off viewing that 0% promo interest rate as a loan from a shark, or someone who is notorious for bending people over. Take the loan if you must but understand you just did business with the mob. In other words, this isn't a game, and definitely don't let that balance rise above that 30% ratio of debt to total granted credit.       

It's only recently after coming to ends with many demons, inspiration from this community, talks with friends &amp; loved ones, and a couple of financial self help audio books that I decided to take control of my financial fingerprint and pace myself intelligently in this marathon towards financial freedom. I now more than ever see the day when I can breathe easily and declare myself no longer buried in debt. What a load off my mind that will be. 

To give you the rundown of the payoff strategy, it is key that you are working part time and most of your student loans be federal subsidized ones. This matters because only subsidized loans qualify for 0% interest accrual unemployment deferment (in ny this runs for a total of 30 odd months in 6 month cycles where you have to reapply for the deferment). The other factors that enable me to qualify for such a program is the fact that my cost of living is low and because in-deed I only have a part time job less than 30hrs/wk; besides helping mom out (pretty much for room and board).

The gist of the plan is to put a pause on a majority of your source of debt while consciously hammering away at the most damaging accounts. Under this unemployment deferment, it is key to use this precious time to use the snowball method (Keep in mind that your overall payment amount never changes even though your individual debt on cards nears levels you're satisfied with). That money that was going towards the minimum on 6 or 7 student loans is now going towards big chunks of that one maxxed out credit card with an insane high rate. Keep in mind you're still paying the minimum on all the other credit cards. You do this until the card is at or below the 30% debt to credit ratio then move on to the next one with either the higher interest rate or the lowest balance. For me it was the latter, the more I saw small goals be achieved the happier I was, knowing everything was adding up.

It is key to hustle your ass off and find as many sources of side income you can get. The main ones for me are: using the family car to give taxi rides and airport rides to friends and relatives, and have them tell their friends about me. Babysitting, again the bigger you make your network the more opportunities. Being allowed by mom to make profit off unused real estate in the backyard and rent out parking spaces (mostly for people looking for long term car storage). I live in one of the boroughs of NYC, plenty of people are willing to pay top dollar for safe/reliable parking. Lastly I moved upstairs and rented my room out for $720 monthly. 

Moving on, after you're content with the balances on all the credit cards its time to move on to the Student Loans and repeat the process, hopefully you still have plenty of months out of the initial 30 the loans could be in deferment. 

I haven't got to this part yet but it looks like my plan is working so far. My credit card debt to credit ratio amongst all but 3 cards is 30% utilization. I'm pretty happy with the results so far. I have it projected that at the rate I'm going, two years is enough time for me to completely pay off $50,000 if I stay concentrated on hammering away like a mad wood chuck. 

I have to end by saying that this isn't a fool-proof method, and something like an emergency can really mess my plan up. The biggest biggest support for me has been family. I can't stress enough the importance of a beyond-supportive family structure. I cant count my blessings enough. I am aware not everyone has a mom whose behind seemingly ""every"" idea her 28yr old son has. 

I'm open to all criticism, I wanted to share my story and hopefully plant some positive seeds. Thanks for listening.",finance,1458731897

devops,Common patterns for public key sharing in microservices? (I'm verifying JSON Web Tokens),"Hi,

I've built an API that uses [JSON Web Tokens](http://www.jwt.io) for authentication across a federation of servers.

One of my servers needs to validate the signature of a JWT it has been given. My idea:

1. add an `api/public_key` endpoint on the issuing server.
2. If I need to validate a JWT that came from another server, I will just grab the `/public_key` from the issuing server (caching it along the way) and use that for validation purposes.

My question is:

1. Am I reinventing the wheel? Have protocols for this use case already been created?
2. Is this secure? The only problem I can see is if my server SSL certs are compromised or somebody tricks a client into downloading a public key from a different URL.

Some side notes:

1. I'm aware that I could just install the public key in version control and deploy the client server with a keyring, but I am trying to reduce the number of deployment steps where possible. I haven't ridden this option off completly, but I would like to explore other options if possible.",technology,1458745583
Bitcoin,How to make a boatload of money! BitcoinPay: a sidechain solution,"How to make a boatload of money! BitcoinPay: a sidechain solution

Bitcoin's blockchain is almost full. An option to scale the protocol are side-chains.

Some side-chains already exist (like elements alpha) and others are in developement (like Liquid or Rootstock) but none of them is ready today, nor they focus on money transfers and transactions.

Despite the hype on programmable money the truth is that most people use Bitcoin as simple money and still lack the necessary culture and user cases for smart contracts.
Therefore simple transactions are the most requested service as well as the main source of value for the Bitcoin protocol.

For this very reason, a side-chain that focuses on payments and transactions, dropping the other features, will meet market demand and ensure substantial profits.

The name should be something nice and cool. My suggestion is BitcoinPay (in the style of apple pay) but you can pick anithing that works.

This specific side-chain should have these features:

- Include necessary code only and drop all complex OP_CODE and things related to smart contracts. (at least for the very beginning) This will speed up developement.

- Include a link to Bitcoin's main chain with a 2 way peg (or with a federation untill core 0.12.1 is activated)

- Have segregated witness (already implemented on the elements alpha side-chain)

- Generate blocks every 15 seconds with a max blocksize of 2 Mb (to scale up to 80 times the Bitcoin's protocol)

- Use thinblocks technology to reduce critical bandwidth usage during block's transmission (the code is already available on Bitcoin Unlimited)

- Have both Schnorr and ring signatures (implemented respectively on elements alpha and Monero)

- Have zeroknowledge proofs to enhance privacy (like Zerocash and elements alpha)
 
- Use the sha256 algorithm and merge mining with the Bitcoin's blockchain. (To ensure security on the side-chain)

- To solve the Blockchain's size problem checkpoints must be used. on BitcoinPay the chain will be cut beyond 6 months and replaced with a genesis block with all the older UTXO. In this way the chain will not grow over 2 terabytes even at full capacity. It's no longer necessary to keep all the blockchain from block 1 because security is guaranteed by merge mining.

The remuneration from transaction fees must be split into 3 parts:

20% to remunerate investors, pay developers and promote sidechain.
30% to Bitcoin's main-chain miners for merge mining
50% to BitcoinPay's miners

With these specifications the project is simple and profitable. The technology is there, the code is already written and you just need to combine all the features to release the side-chain.

The project should also schedule a hardfork at least once a year using Ethereum's mechanism. Mining gets exponentially difficult when you do not update the version. In this way it is possible to easily introduce improvements.

This project can greatly enhance Bitcoin's use for businesses and transactions, dramatically increasing its value.

This idea also has few expenses, a low difficulty and potentially huge gains for programmers who will realize it.

personalfinance,[Resubmitted] I need help deciding if what my preferences are for a new (used) car are realistic.,"Hi PF! This is sort of a read but I really need your guys's help in deciding whether it's a good idea to buy a used car in the next couple months and whether what I prefer is realistic. As many people have made clear, I really need help in this department and would really appreciate some advice.

My current car is a 2006 Buick Lucerne CX with 156,000 miles on it. I got it used from my grandma almost 2 years ago and it had a lot of previous problems. Last December I spent a little over 2K trying to fix my brakes, coolant leak and a temperature gauge. But only three and a half months later the engine light has come back on with the same issue and the coolant leak is back. Besides the leak the car now is in pretty good condition considering the year and mileage.

What I want: I want to trade in my previous car (between $1,000-$2,000 trade in according to kbb) and I would really like to buy a used Toyota Highlander between 2009-2012. I like a lot of things about it and I really want to get back to a larger sized car since my husband and I are currently trying to get pregnant (unrelated to 8 seats, see below)

What I want car wise: To be fair, I'm still open to other cars. If you have anything better to recommend, please share! But there's a few things that I'm looking for in a car even if I don't choose the Highlander. That includes: ""good"" gas mileage hopefully between 20 to 30 mpg depending on city and highway driving, a rear view camera, 8 seats( now don't think I'm crazy, I'm fully aware that I don't have children. I PREFER 8 seats as I work as a caregiver as well as a part-time Aid for those with special needs. I need to have a car big enough to fit several of the kids as I take them around the city to integrate them into the community. So it will be work-related as well. The driving and having the kids in the car is part of the job. I would just prefer to have them have more space because some of them have physical disabilities and need to carry medical equipment like walkers, canes or wheelchairs.) Though this is not required, I would like a mid sized car( I used to drive a GMC Yukon Denali and loved the size, space,  almost everything) so around a Ford Escape size, under 40,000 miles and leather interior (preferably).

My Finances: I make around 2K a month after taxes. While my husband makes 3K as well as a commission per month between 1K to 3K. I have no debt but I pretty much have no credit. My husband has some old debt from a few years ago, although it's not much it definitely made his credit pretty bad. So his credit is probably not a good option to use. My credit history is newer (it says my history isn't long enough for a score), but I've had a credit card for almost a year now as well as a payment on a bed we recently purchased. We currently pay $900 a month for rent, (and with all bills and food included, we spend around 2,000 give or take per month.) We are able to save about two to three thousand dollars a month. By the end of next month we should have almost $6,000 in savings after bills. (We paid some of his debt recently)

My questions: with our combined income of almost $80,000 a year, what can we afford? For example, is it best to put down $7,000 for a 2009 which costs $23000 sticker price or should I put down less? My main concern is how much I will be paying not only out the door but monthly as well. Of course the interest rate scares me and I'm not sure what I can do in the next month or two to increase my credit. Ideas on how to do so would be greatly appreciated.. Preferably I'd like to pay $250 per month if that's even possible.

As I'm sure everyone wants, I want the most bang for my buck so it doesn't matter to me if it's a 2009 as long as it has under 40,000 miles. Even less mileage is better of course. But I don't want to set myself up with a super high interest rate and a monthly payment I can't afford. So do you have any suggestions on how to go about this? I've already looked at post history and side bar but still have these questions.

personalfinance,"Tackling credit card debt: Credit too low for a debt consolidation loan, not struggling enough to qualify for hardship programs. I think I'm out of options, but just verifying.","Greetings reddit PF!

I'm your usual idiot that ran up $25K in credit card debt on top of $55K in student loans. I've got my life back in order and am working full-time, and moved back home to avoid paying rent and utilities. My car is paid off, so my only major expenses are:

* Food
* Car insurance
* Medical bills

Unfortunately, my credit score has taken a huge hit because of  collections, and maxing out the cards. I am in the process of disputing a lot of these collections -- they are medical collections that ended up being approved by the hospital's charity care program (I made so little last year that I actually did qualify. The remaining bills are stuff not covered by charity, like radiologists and the ER doctor.) Therefore, I don't see myself qualifying for a debt consolidation loan. The only offer I've got is a secured loan that would involve me giving my car title to the bank. That idea makes me *really* uncomfortable, and my car is a 2007 -- yes, it's paid off, but it's not worth that much in the first place!

When I called my credit card companies about hardship programs, most just said ""No, sorry."" One company did talk to me for a while, but concluded that I did not struggle enough for any sort of program from them. I'm able to make my payments; I just want a lower interest rate.

So for now, my plan is to pay off all the accounts in collection (currently, it's not more than $1500, and some of them are claiming they aren't reporting it to the credit agencies anyway), get my utilization ratios back to something sane, and check my score later to see if I may end up qualifying for a consolidation loan. I'm just looking to see if this sounds like an appropriate course of action.

EDIT NOTES:

* I was unemployed most of last year, and then working part-time after that, which is why I made so little back then as compared to now.

* It's so hard to get an answer on what helps and hurts your credit score, but it looks like I should NOT cancel the cards with high utilization -- instead, it looks like I should work towards lowering the balance to help my ratios. Let me know if I'm wrong.",finance,1458750760

If you do, though, it's simple enough to pay back the loans, earning ""instant interest"" in the increased cash flow which you can then invest in taxable accounts.

What if, instead, you established a self-directed IRA, and created a company within it that refinances student loans?

The company pays off your loans at a refinanced rate.  Then, you (the person) still have the student loan debt, get the tax deduction for paying the interest on the loans, your IRA gets paid back the full amount (as opposed an IRA withdrawal of principal), doesn't change your yearly contribution limits, and allows you to pay in even more because of the interest rate.

Am I crazy?  I know there's some conniving businessman who has thought of this first. I'm wondering maybe there's an IRA rule that says you can't ""loan"" money like this to yourself or your family, but I'm wondering if establishing an LLC can constitute a corporate veil.",finance,1458757036

I'm going to attempt to be as brief as possible. My cousin and I recently bought some lottery tickets for fun, and we each bought 5 tickets/wagers for I believe $10. Now this was all well and good, but on the way home we were discussing the prizes and what we would both do if we won, baring in mind I'm 23 and my cousin is 20. 

&amp;nbsp;

He stated that it would be more intelligent and beneficial to take the top prize at a lump sum and normally I would agree. However here is where the problem lies, you see this lottery is a bit different in the sense that they offer to pay you for the ""rest of you life"" at a minimum of 25 years I believe, but they will pay you for as long as you're alive according to the fine print, unless you take the lump sum. I've read numerous articles and basically everyone agrees that the lump sum is usually the way to go, however this lotteries top prize is only around $5,000,000 or so. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now I'm assuming due to the taxes where I live(45.6% total with state and federal combined) would take a large bite out of your lump sum and leave you with only $3,128,000, or about $120,000 a year in interest earned before taxes, unless the interest isn't taxed? You could live off of the $120,000 for sure depending on your budget, he agreed about this, but when I mentioned that if you didn't take the lump sum you would get $7,000 a week, which is about $364,000(52 weeks) before taxes. This would leave you with $222,040 a year AFTER taxes(0.39% lower bracket than lump sum) which I calculated using the combined federal and state for our location. 

&amp;nbsp;

So it would be $222,040 per year (after taxes) vs $120,000 per year (before taxes, IF the interest is taxed)

*****

My question for you all is if given the choice between $7,000 a week for the rest of your life, OR a lump sum of $5,750,000 which would you choose?

Who won me or my cousin?

Before, I wasn‚Äôt interacting with fundamentals seriously, I was just looking at NFP and CPI numbers and making some poor deductions based on FOMC statements. But then I realized how I ignored this crucial part of trading and then decided to learn more about fundamentals and encountered with some problems throughout the way. I will be grateful if experienced traders/investors enlighten me.

So, let‚Äôs start with the latest FOMC statement. I try to be as straight-forward as I can. Past week FOMC statement was quite dovish compared to market expectations, Yellen explicitly stated her concerns about global financial risks and Fed also downgraded its GDP and PCE projections. Before that Mario dropped a nuke. So it would be fair to say that EUR is bullish and USD is bearish. 

At this point I have these questions:

* Since Fed ignored the strong data coming from US and started to think about global risks, does that mean that fed‚Äôs future monetary policy is strictly tied to factors like Europe and China ?

* Does downgrading or upgrading the projections affect the market ? (I think it does.)

* PCE constantly increased for the last 3 months but CPI decreased last month however Fed considered CPI as increasing gradually. Does Fed ignore the latest decrease ? And by the way specifically which inflation data is important for Fed? Yearly Core, Monthly Core, CPI, PPI, PCE?

* Does the first reaction of market indicate future sentiment and trend ? And if it does, is there any way that I can learn how long the sentiment lasts ?

* What are the roles of forecasts, let‚Äôs assume the previous cpi number is 1.2 and our forecast is 1.5 but the actual number came as 1.3 . How would this affect the market ? It‚Äôs a common phenomenon since forecasts are rarely correct.

* There are couple of GDP, unemployment and inflation data on the table (such as: Jobless claims, ISM manuf.- non manuf. - SA, Unemployment rate, NFP, GDP y/y-q/q-m/m | annualized-price index etc...) which are the ones that central banks take into consideration ?


Moving on... This week we had lots of opportunity to listen the both FOMC and ECB members. While I was expecting a bullish momentum on EUR/USD because of the latest statements etc. but dollar didn‚Äôt give a fuck. 

* Inspite of the fact that Fed lowered its projections and came with a dovish statement Lockhart+Harker+Williams+Evans and Bullard come with hawkish comments. Since Evans and Harker is not even a voting member how their statements made so much bullish effect on USD ? Or the recent sentiment was the consequence of Brexit and Brussels attack ?

* Can we say that Yellen‚Äôs and Mario‚Äôs statements created a macro sentiment but FOMC members triggered an intraday sentiment ?

* How strong are those FOMC members‚Äô comments really ?

* What‚Äôs the deal with the dot plotting stuff ? I know that it‚Äôs a interest rate forecast sheet that the members are plotted as dots. I think it‚Äôs not important but Evans and Bullard mentioned about it.

* Also did Lautenschlaeger explicitly state that ECB could go lower with rates or I get that wrong ?


It's hard to comprehend the reactions of market to such news. I hope they are clear and easy to understand.

personalfinance,28/F still living with parents/ over 100K in loans: Advice needed!,"First off I'm brand new to reddit but have heard great things about those in /r/personalfinance so hopefully someone can help. Sorry for the wall of text!

I'm about to turn 28 next month and I still live with my parents. The reason I'm in the situation can probably be attributed to the following: 

-I have just over $100K in student loans of which all but $8 are private Sallie Mae loans; 
-I've had trouble budgeting my whole life I always overspend on myself and friends/family whether I was in a place to do so or not (I've been depressed for several years and food/booze has been my crutch so a lot of money spent there)
-about $7K in credit card debt;
-I haven't had a well paying job until just this past November.

Other things you may need to know, my parents were supposed to help me pay for my student loans but not long after they kicked in my dad lost his job and eventually ended up on disability; this is important because I was meant to only pay for half the monthly payment which meant more money to allocate elsewhere. To help me in lieu of payments, they gave me their paid off 2005 Lexus es330, which is falling apart and expensive to repair, and I haven't had to pay rent (I love them so much this wasn't meant as a dig). Because the car is in my parents name still, the insurance has been really cheap ($35/month). I'm also on the cell family plan so that's about $90 a month. I mostly eat only what I purchase or pick up. I make $1,798.08 per paycheck, of which I've been saving $500 towards moving (I only have $2K so far). I also pay money towards my credit card and I'm paying towards my loans ($200 for federal and $400 for private) although I've been paying interest only on the private loan as its over $800/month with principal. At the end of each pay period I have less than $100 left.

I'd like to purchase a house close by where I live now (I'm in Mundelein,IL) this year. I wanted to rent but rent around here has increased by $2-300 and I don't see how I could afford that - the new salary provided the $1,000 delta I calculated for rent and then it increased. May also need to explain I had to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy which was final Feb of 2014.

Can anyone see a light at the end of the tunnel?? I feel like I'm never going to be able to pay for everything (including a new car at some point) without scraping by. Help!",finance,1458763703
personalfinance,"Soon to be 31, Married, First Child due May 2nd 2016","Hello, first time poster on this subreddit.  

I have come to a part to where the decisions I make in the near future will most like influence my future finances. I am in need of some finical advice.  

Background:
=======================  
I live in a very poor region of KY, and I drive to WV for work. I do IT Support/HIPPA Compliance for a local FQHC(Federally Qualified Health Center) there. I make 21.42/hour which for around here is very good pay unless you are a lawyer, coal tycoon, or Doctor. I think other it places (the local college, the local hospital) only start off at around 14/hr - 15/hr and most require a bachelors degree which I do not have. Speaking of college, I came out of college with an associates in Computer Science, about 8 - 9 certifications.   

I just had my 4 year work anniversary.   

We own our home(it is a 14 x 50 trailer), it is on my father-in-laws land. We are thinking about building a house on the land after we get some issues with the land straightened out. I talked to a contractor that I know  and he can get it done for around 60,000(3 bedroom, 1 bath), The Father-in-law is more than willing to sign the portion of the land we are at over to our name, and I have a fairly decent credit score of 722 (per credit Karma).   

I also do some side work, such as website development(300 - 1000 per site) I have a few big clients a local christian rock festival, a small town, a few Dr. offices, bed and breakfast, a chamber of commerce, etc... Some sites with monthly maintenance fees (50.00/month) some w/o. I also do computer repair (never more than 100.00 plus parts). My prices are very cheap in my opinion, but I just do it for fun. I don't even advertise my skill set. My side work comes from referrals, and is fairly inconsistent.   

Here is a run down of my Bills per month  
=======================  
* Power Bill - $80 - $200 (Depends on Season/Temps)
* Water Bill - Around 47.00
* Internet - 95.00 (Over priced for 4meg Down / 1 Meg up, and  basic telephone) They have a monopoly. It is either this, no net, or move.)
* Netflix - 8.00
* Cell Phone - 125.00 (2 on this bill mine/wife)
* Truck Payment - 165/month (I owe about 7k on it can't pay off just yet.)
* Student Loans - 100.00 (I owe about 8k on these 2 unsub 1 sub though Navient)
* Food (We really need to cut down on this. it also includes things like dog food, shampoo, etc..) - 400 - 500
* Work Travel/expenses (I drive about 80 miles/day) - $520.00
* Insurance - 125.00 (2 Vehicles full coverage, and 1 house)
* Life insurance - 45.00 (two policies)  

Misc Information  
======================  

* Total Expenses: 1922.00 month
* Total Payday per month: 2178
* Left Over after bills: $256.00
* We have about 7k saved up for emergency as well. 
  
Questions  
=======================  
* The problem lies when the child is born. Health insurance is costly. My monthly Health Insurance for the wife (mine is covered apparently)is currently about 363.00 but will jump up to about 744.00/month.  
  
* The second issue is going to be all the bills from the birth, Dr. Visits etc.. Fun fact with my insurance when they hook my wife up to monitor the baby it is 1500 every time. twice a month.  To be fair after we hit deductible they will pay about 80% of that.
  
* Would it be wise at this time to pursue the building of the house?

personalfinance,"New physician, trying to buy a home","Hi Reddit,

I need some advice and would love to get your guys' input.

I'm a new physician and I'm looking to buy a house, but I literally know nothing about finances.  Zero.  Zilch.  Nada.  I've been trying to study up on the most basic of concepts and wrap my head around them, but I am literally years behind the curve.  My folks paid my way through undergrad and medical school.

Quick financial breakdown for me: I have zero debt (including school, credit cards, etc).  I will be getting married a few months.  I make ~$400k a year now.  I have around 300k in the bank, 50k invested in the market (in an index fund, based on a recommendation from a family member), around 100k in retirement accounts.  I'm maxing out my 401k each month.

Anyway, I know I need help in prioritizing how to invest my money (perhaps that'll be the subject of another thread depending on how his one goes), but onto my immediate question--

I am looking to buy a house, probably ~$1 million.  I don't plan on moving from this area ever.  I don't plan on getting a new job.

What kind of mortgage should I look to get, what company should I get it from, and how much should I put down?  Based on my reading, I'm planning on putting 20% down to get a good interest rate, and perhaps getting a 15 year fixed to pay it off ASAP.  Does this sound reasonable?  And through whom should I get the mortgage?  I did speak with one company that said they would give me a rate of 3.125%.

Any help would be greatly appreciated Reddit.  Finance and money is not my strong suit and any guidance would be great, thanks in advance!",finance,1458765304
personalfinance,Credit Card Questions (newly turned 18yr old looking for advice!),"Hi pf!

Looking to pick up my first credit card. I've been told a lot about them and advice ranges from CREDIT CARDS ARE BAD to HAVE TONS and I know neither are correct.

Been looking into picking up (I bank with chase, I have a debit card and I currently work a part-time on the weekends) an Amazon Visa as it seems to be beneficial for students? This was just my first impression (cash-back on Amazon purchases, points, cash-back on groceries and gas, etc).

Perhaps explaining what exactly a credit card is would help? AFAIK, it's just a short-term loan but my brain can't really fathom how this works out when it comes to managing accounts.

I would also love some kind of eli5 or indepth (or both) on what exactly APR is? I currently have info that a normal starting % is about 20, and that the lower you go the better. I'm assuming it's the interest rate on debt left over post 30 days?

I was also told by a friend that it would be a good choice to find a card that assesses interest but *not* fees for debt that persists beyond thirty days. Is this that important? Is it even a good idea? Unsure.

Thanks, and hopefully you all can help out other youngins like me.",finance,1458765713

personalfinance,Buying a house soon. Should I reduce downpayment savings to pay down student loan debt first?,"We're hoping to buy a house in the next 6 months to a year in the San Francisco Bay Area. House prices in the areas we are looking range from $700K to $1M. My basic question is whether we should use a portion of our downpayment savings (likely about $25,000) to pay down student loans and reduce monthly payments or have a larger downpayment to reduce future monthly mortgage payments. Given my growing family, staying in our one-bedroom apartment much longer is probably not an option. Likewise, because rent for two-bedroom apartments in the Bay Area range from $3200 - $5000 (which is the **median** in SF, where we currently live), moving to a new rental doesn't seem like a good option either. 

Here are the financial bullet points:

* ~$210K gross income, collectively
* ~$218K saved for downpayment and closing costs
* ~$22K invested in non-retirement accounts that we could liquidate for an emergency fund, pay down debt, etc.
* ~$220K in retirement accounts, which I would prefer not to touch
* ~$80K in student loans at fixed interest rates between 2.75 and 3.00% (monthly payments are about $500)
* ~$25K in student loans at variable interest rates, currently between 3.33 and 4.00% (monthly payments are about $1000, including the additional amount we elect to pay on these each month)
* ~$16K auto loan at fixed interest rate of 1.2% (monthly payment is about $400)
* No other debt, but about $2400 in monthly child care expenses for two kids.

Currently we are contributing about 10% of our pre-tax pay to retirement, plus we both pay into government pensions plans with our public employers. In addition to our personal retirement savings, we should receive about 75% of our salaries in retirement if we stay with our employers. 

I'm strongly considering using $25K from the downpayment fund to pay off the variable-rate student loans. I would continue to pay all other debts at the current monthly rates, given their low interest rates.

Thoughts and alternative options are welcome. Thanks!",finance,1458772281

Instead, my fiance and I agreed to take $750 and pay off all of our credit cards, and 2,000 to go directly to paying off one of our cars. This should take about a year of payments off the back end of our loan, and save us some money in interest. 

The remaining $250 will go towards a new grill so we can stop setting the smoke detectors off in our kitchen when we try and cook steaks.

We have 2 credit cards we used for buying furniture, repairing our home, ect... we're young, dumb, and bought stuff we probably shouldn't have. So I'm trying to make it less painful for us in the future.

The APR for the 2nd card is 0% until March 2017 for introductory purchases and for the balance transfer I did of about $2,400. After that its 18.24%

Crossposted to r/studentloans

I am too angry to think straight, but need to get focused, so I thought this would be a good way to do it. Apologies for not having my exact figures in front of me, but I hope the general numbers will do.

F(30). Cross country (USA) move two years ago. Pre-move, slowly took over the majority of my student loans from my parents (mother is primary co-signer on oldest loans). I have 60K in federal, all dealt with, thanks to IBR. I also have a private SM/Navient (17K, ~6.6%, @ $150/mo). Remaining was a Chase private loan from 2007 (29K, not sure about interest, but ~6 or 7% @ 220/month--it was originally 22K).  

&amp;nbsp;

When I moved, it was to get out of an abusive situation. I lived in a friend's spare room and did not have to pay rent, allowing me to function on minimum wage while I got my head/portfolio/general shit together (yes, my friend is an angel). My expenses were ~$400/month in loan payments, phone bill, temp agency fee, public transportation and CC payment (just one, pretty close to its max of $1500 for the last year). It took two years, but now I have FT work (~30K/yr) and am planning on moving to a higher paying gig ($41K/yr) in two months (friend is leaving her gig and recommending me for her position). I was finally starting to save money this year after years of being unable to (year before my move, I made 15K; Year 1 and 2 post-move, I made less than 10K each).  

&amp;nbsp;

Which brings us to today and opening a letter from Chase telling me that the 29K private loan has defaulted. My mother (61) was overseeing it and has been unemployed for 18 months (she previously made 120K/year). She has been fairly delusional about this (we do not speak often). Her reasoning for everything is ""I'll fix it once I get work, you know how it is"". I had been aware that something might be up during last summer when I got a collection notice out of the blue. It showed 3 months' delinquency. I called and told her she had to warn me about this kind of stuff, because I can fix a $200 problem, but not a $600 one (it was during hiatus, which is five weeks when no one in L.A. works because nothing is shooting--everyone plans for this). She was flippant and dismissive and said it would get dealt with. I would have pulled my credit report after this but I had already done so for the year and don't get my next go at a free one until March (coming up, so I will finally see the full extent of what this has wrought). When I was home months later for XMas, I asked my father about it. He said they would deal with it next week. And now here we are.  

&amp;nbsp;

Their financial life has been severely impacted by my mom's unemployment, as my dad makes maybe 1/3 of what my mom makes. I know he tapped into his 401K to cover their mortgage payments at one point, but wouldn't tell me more. I never got a ""Hey, can you cover this?"" or a ""Hey, heads up, your credit is about to be ruined."" I am putting the armchair psychoanalyzing/family stuff away in a box for now because I can fix this my damn self and could have the entire damn time if they had just told me. I would like to focus on throatpunching this out of my life instead of taking this out on my parents though. I am mostly a little heartbroken because I'd hoped to have to not lean on the friend I live with that much anymore since I got FT work, but this throws a wrench into everything. 

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

**The options I got from Chase were:**


1) pay the whole 29K  


2) pay 17K and it'd be done with with a note on my credit report  


3) pay 10% w/ $400/mo until fully paid.  


No matter what the default is on my credit.  

&amp;nbsp;

My parents' reasoning is that since the default will be there anyway, there's no point in me paying them. I think they have lost their minds (I don't expect them to DO anything, they're broke--but that strikes me as terrible advice). I explained that Chase would report it to the IRS as unreported income and then I'd be fucked into a new tax bracket I couldn't afford. My mom says as long as I make less than 50K, that's not that bad. I said that is assuming they do not just sue me (mom and I are both on the loan, I live in CA, she is in NJ--not sure what the statutes are for either in this case). 

&amp;nbsp;

I picked option 3, but I do not have the 10%. I sent Chase the $650 I had saved up. That's it. Now it's just my income.

-Bi-Weekly income is ~900 after taxes.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Current expenses are:** 


-100/mo phone


-150+/mo for SM loan (I always send more)


-40+/mo CC (I always pay more and was going to get the balance back down to 0 w/ my tax refund, which I guess is now not happening?)


-120/mo Bus Pass


-75/wk Food (I split this responsibility with my partner)


-Repairs/House (these are things I could not previously afford to address over the last two years, fixing worn out shoes, broken zippers and the like--I try to space them out)


-~50/mo Lyft (less if partner can give me rides to events, more if stuff has me working later when it's unsafe to take the bus--I don't drive, have a permit, and Lyft works out to be the same as gas/insurance cost-wise anyway) 

(I have health and dental insurance. CA pays for it.)

&amp;nbsp;

I also contribute to the apt while I live here (cleaning, laundry, petsitting, baking favorite cookies, therapist, videogame wingman, etc.). My partner lives close by and we are both writers who prefer to work than go out. We mostly watch TV, work on his grandparents' garden and try to fart on each other. I volunteer a lot for professional things in my spare time (WGA events, Cons, Bernie).

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

**I am saving for**:


-Apt (1 month deposit--which I now have to probably triple b/c there's a default on my credit score)


-Guild fees (I am SAG and WGA eligible, only interested in WGA)


Both are at $0 now, so I guess it's essentially a wishlist.

&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

-Yes, I plan to consult a lawyer if I can get a free consult or a friend can recommend another friend.

Thanks if you made it the whole way through. Sorry if it's an info overload, just wanted to be thorough.

I thought I'd ask about how you guys deal with the stress of having a tight financial situation, even if you have a plan to make it better. I'm drowning in debt from grad school -- student loans and credit card. I have a full time job, so I'm paying it down as aggressively as I can (60% of my income goes to payments). I can't renegotiate my interest rates, but it's all under control and should be paid off within two years. I work remotely and live in a cheaper country to help. I've applied for about 100 second jobs, in person and online. Everyone wants to be a tutor or babysitter or barista these days for extra cash, so it's not that easy.

I got a call from the IRS today saying that I filed incorrectly last year and might owe $4,000 -- until I refile and fix it.

There's something nice, mentally, about having them all in one place and not dealing with that awful company anymore (Navient/Sallie Mae).
* My plan is to OVERPAY as often as possible; I can probably afford about $1,500 a month towards this debt.  With that in mind is there anything I'm not thinking of as it pertains to this refinance?
* I applied for the 20 year fixed but I think, if I remember right, there's a 15 and a 25?  Is there a benefit to taking a sooner payoff date?  Wouldn't that just jack up my minimum monthly and, god forbid, I fall on hard times just make it harder to keep up with? Especially if I plan on overpaying anyway?  Is there a downside to extending the payment window?  It would lower my monthly REQUIRED payments, yes?  Does moving these dates typically effect your interest rate offered?

THANKS EVERYONE.  Let me know if I need to add more information.

personalfinance,"Im so close to getting my degree, but how do I pay for one semester","I'm happy to say I would like to return back to my university after struggling financially and keeping up with student loan payments.  I was not kicked out or put on academic probation, but I dropped out from school as I was losing motivation. I changed my major three times so it has extended my graduation date.  I'm so close to getting my degree. I have 9 credits left which I got Ds and Fs which are courses in my major, so I have to retake it in order to fullfill graduation requirements and be conferred a Bachelor Degree.  

But, I'm financially stuck.  I applied for FAFSA and qualified for Pell Grant and Stafford Loan.  Currently, I work a part-time minimum wage job and have been making payments on loans I took out in the past. It's so hard to save because everything is going to student loans otherwise I would pay out of pocket.  Tuition is expensive as it's a private university. I just have to worry about Spring 2017 semester as the 3 credit class is only offered in Spring and I'll be taking 6 credits in Fall 2016. In order to receive financial aid, I have to take 6 credits so I don't think I'd be getting any federal or institution aid in Spring 2017 which costs $3,500.  I already have $90,000 in loans  (Unsubidized Loans, Wells Fargo Student Loan, Navient). I'd hate to take out another loan, but if it's the last resort, then so be it.  I'm only 24 so I have little credit history to qualify for private loan.  

I do want my degree, but if I can't afford it then I won't finish it, but why waste it away.  There must be some options out there that people may know about.  Would appreciate any advice!",finance,1458784608

personalfinance,I'm closing on a house soon. The credit union tells me that they are not allowed to close within 6 business days after final inspection per federal regulation. Are they blowing smoke?,"So, I'm buying a townhome which has several others in the unit. The construction is 99% complete, they just need to put down sod and touch up paint a bit. The builder tells me that they will be ready to close next week. I've talked to a lady at my credit union, she said all I needed to do was have final inspection ordered and I'd be good to go. Well, today she changed her story - she said that per federal regulation, I have to wait 6 business days after final inspection before I can close, which would delay closing a few days. 

My first thought was ""that sucks, but oh well"" but then I got to thinking, ""if it's a federal regulation, then surely it applies to other lenders for the other people in my unit as well, so they won't be able to close next week either"", since I presume we're all having final inspection done at the same time. My bank told me they couldn't do final inspection until the sod was down, which I'm told will happen Friday. 

So anyway, was the federal regulation line accurate? Or am I just being waved off? I know a few days isn't a huge deal in the long run, but I'd like to move in ASAP.

* Severe anxiety problems regulated by medications but without medical insurance I would be screwed.

* No college loans and no degree, I couldnt keep with it.



My plan(ish)-
I currently live with my grandmother after living in central Fl for 4.5 years, I moved back after my grandfather passed 2 years ago, but I have no friends in the area and Im feeling stagnant. In central Fl i worked for a large rodent (making $8.35 an hour when i left.... not going back to that job ever) and rented for most of it, couch surfed/rented a friends spare room for a few months, and unfortunately lived in my car for the summer of 14 (family still doesnt know that, but i learned that you cant trust everybody's word even if they are a friend) I currently work in the bakery of a big warehouse store and make $13 an hour, but im only working 25-30 hours a week currently due to cuts. I hope to purchase a 2-3 bedroom house in central fl and rent out the rooms to friends. A really good friend of mine is willing to go half in on a home, but I am uncomfortable about that so I hope to find/be able to find a home that I can get a decent mortgage on that is livable. I am fairly good at home repairs having worked with rental houses in the past (general maintenance and complete overhaul renovations, but I hate plumbing...) After renting for several years I would like to own my own place, rent for a 2 bedroom was $750 a month plus utilities, looking at mobile homes the lot rent on one varies from $500-$650 a month plus the price of the home so thats another $20-$30k. But a mortgage payment on a house on its own land seems like it would be cheaper..?


I have a trust fund of four govt bonds that are either series E or EE (i dont remember) that are from my great grandfather before he passed and my older sister who got the same bonds said she got about $5500 each out of. Come sept. I will be able to cash out these bonds and my desire is to be able to cash out two or three of these bonds to use as a down payment on a property.


My father is very supportive of me getting my own place, he was about my age when he bought his own home (that I grew up in) and he is willing to cosign a home loan with me. Ive been looking and looking at places within about half an hours drive of where my last apartment was located. It seems that to get a decent home Im looking at $70-$80k? I know that my credit score of 708 is kinda low for that price range with how much Ill have to spend for a loan from a bank, so my questions really are-


Is it reasonable for me to have a $10000-15000 down payment on a home coming mostly from my trust fund? i  want to keep it so that I could afford the home even if i was on my own, assuming I transferred stores I would be making approx $550 every two weeks, I spend on average $40 a week on food, but I could definitely cut back if needed. and my phone Is $20 a month.


Am I right for looking at more expensive homes since they are on land that i would own, and not be paying thousands a year on lot rent?


Would it be something that would be even possible for me to buy a house in the area I am looking (600 miles away from where I am currently) without being guaranteed employment with the company I currently work for?


I know I am missing more that I had to ask but its been a long day, Thanks for the help.

technology,TheNextWeb: Why Twitter is a better network for real life than Facebook,"**Full text from [the article](http://thenextweb.com/facebook/2016/03/22/twitter-better-than-facebook/).**

&gt;This week, Twitter turns 10. Over the next five days we‚Äôll be exploring how far the microblogging service has come, the challenges it faces going forward and some of its key moments along the way.

&gt;If you‚Äôre like most people, your life ‚Äî or at least the lives of those around you ‚Äî can get really wrapped up in Facebook. Between social shade and pictures of babies, Facebook is a more cult of personality than social network.

&gt;And that‚Äôs why Twitter is better.

&gt;**Facebook**

&gt;There are two moving parts to Facebook: the social feed and Messenger.

&gt;Facebook proper is a tireless stream of long-form blog posts and big, splashy posts from #brands with links that redirect you to their site. It‚Äôs boilerplate social media, often at its worst.

&gt;About that feed: it‚Äôs fed to you. Facebook uses some advanced algorithmic flavor to curate your feed for you, which goes beyond what‚Äôs popular. Hot topics and posts favorited by your friends and family get top billing. Sometimes. Maybe.

&gt;It‚Äôs a bit of a blur, but that‚Äôs the point. Facebook has no ambition to reveal how it does its thing ‚Äî you‚Äôre just supposed to sit back and use it and ignore its possible racism.


&gt;Messenger is a fairly standard chat platform with a lot of extras. You can do everything from request an Uber to play mini-games in Messenger and it‚Äôs available just about everywhere you turn.

&gt;Messenger is also a standalone entity, with Facebook forcing chats to Messenger rather than host them on your feed.

&gt;There are also other Facebook properties widely used, like Instagram. Also curated, Instagram is for media rather than blogging, and has a dedicated user-base addicted to pictures of brunch.

&gt;**Twitter**

&gt;It‚Äôs not hard to figure Twitter out, even when you consider the sum of its parts.

&gt;You‚Äôve got Twitter, which moves fast and breaks things ‚Äî literally (yes, that‚Äôs a pun). At 140-characters, there‚Äôs not much long-winded nonsense you can spew. Tweetstorms are a thing, but used occasionally ‚Äî just like ‚Äòtweet longer.‚Äô

&gt;The 140-character limit may improve, but you‚Äôre still not going to be blogging on Twitter. You can host images and video on Twitter, but they may not have the synergy of Instagram.

&gt;Vine is for creators who make six-second snippets of video and dovetails nicely into what Twitter is. It‚Äôs fast, entertaining and often silly. It also spurns viral content, or spins it into something entirely more entertaining.

&gt;Periscope is the only Twitter entity without any kind of rate limit. You can live-stream until your phone dies, or keep it plugged in and go for as long as you like.

&gt;The catch there is that Periscope is for live broadcasts only and only hosts video for 24 hours after a stream has ended (you can save them to your camera roll, though). It‚Äôs about as ethereal as Twitter gets, but creates a sense of urgency around viewing.


&gt;**Different strokes**

&gt;Facebook and Twitter are meant for different audiences, or at least different types of users.

&gt;It‚Äôs hard to dig yourself out of Facebook, which may be why studies show it‚Äôs better not to use it. Between streams of posts from your extended family and the cluttered interface (mobile or desktop, though desktop is much worse), Facebook is good at making you think you missed something.

&gt;Twitter, on the other hand, seems to like making you miss stuff. Though the algorithmic feed helps, it‚Äôs opt-out. Even if you choose to try it, chances are you‚Äôre not going to catch everything.

&gt;But the nature of Twitter lets you slip in, check out what‚Äôs been going on, then dart out ‚Äî back to real life. It‚Äôs as powerful as Facebook when it comes to discovering information, but begs a fraction of the time.

&gt;You can DM via Twitter, but that‚Äôs not a proper chat application. Messenger is better for that, but is getting as bulky as Facebook. A simple chat app is quickly becoming a place where you check for messages, then stick around to do other things ‚Äî stuff you can probably do better with other apps.

&gt;**Audience**

&gt;There‚Äôs a defining factor between Facebook and Twitter ‚Äì and it‚Äôs family.

&gt;Nobody connects with loved ones on Twitter; it‚Äôs just not what the platform is for. You don‚Äôt typically say ‚Äòdid you see the picture Mom tweeted of her new puppy?‚Äô

&gt;But you‚Äôll hear ‚ÄòMom posted a picture of her new dog and it‚Äôs incredibly cute,‚Äô where ‚Äòposted‚Äô insists it was on Facebook. For many of us, Facebook is for keeping up with personal things; it‚Äôs replaced interaction. That may trouble you ‚Äî it may not. You may not even have realized it was happening, but it is and on a massive scale.

&gt;Twitter is typically for connecting to people you may not know (think about it ‚Äî how many people did you know on Twitter before you signed up?). It‚Äôs equal parts professional networking and social snark.

&gt;It‚Äôs where opinions are shared openly because even the hate dissipates quickly. Even if you were to post something opaque about your best friend being a jerk, 140-character responses hurt a lot less than Facebook‚Äôs endless parade.

&gt;Similarly, people feel less responsible to interact via Twitter. Because posts flick away so quickly ‚Äî and Twitter isn‚Äôt trying as hard to surface content from your family or friends via an algorithm ‚Äî letting go is probably easier.

&gt;**There is no contest**

&gt;We like to talk about user numbers ‚Äî specifically how Facebook is absolutely killing it ‚Äî but there‚Äôs no competition between Facebook and Twitter. On almost every level, the two are different ‚Äî comparable due to socialization, but not equal.

&gt;Facebook lets you connect with family better, which may be its only killer feature. Twitter lets you connect with the world more efficiently, which is definitely its draw.

&gt;Messenger is great for chats and things tangentially related to communication, but using dedicated apps is still more feature-rich.

&gt;Live video is possible with Facebook, but Periscope is still far more popular. It‚Äôs also got more synergy and features for live broadcasts; Facebook seems to be dabbling rather than serious.


&gt;Vine is a wildcard, but in my opinion ‚Äî far more entertaining than anything Facebook has to offer.

&gt;Twitter obviously allows you to share Periscopes and Vines via Twitter, but does a great job at also keeping them standalone entities. I may discover a Periscope broadcast via Twitter, but it redirects me to Periscope, where I can take full advantage of what the platform offers.

&gt;Facebook is a time investment and often an emotional one. That carries over to Instagram and Messenger, too; it‚Äôs hard to pull yourself away.

&gt;Twitter ‚Äì even cumulatively ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt ask as much of you and I can appreciate that. I get in, get informed and gtfo. I check out some Vines, see who‚Äôs on Periscope and respond to a few @-metions and DMs ‚Äî all before I can even get one-third of the way through a Facebook feed.

&gt;There‚Äôs something to be said for having more time to experience things in real life instead of responding to everyone else‚Äôs digitally.",technology,1458813619

personalfinance,Large lump sum for student loan/repayment plan for private loans.,"Hi all,

So I have around $210k of SL from undergrad and law school. $100k of which is private SL. I'm currently on IBR for the federal loans. I started working three months ago but applied when I was unemployed so my payment is $0. I make $45k a year win bonus but I have no idea what they will be. 

I pay $900 a month in private loans to discover. Interest range from 6-7%. I called them an they offered me two types of plans. One plan would lower my monthly payment to 670 a month for 6 months but all the interest accumulated during that time is capitalized at the end. 

They also have a plan that extends the loan for 6 to 12 months and brings the payments down to 260 and 160 respectively. No capitalization at the end but interest obviously accrues. 

Now my parents have offered to give me around $75k to help pay off some of my loans. They plan are refinancing their house to do so. I'm a little hesitant about this as much as I appreciate it I just don't want to see them screw themselves over trying to help me. 

Now I talked to my parents and they think taking the 12 month plan is a good idea to keep my payments low while I try to refinance through sofi or something similar. I was recently denied but I took a 50 point credit hit right after the bar for opening a credit card, switching banks and leasing a car for work. So it's already up 25 points back to 700 and hopefully in a couple months I can refinance, also have money from my parents and be closer to a bonus or raise at work. All the while I'd be paying as much as I could afford. Probably around $700 month for those SL. 

I appreciate your thoughts.

I have a credit card that I use for small purchases and pay off every month, would it be a smart idea to get another credit card with lower interest rate put my dental work on it and then pay it off monthly?

Or is there a better solution I'm missing? I have tried care credit and they won't approve me :(


Tldr; i need $1200+ dental work. Is putting it on a credit card and paying monthly a good idea or is there another solution?",finance,1458829353

I make $14/h currently so my question is how do i take full advantage of this incentive? If i change nothing i'm under the impression that it's totally useless to me, as i did not owe after completing my tax return this year, so i wouldn't (or shouldn't) owe next year and therefore not have any money to wipe out with this incentive. 

Would i have to adjust my withholdings from my employer (currently $45 federal and $20 state per weekly paycheck) so that i owe on my next tax return and then have it wiped out by this incentive?

personalfinance,"PSA for Chase credit card holders who are carrying both purchase and promotional balances, be wary","This might be common sense, but I consider myself relatively savvy and this was surprising to me (mainly because it is not clear on the statement).

We closed on a house in February. Anyone who has bought a house knows that the weeks after can be a little chaotic (I also started a new job and took 0 days off for close and moving). Chaotic on your brain and your pocketbook. I decided to throw most of our spare purchases onto a credit card, eat the ~$20 interest charge, and pay it all off when we were able to look at all the costs of purchasing a home that we accrued. This was to make sure we had liquid cash for any sort of work we needed that would be better done as cash only (i.e. someone fixing the fence, etc).

For simplicity, I used the card my husband and I both have (so all the charges would be in the same place). This card is also carrying a Balance Transfer Promotion at 0%.

After the chaos settled, I checked my bill and went straight to the Interest Charges to figure out how much I needed to pay. 

Balance Type|Annual Percentage Rate (APR)|Expiration Date|Balance Subject to Interest Rate|Interest Charge
:--|:--|:--|:--|:-- 
Purchases|16.24%(V)|-|$1519.87|20.96
Cash Advances|19.49%(V)|-|-0-|-0-
Balance Transfer|16.24%(V)|-|-0-|-0-
Balance Transfer Promotion|0.00%|8/22/16|$1,990.69|-0-

Given this information, I called Chase and confirmed with a service advisor that if I made a lump $1700 payment, that would knock out all of my interest. She confirmed. I made a $1700 lump sum payment online. 

I checked my statement as soon as it came out to make sure it was allocated properly, and to my surprise saw this:

Balance Type|Annual Percentage Rate (APR)|Expiration Date|Balance Subject to Interest Rate|Interest Charge
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Purchases|16.24%(V)|-|$969.69|$12.51
Cash Advances|19.49%(V)|-|-0-|-0-
Balance Transfer|16.24%(V)|-|-0-|-0-
Balance Transfer Promotion|0.00%|8/22/16|$1,960.86|-0-

My total balance for the billing period was only $2,055.97, I immediately was confused AF and called Chase. I was told the following:

""The Balance Subject to Interest Rate is the AVERAGE of the amount you owed over the time period, not the amount at time of statement.""

This was pretty frustrating because that means even the most current bill is inaccurate and the ONLY way to get your pay off amount is to call in and explicitly ask them to confirm the current amount. And despite doing that, I was only read off my balance statement. I actually owe 120 dollars that is accruing interest. I knew you needed a payoff amount on loans, but I was unaware that credit cards also worked this way.

The poor customer service rep couldn't explain the logic behind it, or why their statements don't denote that the Balance Subject to Interest Rate is not equal to the amount you need to pay off the avoid future interest charges.  (Other than banks love money.)

To Chase's credit, the second advisor was very educated and helped me figure it out quickly. +10 points for Timothy, cause he didn't build the system. 

**TL;DR: On your Chase bill, the ""Balance Subject to Interest Rate"" is the AVERAGE of your balance over the entire billing period, not the ending balance. This is not explicitly stated on your statement. Call Chase directly to get the current pay off amount.**",finance,1458837774

We would like to buy a new Outback Subaru for $32,000. We would put $10,000 down and then have a loan for the $22,000. We would have a 4% interest rate loan across 5 years ($460 per month). However, my husband and I would pay extra each month to ensure we got rid of the loan in 3-4 years. We have a horrible car for snow right now. I will be getting a new job soon (which I will make more money and add to our income) and need a car that drives well in snow. We also would like to start a family in three years and I would like a car that has great safety features. Both our cars now are not very safe and that makes me quite nervous. (Also, I have looked for used Outbacks in the area and they are priced almost exactly as the new ones. That is why I would like to go with a brand-new one.)

With paying $500 a month, our total would be $4070, leave almost $800 with room. 

We do have a 6-month emergency fund.

After searching for 3 months I received an offer for 52k a year which I have accepted. The only problem is that it requires me to move about 3 hours away from my parents home where I'm currently living. During college I had major issues handling money and have ended up with about $4000 of credit card debt in high interest accounts in addition to student loans, but that's something I can plan and budget for.

My question is, should I take out more to pay off the credit cards now and have one payment instead of several? The interest rates on the loan will likely be similar to that of my cards due to a low score, but in my head having a single loan with a scheduled payoff seems preferable to having so many cards.",finance,1458840519

Anyways, now that I'm earning money ($36k per year, I've been paying over 50% income towards debt (I live with my parents and don't mind doing so for several more years). So, I've been applying over $1k per month towards paying off cards but still have a long way to go, as the interest ranges between (14-26%)

My federal loans are set to IBR, and I will be paying zero this year once they are out of the grace period.

Is this a horrible idea? I feel somewhat foolish letting non-dischargeable debt balloon while aggressively tackling debt that could be discharged.

1) Get an accelerated BSN at a state school ~20k, then go on to get my MSN after to become a nurse practitioner ~30-50k depending on school. This process would probably take me about 4-5 years to get where I'd like to be career-wise. So total around $60k.

personalfinance,Bad accountant advice ruined my credit score (tax lien) any advice?,"A few years ago a previous employer never sent me a tax form.  I was doing my own taxes at the time.  After getting a letter from both the state (CA) and federal IRS saying that I owed money (and no idea how to get the right amounts) I hired an accountant to dig into things and help clear everything up.  She redid the previous year's taxes at the same time she did the currently due taxes.  She advised me to pay the original amount I owed and that she would write a letter contesting the penalties and interest from non-payment.  It was about a year later and both CA &amp; Fed just deducted money from my current refunds.  I thought nothing of it since they both still sent me some money back.  My accountant never wrote the letter, giving her the benefit of the doubt, because both deducted money and still gave me some.  I didn't know she never wrote the letter at the time.  

Evidently they didn't take the whole amount because a few months later CA put a lien on my bank account and withdrew (almost but not all) the rest of the money.  I since looked into things myself and made sure but CA and Fed have all their money.  I would have just paid the penalties and interest at the time if that was the advice of my accountant since I had the money to cover it.

Taxes are fine now but the lien (even though it is paid) is killing my credit score.  I used to have over 700 and now am in the low 600s.  I was told by someone that a lien on my credit report is equivalent to a bankruptcy in terms of damage and it will take 7 years for it to come off my report.  Is there anything I can do?

TL;DR - Paid off tax lien on my credit report because of bad advice any way to remove it?",finance,1458879377
personalfinance,$25k Award and some nasty credit issues. Please send knowledge.,"Hey PF, 

I've been lurking a long time and while reading the Wiki and checking multiple threads, I wanted to get some opinions on our situation. 

The story is that my fianc√© had an accident year on the job and has been out of work on compensation. Finally after a couple surgeries and lots of PT and waiting, she is being released and will come with an award. (apparently it's not a settlement) The money should be around $25-50k (for the sake of argument, I will go low). 

###Here's the stats for your viewing pleasure: 

* My Salary: $90k
* Her Salary: $0 (payments end this week)
* We rent $1000+, have 2 cars (super high interest rate $1000+/month for both cars), no CCs. 
* Lots of debt and low credit scores. (450 mine and 608 hers)
* Both in our low 30s.
* I have not paid taxes in 2 years. (Currently working on that with my CPA)
* My debt: 45k debt (20k school, 25k random other things)
* Her Debt: 20k medical and 20k other things. 

We come from a low income childhood and was never taught the value of money or credit. Since 18, I have amassed a large amount of debt with several CCs and phone accounts. I always made good money so I usually just buy everything in cash and never looked back. More recently, we have been trying to do better and not spending money all the time and trying to make a savings. Unfortunately, the savings went to $0 after some emergency situations. 

She wants to fix our credit and get the ball rolling on stabilizing our finances. We also decided to do the Dave Ramsey courses out here where we live. So we have that going for us. 

So I guess my question is: ""Where do we go from here? How can we stabilize our lives to make sure we don't die somewhere on the streets living in a box because of our mistakes?""

**TL;DR: We're 30 somethings that are getting $25-50k and have some pretty fucked up credit issues. Please send help. SOS.**

personalfinance,"(NV, home state of VA) Vegas hotel is trying to scam us, what rights do we have?","My sister signed up for one of those timeshare promos, watch a 2 hour presentation and have a 3 night hotel stay comped [at the holiday inn desert club](http://www.ihg.com/holidayinnclubvacations/hotels/us/en/las-vegas/lascv/hoteldetail).  

Originally they asked if she was single or married, she said single.  A week before the trip they asked if she had *ever* been married, she said she was divorced and was told she needed to have the divorce papers with her.  

The day she was supposed to see the presentation, she was turned away because they wouldn't accept the papers she brought, and she'd have to have her (now ex) husband with her.

They're now saying that she's on the hook for $800 for three nights, plus taxes.  We've tried to talk to multiple people and have been repeatedly refused help or flat out hung up on, they won't even give her an itemized bill, so she has no idea why a room advertised as $189 is showing up as 3/$800 when she's already paid the tax on them.

I tried to contact them to find out the last day to cancel reservations prior to a stay and they wouldn't even tell me that much, they just kept saying that it depends on my package, and without actual reservations they can't disclose that.

What recourse does she have?  I've told her to attempt a cancellation of payment with our bank (navy federal), but she's still trying to work with the hotel on it, despite them doing everything they can to give her zero information about her issue.  I also looked at other reviews about the place, they've turned down other people for nitpicky reasons (husband and wife were visiting from out of country, wife was denied because she wasn't fluent in English so they refused the presentation to the husband as well) so she thinks they purposely deny as many people as they can.

We're very upset about this.  If we planned to spend that much money we could have stayed at one of the top hotels directly on the strip, and still payed less for an awe-inspiring hotel like the bellagio, instead of a shithole a few blocks away.",finance,1458880570

No intention to spend any more than 300 a month, and I intend to pay my balances on time because who would want to pay interest. Not really interested in rotating catagories. So my questions are:

Are there any other cards without fees that would be good for my usage?

Would it be a good or bad thing for my parents to cosign?

With the Upromise card I would have to buy things through a Upromise portal/site, has anyone here had any issues with that?

personalfinance,(27M) Pension... what else do I want?,"Hey guys,

I work for the State of Minnesota and am currently part of their Correctional Plan. I work in a secure facility, currently making around 40k a year (Last year, my ""federal gross"" was just under the ~37k tax bracket).

I am not a college graduate.. I went to school for Computer Science for 3 years and ended up dropping out due to very severe depression and a suicidal mindset. That was approximately 5-6 years ago. I can't say I plan to be here forever, and would love to get a degree in something, but currently still recovering from it financially. Also attempting to repair my credit in the process, which was quite destroyed.

My current question is... I read about pensions and how they are bad to rely on. I'm quite involved in my finances and budget and am doing pretty decent for myself at the moment. My cost of living is relatively low so I am working toward paying off high interest debts and things in collections. My wages are frequently garnished, and I haven't received a tax return in years.

Once all of these things are taken care of, what should I do besides my pension plan? I currently put in 9.1% of my income and my employer provides 12.85%. I'm offered a ""deferred compensation"" plan that I am not involved in, because they match roughly $175 dollars a year. Yes it is free money, but I haven't taken the time. This would allow me to put ""compensatory time"" which I can earn by working overtime at a rate of 1.5, or by throwing holidays into it (Could earn 88 hours if scheduled NO holidays, 80 of which could be put directly into this account). I believe it is a 457 plan (Is that a thing?) I haven't done any of this as being in debt, I prefer to have as much money as possible to put toward becoming debt free.

I have been looking into IRA's due to no company matching 401k plan, what are my options (or recommendations)? 

Thanks

They always called while I was at work, so I just kind of ignored/avoided the calls. Finally, a couple of weeks ago I said yeah, sure, I've got time to talk. They told me my current loan interest rate was 4.2% and they could offer me the current rate of 3.75%, which would knock my monthly payments down ~$180. I said sure, sounds great, and they sent the loan disclosure documents my way to sign. 

Here's where they started to lose me. I started looking over the loan docs which said I still had ~$109k outstanding on my current loan, however, the new loan amount at the lower interest rate is for $112k. Is that standard practice? It just seems that they're getting me on the hook for another $3k, and trying to disguise it with ""lower monthly payments"". They've also been on my case big time about getting the disclosure documents signed and returned ASAP, calling and emailing at least once a day. I've been with my dad who's having some health issues and haven't been able to get the disclosures sent back.

I am going to work for an employer that is 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit that provides public services to those with developmental disabilities. My employer qualifies for PSLF.

I have just over $30k in loan debt. $25k in Direct Loans that are eligible. $5k in FFEL that are not. All of my loans are currently serviced by FedLoan, but because of how it is set up I have to make multiple payments to the one company (a bit of a pain, but could be worse). I have been in repayment since December 2012, and have made every payment on time. I have been on an IBR every year I have been in repayment.

I'm questioning if I should consolidate my loans before I submit my PSLF paperwork, to make my FFEL eligible for forgiveness.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm thinking all the payments made on my loans before I started working for a non-profit do NOT count towards the 120 payments. Only the payments made while working for a non-profit count. If that IS the case, I would likely consolidate my loans so they all can be forgiven, since I would be starting from scratch anyway. I am aware that payments made before consolidation would not be counted towards the 120 payments after consolidation. 

Since my loans are serviced by the same provider anyway, is there any benefit to consolidating them? Would the interest rate be lowered? I have $10,348 in unsubsidized loans, and $15,944 in subsidized loans. I've read in the past if you consolidate federal loans you have do it through a private lender, and you lose the benefits of having a federal loan like IBR and PAYE.

I'm getting a headache from reading all the fine print on the website, so any insight would be really appreciated!

5.  My fiancee (an Army vet) and I both have jobs, and will be making $12.29 an hour (me) and $10.00 per hour (him).  His will be part time, with no benefits, though he gets up to 40 hours a week, with medical, vision, dental, and a required deposit to a state retirement.  Mine is permanent part time, though I will get up to 39 hours a week. My monthly insurance payment is  going to be around $350.

My children are covered by state medical insurance, (because if I pay for their insurance through my job, I won't even make a single cent on my paychecks) and my fiancee has ""bare minimum"" VA insurance that only covers what he was discharged through the Army for.  He is currently applying for state medical insurance.

Questions:

Can we file ""married filing jointly?""
How many withholdings can we claim total?  
How should we split the withholdings to keep the most money out of our paychecks?

(For our year 2015 taxes, turbo tax advised us to file married filing jointly.  Our total Federal refund was almost 10K, but 3 days AFTER it was scheduled to be deposited, we found out it went to student loan debt... which crippled us financially.  We were dependant on that refund to move out of our current living situation and pay waaaay past due bills... because this didn't get to happen, we are on a bare bones budget.)

Bitcoin,Thought experiment: Government led mining arms race.,"This is a short essay exploring one possible direction for bitcoin if and when demand increased such that the market capitalisation became comparable in magnitude with an existing major currency or asset, such as gold, euros or dollars.

So the basis for the discussion is that we got there - the market cap is much larger than today. How we got there could be from private demand initially, followed by government and/or central banks taking an interest, big investment banks... whatever. The key point I'm making is that regardless of how we got to that point, once the market cap reaches a certain level, governments and central banks will take a significant interest in bitcoin.

(From now on when I say government I'm including central banks as being part of the government, i.e. a central bank is effectively part of the government even where technically/legally it is separated and partially autonomous - they aren't really autonomous, they're part of the wider system of politics and governance).

So let's say the UK governmant is concerned that citizens are increasingly choosing to exchange sterling (Great Britain Pounds, i.e. GBP) for bitcoin, e.g. as a store of wealth in an unstable financial environment. The effect is large enough that sterling starts to fall relative to bitcoin. Let's say this same scenario is playing out in other major economies, the US, Canada, Europe as a whole, Australia &amp; NZ, maybe India, South American countries, perhaps even China and Russia.

I see two possibilities to consider. 

(1) Governments see bitcoin as a threat to their ability to govern, and/or their power, and a number of key governments are able to find a consensus and coordinate a campaign against bitcoin. I don't think bitcoin could thrive in this scenario, but I also think it is an unlikely one, because...

(2) Governments see bitcoin as a threat to their ability to govern, and/or their power. No consensus can be arrived at between governments, possibly because in the background some of them have already conceded that bitcoin is competing strongly with their fiat currency, and are exploring ways of obtaining some controlling power over bitcoin, e.g. through building mining farms and buying bitcoin.

This could lead to an arms race dynamic between governments competing to take control of miner share and to increase bitcoin reserves. 

Is this a sane scenario? A government would be losing it's ability to control money supply, and although taking mining share doesn't necessarily improve that, it does mean that the money supply isn't being controlled by foreign governments. So they each maintain a share of the mining capacity to maintain a vote (or perhaps it's really a veto on change) over bitcoin monetary policy. 

At this point I wonder if a fork would be coordinated such that western democracies would split away from China, Russia, etc. Perhaps it would be deeply incompatible to have governments and economies with big political differences operating on the same blockchain, and a fork is seen as a reasonably workable middle way. A fork might also be seen as a way de-escalate the arms race and reduce spiralling energy demand from mining.

In the mean time, private mining can continue, but perhaps dwindles to practically nothing if the arms race between governments causes the profit margin to go negative (i.e. all mining is done at a loss).

The cordial answers I received and was messaged definitely makes me feel better about the state of the party, but I have major concerns about the inability to provide evidence to back up claims.

personalfinance,Lots of student debt going into medical school and a little inheritance.,"I'm reading up on debt and 'windfall' inheritances right now, but I wanted to ask some specific advice. Just this week, I received $10,000 in inheritance. I have about $7,000 in my checking account, and I'm finishing my undergraduate education in May. I have about $70,000 in student debt from a circuitous journey through (private) college with no financial help from family. I have no other debts and also have a paid-off car. 

I'm starting medical school in the fall of this year. That's a big investment, but I know that the huge debt load is manageable later in life on a doctor's salary, and I also may be receiving a good bit of my tuition waived. I also live frugally.

I'm just unsure what I should do with this $10k. It's a good emergency fund, but where to keep it? Savings account interest rates are abysmal, but the fund could live there.

personalfinance,Emergency Fund vs. Vehicle Loan,"I've used the search bar, but nothing matching my situation exactly comes up. Feel free to skip to the bottom if the background info doesn't matter to you.

**Background:** a couple of years ago I moved across country after a two-year period of messy divorce cleanup. I ended up with a lot of credit card debt and my student loans. Moving from an area with good public transit and bike infrastructure to one without, I needed to buy a vehicle to get to work (after already spending most of my savings on the move). I'm finally out of credit card debt, and I'm paying (IBR) on my student loans. I work in the nonprofit sector and plan on staying that way, so in another 8 years my remaining loans will be paid off via the federal loan reimbursement plan. My vehicle is super reliable, and I'm currently using all the money I was paying towards credit cards to pay it down. This comes to about $400/month. I still owe $2800 (at 8.99% APR), so I'm trying to get it paid off ASAP. This will also allow me to drop my insurance cost, saving me around $44/month. 28 years old, ~$31k/year salary, I have $1800 in personal savings, I have no retirement to speak of. When my vehicle is paid off I plan on opening a Roth IRA and contributing $5500/year (broken up into paycheck-by-paycheck contributions). I have a live-in SO, and we've also opened a joint savings with the intention of using it as a mortgage down payment at some point, but I'd rather not tap into this for any other reason.

**Question:** Should I empty my savings to pay off the vehicle and pay my cheaper insurance premium up front when the time comes (total savings on insurance/interest ~$325), or should I prioritize Emergency Fund savings? Is it more important to get my retirement going ASAP, or to have a fund available just in case?",finance,1459006316

My student loan interest rates are ridiculously low and no one - even my two friends who are financial advisors - can figure out why.

I had variable-rate loans from Citibank until 2011 when they were sold to Sallie Mae (Navient). My balance was about $17k at that time, don't remember the interest rate but I think it was in the 3-4% range. When SM/Navient picked them up the rates dropped below 1%. They currently range from .07-.39%. At first I assumed it was some kind of gimmick, like they compounded hourly at that rate or something:) But no, I've been paying just a few dollars per loan in interest each year.

Obviously I'm not complaining but I've always wondered how this happened and didn't think anything good would come of asking Navient:) Has anyone heard of anything like this? Was it just an error in my favor? Thanks for any insights!",finance,1459008089
personalfinance,Is it worth cashing in my TFSA Mutual Funds in order to pay off debt? (CAN),"About a year and a half ago my girlfriend &amp; I had ~10k in debt, I was in the market for a new vehicle and purchased a new car at a very low interest rate and received a cheque for 10,000 dollars (included in the financing of the vehicle) which basically consolidated all of our debt onto the car.

Since then we have closed our line of credit, her finances are under control but I am personally struggling. I know buying a brand new vehicle wasn't the best idea but what's done is done and there isn't much I can do but make the payments on time and ride it out.

I am currently clearing between 3500-4000 / mth. (Base salary + small commission) I give my girlfriend between 1000 and 1500 a month depending on the kind of month I have for mortgage payment, cell phone bills, internet / cable, electricity, condo fees etc. My car payment is 391.59 biweekly, my insurance is 165.97 per month. Fuel costs are approximately $75 - $100 / week. (I have a 40km commute each way.) I put $200 / month into a TFSA Mutual Fund which is now at $4400.00.

My spending habits are brutal, and I'm realizing that now that I am backed into a corner. I buy lunch at work every single day, anywhere between $8 - $13. None of my friends have a mortgage currently except for me, so it's common practice to go to the bar every Friday and Saturday night and spend at least $40. These bad habits have driven me into a tough spot. My chequings account has an overdraft limit of $1500. My bank account is currently sitting at negative $1300. My credit card is maxed out at $2000.

My question is, would it be wise for me to take the savings out of my TFSA Mutual Funds in order to pay my credit card off completely as well as keep my chequings account in the positive? The fee / interest on my overdraft is only ~$15.00 a month, but it's a terrible feeling living paycheck to paycheck because I'm running out of overdraft room and credit card room. I understand the biggest issue I have is terrible spending habits, say I were to fix that, stop the unnecessary spending, is it wise to use my savings to start with a clean slate instead of working my way back to the positive over months and months?

I have some big expenses coming up soon. I'm in the market for an engagement ring, my girlfriend has never been on a trip and has been working two jobs for months saving up for a holiday whereas I have not been, I need to start saving for a wedding, all of this needs to start with changing my spending habits.

He has been turned down because of his income (which is $10/hr, well above min wage). We tried JD Byrider and a few other local buy-here-pay-here places. We want to buy from a lot so we can be sure we don't get another lemon (like his current vehicle). 

We went to a local lot and the salesman said oh yeah your girlfriend can cosign so you can get approved for a nicer truck. So he runs my credit and says yes, we can get the truck my SO wants. So we went home to try and get insurance quotes (also note that he doesn't have insurance because it is insanely expensive) and we finally found a decent quote.

We went back to the lot and the salesman said great, we will submit the forms and just call back tomorrow morning and we can go from there. 


Well I had to work the next morning so my SO goes by himself, down-payment and insurance quote in-hand. The salesman said he has to take me off the loan because he would be losing money. I assume because I qualify for a lower interest rate.

MachineLearning,"""Are you sure you should be doing that?""","Hey people,

I have a non-critical system I'm working on that logs when people decide to do certain things. I want to flag when users do things that don't match what they've done before. An analogy would be ""Joe posts on /r/machinelearning at noon every Tuesday"".

Here is how I'm thinking about this:

* Output: Which subreddit Joe posted on
* Inputs: Time of day, day of week

Over time, the system ""learns"" when Joe is likely to post on what subreddit with the ultimate goal being something like this. One day, Joe posts on /r/cars on Tuesday at noon. The system notices this and says ""Hey Joe, are you sure you should be posting on /r/cars? Usually, you post on /r/machinelearning at this time.""

Another case would be that Tuesday at noon rolls around and Joe does NOT post on anything. The system notices this and flags it for Joe: ""Hey Joe, should you be posting on /r/machinelearning?""

The system gets to watch Joe's posting history as long as is necessary for there to be some confidence in the flags that are being generated.

In reality, Joe is not actually watching the flags, these are flags being aggregated across many different people and the flags are just reports generated for the PHBs to decide whether to investigate or not. Then those decisions are fed back into the system.

politics,"Dispelling the myth of ""trickle down economics"" and ""tax cuts for the rich""","These days, one of the things that I see misquoted the most is the term trickle down economics. Trickle down economics is not an actual economic philosophy. It is caricature that liberals attack to make conservative (and former liberal) economic policies look foolish and unfair to the common man. 

The idea that the government should give resource A (for instance money) to group A, in hopes that it might trickle down to group B is ridiculous. Any rational person would just give resource A to group B directly and cut out the middleman. 

Which brings us to the conservative argument. The argument is that there is a point where taxes can be so high that they actually decrease tax revenue. Here are some famous people making this same argument. 

In a 1962 address to Congress, John F. Kennedy said, ‚Äúit is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.‚Äù

In his 1919 address to Congress, Woodrow Wilson warned that, at some point, ‚Äúhigh rates of income and profits taxes discourage energy, remove the incentive to new enterprise, encourage extravagant expenditures, and produce industrial stagnation with consequent unemployment and other attendant evils.‚Äù

John Maynard Keynes: ‚Äútaxation may be so high as to defeat its object,‚Äù that in the long run, a reduction of the tax rate ‚Äúwill run a better chance, than an increase, of balancing the budget.‚Äù

Now you might be saying, that doesn't make any sense. Rich people have almost all of the wealth in our country. They should pay their ""fair share"" (more). However, that isn't how rich people work. When you have a lot of money, you have the freedom to do different things. 

People in the top tax bracket don't want to pay high taxes. They can move themselves and their businesses and even their money offshore in order to not pay high American taxes. Rich people can invest in ""tax shelters"" which allow them to take losses from one economic enterprise and use them to offset their gains in others, reducing their taxable income. Furthermore rich people can afford tax lawyers and consultants who know the best ways to hide and invest income legally, so they don't have to pay as much tax. 

Now, how can we combat this. It is very simple. reduce the tax rates. Currently the top marginal tax rate is at nearly 40%. Donald Trump (for example) wants to reduce the top rate to 25%. (He believes that this will make most tax loopholes obsolete as well). If the top marginal tax rate was only 25%, it would not be WORTH IT to rich people to move to a different country, or invest in tax shelters, or to hire tax consultants and lawyer, or to invest in tax free bonds and such that don't allow them to use their money now. It wouldn't be worth saving that 25 cents on every dollar they earn. This means that tax revenue would go up, because more rich people would be paying taxes on a higher percent of their income. Which would actually be a huge boost for our tax revenue considering the top 1% already pay 50 percent of federal income taxes

Now, a lot of you might say something like: 

George W Bush cut taxes in 2001 and that got us into huge deficits. And same with Reagan! 

Or 

Kansas cut taxes and they now have huge deficits! 

Let me dispel these myths. 

First off, tax cuts are not an economic panacea. Nothing is. Cutting tax rates will not create a surplus or immediately boost an economy. They will however, attract rich people and businesses into the country who will pay taxes and hire people who will pay taxes. Creating a business plan or moving to a country take time. This means that the benefits of cutting taxes take 1-2 years to take full effect. Let's look at George W. Bush's tax cuts first. Bush reduced the top marginal rate from 39.6 percent (what it is now) down to 25% over a period of small tax cuts. This was a 10 year plan, so people and businesses knew that these cuts would last for a long time. Which is important, because if people think the tax cuts will be reversed, they won't come (see kansas) 

Now if you go here and to page 411 

https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ERP_2012_Complete.pdf


You can see our tax revenue actually GOES UP from years 2003-2007. Directly supporting the evidence that tax cuts increase tax revenue. In 2008, the housing bust happened, which is an entirely different topic, but that is what causing our tax revenue to fall in 2008. If we didn't have that economic catastrophe, I believe that we would have continued to see increases in our tax revenue. 

Now as for Kansas, yes they have massive deficits, but it is their own fault. Not only did they re-raise their income taxes a bit after cutting them drastically (scares away business from coming because they don't know if that will happen again), but they also raised their sales tax a lot as well. Furthermore, like Bush, they also didn't reduce spending as well. If you want tax cuts to be successful, you must reduce spending and stick with them. Business will not come overnight. It takes a year or two.",finance,1459039676

personalfinance,Finally Rid of My Unsecured Private Student Loans (via unconventional means - long story included),"It's been a long and a credit painful 7 years, but got confirmation earlier that I no longer have any more private student loans. And I did it without paying a single fucking penny to Sallie Mae and those fuckers (or declaring bankruptcy). WOOOOHOOO! But I survived and made it through! 

**Background:**

I graduated high school in 2006 and went to a private university, over a two year period at university I incurred a lot of private unsecured debt (about $65k). 

I dropped out of college due to a lack of satisfaction about what I was learning and what I wanted to learn. I ended up working for a real shitty employer from March of 2008 to November of 2010 at minimum wage. I've been working for a great employer since November of 2010. 

**What unconventional means am I talking about?:**  

My case is a prime example of luck, timing, how knowledge is power, and just having the fortitude to not care about debt collectors  harassing you. 

In my state Oregon, there is a statute of limitations on all kinds of debt (in fact all States do). In Oregon, it happens to be six years across the board. A couple things about statute of limitations:

* The clock starts the moment the debt becomes past due
* Any kind of payment on that debt resets the clock
* You can still be sued by the lender during the time period (until the statute of limitations takes effect) 

[Find your State here](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-29941.html)

Regardless of the statute of limitations in your State, derogatory remarks can only stay on your credit report for 7 years. After that they get removed and your credit score goes up.  Its important to understand the difference here. 

When the statute of limitations is reached in your State for that kind of debt  - the lender can no longer legally sue you in court. Although they will certainly still send you mail and call you. 

When I dropped out of college in December of 2007, the six month grace period to pay back my student loans started. Well I was in no position to pay those back ($600/month) so I did a strategic default.  I officially defaulted on all my student loans (federal and private) in August of 2008. It was during this time that we had the financial crisis when everyone and their uncle was defaulting on some kind of debt. 

About 6 months after defaulting, the debt collectors started calling and mailing me incessantly. It helped that I was working graveyard so when they‚Äôd call,  my phone was on silent as I was in bed. Every so often a new debt collector would buy the debt and the process would start itself over. It got to a point  where I had no idea who had what private unsecured student loan. I think I've gotten debt collection calls and mail from a total of 25 companies over the duration. 

(this is when I learned just how badly the system is rigged against people in debt who default). 

Once you default, and it goes to collections - the collectors charge a 30% fee on the total debt owed. So your $30k of private student loan now has just become $40k. That 30% fee alone was even more incentive to not pay back my private student loans. 

In 2010, some of the lenders - once it became clear that I had no intentions of paying the debt back no matter how many times they called or mailed me statements - just ended up writing the debt off. But was still being reported on my credit report as derogatory. 

**My theory as to why I did not get sued:** 

These are unsecured private student loans that originated between 2006 and 2007 when banks were giving money to people left and right. Also, I got these loans with no cosigners and given that these are private unsecured loans,  lenders are not able to garnish my wages or take tax refunds.  Also, by working at a minimum wage job the first few years I defaulted ensured I had no assets for them to sue me for. And the one major asset I do have, they are not legally allowed to go after (my 401k). 

Keep in mind that private unsecured student loans are totally different than Federal loans. With Federal loans - they can garnish your wages, take your tax refund, etc. 

So given the laws around lenders not being able to garnish my ages or take my tax refund on the private unsecured student loans and given that I had no assets to sue for, no cosigners to go after, and I had no  intentions to make a payment on my student loans - the lenders really had no other recourse but to write these loans off. 

**My Federal loans:** 

In 2012 I started getting notices from the US Treasury about my federal loans that I still hadn‚Äôt paid on - these were serious notices about wage garnishment, tax refunds being taken, denial of social security, and medicare, etc. Given the nature of the notices and the threats, I ended up going through a 9 month  loan rehabilitation program. By the time I went through that program, my federal debt had ballooned from $8k to $15k (due to interest and collection fees). 

To this day, I am still making payments on my federal student loans (about half paid off in the last four years). I hope to have them paid off by 2020. I tried consolidating my Federal loans in 2014 to get a lower interest rate, but when all your Federal loans are at 6.7% and the new interest rate is an average of your loans  - not much good consolidating will do. Just a side note here, the interest on my Federal student loans is higher than the interest on 15k  my car loan which is 4.2%. (try and figure that out)

**Today**

All student loans are now backed by the Federal government (has been since 2010) so most students can no longer get unsecured private student loans like what I got. Also, lenders have been more strict on who they loan money to now. Student loans still cannot be discharged in bankruptcy (seems to be actually getting harder to do this than before). 

So it‚Äôs unlikely that anyone would be able to replicate what I did here given the changes in federal laws (nor would I encourage anyone to try and do what I did). I really think I just had luck, timing - coupled with my knowledge of laws and fortitude to ignore collectors. 

I don‚Äôt have any intentions of ever doing something like this again, I now have a decent credit score and I am looking to buy a house in the not too distant future. 

**Going forward**

I am thinking about contacting an attorney to send a cease and desist letter to Sallie Mae/Navient who is still the only lender who seems to think they can still get a payment out of me - never mind the statute of limitations has passed and their loan is now off my credit report. 

**Sallie Mae**

Now I think there is a special place in hell (if it exists) reserved for Sallie Mae, they pulled all the tricks out of the book to get me to make a payment on their loan. They tried this one particular method twice, it involves  sending a letter about a class action lawsuit against them and how you could participate - but when you read the fine print - any money received from the lawsuit would be applied to the past due amount (which restarts the clock on the statute of limitations).  And I don‚Äôt know about you, but $6 payment from a class action lawsuit is a lot less than $40k. 

Another ploy they used, a nasty letter was sent to me  from some law firm about the same time the statute of limitations was set to go into effect. But I called their bluff because I knew they had no assets to sue for and wouldn‚Äôt get anything from me. Intimidation and threatening letters does not faze me.

In terms of debt, we only have student loans.

Federal: 45000@ 3.5%. We're on IBR and pay 200 dollars per month (we could pay less but I wanted to actually try and make a dent).
Family: 20,000 @ 0.%. We pay 400 dollars per month on this.

Our current budget looks like:

Rent: 500
Utilities:150
Food: 500 
Medical:100
Misc:100
Loans: 600 
Insurance:100

We spent about 2,500 and bring in about 3.500.  My husband's salary fluctuates depending on his current job (he works in research and seasonal positions).

Our income will be changing in about six months when I go back to school, where we will make about 3000 per month. Some other costs will decrease (insurance and medical and transportation will all decrease thank goodness, my job is awesome but the benefits are dreadful). 

We have about 5000 in an emergency fund.

We have been wanting to purchase a house and are thinking of putting the money towards a downpayment, but a relative thinks we should pay towards the federal student loans in order to bring them down further.  We were told it was irresponsible to become home owners while we still have student loans. Honestly, I sort of agree with this relative- should we really take on more debt? But then I'm also hearing that this could be a way for us to get a bit ahead and spend some time really building up equity.  We spoke to a mortgage officer and qualify for about 175,000 for a mortgage at 3.5%. We both have credit scores in the high 700s. (We worked on this because neither of us really had anything but student loans, so we took out a car loan and paid it back, got an active credit card that we pay off monthly, etc.)

On the radio and they don't finance you they find a bank or credit union to help you which is awesome and I'm thankful for that. But I was pressured into 3 cars and only 3 cars for 10k and I mean literally the 10k and 2 cars didn't even come with a warranty (pretty much the whole reason I went to a dealership) I took into consideration that I know the Audi 1.8t  is fancy and known for being a piece of junk tho. And it had 68k miles which isn't much but we all know it's a turbo car and a guy got it when he got back from the military and he probably dogged it and it had no warranty so that wasn't a smart decision because they are expensive to fix. The other car with no warranty was a Pontiac gran prix gtp with right at 100k miles and that's a bad idea even tho the guy had no back story on this car. So I got in this dodge caliber drove it just like the others. It wasn't the best and I wasn't impressed but it had cruise and the premium audio! **WOOOOOO** big deal I was looking more for a warranty and smart decision for gas mileage and being a teenager that's not what most would do....I was never told by the credit union or bank I could go elsewhere with this check and this dealership took complete advantage of that fact(the car salesman was in the room when I was getting the loan)



my motor spun a bearing luckily it was 1000 miles till my warranty was up. 3 year 36k mile warranty. So I literally got what I paid for because the motor was half rebuilt by a shady dealership but they are the only people aloud to do the work around here for the warranty to be vaible. (Replaced the bottom end of my motor for $200) it was 2.8k for the bottom end of my motor and 3.2k labor. Luckily that's not my problem. I fixed other random parts that cost me around 2.8k in Credit card debt but oh well that's another story(Warranty didn't cover).

Now I have great credit which is awesome but I can't get a car I want now because I'm so upside down and the dealer i want to go to only wants to give me 2k for my trade in and I can't do it. Then the 23k car I want becomes 28k and I can't afford that I can however afford the 23k.

Unfortunately, I ended up developing some really serious health issues that have lead to a horrible downward spiral of me becoming too disabled to continue with my education, having to leave my job, not being able to afford my apartment, and obviously no longer following the financial timeline that would have allowed me to purchase my car at the end of my lease. The issue is, I *need* a vehicle--and I need one that is going to be reliable. I have very frequent doctors appointments in multiple cities and will be starting physical therapy soon as well. I don't live in an area that has public transportation and wouldn't have the capabilities to really utilize them anyways because of my health. I hate, hate, *hate* not being able to do things on my own, but I've had to move in with my boyfriend to save money and am relying on about $250 of financial support each month from my mom for food, gas, and copays for doctors appointments. When I called to find out what to expect at the end of my lease, they said that i would still owe about $14,500 on my car and could expect payments of $276 a month for 60 months with 5.5% interest and that just seems outrageous to me!

personalfinance,First time home buyer considerations,"Hello,

I am just looking for some preliminary insight into the plans my fiance and I have with regards to purchasing our first home planned for about 1 year (or a little longer) from now. We are trying to make this a long term effort and have some elements to consider. Any insight into expected costs (outside of the norm), and expected home costs we could expect would be useful. We plan to meet with someone regarding this at some point, but thought I could start a conversation here to get some early insight. 

I admit, we're not the most savvy when it comes to major purchases. I bought my car and that is about it. One thing we know is that from renting previous places, the cost required doesn't seem to match the satisfaction of having to deal with a landlord, assorted home issues that we can't really resolve (just get ""patched"" by the landlord), and of course having to leave the house at the end of the term. 

Right now, we are both gainfully employed. I'm happy with my current career trajectory as I moved out of minimum wage jobs and just a few days ago signed a contract to be moving from my contracting position at a large corporation into a real, full time job with them. I accepted a higher salary, better benefit, etc. so earning and saving potential is better at this time. She has been well employed for a few years now with a design firm. To give some numbers, my salary will be $43k and hers is around $35k. I am trying to make sense of this long term home purchasing goal with these figures in mind. 

From some initial browsing on sites like Trulia which give an estimate on the monthly cost of housing (minus utilities), we seem set on the idea of shooting to purchase a house around $180,000. We don't have a hard number in this regard, and certainly it would be dependent on what we could get in terms of a mortgage. We intend to be able to put down a full 20% (through saving over the past few years we have about ~16k currently and put away a good chunk every month). I'm not sure if we should consider even going above the 20%? 

In terms of current expenses, mine are very minimal. I have 2 student loans left. I have been focusing on paying off the higher interest one quickly (4.5%) and have reduced this to $900. The other loan is $3,500. My car loan has about $6,500 left (unfortunately I can't recall the interest rate on this). I paid off my credit card debt and currently have no other overwhelming payments (we live at her mother's house without rent, instead fixing up the house for resale). My credit score is pretty good (780). 

She has more expenses so I imagine should not be factored into the home purchase. I'm not sure to what extent this will impact our ability to buy (if at all). I believe she has student loan debt between 10-15k. This is the primary source of debt, as everything else is controlled (ie: 1k on credit card with a timeline to pay off). 

I feel like we're on the right track here, but again don't know a whole lot about what I am really doing. I am just sort of winging it. Any insight or thoughts on this plan would be useful. It's again a long term goal but one we very much want to achieve with as much ease as possible.",finance,1459081547
personalfinance,How much house can I afford?,"Sorry if this is not relevant, I tried a search and couldn't find anything that quite answered my question. If you have a link to a good calculator for this sort of thing, please share!

A little background: 
Husband and I live in New England where real estate and property taxes are generally expensive. We are selling our current home and hope to walk away with 40k after closing costs. We have a combined 65k in general savings, plus retirement accounts (that we really don't want to touch). My in-laws have stressed that they really want to help us buy the next home. 

We want something that we can live in for the next 20-30 years. He works in IT and I'm a teacher. We have a combined income of about 160k. He puts 10-15% in his 401k and I have a teacher pension plus I contribute about 4k per year to a Roth. We have no credit card debt, our cars are paid off, and no other significant monthly expenses. We have a baby on the way, so will have to consider the costs of daycare (around 1200 per month around here).

We were thinking of searching for homes in the 300k-425k range. Those homes typically have real estate taxes of between 6k and 10k per year. While this is a lot more than our current home, it feels doable given our current financial situation, but a bit scary to think about because we're in our late 20s and that's a lot of money!

personalfinance,Pay off 2nd mortgage or child's college prepaid?,"We have 2 fixed mortgages.

economy,Economists name the Fed‚Äôs biggest interest-rate hawks,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) ‚Äî Several Federal Reserve speakers have this week agitated for interest rates to move higher sooner rather than later, confusing some market watchers.

After all, the Fed‚Äôs latest policy statement ‚Äî and Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen‚Äôs accompanying news conference ‚Äî was widely seen as signaling that the U.S. central bank is in no hurry to raise rates.

It turns out the hawks were first to the microphone after the March 15-16 meeting.

In December, the Fed increased its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nine years. At the time, a majority of members said they wanted four more hikes in 2016.

After the Fed‚Äôs meeting last week, a 10-member majority said they foresaw just one or two.

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Question,"My husband and I have accrued a good amount of credit card debt since I became a SAHM. I currently have 2 CCs. 1 that has no balance that I rarely, if ever, use (Pier 1). The other is through Navy Federal that has 9K out of a 11,5K limit on it. My husband has 2 CCs also. 1 through USAA that has 1,7K on it with a 3,5K limit and 1 for Navy Federal that has 11K on it with a 12K limit. 

Due to reenlisting (military) we were promised a bonus that would be big enough to get us 100% out of CC debt. Although that was back in November and we have yet to see the money nor do we know when to expect it. Our questions are:

* Should we pay off all debt in one lump sum?

* Should we make larger payments on the CCs over months to allow our credit to improve?

* Should my husband open *another* credit card and not use it solely to up his limit so his usage-to-limit ratio will increase, thus increasing (hopefully) his credit score?


Our credit scores are fair (mid 600's). Mine used to be much higher but throughout our house buying process, a large amount went on my CC due to inspections and closing costs that the sellers would not cover. Our goal is to improve our credit scores back to at least the 700's. We're never late on payments and have stopped using our CCs due to our credit and the CC limits. We have been paying each payment on time with a little more than the minimum if we can afford it.

Recently I accepted a new job offer that is paying me more than I expected. I have a ton of student loans and I just want to be set up for the future with my fianc√©.

My credit score is complete crap at ~600 due to my past and I want to get this up ASAP really. I also have 0 in savings and tend to live paycheck to paycheck. 

Below is my monthly monies:

Discover Student Loan : $3k @ 6% ; $60/month

Credit Card 4 : $750 @ 0% ; $25/month

Car : $350/month
Car Insurance : $150/month

Loan for camera : $250/month (ending the end of the year)

That's all my obligations. I'm also helping to pay my fianc√© credit card of about $300/month as well as putting about $200/month into our joint savings account.

personalfinance,37 y/o - Mortgage Question: ARM vs. buying down points on Fixed Rate,"Long story short. 

37 years old in October (relevant because of timeline). Single, no dependents, not necessarily looking hard for anything (relevant because of situation). 

Unfortunately I don't have a long enough credit history, or high enough credit limits, to have a fabulous credit score. Literally, my average of the 3 scores falls at 698, which is 2 points below the cutoff where FNMA guidelines mandate a 0.8% interest rate penalty. Which sucks ass, I know. And I really can't figure out why - my scores were higher a couple months back (in the 720s) and I don't have any missed payments. So it's frustrating, but it is what it is. 

So my bank has floated me a number of different options and I'm trying to puzzle out which is the best way to go. 

1. A 30 year fixed at 4.5%. I could opt for this and buy say 1 point to reduce it down to 3.5%. From a risk-perspective I think I'm most comfortable with this as I like the security of knowing what my rate will be, even if I won't be in the place for 30 years. 

2. A 10/1 ARM at 3.625% with a lifetime cap of 9.95% (no interim caps).

3. A 7/1 ARM at 3.35% with a lifetime cap of 9.95% (no interim caps). 

As I said, my natural inclination is to go for the fixed and pay down a point or so ($3,600) in order to lower the monthly payment down to the same level of the 10/1 ARM payment (which is really affordable to me), but I've been doing A LOT of reading and there's a school of thought that for younger people or people who aren't ""settled"" in their life situation that an ARM is a viable option (especially something with a 10 year lock) as their life situation will likely change significantly over that time period and you'll build more equity faster with the ARM. So that school of thought has me thinking ""hey, with a 10 year ARM I'll be 47 when it's done, my life could be significantly different at that point, whereas with a 30 year fixed I'm basically saying that I could have this place paid off completely before/at retirement.""

I'm 34 years old and two years ago started a high paying job that allowed me to start saving and no longer live paycheck to paycheck.

I have too much debt.  I am using the avalanche method to take it down by highest interest rate first.  
I am borrowing the money to do this from my savings.   Does this seem sensible?

I recently had a 3K expense on my car  followed by another 2K expense on my car, which took my little savings and credit paying plan and left me without enough money to pay my rent so I had to put it on my Discover card.  I need to dig out of this.  Step one is I don't use my credit cards except for those last 2 expenses and haven't for a few months.  

Debt:
Visa 2614 @ 24.9%; 4000 @0.0%
Discover 8000 @ 16%; 1000 @18%; 8000 @5%

Savings:
Money Market 200 at 0.1% (regions bank)
Money Market 700 at 0.8% (discover bank)
Savings 2000 at 0.95% (discover bank)

I also have a Roth IRA and a 401K that I am not touching.  

My plan HAD been to pay the lowest balances first but since I have interest rates all over the place, I'm switching to paying down the highest rate first.  So, Visa 24.9, then Discover 18, etc.

But to do this, I want to make a dent quickly, so after my 679 rent, I have about 800 left ""extra"" to pay with.  471 of that goes automatically to the loan, so that leaves 400.  I feel like I should dip into my savings to make that sum bigger each month, and maybe even stop saving for now (I save about 400 a month between the 3 accounts).  

Does that plan make sense?  I feel like I just need on big consolidation loan, but the lowest offers I'm getting in the mail are like 11% and I just don't think that's gonna be worth it.  Am I wrong about that?

I was quickly promoted to manager and was able to save a little money, pay my rent/bills, eat out occasionally, and even travel.

Because I am not legally emancipated from my parents (I love them, we get along great - I became financially independent for personal reasons), I have to record their tax information in my federal and state aid for tuition. They make a lot of money and this means I basically get no aid. 

While it is difficult, I have been able to pay my tuition, rent, and bills and live like a normal person (going out less and eating in mostly).

personalfinance,Refi Student Loans,"Hello PF,

I'm curious if anyone has suggestions for my situation. I currently pay for school cash, but before I could do that I took out loans. I have about $18k in debt with a rate of about 6.5% (I Think). My plan is to take the money I was budgeting for paying school cash and just apply that to the loans (about $700/mo). At this rate it would take me about 27 months and $1,400 of interest. I'm interested in ways to 'refi' my loan into a lower rate. For example, if I got a 3% rate I could pay it off in 26 months with about $600 in interest. 


I've done some digging and found sites like CommonBond.co and Sofi.com which have rates in this range. I'm not sure yet if they charge origination fees or not. My question is has anyone used a service like this? I also have a great credit score and should be able to qualify for their better rates.


I'm also interested if anyone knows of a crowdsource loan tool that I could use. I feel that I may be able to get my loan 'funded' if I offered a 3% return for 26 months as it would be a good deal for a group of people currently earning 1% on their money. I'm thinking something like Ledge, but longer terms and higher amounts. 



Also to note, All my loans are federal and a mix of sub and un-sub. I plan to take advantage of the 6 months grace period and did a fed considlation after I stopped taking out loans. I also am aware of the income base repayment and hardship benefits they have, but I'm not concerned about losing these benefits as we have savings, passive income, job stability and live below our means. I'm simply fishing for ideas to save $700-$1000 in interest over the next couple years. The only part I have not calculated is the tax benefit on fed interest, but I don't think i'll get past the standard deduction anyway.

personalfinance,"In a bind with going back to school, could use advice","Hey, PF. Long time listener, first time caller. ITT you'll find the details of how I fucked up my college education by not knowing how anything relating to student loans work.

I originally started college in 2013. Due to medical issues (and honestly, the 2hr metropolitan commute being too much on my fatigued body) my doctor encouraged me to withdraw and take a semester off during the beginning of my sophomore year. This led to a semester + summer of being prodded and poked, followed by a year of nearly full time retail work split between two different jobs while I figured out what I wanted to pursue in college.

At first, I thought the only issue was that because I was so out of it, three of those six classes were INC and followed up with Fs (and I do intend to retake these courses when I return), as I missed the cutoff date for withdrawals. What I didn't know was that there was a form missing or lost when processing my federal loan from my third semester- the one I withdrew from. My school is horrendous with everything administrative, and would normally receive the funds from government loans the last day of the semester, but I truly wasn't aware that I owed them that bill until this year. The federal loan's servicer had my mother as all contact information, and she wasn't aware they were my true servicer as she was bombarded by other services claiming to be mine via junk mail. She also never attended college and is not the brightest bulb in the pack, bless her heart. I finally got a hold of that loan to find it delinquent, and now owe them $500 out of the $3100 borrowed in repayment and late fees. On top of that, I still owe my college somewhere between 3.2-3.4k for the semester that wasn't covered under any loans.

So now here I am, unemployed but actively searching for any job I can get my hands on (preferably full time retail or administrative to save money- but let's be real- I'll take anything), being in repayment with backpay on my first student loan, and owing my college a semester's worth of tuition. 

I have absolutely no one to cosign for a student loan as my parents have awful credit. AFAIK I don't qualify for any private student loans because I can't be enrolled until I pay the past bill. I'm now unable to get any more federal loans as my other one isn't current and because I'm deemed to not be making SAP. Can it be deferred if I potentially resume classes this summer on my own dime to regain SAP?

Is my only option to wait potentially another year and a half until I can go back to allow me to save up ~$7k? Best case scenario is that I give a sales pitch to my grandparents to give me a personal loan with interest of the past tuition's balance + summer classes (essentially one year's worth of tuition) to get me back on federal loans. I just don't know what my options are- is there a type of student loan that can help you back pay? Am I stuck working on my credit and taking out a personal loan for college for a year?

 - $10,000 signing bonus paid within 1 month of joining
 - $3,000 stipend for housing

 - 5 credit cards with a total of $4,400 CL, all paid in full every month, no debt
 - Yearly college expenditure amounting to $60k including housing, tuition, food, etc. I am an international student. My parents help me pay for college, so I thus far have not had to take any loans.
 - Additional expenditure of +/- $2,000 on flights to go home over long breaks.
 -  I make about $2,500 (with some state and fed tax witheld already) from on-campus work during each of my semesters over and above the internship during the summer.

 - No student loans as of now.
 - About $1,000 in savings.

I would ideally like to save as much of this money as possible, while also investing in a reliable car that I can use for the remainder of my college years at the very least. I've been told Hondas and Toyotas are relatively reliable and cheaper to maintain than European cars, and am leaning towards a Civic.

Some questions:

 1. What would be the best way to manage my income? I feel like I'm in a fairly good place to start, with no debt, though my savings are somewhat minimal at the moment.
 2. Should I buy a car through financing, or pay in cash outright? My credit score is decent (~720 on Credit Karma), but the length is limited as I only came to this country last August.
 3. Should I be doing something additional to all this to maximise my savings?
 4. Should I be investing the money I get, or just stick it in a savings account? I am not eligible for my company's Roth IRA or 401k due to being &lt;21 + international.",finance,1459156504

**Here's the basic idea:** http://puu.sh/nWNLB/9ca96dba1a.png

I'll be using the SOCKER plant stand as a base, just to make it simple to move around and have a cheap and effective base

http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70285820/

My idea would then be to have about 3 or 4 rows of plants which are fed water through holes each other's plant pots. I'd use the SOCKER plant pot for these http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90285824/  and I will drill holes in the bottoms and have tubing going to each plant below.

I will fill the pots with clay marbles.

At the bottom will be a nutrient reservoir which is fed to a pump. The pump has a variable throughput so I can fine-tune the water cycling as my plants grow etc. The pump also have a filter to prevent crap from going through the system and clogging the tubes and  pump itself.

I will also have a digital timer on this pump so that I can stop pumping at night and control an interval. This will depend but probably 15 minutes every 1 hour for watering.

---------

Some concerns:

Will gravity and randomness take care of the critical stage of properly distributing the water? I'm thinking of using connectors like these http://puu.sh/nWNZT/78c4f3db92.jpg  at the top where the water is split into 3 places for the plants. I will have to align them very straight of course, which I will do by fastening them securely to the construction.

I'll be using black tubing for the water. Will this prevent algae production?",energy,1459162846

personalfinance,Modest inheritance coming over the next 6 months. What to do with it?,"Hi, a family member's death has created a windfall and I hope to make their gift go as far as possible. I'm pretty careful with my money, but the size of the windfall is pretty significant compared to the assets I have.

Me/my assets:

* 25 y/o, 65k annual salary.
* 15k savings, 20k in 401k from previous job (no active contributions)
* Rental duplex valued at 241k, net income of $600/mo.

My debts:

* $200k mortgage on rental duplex, 3.75% interest
* $40,000 owed on vehicle @ 5% interest, used for Uber Luxury service (side business).
* $14,000 left on federal student loans, composite interest ~5%

The windfall:

* $60,000 in immediate life insurance money.
* 1/3 of a house, which will net about $180,000 when sold
* somewhere between 50k and 100k assets that are currently locked up in investments.

So basically I will have 60k cash within a few weeks to months, another 40-60k in 6-12 months when the house is fixed up and sold, and 50-100k in various brokerage accounts that due to estate rules won't be immediately available, but can be invested differently or kept as they are.

I'm thinking it's pretty obvious to just zero out the student loans, but I'm more hesitant to just pay off the car note because I can carry so much in deductions for the vehicle, including loan interest and depreciation, so I could make that 40k go much further.

I was patient in my job search and had a few places I really wanted to work. I got one of those jobs but it took me about 4 months to go through the process, where I predominantly used credit cards to fund my lifestyle. Job pays $105K ($90 base and $25 bonus) and I am 31.


My loans were set to start in December but that was the first month of employment. I deferred to have a few months to pay down my credit card debt from grad school and post. Credit cards were about $10K. I paid one off, should have another one paid off by April 15 and the third has no interest until November. Loan payment was scheduled to be $740 per month.


Payments start in May so I logged in to check and prepare a budget for when that begins. When I logged in, payments went up to $1330. This makes budgeting much tougher. I cna afford it but the extra $600 was going to emergency fund, credit card bills, and then long term savings for a house and car.


I know there are options through Navient but I am not sure what to choose. All of the interest rates are in the 5.9 - 7.3% range. Options are:
- Pay as You Go
- Revised Pay as You Go
- Income Contingent
- Graduated Repayment
- Extended Repayment

financialindependence,House Sitting instead of Renting,"Currently, all of my material things are stuffed into my car. I just moved out of my house in San Francisco where I was able to achieve a 50% SR. I‚Äôm moving to San Diego, so I‚Äôm thinking I should be able to significantly increase my SR. 

While considering how nice it will be to pay less rent, I couldn‚Äôt help but consider the fact that paying $0 rent would be even better. After thinking about this for awhile, house sitting came to mind. My fantasy is to jump from housesit to housesit, basically living for free, while working from the house that I‚Äôm watching. I'm fine with watching pets/putting chlorine in the pool/whatever. I have a unique work situation that I think will allow me to achieve this, if there are enough house-sitting jobs in my area. 

The reason I think I‚Äôll be able to pull off jumping from housesit to housesit instead of paying rent is mostly the job I have. I‚Äôm on the road around 4 months of the year for work, so I won‚Äôt have to worry about living situations then.  The rest of the year, I work from home. I just need my laptop and an internet connection to do my job.

SO, after some basic googling, I‚Äôve found 5 or 6 legitimate websites that connect house-sitters with houses that need to be sat. Each website has an annual subscription fee, ranging from $20 to $100. Right now I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll just sign up for all of these websites, take the hit, and try to find lodging until my tradeshow season in mid June. I really don‚Äôt have an idea of the availability of houses to sit in the San Diego area, and I can‚Äôt see the majority of the posts unless I‚Äôm paying the website. Before I sign up for these websites, I was wondering if anyone had any experience doing this kind of thing.

Also, if there are a couple of days in between sits, I have friends in the city that I can stay with. Small gaps in house sitting gigs shouldn't be a big deal.

I currently owe 188K on the mortgage. I charge rent of $1750 a month but my mortgage is $1850 (my flood insurance went up a few months back as it's very close to the water). I'm cash flow negative now but wasn't before my escrow went up. I'm 3 years into a 20 year mortgage at 3.625 however I pay PMI of about 91 a month. The principal is reduced about $670 a month.

The current renters have been there for 2.5 years and their lease is up this summer. The renters don't bother me much and they pay on time although they do annoying things like park on the grass at times and did some damage to a bathroom wall which I fixed. Overall they keep the house in pretty good shape though.

About me: I live about 3 hours away now, I own my primary residence, contribute to my 401K and have a secure job with the federal govt making ~135K a year. I'm in my late 30s.

I can see these renters wanting to stay for years. I'm trying to figure out whether to keep renting to them and eating the $100 a month (I would raise the rent if they want to stay) or just sell it and cut my losses. The house will probably sit on the market for months but I have savings to cover that. It was flooded during Hurricane Sandy so buyers are weary of that neighborhood. I've never planned on being a landlord this long and had family helping me early on but because of medical issues they no longer can.

personalfinance,How many/much of student loans to accept for MBA program??,"Hey All - This is my first post!! :-)


        I am starting a 2 year MBA program in the Summer (May) and I am wondering if I should accept a Unsubsidized Federal Student Loan each semester for only the amount I need to cover tuition (~$5,640/semester), OR take out the max awarded Unsubsidized Federal Student loan for the first 3 or 4 semesters to cover tuition for the entire program(~$10k-$12k/semester)?


        The program is 48 credits ($705/credit - fixed rate) and will cost about $34,000 for the entire program (6 semesters).


        My thought logic right now is to do the second method and take out max loans for 3 or 4 semesters of financial aid to get to $34k in total loans and use the funds to pay for each semester to finally end up having 3 or 4 student loan payments at the end of the program. Initially I think that this would be better than having 6 smaller student loan payments after graduation if I took the minimum needed student loan for all 6 semesters.


        My thought is that 3 or 4 seperate payments is cheaper and interest efficient than having 6 seperate smaller payments.


        Ideally, if things workout, my company would reimburse me $5,250 per calendar year (after tax) and I would be able to pay off about $10k-$15k with company tuition reimbursement.


        I plan to make monthly payments to pay these off starting in the first semester and pay $300 per month when I start, since they are unsubsidized. Upond graduation, then I would go with which ever payment plan is available for the remainder (likely do the Standard plan since its the least interest overrall)


        Can you help provide feedback on what options will be better in the long run??

I've got a question about long term capital gains tax. 

I have $12,000 in a mutual fund with Fidelity and would like to move $11,000 to a Roth IRA (contributing to 2015 and 2016). This year I'll be making $36,500 and will be claiming the standard deduction and myself as an exemption when it comes to filing for taxes at the end of 2016. 

Am I correct in understanding that the sale of $11,000 of my mutual fund will bring me to $47,500 taxable income, and the standard deduction ($6000) and exemption ($4000) will reduce my taxable income to $37,500? Furthermore, as my AGI is below the level for taxation on long term capital gains, I will pay 0% federal tax on the gains from the sale of my mutual fund? I originally thought I would need to offset the income from the sale of my fund by contributing to my traditional 401k (to keep taxable income below $37,500), but I'm hoping this will work. 

I just wanted to run this by some people before committing to it since I don't want to end up surprised with taxes at the end of the year! Thanks for you help. 

Edit: I forgot about taking the cost basis into account for the sale of shares and it's looking like the sale of $11,000 would result in $7,300 in taxable gains at current share prices. This would mean my AGI would be increased by $7,300 and not the full $11,000 putting me at $43,800 taxable income. As I currently understand it, with the standard deductions and exemptions, this should put me even further below (33k vs 37k) the limit for 0% federal tax on long term capital gains!",finance,1459202817

personalfinance,"Looking for advice/budget critique: should I pay $1,000 now to open a Vanguard IRA, or finish paying off my $18k student loans before I invest?","Hi PF, I am a lurker around here and finally decided I'd throw in my budget to have it critiqued. For a while now I have been going back and forth, fencesitting about if time vs. money will hurt me in terms of deciding to open an IRA or not. 

My current dilemma is such: I have around $18,000 in student loans right now and am on a fast track to pay them off in about 2 years exactly. I'm working a second job to achieve this. I'm a 25 year old who is worried that if I wait too long to open an IRA that I will be missing out on that sweet, sweet compound interest, but I also come from the Dave Ramsey school of thought that I should pay off ALL debts before I even think about investing. 

A few basic facts before I post my budget spreadsheet below:


* I have a small emergency fund set up. It's a little under two months' worth of pay (of just my primary 40 hour a week job's income). ~$4,000. 


* I am thinking of setting up an IRA with Vanguard, which requires a $1,000 deposit. 


* I have fully maxed out my 401k contributions at work and my employer matches up to $1,500 (I think). My income on the spreadsheet is take home, not pre-401k contributions. 


* As I said, I am 25, so I want to start early to maximize my investments. 


* My car payment is for a 3 year lease (very NOT Dave Ramsey of me, I know). I am highly considering buying used again when my lease is up. 


* Every two weeks, I go to the bank and take out roughly $200-240 in cash to use for those two weeks on basic necessities like food, and for longer term savings toward things like car repairs and medical co-pays. I use Dave Ramsey's envelope method, though I don't heed all of his advice (I'm kind of a hybrid between his 'snowball' philosophy toward debt and trying to do what I think is working.) 


* Any other questions, just ask.

[Here](http://imgur.com/cWC65CH) is a link to a spreadsheet (just a screenshot) I developed that lays out all my expenses, income, savings, and my timeline/debt for my student loans. I have four separate student loans. The smallest only has about $1,400 left in it and I think that's a 4% interest rate. The highest is 6%. 

So pretty much my question is: given my budget above, would it be wise to take $1,000 out of my savings NOW to deposit in a Vanguard IRA, and add back to my savings as I can to make up for it, or concentrate solely on attacking the $18,000 in debt, and then and ONLY then open an IRA in two years when it is paid off?

Will I be missing out on that much in 2-3 years of NOT having an IRA? Or because I'm young, should I open that IRA as soon as possible? 

I've talked to financial advisors and all sorts of people who have given me mixed answers, so I'm turning to you all. Thanks in advance for all the help!",finance,1459203432

I know it's possible to purchase a vehicle if our attorney files the necessary paperwork and the trustee approves of the amount involved - but here's where it sounds a little fishy to me...

Basically, our attorney gave us the name and number of ""a guy he works with"" at a local auto dealership in the area. This guy at the dealership tells us 1) all their cars (both new and used) are sold for the sticker price, no haggling needed and 2) If we want to work with him, we must purchase a vehicle from the dealership lot he works at.

This immediately raises some red flags with me. I feel like being limited to a single car lot could pose some serious problems both in terms of inventory/selection and in terms of us being ""trapped"". We wouldn't be able to negotiate on price apparently, and so I doubt the circumstances would be much better with regard to the interest rate we would be offered on any amount we choose to finance. I realize it's our own fault for being in the midst of a BK and I accept responsibility for that part of the equation (and what affect that has on the finance rates you get offered) but I feel like this could be piling on an additional bad decision for unseen or unknown-to-us reasons and I really don't want to make our financial situation any worse than it already is.

personalfinance,Making the best use of an already done hard pull for a loan,"I just got a Mazda6 recently, with Mazda financing (for ~20k$) since I got a nice rebate. I had also applied (and gotten a preapproved) loan from my local credit union. Unfortunately, the credit union requires me to do another credit pull after 90 days (apparently required by the Mazda dealer) to apply for refinancing, which I am trying my best to avoid.

Is there any way that I can refinance my Mazda finance within 90 days that the dealer mentioned? Is this 90-day limit a hard one?

Is there any way that I can best use the hard check that was already done on my account by the credit union, in case the refinance isn't possible within 90 days? I was thinking of taking a credit card from the credit union (uses my already pulled credit history) , but that may increase my interest rate considerably when I refinance after 90 days.

I have a good FICO score (760+) the last time I check, but I've had two credit pulls last week by Mazda and the credit union, so I am not quite sure how I stand at the moment.

personalfinance,Where can I get a student loan (besides the financial aid office)?,"Hello PF friends,

I am currently a student in an associates degree vocational program (Medical field, 2 year program, approximately 60K average salary once I graduate). I am about halfway done and so far I have managed to get by without any financial aid or debt. However, by now any savings I've had are pretty much gone and I find myself having to work more and more (and cut into my studies) in order to make ends meet. 

I would really like to take out a small loan just to cover my rent for the remaining months of the program while i'm still in school. I'm thinking a $5,000 loan will give me enough breathing room so that I will have more time to focus on my studies and spend less time worrying about paying my rent each month. I can still work a little bit to cover other living expenses.  

My issue here and question to you is this: My financial aid office refuses to offer me any assistance in getting a loan since I have too many credits. They won't even offer me any advice about where to go to get an outside loan. Are there any institutions that offer these sorts of loans at reasonable interest rates, or with deferred payments? Where is the best place to look? Is this actually a stupid idea? I just find that I spend so much time stressing over paying rent that it's really taking a toll on my education. I don't mind trading a bit of interest for some financial security right now.

personalfinance,"A little of everything- savings, loans, retirement","Hello PF! Long time lurker, first time poster. Please be kind. I have recently gone through a break up in which my SO was in a sense my financial guide. I learned a lot of basics and have come a long way. As much as I want to blow my paycheck on shopping, the better part of me knows I need to come up with a solid financial plan to carry me through the next few years.


Background. I am 24, went to instate schools for my Bachelors (took 3 years) and Masters (2.5 years). Parents helped me out a TON but still came out with debt (~60k) in December 2014. When I graduated I contemplated and was offered a job in a big city (with big rent) but SO/ parents advised me not to, so I moved back home (rent free- parents are the best. Yes I know I'm incredibly lucky). Found a great job with good benefits, unfortunately doesn't match my 401k. But $38/hr at 23 with no experience and great hours- no complaints. 


I make about 3500-4000 a month after taxes, depending on hours of the pay period. A month in spending 
1. 400-475 to parents for car, insurance, cell phone, small portion of utilities.
2. 1143 (double my minimum student loan payment, have paid more in the past)
3. Credit card- I put everything on this, about 125 gas, 250 food)
4. 230 gym/personal trainer- may seem frivolous but has/will save me a TON down the road in health care bills (now at a healthy weight and all good levels; also, monthly payment used to be 400)
5. With what was left I usually traveled within means or saved.


*Student Loans* I started with ~60 k in student loan debt. In the last year I have paid off 20k. I was messing with numbers on unbury.us and found that if I pay 2k a month (rather than the current 1143) I can be done around December 2017. I will be 26. I want this-bad.  I intend to start putting 2k/mo into my student loans starting in April. **Where should any extra savings go- should I start another savings account for things like my car maintenance? Travel? E fund? Retirement? Please read further before answering this** 


*Retirement*I have been putting 10% pretax in my company's 401k 2060 fund for about a year now. They do not match. I don't know much past this. **What more should I know?**
**Do I need to be working on an additional retirement account right now? I am thinking about changing jobs- how will my 401k be affected; do I need to move it over?**


*Savings* I have just now made it to 5k in an emergency savings account. It is 3 months of my minimum student loan amount, paying my bills, food, gas, but cancelling things like the gym membership. However I know if I was in dire financial burden, I could forego loan payments (because I'm far ahead) and with parental assistance my E fund would last me a year (I don't foresee this). This money is sitting in a credit union saving account. **Should I move it to another bank/account? Should I put some of it into a retirement account? IRAs?**


*Credit cards* I currently have a CC through my credit union which has a 5k limit. I do not carry a balance. I don't know the interest rate because I always pay it off. Rewards are okay. I have heard it is good to have 1+ credit card if possible. I checked my credit score for the first time ever today. It was 757. I have been researching credit cards and the Chase Sapphire is appealing and has good reviews. Since I travel a lot it may benefit me. I do not see myself doing crazy spending or being irresponsible. **Go for it or nah?**


*Car* I have a very reliable Honda that is 4 years old but going on 100k miles (damn you commute). I have no plans on selling it. However it is under my parents' names (they bought it brand new when I was in school- 6 year loan I believe). I just pay them the monthly payment and take it For regular maintenance. Since their credit is great I also think it has a good rate. **Is there any reason I should move the loan/title to my name and pay for it myself? Or should I just keep it under them?**They haven't asked me to change the situation but just curious. 


*Budgeting* I don't really have a set budget since I'm hourly and my paychecks can vary. I think I am doing well without one. The rigidity of a budget makes me nervous. I don't go out to eat/drink often, plan my meals, don't shop often. I also like to travel which can make my spending higher, but I always do it within reason (stay with people I know or cheap air bnb, cook, do free activities). **Is it really necessary to plan out every penny? Or am I ok with what I'm doing?**


My financial goals are to: pay down my student loans, have a good savings account (which I think I've done ok on both ends). One day I want to have  enough for a small house to rent out (I'm not one to ever want to settle), maybe some money for a wedding (if ever), college for children waaaay down the road, a comfortable retirement. In the more immediate future, I'd like to start a Ph.D. But want to be financially free from the first few years, then hopefully find a program that pays for itself.

personalfinance,Which home do you think would make the most financial sense and be the smartest purchase?,"Background:  28, single, looking to purchase my first home

Income: ~$140k/year; after maxing out 401k, my takehome paychecks are ~$6600 a month.


Zero debts.   


Currently renting - 1 bedroom 650 sq ft apartment for $1100 a month, everything included.   Lease will be up in the end of August.  Current apartment is crappy, but it's a 6-minute walk to work every day, and a 9-minute walk to nearby restaurants.


Credit card spending: ~$400-500 a month, mostly on food/eating out (since I hate cooking), and includes $40/month internet and $30/month phone bill.  Generating 5% on select rotating categories and 2% cash-back on everything else.


Savings account:  $50k, generating 1% interest with Ally.  Also have $5k in an IRA from 2 years ago.


So I'm thinking about purchasing a home, and I would like to buy something close to work, but also something economical and very-much worth its listed price tag.  The cheapest options that are close to or within the city, are obviously condos.


OPTION 1:


2 BED  2.5 BATH condo (2 floors! Split level with the half bath on the first floor for guests - a major plus!);  $190,000; 1131 sq ft;  HOA Fee: $715 per month; highrise building built in 1968


Location - not the most desirable, ~18 minute drive to work (and requires getting on the freeway, which likely has very heavy traffic in the morning and might cause the drive to take likely almost ~30 mins).   Across the street from the building is a mall within a 3-minute walk.  And though it's not the nicest mall, there is a wide selection of take-out places and shopping...


The point of considering this 2 BED 2.5 BATH condo is that I could rent out the second bedroom to someone to cover the high HOA fees and the property tax for me.  The obvious downside is that I'd have to share living space with someone, and given the area the condo is located in, I might not get the absolute best selection for a tenant/roommate... 


However, this option seems to make financial sense, since I'd be avoiding the HOA fees I pay every month, which don't add anything to equity.


OPTION 2:


1 BED 1 BATH condo; 875 sq ft  $200k (though I'd try to bargain it down to maybe $185k-$190k?);  HOA Fee: $508!!! : (


Location:  Much closer to work - ~9 minute drive.  Area is decent, and highrise building is newer (built in 1980).


The 1 BED alleviates any headaches of dealing with renting out a room to someone, but I don't generate any income to cover the absurdly high HOA fee.  I mean $508 a month for a 1-bedroom?  That seems ridiculous.


But on the plus side, it's in a nicer location, much closer to work, and within a 10-minute walk to some restaurants and shopping.


Of course, I'm still actively searching for the ideal combination of location, size, and price (and HOA fee cost), though for my situation, what would make the most financial sense?  


It's also worth noting that I had plans on paying off the mortgage in ~3 years.  Though according to Zillow, I can get a 15-year mortgage at 2.974% APR (2.875% interest rate), and a monthly payment of $1095 a month for the 1 BED 1 BATH apartment, and  similarly, I can get also get a 15-year mortgage for the 2 BED 2.5 BATH condo at 2.968% APR (2.875 interest rate) with a monthly payment of ~$1080 a month.   


I don't know which option I should go with, and which payment plan I should go with - the 3 year payoff plan or the 15-year mortgage plan.

personalfinance,Student Loan monthly payment was reduced...I am suspicious.,"Not that it's a bad thing. In general I like the option of paying a little less incase I'm particularly tight on funds some month. But I got a letter saying that my monthly payment had changed but doesn't give a specific reason. Some of the reasons I can instantly cross out, but there's a few suspect ones: 

Your repayment plan has changed - Not sure why that would be. I didn't request any changes.

Your interest rate has changed - It's a federal loan, so I don't think that would be the case.

Unpaid interest has been capitalized - Again...not sure why that would have happened. 

Due to past delinquency or late payments, the monthly payment amount was insufficient to pay off the loan within the remaining repayment period. - This one is a little scary, because this happened after I was a few weeks late with one payment. I thought I had paid, but must have missed a submit button. But I paid it within two weeks of it's due date, never got a penalty. And it seems weird that the payment would go down, rather than up. 

I don't have any accrued interest on the account, so I thought perhaps it was because the full accrued interest had been paid. But that isn't a listed reason. I thought maybe the accrued interest had been capitalized as a penalty, but, again, why would it go down?

Overall it doesn't seem like a bad thing, but I'm suspicious that something bad is happening under the hood. Since they're closed now, I'm asking here first to see if there's an obvious explanation. Otherwise I'll be calling them tomorrow. Thanks for any help.",finance,1459219014

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt with 0% APR vs Personal Loan with small APR: What's better?,"So I have some debt I racked up pretty stupidly and I'm working hard to get rid of it. Long story short I was promised a large lump sum raise if I worked three years below wage at a start up, sort of a ""we're all sacrificing together"" type of thing. When raise time came instead of a raise I was fired, along with some others, under the notion of the company not doing well and needing to restructure. I had been there the longest though, since nearly the start, and during those three years I racked up significant credit card debt (close to 50k) paying for a wedding, honeymoon, and a few other things that I stupidly thought would be no issue once I got my promised raise. 

I am currently talking with a lawyer to see what my options are to get any or all of the money I am owed (just so everyone knows that I am on top of that aspect of this), but in the meantime I'm acting like I'll never see the money again and I'm moving on. 

My question is this. What's the better option to go with when I have multiple credit cards where at any time about 50% of the debt is on two cards with 0% APR rates that last for another 12 months. The remaining money is at parked on a card accruing 12.99%. APR. I've always paid everything on time, either minimum payment or as much as I could afford to pay at the time, so I've never had issues with delinquency etc that could hurt me.

Im curious what some of you suggest I do to eliminate this debt and how this all effects my credit. 

Option 1: Do I start by trying to pay the 12.99% portion off as quickly as possible, then moving to the others? In my new job my base is 125k with another 25k commission uncapped where 160-170k is totally realistic. It would still take me a while, well over a year, but if I buckled down I could make a sizable dent in the total amount of debt within a year. 

Option 2: Do I shop for the lowest rate loan I can find and pay all of the cards off at once?

Or option 3: Do I leave the money on the cards with the 0% APR and take out a loan to pay off the money on cards that don't have the 0% APR?

Any help and guidance is appreciated. Ultimately I'd like to figure out what option available (listed above or not) helps me eliminate my debt with the least amount of damage to my wallet and credit.  

This is a long one and sort of convoluted, so thanks for getting this far and for any guidance you might be able to give.  

Thanks!

Reasons for this are I don't want another car payment, already own 2 vehicles that are fully paid off, am single with no kids, and my pay won't be as good when I return.  

I had saved up $9950, and my total debt between 2 credit cards and one installment loan is $11,100.  This breaks down to:

* $11,500 personal loan from a credit union @ 11.5% interest, currently 2 months ahead on payments and have $5,900 remaining on payoff.
* $6,800 limit card with $3,400 balance @ 17.9% interest, had this card for over 6 years now and when I first picked it up, my credit was terrible.  Card started with a $500 balance but interest rate has stayed flat.
* $4,100 limit store card with $1,900 balance @10.5% interest.

My plan is to kill the credit card debt first then chunk down as much of the loan possible, possibly paying it off in the next 3 months(Final loan payment is supposed to be in Oct 2017).

Currently, I am on income based repayment with a payment amount of $0 with recertification due in August.

However, I plan to pay $1700 a month from April to December of this year, and then pay $1500 for the next two years through 2018. My total expenses are $1900 and my take home is $3800 a month. I stick to my budget religiously and I have a 6 month efund saved and tucked away.

Am I right to pay only 5% into my retirement fund while I pay the student loans off? All of the money is allocated to a 2050 index fund. I only have about $6700 across all accounts, but I should have about $9,000 total by the end of the year. I also owe $19,300 on my car with a payoff date of 2021, but at 2% interest, there is no way in hell I am paying that off early.

I should have my loans paid off at 34 years old. Am I okay to contribute the minimum to my retirement until 2018 when I make the standard 15% contribution? A family member suggested that I do incremental increases of 1-2% annually while continuing to make student loan payments. I am just worried about my age and there not being enough time to build a decent nest egg.",finance,1459259536

personalfinance,Minimum Amount to Keep in Checking,"First of all, this sub has helped my wife and I tremendously to get on track. I have an extremely detailed budget spreadsheet that keeps track of of all our expenses on a monthly basis and then breaks the remainder down to a weekly budget to keep things on track in the short term.

Since switching to this method, the amount in our checking continuously grows since we are conservative with a lot of our values. For example, I get reimbursed gas at the Federal rate, which is more than spent. Our utilities are budgeted for the worst case, as our groceries and gasoline and anything else that may fluctuate.

I am struggling with a minimum amount to keep in our checking since this value gets bigger. I would like to keep the required amount (plus a buffer) in the account, but our paychecks don't align so it makes things difficult. I get paid every 2 weeks, my wife on the 1st and the 15th. Also, some values are paid weekly (groceries), monthly, bimonthly, or even yearly making it difficult to track.

Any guidelines or calculations to help me figure out how much to keep around? Most people seem to eyeball it on this sub, but I'd rather have some rationale behind it. Also, I'll be moving part of the money to savings and to buy bigger things that we want/need but don't always make it into the budget.

personalfinance,Emergency fund vs credit card debit.,"Just read the emergency fund post and reminded me to ask this.

My friend has an emergency fund with couple of grand in it and a fairly large credit card debit - More than the savings.

I've been trying to convince her to use her fund to pay off her credit card debit, with the benefit of losing the terrible savings account interest rate being offset by reducing the terrible interest rate the credit card is charging. 

Her argument is, ""I want it just in case."" I've try to negate this by saying in an emergency you could redraw on your credit card, effectivly just using it as a place to store your cash and savings money each month by doing so. But she won't budge. 

Aside from the fact I know this is her money and her decision what she does or doesn't do with it. But, I'm perplexed to why she won't do it. Am I explaining the benifits incorrectly and is there a better way to explain this to her, or have I totally missed something and it would be better for her to keep the money in the savings account?",finance,1459274385

Thoughts?


I am paying the loan back using money that has been taxed, so that 20-30% is gone regardless. The penalty for taking the money out is about 10%. Total penalty is 40% to not pay back and 30% for paying back.

First, I'm finishing my undergrad and have quite a bit of debt, and I'm about to enter my graduate degree. Good news is the graduate degree is totally paid for by a good scholarship!

Bad news is that I have a bit of debt, and I'm trying to figure out the best way/service to handle this.

$4,000 credit card debt between 2 cards (Wells Fargo Platinum -$3k and Barclaycard -$1k)

Questions:
1. My understanding is that I could just do it without reporting to the IRS or anybody?
2. There isn't any weird tax implication that I should be aware of? For example, they wouldn't be hit with a tax bill when they sell their investment in the future?
3. I would of course be the beneficiary should anything happen to them, I wouldn't be hit with inheritances/estate tax if the investment is under the state /federal amount that is exempt?
4. My mom is 60, and my understanding is that she can contribute as long as she has an income and there isn't an age limit for contributing?
5.  In your opinion, is there a better way or just another way (in addition to contributing to the ROTH) to help my parents save for retirement that I don't know about?

personalfinance,"Bad credit, no guarantors and rent requirements keep getting higher.","I don't know if this is a rant or just a cautionary tale. 

I went to college, got a job, began paying off debt, and currently live in my mothers house while working during the off-time with my best friends in the entire world. We planned to live together for awhile and after saving up the money we set to it a month ago and have been running into so many roadblocks. If it's not bad enough we each have our own unique cocktail of roadblocks that makes us untenable.

I make 40k a year and have 42k worth of marketable assets in a small business. I work 40 hours a week as an exempt permanent employee for a major advertising agency. Despite this, in the past month I learned that my credit score plummeted from 650 to 550 due to my mother taking out a card in my name and over-utilizing it. I don't believe there's debt so much as she over-utilizes for her work. On top of that is a medical expense for her cat on a credit line I took out, both of these things impact my score and make me untenable. My mother probably got the card when I graduated because her credit score is barely rising above 500

Friend A works for about 20k a year in a theater and his hours vary weekly but he makes enough to take home with Friend B enough to have paid 1700 a month in rent for the past year. His parents passed away recently and after the sale of their meager estate all he was left with was about 30k in a Federal Tax Lien that's dropping his credit score into the 550s with me. We learned about this today and he's contacting his lawyer tomorrow. He has no contact with his extended family who are mountain people and not exactly interactable.

Friend B is his wife and she has the same job with the same pay. While she has no student loans like the both of us, she doesn't have any credit built and her family has both bad credit and is working class in terms of income.

So our dream team collectively rolls in around 70k a year, well under the 45x Income Requirement brokers have been floating on two bedroom apartments in NYC. We have another friend who is likely going to live with us in a couch-capacity who is helping us out and we manage to consistently be able to offer five months rent to compensate for our shitty credit.

We just got rejected from a 1700 a month apartment despite me clearing about 2300 a month ALONE. Online sources have said to offer more and more money up front to compensate or to write a letter explaining bad credit but it just doesn't seem to effect anything. We keep getting asked for a guarantor that makes over 150k a year but one of us has dead parents, my mother is a single working mother at the age of 61 with bad credit and my other friends parents are struggling to keep their house. Friend A and B have their current lease expire in two days and need to move out and we thought we'd have found *somewhere* by now but each day is a new rejection. Worst case Friend B can live with her parents and I can live with my mom but Friend A doesn't have anyone left and is floating the idea of living in a hostel and paying for storage for the furniture he has. I feel like that cost would hamper our efforts to continue finding a place or at least his side of it.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this. I think it's a situation of getting it out into the air, I feel like I tried to do everything by the book when it comes to college and work and saving up but I feel also the chance to get out and live on my own with the people I love and care about has been robbed from me by the circumstances I can't directly change and couldn't directly change within the time we spent searching. I just want to live near my family, my job, and the city I grew up in rather than have to move somewhere else. I also am realizing that other places probably won't accept our situations roadblocks either. I guess at this point I'm curious if anyone else has been through this sort of thing and how you got through it and what happened after everything. I'm having a lot of anxiety and this has been killing me during the work day, hearing literally any story about coming through on similar circumstances would be amazing.

personalfinance,Requirement to contribute to retirement,"Hey guys! I know a lot of people say this, but I've been lurking around this subreddit for a while, and I finally had a question of my own.

Employee contributions are at a rate of 7% of gross salary with an option to contribute up to 17%. All employee contributions at a minimum of 7% are sheltered from Federal Withholding Tax until the date of withdrawal. Employer contributions are made as needed based upon actuarial findings.""

Does this mean that if I got this job, I would be required to pay 7% into a retirement fund without an option to decline? I'm very interested in the job, but a seven percent reduction in the amount I would receive would make it almost not worth it over the job I have now.

personalfinance,Online Banks or Credit Union for savings account and/or CDs,"Hello,
I am trying to figure out the best way to improve my savings. I have Wells Fargo savings account which does nothing for me in terms of interest rate(.01%) was looking to improve it.  I want to open a savings account with a higher interest rate and a few laddered CDs if possible. 

I'm trying to decide between using an online savings account or using a credit union. I live in Utah but the 2 credit unions I've been looking into are America First Credit Union and Mountain America Credit Union.  Both of their basic savings accounts seem to only have an interest rate of .10% (if I'm reading their website right) while online banks like Ally and Synchrony have 1.00% and 1.05% respectively.  The obvious factor would be the interest rate, but having a physical location and less ATM restrictions makes me question that.  Are there any other factors I should be considering besides interest rates for a savings account? 

Also is there any resources or websites for comparing CD interest rates. I have no way of verifying the numbers I've found for the credit unions or comparing the numbers with online banks.  
So far I've found America First's CDs interest rates are 1.00% for 1 year, 1.50% for 3 years, and 2.30% for 5 years.  Mountain America's CDs interest rate are .50% for 1 year, 1.49% for 3 years, 2.08% for 5 years.  I have no idea if that is accurate or reasonable.  I'm totally fine with not getting CDs but I still would like to be more educated on them. 

Thanks for the help!",finance,1459315720

investing,Help understanding USDINR exchange rates,"I realize this is a US focused sub, but hopefully someone who is experienced in this area can enlighten me. 

I want to start trading in currency derivatives on the NSE (India's National Stock Exchange). To that end I'd like to get a sound understanding of the factors influencing the exchange rates (US Dollar and the Indian Rupee). So far I'm trying to follow the economic indicator news on places like *investing.com* or *tradingeconomics*, but the way USD relates to INR as opposed to the way it reacts to other major currencies like CAD, JPY, GBP completely befuddles me.


For example:
last month, some non-voting FOMC members came out and said stuff which went against the statement released earlier. Why does this impact the currencies so strongly when these guys didn't have a vote?


Towards the end of last month, I observed USD gaining on INR but losing against other major currencies. Why was this?

Even right now, after the chairperson said she'll stick to the course laid out in the earlier FOMC statement, USDINR is going up rather than down, as seen [here](http://imgur.com/Afitawn)

I realize some of my doubts could be because of momentary observations which went the other way when I wasn't looking or maybe I'm just looking at the data wrong. 

Any insight in this subject, or even text/literature recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

worldpolitics,China‚Äôs 13th Five-Year Plan - Living In 2020 - by Pepe Escobar,"Consumed by myriad manifestations of its existential crisis, as usual the West neglected or underestimated the biggest show in Chinese politics: the famous ¬´two sessions¬ª ‚Äì of the People‚Äôs Political Consultative Conference and the National People‚Äôs Congress, the top legislative body ‚Äì which ended up approving China‚Äôs 13th Five-Year Plan.

The key takeaway was Premier Li Keqiang stating Beijing boldly aims at an average growth from 2016 to 2020 above 6.5 per cent a year ‚Äì based on ¬´innovation¬ª. If successful, by 2020 no less than 60 per cent of China‚Äôs economic growth would come from improvements in technology and science.

President Xi Jinping was even bolder, promising to double China‚Äôs GDP by 2020 from 2010, along with the incomes of both urban and rural residents. That‚Äôs the practical meaning of the Chinese Dream, Xi‚Äôs immensely ambitious official policy, and the contemporary translation of a ¬´fairly comfortable life for all¬ª ‚Äì what Little Helmsman Deng Xiaoping promised almost half a century ago.

Economically, Beijing‚Äôs road map ahead includes liberalizing interest rates; keeping the yuan stable (as in no spectacular devaluations); and controlling ¬´abnormal flow of cross-border capital effectively¬ª. For this massive collective effort to bear fruit, Premier Li went straight to the point, hard work is essential. And that will translate into ¬´zero tolerance¬ª for messing it all up, and ¬´room for correction¬ª for those who made mistakes. Innovators will be handsomely rewarded.

Xi‚Äôs Chinese Dream is now hitting high-speed rail velocity. The 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), in 2021, is practically tomorrow; thus the rush towards the avowed goal of ¬´building a modern socialist country¬ª. And yet doubling up GDP is a larger than life endeavor when you have a rapidly ageing population, massive property overhang (and that‚Äôs a euphemism) and rising debt.

Everything will have to be perfectly calibrated. For instance, China used more cement between 2011 and 2013 than the US used in the entire 20th century; and a lot of it was just for nothing. As Jia Kang, a Political Consultative Committee member stressed, ¬´the 6.5 per cent is an iron bottom that should never be broken‚Ä¶ if growth slows to approach the bottom, there will be pro-growth policies¬ª.

Enter Xiconomics

Even with the economy ¬´slowing¬ª to 6.5 percent a year, Chinese GDP is forecast to reach 25 trillion yuan ($3.8 trillion) more in 2020 than in 2014; to put it in perspective, this excess roughly matches Germany‚Äôs entire GDP.

Premier Li, in a very Chinese way, commented that in 2016, the Year of the Monkey, he‚Äôs bound to wield the mythical monkey's gold-banded cudgel to ¬´smash all obstacles¬ª that may prevent Beijing from reaching its ambitious economic targets.

Enter, thus, Xiconomics. Xiconomics is the successor of Likonomics ‚Äì which implies that Xi, and not Li, is the real driver of China‚Äôs economic reforms, although it is Li who holds a doctorate in economics from Peking University.

Everyone in China is talking about Xiconomics since the People‚Äôs Daily run a series extolling ¬´Xi Jinping‚Äôs economic thought¬ª. In practice, this amounts to Xi heading the Central Leading Group for Comprehensive Deepening Reform and the Central Leading Group of Finance and Economics Affairs. In China, these two bodies are usually presided by the Prime Minister.

The 13th Five-Year Plan is heavily imprinted by Xiconomics. It‚Äôs crucial to note that before the final version was drafted, Liu He, Xi‚Äôs top aide, had been on the phone a lot with US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew; they extensively discussed China‚Äôs exchange-rate policies.

One of the key aspects of Xiconomics is Beijing preferring mergers and acquisitions of state-owned enterprises instead of privatization. Economists interpret it as Xi bolstering state capitalism to tap plenty of overseas markets ‚Äì many of them virgin ‚Äì to make up for slowing domestic growth.

And that leads to the crucial importance of the New Silk Roads ‚Äì or One Belt, One Road (OBOR), according to the official Chinese terminology. State-owned enterprises will play a key role in OBOR ‚Äì which will be essentially creating Eurasia integration via an immense trans-Eurasian emporium.

OBOR happens to be the only global economic integration plan in play (there are no Plan Bs), implying almost $1 trillion in future investments already announced. Last June, China Development Bank announced it would invest an astonishing $890 billion in over 900 OBOR projects across 60 countries. And that will include a crucial, 2,000-mile long high-speed railway from Xinjiang to Tehran, an essential part of the growing energy/trade/commerce China-Iran strategic partnership.

Internally, Beijing‚Äôs top challenge arguably will be the pacification of Xinjiang ‚Äì a key OBOR hub. There is an effort to encourage integrated residential blocks, as Premier Li stressed, targeting cities where Uyghurs and Han Chinese have been segregated since the 2009 riots, especially in Urumqi, Xinjiang‚Äôs capital. Uyghur students will also be encouraged to study in Han Chinese schools. Whether this will work will largely depend on provincial cadres strictly following Beijing‚Äôs integrationist directives.

All about Xi

Beijing is unabashedly ramping up its soft power in parallel to economic power; the launch of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) ‚Äì which will be key for many projects across OBOR ‚Äì is mirrored by the establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea and turbocharged construction in parts of the disputed South China Sea.

Not accidentally, the CIA is sending its own signals, stressing the US ¬´would be uneasy¬ª at the prospect of China dominating Central and South Asian security in the long term.

Beijing is not exactly worried. The reform of the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) is also in progress ‚Äì and should be completed by 2020. The reform, coordinated by the Central Military Commission, relies on better coordination between the four Armed Forces to ¬´win wars¬ª, according to Xi himself.

Xi has already announced that before 2017 the PLA will be streamlined by no less than 300,000 jobs ‚Äì but will still count on 2 million active troops. Another key objective is to develop China as a maritime power ‚Äì totally capable of monitoring surface and aerial traffic across the South China Sea.

For instance, Beijing has deployed the powerful HQ-9 air and missile defense system to Yongxing in the Paracel archipelago ‚Äì inhabited by about 1,000 Chinese since 1956 but still also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. The HQ-9 is able to transform enormous amounts of territory into virtual no-fly zones. Only the F-22 Raptor and the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber can operate in the vicinity of an HQ-9 in relative safety.

Behind these Chinese military reforms, the unstated goal is clear; the US military better not start entertaining funny ideas, not only in the South China Sea but also across the Western Pacific.

China‚Äôs anti-access/area denial strategy is a go. And Xi is right behind it ‚Äì now widely regarded even at the provincial level as the ¬´nucleus¬ª (hexin) of all these reforms. Talk about a lightning-fast consolidation of power. And talk about a lot to talk about when China hosts the next G20 summit, in Hangzhou, in September. The 13th Five-Year-Plan has just been approved, but China is already thinking, and mentally living, in 2020.

personalfinance,I'm making WAY more money than I need to spend. Need help deciding what to do with it.,"I'm 23 years old living with my parents in Texas, and I'm a software developer. Between regular salary and quarterly/annual bonuses, I'm set to make almost $120k this year. My parents generally don't *let* me pay for anything, so I don't have any real regular expenses, except a few subscriptions for a total of less than $50/mo, but they are going through some stuff, so I am helping them out when they need it enough to ask, and more than just financially which is why I'm still at home. I'm hoping to transfer to my company's Seattle office once my parents get settled, but I have no idea how much moving will cost.

My company matches 50% of up to 6% of my salary for a traditional 401k, and I'm auto-contributing fully that amount, but I'm not investing anything else beyond that. I have $6.3k in student loans (federal subsidized @ 3.4%) left, and I'm paying those off at $500/month, but I'm thinking of increasing that to $1000 soon. I'm not worried about paying them off fast, though, because the interest rate is so low. And finally, I have $45k in savings, increasing to $50k as soon as I get my tax refund. I use YNAB, so I have a $10k emergency fund, and everything else budgeted for things like new car ($9k), vacation ($4k), and quite honestly a lot of other random stuff, furniture, home gym, etc. I don't really plan on using any of it any time soon, but I wonder if I couldn't be doing better.

I know the usual advice is to max out every kind of retirement fund available. Is that still sound advice if there's a potential move on the line? My mom thinks that either way, I shouldn't tie up that much money in something I can't touch until I'm 60, and she wants me to invest in real estate, which I think is a worse idea, especially since the price of land has already skyrocketed to match the amount development that is happening around here. I'm thinking at the very least a few CDs of varying lengths and amounts. I'm also planning on getting a regular investment portfolio, but haven't sat down to figure out the best place to start, but again, I don't want to tie up too much in that since there's so much risk involved.

personalfinance,Pay student loan or save or both?,"Hi all,
I'm looking for outside input on debt payoff vs. savings. 

I'm 29, single, no kids. Since finishing grad school in May 2014, I've paid off $32,000 in student loans, put $7,000 into my IRA and $4,000 in emergency savings. At the moment, I'm sending all extra cash to my mom, who also gave me a loan for school. She will be paid in full by July 1. At that point I'll have: 

$8,600 left on a student loan @ 5.41% 

$4,600 in emergency savings (online savings at .75%)

~$13,000 in a Roth IRA

I'm paid ahead on the loan by 4 years so I have no required payments right now. The emergency savings is 3 months expenses for me. Rent is $1250 and I'm on a lease until September 2017. I'm about to take a pay cut in exchange for a way better lifestyle, but it means I have to be a little more frugal to stay aggressive with my debt and/or savings. New salary will be $58,000. 

I'm freaking out about turning 30 and not having substantial savings since I spent it all (and much of my income) on grad school, but I also truly hate carrying debt. The interest rate on the loan is in that grey area where no one necessarily recommends paying it off first in all scenarios. 

Long story short: I did the math, and I can pay off the student loan by April 2017 if I don't contribute anything more to savings between now and then. Would you?",finance,1459345503

personalfinance,Need help deciding to put down 20% on home or pay off student loans,"Okay, so here's my current dilemma with a little background first:

28, F, married with one child. Husband and I gross ~93,000.00/yr. Live in a smaller town where cost of living is low, retirement is on track, have $10,000.00 emergency fund as well as ~$5,000.00 in other savings. We are comfortable, but not living super large or anything-healthy personal finance is a major goal for us.


I have about $40,000.00 in student loans, $18,000.00 of that is a private loan at 7.00% (refinanced last year) and the other $22,000.00 is federal with interest rates between 5.00-6.00%. Right now, all of my student loan payments add up too just at $400.00 monthly.


We have the opportunity to purchase my father's home in about a year for $150,000.00. It is currently valued at about $170,000.00 so this is a good deal in our eyes and the house/location is much better for us, as we currently do not live in a great school district/area and are hoping to make a move in the next 2 years before our child starts school. We currently have about $20,000.00 equity in our current home. Obviously we would like to make the 20% down payment on my dad's home in a year, but could I be doing things in a different way regarding my student loans?


My thought is this:
Instead of putting down the 20% ($30,000.00) on my dad's home, should I take that $30,000.00 in addition to another $10,000.00 I could save over the course of the next year and just pay off my student loans, and then purchase my dad's home through an FHA loan with only 5% down? I keep running the numbers through calculators and it seems that this could save me money both in monthly payments as well as the obvious interest savings over the life of the student loans. Has anyone ever done this/is there a downside?





Example of the calculators I have been using:






Conventional loan 20% down

Loan amount $120,000.00

Interest rate ~4%

Annual property taxes $3,800.00/yr

Annual insurance $1,200.00/yr

Monthly payment would be $989.57






FHA loan with 5% down ($7,500.00)

Loan Amount $142,500.00

Interest rate ~4.00

Annual property taxes $3,800.00

Annual insurance $1,200.00

Monthly Payment $1,203.89

My goal is to have a reliable car that will require minimal repairs for the next five years.

I don't know what interest rates are like on car loans, but I imagine that I can have the loan paid off within a year, possible earlier as I am due for a raise in the next few weeks. 

Besides the obvious consequences of not paying the loan back, are there any risks that I'm not seeing? Or is it just plain silly to take out a loan and I should just get a car for around 8k?

Edit: I realized after responding to comments that I neglected to mention that this would involve me draining my savings account down to about $1,000.00. It appears as though I can get a reliable car with the cash that I have, and that taking out a loan (even small) is an unnecessary risk.

personalfinance,Tax Penalty vs Premium Tax Credit,"Tl;dr: Would there be large consequences for saying I didn't have insurance last year when only had it for one month?

------

So last year I had insurance for only the month of March, due to moving circumstances, needing to find another job, and eventually forgetting about it, etc.

When filing my taxes via TurboTax, I put in all the correct information involving income from the previous state and present state I lived in. I also mentioned that I had insurance for the month of March and subsequently was charged a tax penalty of about $27 for each month I didn't have insurance due to my income. At the time of filing I did not have a 1095-A.

Some weeks pass and I get a letter from the IRS saying they needed a 1095-A, Form 8962, and page 2 of my return with the updated changes. Not wanting to delay my refund any longer, I did some searching through previous residences and found my 1095-A.

After putting in the information, my amended (but not yet mailed in) results say that I owe federally an additional $240 due to reduced premium tax credit based on my income.

-----

What I don't understand is how its more expensive for me to have had insurance for a singular month than it would have been to just take the tax penalty. When the tax penalty was calculated, it was already based off of my income for the whole year so I'm very confused on how I ended up owing more.

solar,Cost for removing and replacing solar on roof?,"Hello,

My boyfriend's parents are getting solar and they have a 20 year old roof. They've had several quotes for solar and they've narrowed it down to two: one from an air conditioning/solar company and one from a roofing/solar company.

The air conditioner guys said there's no problem with the roof, and that even if there was it would be $500 to take the panels off because they can leave the standoffs installed while replacing. 

The roofing company found some problems. The south side of the roof has fiberglass showing through, the granules on the shingles are wearing out and the roof was just generally installed wrong. There are also two layers of roofing materials on there. They said the roof has about 5-7 years left. They recommended replacing the section of roof where the solar panels are going. 

My boyfriend's dad is a contractor and the roofing people showed him exactly where the damage was and he seems to agree with them. However, the amount of financing they have available doesn't allow for a roof project. 

Their options are basically:

1. Install solar now and remove the panels later when the house needs to be reroofed in 5-7 years. 

2. Back down on the amount of panels and get the roof section replaced before installing.



The deciding factor is how much money it would cost to remove the solar system off the roof in the future. We know it won't be $500 because the roof has two layers and the standoffs won't be able to remain in place while the roof is being replaced.",energy,1459364887

personalfinance,Terrified to Look at my Credit Score,"I've had a very rough half of a year due to losing my job followed by 3 1/2 months of medical issues causing my income to be very low for a lengthy period of time.  Back when I got my car loan in July of last year, I was told that I had a ""very good"" credit.  But in the last six months, I've ran up my $5,000 credit card and I was late on two bill payments just trying to get by.

That being said, I knew that doing this had messed up my credit score and I have been scared to look at it... until today.  I signed up for credit karma to finally face what was going on. And it's bad. Like, 575 bad.

So the bad:

Credit Cards: I actually have two credit cards.  The first one is for $5000 and is just about capped.  The second one was for emergency car repairs and I only have a couple hundred left on there.  Credit Karma has this category as ""very poor"".

Payment History: I've made 97.3% of my payments on time (I missed two). Credit Karma has this category as ""poor"".

Derogatory Marks: Nothing.  Excellent grade.

Age of Credit History: Five accounts.  One is with my primary bank, one account is the car loan, one account is for car repairs on an old credit card, and two are for student loans from 8 years ago.  Credit Karma graded this as poor.

Total Accounts: Same as listed above.  Credit Karma graded this as poor/very poor.

Credit Inquiries: 1 good, 7 bad. One was for internet, two for credit checks w/ renting apartments, two credit checks were for credit cards, one was for my car loan and one... I don't recognize.  Credit Karma listed my grade as poor.


The Good:

There's very little here, but I should be able to pay off my emergency credit card (that I'll destroy upon wiping it) here in April and close that account.  Additionally, now that I have an ok-paying job and my income is about to triple (although it still won't be anything too impressive), I've set up a pretty thorough budget and I should be able to have my $5000 credit card almost entirely paid off around October.

So give me the dirty, brutal details.  How bad is this?  What can I do to fix my credit score?  Will getting my two credit cards situated help much?  If so, how much and how long will it take for my credit score to reflect that?  What can I do about the age of credit history and total accounts?

personalfinance,Receiving lump sum to pay off remainder of student loans - pitfalls? How to optimize?,"Hi r/PersonalFinance,


I am blessed to be in a very fortunate position, but I need some guidance. Following the sale of their house (which they own completely), my parents have offered to give me $25,000 to pay off the remainder of my student loans or to invest as I see fit. As I only make $37,000/year in an area with an extremely high cost of living, this is a huge boon.


But I want to optimize my usage of this money:


1) Are there any reasons taking this lump sum of money and paying off my loans all at once may not be the best idea? (Taxes? Credit score?)


2) Am I better off taking this lump sum and investing it, putting any dividends towards the loans, and continuing to make the monthly payment? I understand I could just pay off the loans in full, and then start investing the minimum payment, but I feel like it's far more likely that I will find a way to justify needing the monthly payment for myself on a case-by-case basis. Investing the lump sum might curb any psychological rationalization for not saving.


3) Should I do a combination of 1 and 2? Take half to pay off the highest interest loans, and invest the other half? If so which loans?


Here's a breakdown of the loans, all of which are Federal loans. 

EDIT: looks like my mobile submission screwed up the formatting here. I'll fix it as soon as I can. 

ID	Priority	Balance	Rate	Monthly Payment
A	1	$2,000.00	6.8%	$23

personalfinance,Would it be better to pay off my car loan or some of my student loans more quickly?,"I recently bought a 2014 car for around $14,000. I paid $6,000 down and financed the rest at 2.85% for 48 months. My payments are currently around $193/month which are currently set up to be automatically paid. Since I financed this car, I have to get comprehensive car insurance...to the tune of about $1200 a year through Geico. If I could be getting a better deal elsewhere I am open to suggestions! Also my county requires property taxes on your vehicle so I will probably have to pay that as well in a few months. But, the car is great and running well. I'm happy I got it.

Private student loans:

* $5,600 left on a loan with almost 10% interest. I was paying around $95/month.
However, I now throw an extra $500 on top of the payments, because of an arrangement I made with my SO (I paid for something expensive he needed asap so he's paying down this loan for me).

* $5400 at 10.75%, paying $181/month
* $12,700 at 4.1%, paying $111/month
* $14,000 at 4.2%, paying $124/month

Fed loans (currently enrolled in public service forgiveness, IBR):

* $5500 at 6.55%, paying $60/month
* $4,000 at 4.25%, paying $40/month
* $4200 at 5.35%, paying $45/month
* $1900 at 6.55%, paying $17/month
* $3500 at 5.75%, paying $36/month
* $2000 at 6.55%, paying $17/month
* $2700 at 6.55%, paying $30/month

After all payroll deductions, my take-home pay is about $2400/month. I live pretty frugally apart from paying my student loans and necessary expenses like rent ($400/month), groceries (less than $100/month because my SO pays for half), I pay electric (between $60-100/month), SO pays internet, etc. I have $6,000 in savings.

What should my priorities be in terms of saving, and paying down loans? Is it better to focus more on the high interest student loans than my car payments? I figure if I pay off the car loan faster, things like insurance premiums will go down, but, the car payment and interest rate are really low compared to my student loans. Looking for suggestions.

($65,000 left out of original $80,000 debt)","This is my first post and I honestly don't know exactly what I'm doing. I apologize in advance if this is a difficult read. I will make this as short as I can to avoid writing a book but that might not be possible.  I met my husband seven years ago at our place of employment. He had just started nursing school and I was going to community college. At about our year of being together, all within a week, we found out I was pregnant, his father died, and we moved into his father's house (about an hour away) to keep up on it. 5 months after my daughter was born I was in an ATV accident  (first and last ride) and was in a wheelchair for a year long recovery. I am a 27 year diabetic with several other autoimmune diseases so recovery unfortunately took forever. I lost my job and had to quit school to heal and care for my daughter...which was a lot of fun in a wheelchair...sarcasm heavily implied here. My husband managed to continue working, graduated from nursing school and began his career. When loans came due they were $800/month. This figure sounds astronomical before I mention that my husband was enrolled in an online course for his nursing degree and through some miscommunication, failed to submit a weeks worth of work subsequently failing the program. He had to start a new program at a new nursing school. I digress...With rent, $800 loan, my cobra medical insurance, and other very basic expenses we defaulted on the loan. When we were in a better position to work on it they gave us two options: settle for $50,000 or pay $3,000/month. Did I mention my husband is a nurse? They eventually allowed us to pay $1,500/month which landed us living with our parents with our child. A year of that and I was borderline mental. We found a house to rent and have remained here. As if this wasn't bad enough, the department of education just took our $10,000 tax return. When I called to find out what the hell was going on, they dropped a bomb on me that there were several federal loans taken out that now amount to $53,000..after our $10,000 tax return was taken. I am blown away. It has been over five years and they are just now contacting us? That much student loan debt would pay (from what I understand) over three nursing degrees. My husband was also shocked because he explicitly remembers financial aid saying he would not qualify for student loans due to this being his second Bachelor Degree. I know some will want to attack my husband but please do not. These are some huge fuck ups but given the circumstances of a dead dad, new baby and trying to get through school a lot of this time period is a haze to us both. There is not enough good to write about this man. I feel paralyzed and full of anxiety.  I am a planner but feel as if this elephant is just too big even if chewed a bite at a time. I read Dave Ramsey's book and really like the concept, I'm just feeling doom. We do budget. We do not have cable, we VERY RARELY do anything for entertainment and we never eat out. Did I mention I now have a 15 month old boy? Tubes are tied so no more surprises there. Here is our monthly budget:
Rent $878
Daughter's school, Montessori: $400

personalfinance,(28m) Quick portfolio review,"Hi all,
Been reading through all the resources here and want to get a sanity check on my strategy before pulling the trigger. I am 28 years old, single (soon to be engaged) with the following financial breakdown:

&amp;nbsp;

SEP-IRA (Fidelity) -&gt; $40,000 total

-&gt; $5,500 in AAPL (+15%)

-&gt; $34,500 (uninvested)

&amp;nbsp;

Checking -&gt; $36,000

2nd Checking -&gt; $16,000

&amp;nbsp;

I currently have about $3k in credit card debt that I will probably pay most of this month and 0 other debt.
I would like to invest the $34,500 in the SEP-IRA using a three fund portfolio. Based on my risk tolerance, I am considering 10% for Bonds, 90% stocks (70/30 split for domestic and international).

&amp;nbsp;

Idea is to do the following:

Vanguard total stock market ETF (VTI) -&gt; $21,735

Vanguard total international stock (VXUS) -&gt; $9,315

Vanguard Bond market ETF (BND) -&gt; $3,450

&amp;nbsp;

I understand that I could probably do iShares ETF's or Fidelity's Advantage MF's but I don't mind paying the ~$7 commission every once in a while for Vanguard. Perhaps someone can convince me otherwise?

Goal is to have a nice egg by age 65-70.

Questions:

1. Does my asset allocation and fund selection look good considering my age?

2. Is it worth having 10% in bonds considering the probable increase in interest rates in the near future? If not, is there a better alternative?

3. I definitely have too much cash in accounts that is getting eaten by inflation. My understanding is that I cannot combine this cash with my SEP-IRA (true?). What would be the best way to roll that money into Fidelity (account type?) and should it be invested/allocated in the same way as the IRA?

4. How much of that $52K in cash should I keep on hand and how much should I put into Fidelity? Fixed expenses are around $1,400/month in rent, ~$200 in utilities on a $80k salary. Might be doing a career pivot in the next 6 months that will drop my salary to around $65k for around 1-2 years before jumping up again. Hoping to purchase a home in the next 4-5 years.

personalfinance,Convoluted backdoor Roth IRA question,"Greetings, and thanks to PF for all the good work you all do.
I have a, to me, complicated question on a possible backdoor Roth IRA. 
Here's the story:  I have an inherited IRA that I take RMDs from.  The RMDs are treated as income, and are taxed as such.  I've been taking the RMDs, post tax, and putting them in my Roth IRA each year up to the $5500 limit. I did this in 2015.
This year, turns out I'm over the MAGI limit for Roth contributions.  I didn't know it until I had my taxes done.  I also didn't take enough tax out of the RMD (28% instead of 33%) from the Inherited IRA. My tax person told me to recharacterize the Roth contributions into a new Contributory IRA, so as to not get penalized on the Roth. I did so.  She also, because I got blasted for not taking enough Fed tax out of the inherited IRA RMD, make the $ recharacterized into the Contributory IRA deductible.
So... the question:
I want to do a backdoor Roth conversion of this $5500 I just took out and put it right back into the Roth.  I feel like I should be able to just put it all back in, without taking any tax out.  Yes, it was treated as deductible but it was taxed when I took it out of the Inherited IRA.  
Would this be different if I do this backdoor conversion in year 2016 (post April 18)? Is the $ earmarked as deductible stay that way, even if I wait a year? I want to keep putting into my Roth in the future, and not into the Contributory.  
What about next year?  If I'm over the MAGI for the Roth again, and I give the 33% from the Inherited IRA to the Fed (so I don't need to count the Contributory $5500 as deductible), can I do a straightforward backdoor conversion then?
FYI I have no other IRAs. Just this baby Contributory, the Roth, and the Inherited IRA.  No 401(k). I'm a teacher, so my pension is separate. 
My income will be above the MAGI for Roths next year as well.

I have been wanting to buy a house in San Francisco (proper) and I am clos to making an offer. I want to run my numbers by you to understand if I can afford this and if not, what are the fiscal consequences if I go ahead with the purchase.

Here are the details of the property:

* Listing price:  $675,000. After 15 days on the market and no offers, my agent advised me to make an offer for $650,000. So let's consider that as the listing price for this discussion.
* Monthly HOA: $364

This is what my lender is offering:

* Max loan amount:  $595,000
* Interest rate:  4.75% Fixed 30 years
* APR: 4.789% 
* Mortgage:  $3,103.81 (Does not include tax, mortgage insurance) 
* Funds to close (down payment):  $63,200.68 (estimated)


Here's my income/saving situation:

* My income: $115,000 CA pre-tax
* Take Home: $5740 (after tax deductions, 401k contributions, commuter benefits reductions)
* Current Savings: $44,000
* Gift funds from family: $10000
* Fidelity stock account: $3.5k
* 401K: $9.5K (First time homebuyer)

So /r/personalfinance, here are my questions:
1. If I make the down payment and my offer is accepted, is it a good idea?
2. What are some areas that I can cutback on?

My main reasons for buying a home are 1) to build equity (I am currently paying $2530 in rent in SF) 2) to be able to do whatever modifications/side projects I want in the house 3) To have the freedom to put it on AirBnB or get a roommmate if need be.",finance,1459386675
personalfinance,Need help. Freaking out about my student loans.,"I could really use some reassurance at least. I would love to know my options from someone who has been through this.

So first off, I have to admit, I fucked up. I freaked out and avoided dealing with them, and when I finally did it was too late. I can go into deeper detail if anyone wants to know, but im trying to keep this short. 

I called them today to try to set up some sort of arrangement because I'm going to be taking classes again in summer but cant sign up till mid april. Either way they told me that my account is being sent to collections.

 I called today and found out that they started the process on the 26th. They tell me there is nothing they can do to stop this. They also said that I can set up a rehabilitation plan with the new company and after 9 months of payments I'll be back in good standing. 

Due to my unique circumstance I'm not worried about signing up for classes. They also told me that it wouldnt effect my degree. My biggest worry is that the new company will not work with me when it comes to payments. My finances look pretty good on paper, but I actually have very little wiggle room. I'd like a payment around 50, and could probably swing 100 a month, but the previous company was asking for 590. 

Also, the company that just sold my debt, purchased it from the original lender in some sort of bulk buy, but they couldn't  tell me what company they baught it from. Would it be possible for me to just get a lawyer and see if I can just get this dept dismissed? 

A bit more basic info. All my loans were federal, not private, subsidized and unsubsidized, and I live and went to school in Michigan. I'll answer any questions that help clarify things. Thanks for any help, or kind words.",finance,1459388565

personalfinance,Student Loan Strategy Help,"Hey guys, first time poster here.  I just would like to ask for some advice in how to go about tackling my student loan debt. My situation is not bad at all in comparison to what it could be, I'm just looking for an efficient way to go about it.  


Background:  

8 Months out of school after getting a bachelor's degree from a top tech school in the US
I have a job paying 65k a year in a state without income tax.  



After 401k and taxes and Health/Dental Insurance I take home about $1550 bi-weekly. Ideally I'd like to spend about $500 per month on loans.  

Student Loan Debt:  
* MyGreatLakes - Parent Plus Loan (I am paying this even though it isn't in my name)  
Principal - $16,620  
Interest Rate - 6.4%  
* MyGreatLakes  
Principal - $32,500  
Interest Rate - 4.625%  
* Navient  
Principal - $7,380  
Interest Rate - 7.25%  
* FirstMark  
Principal - $3,650  
Interest Rate - 7.5% 



For the Great Lakes loans, a few repayment options are available to me.  If you are not familiar they are fixed amount or graduated amounts (less now and more in the future).  

I would like to ask what amounts I should be putting into what area first.  Ideally I'd like to get rid of the parent plus loan soon as it is in my parent's name and I don't want that to be a burden.    

If more info is required let me know, but this should paint a good picture for those who would like to offer advice.  Thanks!

EDIT:

I guess my question is, since I plan to knockout my smaller amount loans fairly quickly with prepayments and such.  Should I be putting more towards the parent plus loan (not in my name) or the other $32k loan that is in my name?",finance,1459394560

High yield checking seems to be right up my alley to kill 2 birds w/ one stone. I've done some research and reddit scrubbing, and there's been some topics on both these banks but none recently and I can't find a direct comparison with experienced folks giving advice.

Essentially LMCU and consumer credit union both offer 3% on balances in my range (10-20k) but consumer credit union offers a 4% and 5% if you spend $500 or $1000 (respectively) on a credit card they offer.

It would seem that consumer credit union is better since it is does have the higher balance cap (20k vs. 15k) and the added opportunity to seek higher interest rates if I want to either use or do some type of MS w/ the credit card each month.",finance,1459395286
personalfinance,[Housing] Hi Pf! I have two refinance options....,"Alright, so currently we are looking at refinancing our house with the objective of getting rid of PMI and getting a slightly better interest rate. Currently we have a 231k loan balance (4.325 interest) with an appraisal of 285k, putting us very close to having the equity to refinance out of PMI. So, we have been given the following options and are unsure of what to take:


Option 1 - 3.875% interest, Roll all the costs of the refinance into the loan amount and buyout PMI, increasing our loan by about 7k, total.

Option 2 - 3.875% interest, Pay down our principle to 228k (to get 20% equity), and pay out of pocket for the refinance.
 
Here are the details of both options:

Number 1

1)      bank fees ~$1795

2)      Title fees ~$1203

3)      Taxes, 8 mos ~$880

4)      Insurance, 5 mos ~$191.10

5)      Daily interest from April 13th ~$461.34

6)      Mortgage Insurance buyout ~2100

7)      Bottom line, we get ~$160 back
 
 
 
Number 2
 
1)      bank fees ~$1795

2)      Title fees ~$1181

3)      Daily interest from April 13th ~$441.72

4)      Taxes, 8 mos at ~$ 880

5)      Insurance, 5 mos at ~$191.10

6)      Pay ~2500 to the principle

7)      Bottom line, ~$6900 due at closing
 
We are able to come in with the 6900 at closing, however it would wipe out a mutual fund we have been saving for our long term investment. We don't really like the idea of increasing out loan amount that much though. What do you guys/gals think? Thanks in advance for the help.",finance,1459396710

investing,"Correlation Between Inflation, Interest Rates, and the Reserve Ratio","Alright so I have read quite a few investment books and listen to a couple investing podcasts. However, I still have a ways to go. One of the topics that was brought up was the correlation between the money supply, interest rates and inflation. However, I cannot seem to grasp the concept of how they are correlated. I am hoping someone can help explain this to me a little better. So I understand the fed will increase and decrease the reserve ratio in order to promote more lending on behalf of the banks or decrease the amount of lending that is occurring. As a result interest rates will be lower, since there is an increase in the supply of money, this would also cause economic inflation, which is part of the cycles we go through. From that more people would be willing to take out loans, and therefore spend more/ invest more. All of which increase the amount of money in circulation, therefore causing inflation. In order to stop a rapid amount of inflation, the fed would increase interest rates making it more costly to take out loans therefore decreasing the amount of spending and causing a recession.

 Now here is where I am confused. If you look at a chart that reflects the history of the money supply (Reserve Ratio) from 1940-1985, the money supply increases from 4.5 in 1940 to 12.1 in 1985. Now at this same time Interest rates increase from roughly 2% in 1940 to roughly 14% in 1981. Inflation on the under hand has its ups and downs however in 1980 it was close to 15%. 

How can all interest rates, inflation, and the money supply all be at high levels at the same time? If the money supply was constantly increasing, how come interest rates were as well? If interest rates were so high how come inflation was also super high? I was under the impression that when inflation is high, the fed would then raise rates causing a decrease in spending.",finance,1459403071

personalfinance,Mortgage lender we got pre-approved with (and whose pre-approval we took to the offer) makes it seem difficult to actually shop rates,"Back in October, after a first-time homebuyer class, we met with the mortgage lender who was part leader of the class. Based on numbers we supplied him, without pulling credit, he gave us mortgage figure estimates.  He admittedly high-balls so that we're prepared for ""worst-case scenario.""  

This past week rolls around and we find a home we want to put an offer on and he pulls our credit for the pre-approval. Hand-in-hand with that he updates the presented estimate rates and figures (still high-ball, even higher). He explains these are illustrative and still worst case, and doesn't give an actual rate quote.  Our offer's accepted and I ask him for the Interest and APR, given that our Agreement of Sale says, ""Interest Rate not to exceed 4.0%"" and his figures are above that. Giving him an opportunity, I show him the Interest and APR another lender is offering us, after pulling credit, and for a couple e-mails he just gives us a range of 0.5% his would fall into between now and settlement--*which is actually more than 60 days away so the rates can't yet be locked*--and insists there's such variance between lenders as far as what fees they incorporate into APR, so it's hard to actually compare rates.

Finally he shows me the current 30 day lock Interest Rate of 3.875%, but again insists due to even possible daily fluctuations of around 0.125% we should expect his bank's rate for us to fall between 3.75% and 4.25%. I understand their may be truth to it, but it makes ""shopping rates"" seem futile, given that A) we can't lock yet and B) different lenders incorporate fees differently in APR. As an aside, he points out that the ""not to exceed 4.0%"" in the Agreement of Sale just means that if it does, we can back out of sale.

Given that we have a limited time-frame to choose a lender to follow through with and that we can't lock a rate yet, am I right in feeling somewhat run around? What should we do?",finance,1459422092

personalfinance,"Moving across the country in a couple months, need to pay off debt first? 20y/o","So my father has offered to have me move across the country to go live with him. I've accepted on the condition that I need to pay off my roughly $3000 debt first. I make about $260 a week, and I have two credit cards plus a loan. My minimum payments are $95, $42, and $35. Balances are $640, $1400, and $690 respectively. Sounds easy right? 

Here's the catch: I'm a terrible impulse buyer, and I'm always buying something vaguely necessary but absolutely not needed at the moment (like replacing parts on my motorcycle that could be left for a while). For some reason spending money, even small amounts, makes me feel better.

 So far the only option I have come up with myself to keep myself on track is to remove $140 out of each paycheck and put it into a separate bank account via bill pay so that I can only access it by physically going into that bank to withdrawal it. I want to pay this off as quickly as possible while I still have a job here, because I know after I move finding a new job will be a struggle plus I just started my first college courses and I took out student loans.

personalfinance,"22 y/o, graduating in May, no issues with student loans, unsure what to do re: future employment.","I'm 22 years old with an associate's in a CS-related program, graduating from university with a bachelor's in May. I've paid off all unsubsidized university student loans and hold ~$4.3k across three subsidized loans that start accruing interest in November, with interest rates of 3.4, 4.2, and 4.6%. I have enough saved to pay off those loans in full, with a loose estimate of ~$12k in liquid assets right now. I currently hold a part-time on-call job making minimum wage and do freelance work on the side, so I have at least a small amount of income each month. I live with family and don't have any monthly living expenses. I don't know what my credit score is, but I imagine it's fairly high - I have nearly three years of established credit and have always paid the balance in full before the due date.

However, I have two issues that stand in the way of gainful employment: I don't have a driver's license (or by extension, a vehicle) and meaningful employment in my immediate area is hard to come by. Minimum or low-wage jobs are present, but jobs in my field (technology) are very few in number. Though I feel fairly secure in my ability to interview and perform in a job-related setting (I have a steady level of work experience and am set to graduate summa cum laude), my problem lies in the logistics. I'll need some time to schedule a road test and purchase a vehicle if I expect to seek employment outside of my city. I have family that commutes to a more developed area, so I can send out resumes there and carpool if I land anything, but I'm not sure how an employer would feel about someone without their own transportation, if that would be a dealbreaker. Relocation isn't in the deck of cards - I refuse to rent, and while my family intends to move after I finish university, it'll take a good year for things to happen.

I have a fair amount of options and thankfully I don't have the gun of student loans pointed at my head, but I'm not sure what my angle of attack should be: whether I should fire off resumes to the commuter city; hang around my city for a while, grinding some low-wage jobs so I have a comfortable amount of money for a vehicle and related expenses; or something else. I'm in a very good financial position right now, but I don't want to blow it by getting in over my head or burning money just trying to look for a job, nor do I want to be doing things that aren't the best use of my time.

personalfinance,Student loan forgiveness vs keeping a loan at original terms,"I know personal finance is generally against keeping student loans when the borrower could pay them off entirely, but I‚Äôd like to share my circumstances and see if anyone disagrees. I don't see student loans as bad because you can always defer it in an emergency. Also, I‚Äôll give a little background on student loan legislation that might help people currently in college.



First, a little history lesson. Back in 2005-06, the Higher Education Relief Act (HERA) was passed by congress as a part of the Deficit Reduction Act. HERA allowed the federal government to increase the interest on student loans in an effort to reduce the federal deficit (it clearly worked). Many of us in college at the time, myself included, consolidated loans and locked into a low repayment plan in anticipation of higher rates before HERA took effect.



Fast forward a couple of years into the Great Recession (2008). Obama‚Äôs congress passes the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF) as a part of a string of ‚Äúrecession busting‚Äù legislation. If you work for the government (federal, state, or local) for 10 years and make regular payments on your loan, the loan is forgiven after 10 years. No one is eligible for forgiveness under this program until 2018, but many people in government are preparing their loan paperwork for 2018 forgiveness.

Despite making regular payments and working for the government, I was told by the Dept. of Education that my repayment plan is not eligible for forgiveness under the PSLF program and therefore none of my payments since 2008 count towards forgiveness. My plan is ‚ÄúPre-HERA‚Äù, which has lower payments and interest than an alternative ‚Äúmodern‚Äù plan that would qualify for the PSLF program.



If I wanted to qualify for PSLF, I would have to consolidate my ‚ÄúPre-HERA‚Äù loans into a new package at a higher interest rate, join a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù repayment plan, and start at 0 for 120 more payments to have anything forgiven (while working for the government for another 10 years). As far as I can tell, the PSLF program is a total rip off because the amount the Dept. of Education requires for payment is essentially equal to a standard 10 year repayment plan; i.e. at the end of 10 years, there will be nothing to forgive.



In my case, keeping my old ‚ÄúPre-HERA‚Äù plan is clearly the better option vs. joining the PSLF program now, but how soon should I pay it off? The interest on my Pre-HERA loan (6%), balance ($14k), and monthly payment ($150), is all low enough that the dividends on some of my taxable investments can effectively make the monthly payment for me. I‚Äôd rather use my discretionary income to invest more than pay off this loan all at once. Yes, there is a tax penalty for using dividends to pay the student loan, but there is also a tax benefit every year of making student loan payments, so I see it as a wash. Is it a wash? Or does it make sense to just wipe $14k off the books at once?",finance,1459440856

If possible, I was looking into securing a $9,000 dollar loan from a local credit union. I think with my income both now and future potential and my credit score ~700, I would get a reasonable interest rate. It also seems like more of my payment would go towards the actual debt than the interest which doesn't seem to be the case now. Because my federal loans are a) deferred for this year, and b) will be capped at 15% of my income, I plan on being very aggressive with the loan repayment for the 2016 year and suspect I'll be able to pay off 2/3rds - 3/4s of the loan. 

Conclusion: 

Consolidating with a credit union seems like a slam dunk if possible, but I am still pretty green when it comes to personal finance and want to make sure I'm not making a huge mistake. I haven't used the credit cards in &gt;5mo and plan on aggressively paying them off even without the loan. 

Your opinions on this are greatly appreciated, thanks.",finance,1459443739
personalfinance,Pay off one student loan or apply payment to total amount due?,"Hi PF, 

I got around to doing my taxes this past weekend. My return has been the same for the past 3 years, so I was expecting the same amount this year. To my surprise, for some reason my return almost doubled (guess I did something right last year lol)

I already told myself going in, my return would be going straight to loans. However, since my return was bigger that I was expecting, I was looking at my loan breakdown, and realized I could actually pay off one of them entirely, and still have money left over to pay the total amount (I have 10 loans total, amounts ranging from $2500 - $5000, and interest rates ranging from 3.4% - 6.8%. Total amount is currently sitting at about $36,000)

The loan I spotted I could pay off is at $3500 with a 6.8% interest rate. 

With that said, would it be better to pay off this one loan entirely or apply my tax refund to the total amount due or does it not really matter? 

Thanks!",finance,1459445541
personalfinance,Liquidating retirement fund in lieu of another loan for a medical student,"Hello personal finance, I'm at a crossroads here.

I am currently a medical student, taking on enormous amounts of debt (close to 300k when all is said and done) at interest rates in the 6.8-8% territory. I have a retirement fund from a previous job with about 7k in it, with a rate of return of -5%. I won't even be making real ""doctor"" income for another 8 years or so, but resident salaries for my speciality are around 50k, which will start in 3.5 years. I also have student loans left over from undergrad. No CC or other debt.

My question is, would it make sense to liquidate the retirement account to avoid taking out a loan? I know it's usually not a good idea to do this, but considering that I won't have much (if any) real income this year, the tax penalties can't be too bad, and it could save me from another crippling loan.

investing,Question on the inverse relationship between the bonds value and interest rates,"I came across the following in Michael Sincere's book ""Understanding Stocks"" and am still not clear on why a bond will lose in value if the interest rates rise and increase in value if the interest rates drop. 

&gt;&gt; For example, let‚Äôs say you purchased a bond for $1,000 with an 8 percent coupon (it pays $80 annually per $1,000 of face value). If interest rates drop below 8 percent, the bond is worth more than $1,000 because investors will pay more to receive the higher interest payments. On the other hand, if interest rates rise, your bond will be worth less than $1,000 because it is less attractive to buyers, who won‚Äôt pay face value for a bond that pays less than the current interest rate.

If the interest rates increase, wouldn't I get more return on my bond?",finance,1459447574

My company formerly paid me bi-weekly, so every pay period contained 80 paid hours and the same net pay. I would do a zero balance budget based on the net pay and use the 2 additional pay periods to pay down debt. Now I'm being paid semi-monthly so my hours per pay period vary, but I'm still working 40 hours per week. I earn $27 per hour. I used a paycheck calculator to come up with:  


27 x 40 hours x 52 weeks = $56,160 annual salary
$56,160 / 24 pay periods = $2,340 gross pay per pay period
Tax Exemption = 2 and I use married (filing jointly) status =&gt; Federal Withholding $167.78, Social Security = $128.33, Medicare = $30.01, Insurance payments excluded from Federal tax = 270.09
Insurance not excluded from taxes = 6.09
Net Pay = $1,737.70  


Is this correct? My concern is that with varying hours per pay period and varying days per month that my monthly net pay will fluctuate, which will throw off the budget.

personalfinance,22 year old student entering my final year of college. I'm not sure what to do next.,"Ok, so I am currently in my (hopefully) final year of college. I am very low income (bring in about $8000/yr from my two part time jobs) and am independent from my parents. That is to say, I am independent on my taxes, but considered dependent on the FAFSA. I live on my own and am looking to move in with a roommate to a two bedroom apartment at about $825/month soon.  I also have a dog I rescued (I know having an animal is dumb in college). I don't have too much debt, and up until this last month had a credit card I paid off in full every billing cycle.  I have excellent credit as well, as my Equifax score is 736. Because I have a high GPA and demonstrate significant financial need I usually get enough aid to cover my tuition.  This last year I had to take out my first subsidized loans and currently have a balance of $8250. I receive FNS benefits of $16/month. I used to have savings, but a lot of unexpected expenses all at once blew through what I had. I have a car which I need for work which I am in the process of paying off. I need to take summer classes if I want to graduate soon and have received a grant for part of it ($1500), but am unsure whether it's worth it to also take on a Federal Direct Unsub. Loan IV in the amount of $2000.

So here's the breakdown of my income vs. expenses:

Income from part-time jobs: ~$600-800/month (includes mileage)

Income from FNS: $16/month

Expenses:

Rent: ~$450/month

Utilities (internet, electric, water): ~$150-$200/month

Car payment: $211.84/month

Dog costs: $30-$60/month

Phone bill: $30/month

Fuel: $40-60/month

Groceries: ~$100/month

Minimum credit card payment: $35 (Discover It card)

Debt:

Discover Card: $178

Auto Loan: $6,322 (2.44% interest)

Stafford Subsidized Loan: $8,250.
                                      
I budget using Ynab, but in the past two months my income hasn't been enough to meet my expenses, so I've been putting a lot more on my credit card than usual and haven't been able to pay it off in full only making the min. payments each month.

I'm not sure what to do at this point.  I'm trying to spend as little as possible even on the essentials, but I just feel like I'm on the edge of drowning. I'm terrified of taking an Unsub. loan as the interest intimidates me, but I don't know if I can avoid it.  I just need some general advice/direction at this point.

personalfinance,Sincere Request for Help!,"Hello r/personalfinance!
I need some guidance. I‚Äôm really embarrassed by my situation so reaching out for advice is proving very difficult for me.

I finished up a BFA in 2009 with a staggering $160,000 in student loan debt from a private design school. A couple federal loans but mostly private. I‚Äôve been paying on 2 of my cosigned loans ($60k in total. One fed, one private) ever since as to avoid burning bridges with my cosigners. On a few occasions I‚Äôve actually had to borrow to make those payments.

Anyway, It took me 5 years to find gainful employment and its still not that great. I hustled hard for those five years. Nothing ever panned out. Needless to say all of the loans I wasn‚Äôt able to make payments on defaulted and have been bought and sold and re-serviced numerous times. In some cases, service/collection fees of $20k+ being tacked on to the original loan amount. Terrifying.

Now I‚Äôm employed with a established company. My job isn‚Äôt going anywhere. (knock on wood) It‚Äôs a major relief. However, since last years tax season the collection agencies have been in full shark mode. I cant pay in full, I cant pay half and I cant pay the ridiculous monthly payments being requested (Like $5000 an month). Come on! I don‚Äôt even make that much in 2 months after taxes and I barely survive week to week. I surely can't afford to have 25% of my check garnished.

So what am I supposed to do? I‚Äôm lost and so discouraged. Every ‚Äúdebt rehab‚Äù service I look into turns out to be a total scam. I want to pay off my loans! That is my goal here. I never intended for any of this to happen. It‚Äôs all just been really bad timing compounded by pure naivety.
Can anyone offer up a legitimate solution? I need a to find a service that can help me track, relieve, and consolidate this awful mess.

personalfinance,"Is my healthplan considered a high deductible plan if ""Obamacare"" subsidies reduce the amount of the deductible paid by me?","At the start of the year, my spouse and I were both on an employer-provided HDHP. We maximized contributions to our HSA.

In July, he went on COBRA, keeping the same HDHP through the end of the year. I went on a healthcare.gov marketplace plan. Initially, the plan said it had a $3,500 deductible. However, after subsidies, I only pay $500 of that deductible.

Now I'm trying to figure out if the plan is still considered a high deductible plan, since the actual deductible is over $1,300, or if I go by the subsidized amount, in which case we made excess contributions to the HSA.

If we did make excess contributions to the HSA, is it true that all we have to do is withdraw that money from the HSA to avoid penalties? Or do we also have to spend that money on qualified expenses?

Thanks!!

**Edit:** My plan administrator finally responded. They stated unequivocally that the HDHP threshold is measured AFTER subsidies are applied and thus my plan does not qualify. Hope this helps someone.

personalfinance,Car dealership tried to raise my interest rate after delivery of the vehicle - Spot Loan - Florida,"This is an outstanding sub and I've learned a lot here. My question is pertaining to a vehicle I thought I had purchased last Wednesday the 23rd. I had attained pre-approval through an outside lender and secured a comfortable price point, interest rate and payment schedule.

Yesterday on the 30th of March the dealer contacted me saying I must return to the finance office and sign a new contract as my rate had adjusted.  I contacted the dealer voiced my displeasure and attempted to walk away.

The finance manager then threatened to contact my Commanding Officer and JAG office (Active duty military). So I took the vehicle once again and traveled to our JAG office this afternoon to investigate the legality of this.

The command lawyer I spoke with wrote up a letter stating my right to walk away from the deal within 48 hours of being notified of a rate change. Additionally he questioned the dealerships tactic of threatening my employment with the Navy under Section 559.72 of the Florida Statutes found below:

(3) Tell a debtor who disputes a consumer debt that she or he or any person employing her or him will disclose to another, orally or in writing, directly or indirectly, information affecting the debtor‚Äôs reputation for credit worthiness without also informing the debtor that the existence of the dispute will also be disclosed as required by subsection (6).

(4) Communicate or threaten to communicate with a debtor‚Äôs employer before obtaining final judgment against the debtor, unless the debtor gives her or his permission in writing to contact her or his employer or acknowledges in writing the existence of the debt after the debt has been placed for collection. However, this does not prohibit a person from telling the debtor that her or his employer will be contacted if a final judgment is obtained.

The representative from the JAG office then faxed his statement to the General Manager of the dealership and gave me a copy to hand them when returning the keys.  The finance manager I spoke to upon returning the vehicle refused to take the letter and told me ""That's okay we'll be delivering the vehicle to your home."" I left the vehicle with the dealer and caught a ride home.

My question is did the dealer just have to have a last word or can I expect any legal ramifications from this. I never signed a new contract or agreed to a new rate, although I'll be damned if they didn't try for hours to get me to sign a new purchase agreement. It's a huge relief to be out of this toxic dealership, but his final comment did leave a nagging bit of doubt. And it is entirely in my nature to worry about this endlessly for the days to come.

IRA distributions, and you may have to make estimated tax payments. If your estimated payments and
withholdings fail to satisfy your tax obligations, you may be subject to IRS penalties. You may want to
consult a tax advisor regarding your personal situation.

The last is a state school which would leave me with only $5,500 dollars in government loans but is my absolute last resort.
