personalfinance,Help with self-employment estimated taxes! I'm lost and confused.,"I just started a new job where I'm an independent contractor. I know I need to pay estimated taxes quarterly, but I'm a little lost in what I'm supposed to do and how much I owe per quarter.

From my limited understanding I'm supposed to pay taxes as both employer and employee (since I am one in the same). What sort of taxes do I have to pay? 

I've seen something generally called self-employment tax and at first I assumed that's all I pay, but I believe that's incorrect. I believe I have to pay my self-employment tax on top of my regular tax? Is that correct?

And then, do I have to pay separate estimated tax for both State and Federal? Are these different? Do I have to pay my state the same amount of tax as my federal? I live in California, btw.

How do I calculate all this? I know the IRS has a form that you follow to do this, but I don't know if I'm doing it right. 

I am estimating I will make $48,000 for 2016 (even though I will almost assuredly make less than that). I calculated that I will have to pay about $12,000 in taxes for the year (I really don't know if I did this right, or what tax this is...).

Is the $12k I calculated only federal tax? And is that ONLY self-employment tax... and will I have to pay regular tax on top of that? How do I calculate my regular tax and the taxes I have to pay for my state?

Where would I go to pay for my state tax? I know the IRS has direct pay I can do, but does that work for my state too?

Sorry, I am SO lost and confused about all this. I usually just get a W-2 and input numbers into turbotax that does all this for me...

personalfinance,Mortgage Offsets,"I bought a house a few years ago with my wife.

We currently are sitting on valuation of about $500k up from $450k 3 years ago.

We have, what is called, an ""offset"" account. The way it works is that any money in the offset account acts as collateral against the principle, so interest payments are for the amount in excess of the amount in the account.

Here's an example:

Amount in offset account: $10000
Offset account debt: $50000
Interest calculated after offset: ((50000-10000)*0.049)/12

0.049 is the current variable interest rate.

The other portion of the mortgage is in a fixed rate.

The question I have is whether it is worth maximizing the offset account, in opposition to investing in an index, as an example.

Currently, each year we adjust the the ratio between the offset account and the fixed portion such that by our estimations we'll meet approximately the amount of savings in the offset account to completely negate interest - this year, that's around $60k.

My gut feel tells me we should only have enough in the offset account that we need for emergencies (say, $20k); and the rest should be tied up in a more lucrative investment that has a higher payout.

What complicates things is that we are unsure if we are staying where we currently live for all that long. The house is reasonable for my family, but there's a possibility that we'd be changing where we live at some point in the future that is unknown currently.

At the current time, kids are going into school, and wife will probably be starting 60% part time work this year. Expected earnings are about $100k (about $65k after taxes), and when wifey finds a job she likes, that might go up to $140k - $150k and about $100k after taxes.",finance,1459482565

personalfinance,"Refinanced home for addition, plans failed, what to do now.","My wife and I recently refinanced our home. Primarily the refi was for a lower interest rate but after running the numbers we were able to pull out ~30K and keep the same payment. While the original payment wasn't really a problem we figured the extra money could be used to do an addition (add 140 SqFt to small living room) on the home. Didn't really have a chance, at the time, to get a complete picture of the costs associated with the addition. 

Anyways, after having meetings with the city, architect, and engineer. Its become clear the project is significantly more expensive (3x minimum) than originally expected. 

So now I have ~30K which I am paying interest on and not sure what should be done. 

Should I: 

* Invest it somewhere else to yield a greater return. (Where?)

* Put the money into other areas of the home (solar, landscaping, bathroom, etc)

* Pay it back into the mortgage. 

* or...

personalfinance,"Stop taking on debt under the guise of ""it's cheap money""","Hey everyone. Long time lurker and finally got an account the other day and have started posting. Something that I've observed regularly here is the advice to keep debt when the interest rate is low and use the money to ""invest"" for a better return. Often times this is associated with a car purchase and the typical comment is something like ""Well I received a 0%/1.9%/2.5%/etc rate and I can make a better return than that by investing in the market. So I am better off""

Look I get what you are saying but in reality this never happens. People don't actually take the money they claim to be saving and invest it. In the super off chance they do chances are they are doing it outside of a retirement account and buying single stocks then jumping out when the stock starts dipping more than their risk tolerance. That's not investing - that's speculating.

This is the lie we are telling ourselves but in reality we can't afford that $30K car. Meaning we can't actually write the $30K check at the dealer to buy it. ""No I totally can I would just rather invest"" ""No I totally can I just don't want to tie up that much money"". OK, that means you don't have enough additional cash on hand that leaves you comfortable. AKA you cannot afford it. 

The worst lies we tell are the ones we tell to ourselves. Don't tell yourself you are being smart and taking ""cheap money"". Debt is never a better idea than paying cash.

I've been done there and done that. 30 some odd years later I've finally learned.

personalfinance,Not sure where to start. Help!,"Hi!

I'm seeking your advice on how I should approach preparing for a more financially stable future. I’ve done some simple calculations, and I’m having a hard time figuring out what to do at this point... Or if what I’m doing is the best for me.  

To give you some details on my financial background:

My current monthly income after tax is $2,825. 

I have 5% of my paycheck going directly into my 401K plan (already removed from above; my company will match up to 6% in contributions; I will increase to 6% in contributions starting July 2016). 

I pay the following in bills (rent, groceries, car gas, and phone): $1,400.

I pay $311 monthly in student loans (Grand total owed: $26,125). The interest rates are split up into 7 different direct unsubsidized or direct unsubsidized loans (all from the same borrower). These interest rates start at 3.86% and go up to 6.8%. 

I have 0 credit card debt. 

With all of that said, that *should* leave me with approximately $1,000 dollars per month. I’ve opened up an online savings account to begin saving (APY 1.05%), and have $500 in there at the moment. 
I have a medical procedure that I know will cost me approximately $1,000 in the next month, and other then that, do not expect any other large bills. 

One thing I’ve noticed while writing this post, is that I’m absolutely terrible at keeping track of where the remainder of my funds go. I have the Mint app, etc. I think I’m just wasteful with my money. I apologize for the wall of text, but I really hope to make small improvements with my savings. Any advice is appreciated.

investing,The Big Short Explained Again,"[Liberty Street Economics did a great post](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/04/hey-economist-what-did-you-make-of-the-big-short.html#.Vv6MfvkrJph) about their thoughts on *The Big Short*.  There was a lot of misinformation in [this thread the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4ckpi4/the_big_short_explained/), so I thought I would post something from actual economists who understood better and have taken the time to answer some more popular questions about the crisis.

There were a couple of things from the video that could have been misleading, and I included my extra (way too long) explanations in footnotes to keep it somewhat coherent:

* Michael Burry did not short mortgage backed securities.  Borrow in these bonds was virtually non existent, and still is today.  He shorted CDOs, or collateralized debt obligations.  Specifically, he shorted synthetic CDOs.  What is a synthetic CDO, you might ask? (footnote 1).  The creation of these synthetic CDOs was actually pretty complicated, but most were pools of credit default swaps on underlying mortgage backed security tranches.  So to create one of these, a bank would issue or find a bunch of credit default swaps, package them together into a CDO, and sell the risk to opposing parties who wanted to bet for or against the housing market.  The guys who were ""long"" the CDO would technically be the ones selling the CDS (footnote 2), and the guys who were ""short"" the CDO would be the ones buying CDS.  Burry also presumably bought CDS.

* CDS do not have to bought from an insurance company.  A bunch of counterparties trade CDS, and even though they are very ""insurance-like"", they trade just like regular over-the-counter financial instruments.  So for example, let's say I have a CDO tranche that's trading at par (par == 100 cents on the dollar), but I am worried that it's possible I will receive less than par in the near future.  I can find a counterparty to buy CDS on this tranche from, and then I will be made whole in the case of a default.  What constitutes a default? (footnote 3).

If you would like to read some short but good explanations for the financial crisis (note they don't all agree), I would recommend the following:

* [Turing Finance: Recipe for the Financial Crisis](http://www.turingfinance.com/recipe-for-the-financial-crisis/)
* [Yes, the Fed's Errors Made Recession Worse](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-02-08/our-critics-are-wrong-the-fed-erred-in-2008)
* [Turns Out the Housing Crisis Wasn't All About Subprime](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-09-14/turns-out-the-housing-crisis-wasn-t-all-about-subprime)
* [Confusion About the Financial Crisis Won't Die](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2016-01-28/confusion-about-the-financial-crisis-won-t-die)

I can also answer any other questions or try and point people in the right direction.

Footnotes:

1. Well, it's anything.  I can take anything with value (art, real estate, stocks, bonds, loans, you name it) and create a CDO.  The objective of CDOs are to change the risk profile of an investment for investors with different tastes in risk.  Generally speaking, there was (and still is) a lot of demand for high quality risky securities, and less demand for lower quality risky securities.  However, in the real world, there are more lower quality risky assets than there are higher quality ones.  CDOs are inventive way of bridging this gap; it takes a pool of risky securities, and realigns that risk for investors.  Let's say I have a $1 million pool of 100 loans, each with exactly a 50% chance of paying off.  If I tried to sell the loans individually, they would all be pretty damn risky.  However, if I pool them together and sell individual risk tranches, then I can create much safer securities (and much riskier ones).  So let's say I split the entire pool of loans into ten tranches, where the lowest tranche (we'll call it tranche J) is the first tranche to take any losses, and the highest tranche (called tranch A) will be the last to take any losses.  So the breakdown is as follows:

* Tranche A - 10%
* Tranche B - 10%
* Tranche C - 10%
* Tranche D - 10%
* Tranche E - 10%
* Tranche F - 10%
* Tranche G - 10%
* Tranche H - 10%
* Tranche I - 10%
* Tranche J - 10%

So, as you can see, Tranche A is a pretty damn safe bet.  Tranches B through J have to be completely wiped out in order for an investor in Tranche A to lose a single dollar.  This cushion is called ""credit enhancement"", and is an important part of securitized products.  Tranche J, on the other hand, looks really risky.  The lower tranches in a stack are usually referred to as the equity or mezzanine tranches, since they carry the most risk, but also the most reward.  Though this is an unrealistic example, you can imagine that an investor in Tranche J would probably demand several times the amount of interest that an investor in Tranche A might.  It is in this way that we have taken a large pool of very risky loans, and created a much less risky product for some investors.

2. If you are ""selling"" a CDS, it means you are ""long risk"".  Or, in other words, you're the one selling insurance to the party who wants to buy it.  The party buying CDS, also known as ""selling risk"", is the one who is buying insurance and is hoping for the underlying security to fail.  The easiest way to think about this is that selling CDS == long, buying CDS == short.

3. Even guys with law degrees from Harvard debate that.  [ISDA](http://www2.isda.org/) is the organization that generally makes the final decision, but each contract has its own definition of ""default"", and even each counterparty has their own interpretation of what that contract means when it says ""default"".  Now you know why lawyers at investment banks make the big bucks; winning lawsuits in these disputes can mean hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars one way or the other.  The payout on CDS is also not binary in the sense that it's either activated or it's not.  When ISDA has determined that a ""default event"" has occurred, owners of CDS are ""made whole"" on their investment, which requires an auction on the underlying security in order to determine the market price of the now-defaulted bonds.  Let's say investors determine that the defaulted bonds are now worth 30 cents on the dollar (i.e., a restructuring or liquidation would result in them getting paid about that much).  ISDA would determine that owners of the CDS on those bonds are entitled to 70% of the face value of their CDS.  The scary part is, that's just for the more common forms of CDS; the market has come a long way in homogenizing these securities, but there are still a ton of forms CDS can take since they are traded over the counter.  Or in other words, two counterparties can agree to create a contract for just about anything they want as long as they find a price they can agree on.  The end result is pretty much just more money for good lawyers.",finance,1459528820
personalfinance,"I have a tax refund pending in my bank account, but i dont think it should be","The TL;DR version, a student loan that went to collections ended up garnishing my pay check. I assumed my tax refund would be sucked up by said student loan, since I unsuccessfully haven't been able to rehab the darn thing. But now I have a tax refund pending in my account.


Here is some additional context that may or may not be relevant. This whole thing was started by a private loan that kept changing hands, and was going to my old university address from almost 8 years prior. I have a lot of loans, and I have always had trouble with the private ones. The government ones haven't had any issues. The garnishing started 1 year ago. Without my paperwork, I am guessing as of right now this loan has about $4,000 left on it?

the collection agency at the time had me fill out forms several times to start rehab process, but for whatever reason, it never got processed and I always got a different answer when I called as to why.

 So a year later, this passed january, I get a letter from The US Treasury. The basis of the letter reads ""as authorized by federal law, we applied all or part of your federal payment to a debt you owe."" then in the details, it says ""payment before reduction $1,257, Total amount of this reduction, $1,257. Now, I maybe didn't understand this 100%, but I just assumed it meant my tax refund would go to this defaulted loan. I did find it odd I got the letter when I did though, because at this time I didn't file my taxes yet, so how would they know if I get a refund or not?

Anyway, 2 months later, I lose my job at a company i have been at for 2 and half years. Sad, but I will survive. So I signed up for unemployment while I look for work. I also go ahead and do my taxes since it is getting close to the end of march, and I don't want to do them at the last minute. After doing my taxes, it tells me my refund would be about $1300, which is higher than I expected, but didn't matter because I assumed that it was going to go toward the loan anyway.

So, now it is a week after I filed my taxes, and I see pending deposit listed specifically as a tax refund for approx $560 something, and it is dated for 04/05.... now that is odd, because I know that refund wasn't enough to cover the whole loan.

So I have a few concerns. Someone made a mistake and this might go into my account and then be taken out, which isn't abig deal, but I would like to know what is going on.

The other concern is that I am currently collecting unemployment, so If this goes through, I am assuming I have to claim it as income  when I go file my unemployment for that week. But I don't want to claim it as income only to have them take that $560 back, because that could screw me up a lot. 

I am also concerned I didn't understand that letter very well and maybe there is more going on that I don't realize.

I called the collection company handling my loan, but apparently it has changed hands yet again. I called the new company, they can't find me, but they are going to look more into it and get back to me.

Anyone have any insight?

I currently rent a townhome with my girlfriend, which I HATE throwing away about $18k a year in rent and currently owe about 62k in student loans so my questions are:

1.     Should my first investment be paying off my high interest rate student loans?

I had uploaded a resume onto Indeed and similar websites recently, so this contact was not unexpected. I did a background check through glassdoor on the company (AGCO), and it looked pretty good! They sent me an email saying that in addition to the position that I had applied for, which I had no recollection of, they had a finance related position open that they had not interviewed anyone for and therefore could guarantee the position. Promising! I did think that it was strange that the company was using hotmail and a gmail with an informal address, but I'd seen stranger things before. I asked about the job because it sounded very vague (""working with customer payments""), and received similarly vague responses (""follow specific instructions"").

However, they wanted me to complete one task before hiring in order to gauge my proficiency. And of course, it was the whole ""here's a large check, keep a small amount and forward the rest to our client"". I said no.

Here's the telling email. I can share the other interactions as well if anyone is interested and the mods allow it. Be careful out there, everyone!

investing,"I have an idea, please poke holes in it","I won't go into immense detail with specific statistics, rates, numbers etc. as I am not even quite sure if the moral/ethical aspect of this hypothesis is appropriate. But anyway, here goes nothing:

Many of you might be aware of SLABS (student loan asset backed securities) and the parallels they draw with the securitized mortgages that ultimately led to the 2008 financial crisis. Much like the MBS's, SLABS are divided into tranches and treated similarly to any other security; however, unlike MBS's, student loans are not distributed on the basis of the student's future employment, meaning that if families X and Y make the same amount of money and have virtually identical lifestyles, but their children major in finance and English lit., they will both receive the same amount of student loans, be it from P2P, government, or private distributors. You can already see how this might be a problem: the English lit. major, under 99% of all circumstances, will make less money than the finance major throughout their career and therefore pay-off their student loans at a much slower rate.

Governmental student loans, while smaller (and shrinking in size every year), have lower interest rates than their P2P and private counter parts. As such, the current trend is to pay off loans from P2P's and banks first and then the government loans, a trend that is making it more difficult for the government to distribute loans in the future, as the returns are being realized in smaller amounts and over longer periods of time.

So it begs the question: why do students with vastly differing future income prospects receive the same amount of student aid? This is where ethics comes in: it is every American's right to receive an education. Yet, with the cyclical trend of delinquent students choosing unprofitable majors and not paying off their loans in a timely manner, they are inhibiting future students' access to loans, which in itself is an ethical dilemma: should you choose a major that can ultimately bar a future student from receiving a loan? Of course that's an extreme way of thinking, but you get the picture. 

This is a proposed solution that I've been mulling. Now, toss your moral compass out the window and keep in mind that I am not discrediting or shaming any ""unprofitable"" major or area of expertise. Basically, there are quite a few statistics on employment and majors tied with employment (i.e. X% of Y majors end up in XX sector and so on and so forth), including average salaries right out of college. I propose that as opposed to unilaterally distributing loans on the basis of the student's family income, loans should be distributed (including interest rates, loan gross amount) as a function of future employment and salary. For instance, if 95% of English majors end up unemployed or employed in a irrelevant sector, they simply shouldn't be given the same amount of money as a student who goes into, say, computer science or engineering. You might ask, well won't that discourage English as a major? Well yes, that's the point. There is clearly low demand for people with that major and, as more and more people choose not to major in English, the hope is that rates will normalize over the long-run and people who major in English will not find it as competitive of a field as previously thought. 

Of course, this will need yearly or semi-annual adjustments according to more recent census data and, while this may initially bare expenses of their own, the decrease in delinquency rates may encourage the government to subsidize some of these costs. After all, the goal of the program wouldn't be to increase profitability, it would be to tackle a nation-wide unemployment issue, in addition to circumventing a potential bubble in SLABS.

personalfinance,"Phishing Phone Callers (""Chase Bank"") have my last 4 among other personal information- what should I do?","Hey all,

Short version: phishing scammers have my personal info to include the last 4 of my social. What should I do??

So today I got a call from an unknown number. The caller and her ""supervisor"" said they were calling from Chase Bank, with whom I have several accounts. They were Americans and sounded legit at first so it took a minute or so before my alarm bells went off (as far as phishing goes, it was an admittedly slick operation.) They asked for my credit card number to which I replied ""which one?"", after which they asked for the last 4 of my SSN and I told them. It was then I realized that ""I done goofed"". (The moment those four digits left my mouth I thought ""ah sh*t."")

I played along with the call out of curiosity, partly to determine how much of my info they already had. After getting my last 4 they asked me for my mother's maiden name. I lied and said ""Smith"" then asked them to read my last 4 back to me, after which I said ""no you must have misheard me, what I said was [*similar but different 4 digits*]."" I then insisted that I didn't have one of the credit cards they claimed I had (even though I did, so another fib). After a while I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and when she put me on hold I hung up.

I am worried because it was apparent that, before they even called, they already knew:

1. My full name
2. My personal cell phone number
3. The types of accounts I hold with Chase
4. The balances of said accounts

What they did not know and tried to determine was:

1. My mother's maiden name 
2. Last 4 of SSN (which they now have, for all intents and purposes)
3. Credit Card Numbers (I was asked but did not provide them)

What should I do? Obviously I think I should alert Chase Bank, but what measures can I take now that I know at least one scammer party has enough of my PII to potentially cause me some serious woe? Should I re-activate my Lifelock account?",finance,1459540865
personalfinance,What action can somebody take if their paycheck is wrongfully docked?,"My girlfriend works as a desk assistant for a college. The week before spring break the desks still had to be manned, but for some reason they changed the system (for just that week). What they did for that week instead was have the manager estimate everybody's expected hours and put them into the system that way, instead of having employee's clock in/out themselves (I assume to be corrected later, for whatever reason). Additionally their was also a paper sign in sheet for clock-in/clock-out that was supposed to be signed (for proof that you showed up). She picked up the first shift of the week and there was no sheet to sign yet (and no indication that she was supposed to do anything different), so later that week somebody else claimed her hours on the paper. She did not know their was supposed to be an in/out sheet and was not informed that management had already input their estimated hours for the week, so she clocked in/out through the system as normal, which fed back an error that she reported to management (the error being she was clocked in/out twice because the Management already put in peoples hours for that week). They never responded, but her paycheck that week came out normal, so we thought no harm done.

Fast forward to this week and her paycheck is short three hours. The managements explanation is that she was payed for somebody else's shift (they say the first shift she worked that week, with no sign in sheet), even though the schedule lists the shift as hers and she worked it. She even has the e-mail about the system error and a picture of the schedule to prove it is her shift. Even if they had overpaid her by accident and were correcting for it (which is not the case), the docking brings this paycheck below minimum wage for hours worked this week.

So in summary a few questions:

1. Is it legal for them to dock her paycheck without her permission to correct their error?

2. Is there some action to take against the other employee who tried to claim GF's hours?

3. What legal action can we pursue against the employers in response to this if they refuse to concede?

personalfinance,"Got out of a high risk/high interest loan, was told I was entitled to a cheque from the old loan company, it has been 6 months.","Basic summary - In spring 2015 I financed a motorcycle at high interest (29.9%) as part of a plan to increase my credit score through a high risk loan company. 

6 months ago I achieved sufficient credit score to trade that bike in and get a new bike at much lower interest later that year. I made a $4500 down payment, traded in my old bike and the bank bought out the old loan.

The person in finance at the dealership said because I didn't have the loan to long I was entitled to a cheque for 500-600 from the old loan company, he was kind of vague as to why (and its been a long time) i was so excited about my new purchase that I assumed everyone would just do right and I would see a cheque in the mail in a few weeks.

 Here is where I feel lost. The person in finance quit with that dealership and shredded his files, the new person in finance has none of my records to indicate why I am owed this money, and the high risk loan company is flat out denying ever having heard of this kind of thing, even though the lady at the switchboard for the same company finished my sentence about my situation not knowing who i was or why i was calling when i started to explain things.

The loan was bought out 6 months ago and I just assumed the old loan company was just taking their sweet time paying me this money until I got fed up dealing with the new finance person at the dealership (who had no interest in helping me). The events above (him leaving and shredding his files) happened in this time period. 

I got off the phone with the old loan company an hour ago because their accounting department had already gone home for the day (time zone difference) I will be following up with the person there on monday...

Is anyone familiar with high risk auto finance, and what this refund or payment i was supposed to recieve may be? I am getting zero help from anyone and have no access to documentaton. I will demand all documents pertaining to my old loan on monday to be mailed to me including the contract i signed but there is not much else I can do...

personalfinance,"Caught in an expensive car lease, barely making ends meet and getting behind.","Hi everyone.

This is a desperate attempt at some much needed advice. I've been trying to get my SO to post here because he's the one who really knows the details of our financial situation (he likes to keep a lot to himself not to stress me out).

Backstory of the past year or so. I got laid off from my first ""real job"" but wasn't able to save any money there because I got paid very little and at the end was getting a huge chunk out of my paycheck for health insurance even though I'd declined it...ugh that's a whole other story. On top of that I developed a lot of anxiety and since then I was on unemployment but still applying for any and all jobs with no luck. Still am doing so. I anticipate a lot of judgment and hate for me being unemployed and I just want to say it's not a choice although the anxiety does make the search a lot more difficult. Not an excuse, I'm getting help for it, and I know a huge solution to our problems would be for me to finally get a frickin job!! 

Around the time I got laid off, my car that we shared (mostly him because he needed it more), died. We'd spent any savings we had to fix it up the months prior to it finally being not worth it. So again, broke and no car to do his job. 

So, we were stupidly naive and decided to lease a Prius so we could have a car and he could make extra money doing Uber/Lyft. The plan was to do that full time when he quit his job of 5 years. It was an extremely high stress, low paying, many over time hours not paid for, and no room to grow job that he had to get out of. He quit in December and has been doing driving jobs since full time and we're just not getting by. 

Despite our calculations, we haven't been able to catch up and we're behind on car payments, bills, etc. We need to change something and fast. We live with his mom and pay rent and bills and the huge reason we both quit our jobs is because we want to move out of here and this city ASAP. The plan was to save money to move out; obviously not happening.

The breakdown is:
He makes around $2800 a month doing his driving gig.

* -$600 car payment (1 year into 3 year lease)

* -$600 rent, plus maybe $150 other bills= -$800 rounded up

* -$150 his car insurance, $63 for mine= -$215

* -$250 for our cell phones

* -$150 for cable (which needs to be turned off ASAP I know) 

Which leaves around $785 for groceries, gas, etc. We go out to eat or do something fun maybe once a month now and always do something cheap. Sometimes (and it pisses me the eff off) we've gotten suckered into paying for family event things. Things like that come up, and also late fees that end up leaving us with nothing to save.

He has student loans and about 2k in credit card debt. I have credit card debt also from years ago I am slowly paying off. He has (or had?) good credit, but now who knows because he is behind. Also I don't know how it works getting out of a car lease and how that will effect his credit. Obviously he'd be out of his current job and without a car. I've brought up trying to get a loan for a cheap car, but if he has no job then how would he get a loan? I've also suggested getting a much cheaper leased car but even then, we don't have money for a down payment. 

Let me also emphasize in an ideal world, yeah, his mom would help us out by not asking for rent. She wants us out of here too and literally makes our lives a living hell, but she's not going to do that. The most we can do is cut off the cable. 

I don't come to this sub often, which is probably obvious considering our situation, so I don't know how kind you all are...Just want to express as I have to every friend, family member, my therapist, etc. that we know we've effed up along the way and I know I need a job, and I want one! We're good, hard working, educated people and we might just be naive pushovers who are very overwhelmed and scared.

I thank any and all advice, even if you just read through some of that. It's complicated and I probably left out a lot.

personalfinance,What to do about 144k in student loans,"Ok, I did a really silly thing and went to law school, and now I am staring roughly 144k dollars in loans in the face, I have about 11 loans varying in size and interest rates, with about 25k of the total left over from undergrad and the rest from graduate plus loans.

The majority of my interest rates are over 6.21%, with one particular $25K bastard at 7.2%.  

The good news is I have a job at the moment, and it pays me 65k a year in salary, and if I don't screw it up that number will likely grow.

I currently have my loans in income based repayment plans, and when I made this transition I didn't have a job and had no income, so my required payments are 0, (but I've been paying 800 a month since I got my job). 

I have been getting offers from various student loan consolidation lenders with fixed interest rates below 4%, which seems super tempting.  My question is, should I consolidate and refinance my loans with a private lender at a low rate, or should I just keep my government loans in the hopes my rates may be reduced/forgiven. Also, income based repayments are automatically forgiven after 20 years, but the remaining balance is counted as gross income for tax purposes!

btc,A different perspective on inflation (and why gold bugs don't really understand why gold is so good. Hint: it's not intrinsic value) -Bitcoin mentioned.,"Long read ahead

Over the years I have refined my thoughts and ideas about the engineering of money. I consider the issuance of money a problem similar to what engineers face with the design of any system. The economists that run the economy of today are more magicians than engineers. They are full of unclear ideas, unclear terminology
and a tendency to overcomplicate things.

Take the word inflation for example. In economics it can mean monetary inflation where the supply of money is increased, or it can mean price inflation where it means the price of something is going up. It would be useful to have a separate word for separate ideas. I personally think of inflation as
""supply inflation"". In addition to this lack of clarity there is a lack of understanding about important things. Even intelligent people can't seem to grasp what inflation is.

To first understand inflation it's useful to start with a perfect money system; a system where there is no inflation. That system is a casino. A casino has tokens that they give out when collateral is supplied. Your 100 dollars worth of casino tokens is still worth 100 dollars at the end of your night of gaming. This system of money is perfect in that it has no ""supply inflation"". There is no need for interest rates
, fancy tricks, or central planning such as quantitative easing. There is no scarcity of money that prevents the night from continuing on.

So if this system is so perfect, how is it different than our current system? It is actually pretty simple. The key difference between that system and ours is TIME. In the casino, collateral exists at the time of the loan, for the amount of the loan. This means that the money that represents that collateral is issued at a 1:1 ratio. In our system where money is created by being loaned into circulation, this isn't true. 
Instead the collateral that backs
a loan does not exist at the time of the loan and only exists partially over time as it is created by the work that is done to pay the debt. With some large loans a down payment is sometimes given, but even in this situation the collateral is only partially existent at the time of the creation of the money. When a loan is given money is created. It is created all at once and not over time. However, it is paid back 
over time and not all at once. 
This guarantees that inflation takes place. 
When a loan is given, Principal(P) is created. Over time the debtor pays back this loan and the money they pay is part P and part interest(I). As the loan is paid back, P is destroyed. This means that while a debt based system is inflationary, the debt itself keeps the inflation from being runaway inflation. It follows logically that the length in time of a loan is directly related to it's inflationary impact 
because the longer 
a loan is, the more discrepancy there is between when the money is created (at the beginning) and when the capital backing up that money is created (at the end). 
An infinitely long loan is completely inflationary and a loan that 
is incredibly short is negliblbly inflationary (In a debt based non-reserve monetary system).

There are certain people in the world such as Ron Paul who want a full reserve gold backed monetary system. If this happened, the time element would change because in order to create new money... in order to make a loan you would first need to acquire the capital (the gold) to give it. This means that the inflation in this system would be like the casino; since the collateral exists before the loan is given, 
then inflation can't happen because the money represents capital and 
capital already exists in full. Even some gold proponents are confused about why gold is actually good as money. They think it is because gold has some inherent or ""intrinsical worth"" . It's actually because it prevents inflation by acting as a capital that needs to be acquired (worked for) before the paper money (or electronic) representing it is printed into circulation.

The dectractors

There have been some misconceptions about how gold is actually bad and they aren't actually golds fault. One example is that when banks used gold, often it wasn't in a full reserve way. Banks figured out from very early on that they could lend in excess of their actual gold reserves because nobody would notice unless they all tried to get their gold at the same time. Since bankers earn interest on loans it is easy
to see how bankers were motivated to lend in excess of the gold that actually was held in reserves. This is called ""fractional reserve banking"". This often lead to ""runs on the bank"" because when people went to cash in their bills for the metal that backed them there was not actually enough metal in the vaults so they would all panic. This is not a symptom or problem of gold. That is a symptom of greedy banking.

There are also some who claim that being able to create money without having to wait for the capital that backs it (say gold for instance) to be created results in the ability to print lots of money which spurs growth. I find these claims dubious... but it certaintly seems that it has worked in ""artificial wealth creation"" and inflating the stock markets.

Even if we are to assume that a system where money is loaned and created into
circulation ahead of time before the capital that backs it up is a good idea, we could still easily design a better system than we have today.

Interest rates

In a system where you have a fully backed currency, where some asset needs to be acquired before the money that represents that asset is issued, interest rates make sense. Who is willing to lend out their capital for free? Interest becomes the price of money in such a scenario. In a full gold backed monetary system, people are only going to lend their gold out if they get something in return. Interest makes sense.

But in the system that we have today, interest has become something else. Instead of being ""the price of money"" interest has actually turned the users of our currency into a sort of quasi type of insurance. Interest acts as a type of insurance. It does that because banks charge it as their service fee for the creation of money. This cost and burden to society is huge, and banks justification for this is that some 
loans default. That means that the exorbitantly high price
that everyone pays to use the money system that we have today is justified because of failed loans. I say exorbitantly high because if all money is created from loans then all money in circulation is earning interest. Interest as we know it today is a form of insurance. This is actually a very clever and I would even suggest evil thing for a few reasons:

Reason 1: On a typical mortagage you can pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest to banks. The banks service? Editing an electronic ledger and creating money. How much of that money is actually justifiably paid? But forget that. Banks justification is that it covers the risk or cost of failed loans. It would be incredibly easy to save the users of money these tremendous costs by cutting out the middle man.
How do you cut out the middleman? Instead of charging interest and using that as justification for failed loans, instead you could simply cut the bank out entirely by not paying interest at all and absolving the banks of having to step in when a loan is failed. In such a situation the loan would be left in circulation. If you have been reading along you would know that this means the loan is not paid back which means it is not 
destroyed and since the length of a loan is deterministic of its inflationary impact then that cost to users would be transfered through inflation rather than interest rates, saving enormously.

Reason 2: This interest the banks charge as their service makes loans harder to pay back. If the justification of interest is failed loans, and interest makes it harder to pay a loan back this results in a self reinforcing feedback loop.

Reason 3: If you break down the amortization of a loan over time you would see that initially a great proportion of the payments on a loan in the beginning are towards interest and not princinpal. Since interest is simply recirculated in the economy, and since interest significantly makes it harder to pay a loan back in terms of time this means that loans are artificially long which creates an inflationary effect. If a mortagage was given without 
interest then it would be able to be paid much sooner rather than later and proportionally it's payments are 100% principal so none of it gets recirculated.

Reason 4: Since banks profit is centered around interest and since interest is a proportion of the size and amount of loans given, banks are actually incentivized to loan as much and as big as possible. And now since ""banks are too big to fail"" they are also incentivized to invest as risky as possible. If you eliminate interest it completely eliminates these bad incentives.

So what is the solution to money?

The first solution to fixing the problem of money is to legalize competition. Let the best money win. As it stands right now there is a legally aided cabal in place that gives a monopoly to bad money. The federal reserve is a private cabal of banks that is privately owned. If the laws aiding this were removed everything could compete on its own merit.

Step 2

Separate public and private money. The government, for its expenses should spend the money it needs into circulation and tax it back out. This system is incredibly simple and transparent. If managed well, it would be inflation free. If not managed well, then the public servants which are paid with the public money would be hurt the most. This puts the incentives in the right place. If politicians are in charge
of spending money and paying government employees including themselves then they are incentivized to do it responsibly because they will be the ones left holding the bag if they try to inflate it. Since competition will be legal, public money would have to compete with private money. As it stands right now, countries all over the world go into debt and are at the risk of bankruptcy when they themselves have the power to create their
own money. It is incredibly dangerous to let anyone private supply the money to the government instead of the government doing it themselves. Napoleon knew this and it is why he said ""The hand that gives is greater than the hand that takes"". He was talking about banks. It is dangerous to delegate this power to someone else. As it stands right now the situation in the United states is rather ridiculous. The USA has the power
to create its own money. Instead, it goes to the federal reserve who then create it from nothing and charge interest.

Step 3

For private money, the best money will win. Some think it will be a gold or precious metal full reserve ""honest"" currency. I think that a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin would be superior to a gold backed one. There are a couple of key reasons for this:

reason 1: The storage , transportation and security of gold is very costly and inefficient. The storage, security and transportation of Bitcoin is not only vastly superior but it is far more versatile.
reason 2: There is the old problem of fractional reserves with gold that doesn't apply to bitcoin because it is possible to mathematically offer proof of reserves. You don't need to trust the ""bitcoin bank"" and you don't need to trust the auditor of the bitcoin bank because this proof of reserves bypasses the reliance on trust. Gold does not offer this

step 4

While still on the subject, it's possible for either the government or even a private organization to create a money that isn't asset backed but is still relatively inflation free by sticking to the principles that I described above. Since competition would be legalized nobody would be forced to use such a system but they might if it was maintained responsibly. Here is how it would work:
Money is loaned into circulation just like today but with the interest component removed. Instead the bank whether public or private would rely on service fees. When a potential debtor comes asking for a loan the same criteria is measured: What is their credit? How is their ability measured to pay back the loan? But instead of a loan being automatically given they would have to bid against others based on time. The debtor that
was willing to offer the shortest time (And thus least inflationary impact) for their loan with the ability and means to receive the loan would win the bid. You could of course work out some of the details, but I would bet it is possible to do so.",cryptocurrency,1459567417
personalfinance,Mortgage rates and APR. Is this rate way too high to consider?,"So I am looking for a home, I have over $60,000USD in savings, no debts beyond credit cards that get fully paid off before they are due (collecting air miles so I use for as much as I can) and a leased car . Married late 30's no kids yet but just under a year of credit history in this country (USA) on a work visa L1B with aims of applying for a greencard. 

I know that credit is everything in this country and so far my credit score around 653, which I hear is not great and might make getting a good rate on a mortgage harder. 

Anyway, I am looking for a cheap home with a cheap mortgage, nothing fancy, but nothing old so hopefully no big unexpected expenses. I have seen a 3 bed 30 y/o condo that fits the bill for about $160,000, with a HOA of $285 and taxes of $4500 a year. It has a brand new heating and condenser installed along with a hot water tank and an attached garage. 

Anyway, to the mortgage. I plan on borrowing 120,000 and putting 40,000 down. The interest rate they offered is 4.75% and it says an APR of 8.04%. The term is 30 years but I don't care about that as I plan to pay back $3-4,000 a month with a mind to pay it off as quickly as possible. 

Oh and it is a variable rate mortgage locked into the rate above for the first 7 years. Which if I keep my high repayment schedule will not matter as the debt would have been cleared by then. 

But, I am hesitent to purchase the mortgage because the rate is so high and I don't want to be paying so high a yearly debt figure (about $9600 a year). The housing martlet is pretty crap here though. Looking around for cheaper places, I can only find 1 bed apartment/condo's of about 500-600 square feet and costing around $80-90,000 at a minimum. Sure it is cheaper, but much smaller so no room to grow and probably no room to setup a home office. 

So, is this mortgage a terrible idea? Should I just go for something as cheap as possible?  I would aim to get it paid ASAP (1-2 years), and then possibly rent it out and try to buy a better place. The issue with that plan is what if a baby comes along? No space! What about the lack of storage for bikes etc. 

Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.


# Edit/Update

Ok, so I decided to say fuck them! I'm going to try to avoid the whole debt trap and try to find a crappy little apartment with a tiny home loan that I can pay off in a year. 

Then I can save up the monies and make another decision in a couple of years times. 

Yeah! Years of living in Asia have paid off because a 60 square meter apartment seems big to me! Hahaha.",finance,1459567826

60000 income, including health insurance and employer match retirement. Roughly 3200 take home.


Current rent including utilities, etc: 650$ per month
Splitting 2 bedroom 2 bath with a friend.

Savings:16000 total right now, could be 25,000-30000 in a year.


Debt: car loan 5000, paid at 300 per month (less than 2 percent interest rate)


Retirement: 35-40 years from retirement,  currently contributing 700 per month between employer plan and roth. 23000 saved so far.


Live in a moderately priced city where real estate is supposedly going to rise about 4 percent next year.



Should I:


A) buy a about 160000$ or less house or condo, with at least 2 bedrooms/ bathrooms and get a roommate,  splitting utilities plus charging about 500$ per month? I'm hoping to reduce the impact of the increased housing costs.


B) Wait a year until more is saved and car loan is gone, but thus possibly losing out on 3% grant program for 1st time home buyers and rising housing prices, plus losing 1 year of rent that could have gone to housing? 


Factors: 
- I'm ready for a little more space and eager to own my own home


-I want to make some money through buying, though I understand it's much riskier than renting. I like the idea of my rent money not being thrown away.


-I'm comfortable with staying in the same location 2-3 years but unsure beyond that. Could perhaps rent the place out if I moved.

politics,The Company She Keeps: Why I Cannot Vote for Hillary Clinton,"Disclaimer: I am a Bernie Sanders supporter. I've already voted for him and would not vote for Hillary Clinton if she becomes the Dem. nominee.

I am very concerned by the people Hillary Clinton decides to associate with, whether it be directly in her campaigns (past &amp; present) or those who she collaborates with. Here are four individuals which cause me to worry about a Clinton presidency:

1. [Henry Kissinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger): Hillary Clinton has touted the supporter she has received from Kissinger, stating that she was [""very flattered when Henry Kissinger said [she] ran the State Department better than anybody had run it in a long time.""](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/02/hillary-clinton-kissinger-vacation-dominican-republic-de-la-renta). However, I, like Sen. Sanders, am not sure this is an 'endorsement' (for lack of a better word) she should be so proud of. Among the many controversial actions undertaken by the US during Kissinger's tenure as Sec. of State, the US support of Pakistan, [depsite its genocidal actions](http://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21586514-new-history-sheds-fresh-light-shameful-moment-american-foreign-policy-blood), is perhaps the most damning. A book by Christopher Hitchens, entitled [*The Trials of Henry Kissinger*](http://www.amazon.com/Trial-Henry-Kissinger-Christopher-Hitchens/dp/145552297X), goes into great detail about Kissinger's tenure and makes the argument that Kissinger should be tried for war crimes. A good summary of Kissinger's nefarious actions can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lw3B8vjIC0), where Hitchens discusses Kissinger's role in Vietnam and Chile. In my opinion, a Clinton presidency will lead to more war and more interventionist policies, which have been to shown to fail on a consistent basis.

2. [David Brock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brock): Brock is the founder of Media Matters for America and pro-Clinton SuperPac ""Correct the Record"". He is also a board member of Priorities USA Action, a PAC which is supporting Hillary Clinton this election cycle. PACs aside, the real cause for pause regarding David Brock is his smearing of Anita Hill which Brock expanded upon in his book [*The Real Anita Hill*](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Anita-Hill-David-Brock/dp/0029046564). Since it's publishing, and Brock's transition from right wing operative to left wing operative, Brock has [disavowed the premise of the book](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/27/us/book-author-says-he-lied-his-attacks-anita-hill-bid-aid-justice-thomas.html), admitting that his book was founded on lies in order to support the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Hillary has a serious problem regarding the public's perception of her [honesty and trustworthiness](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/politics/washington-post-abc-news-national-poll-march-3-6-2016/1982/). Associating herself with David Brock does nothing to assuage that perception.

3. [Debbie Wasserman Schultz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Wasserman_Schultz): I know I am preaching to the choir here and most of this info is probably not new to most of you. Now Chair of the DNC, Schultz was the co-chair of Hillary's losing campaign in 2008. Many people, including Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley, have accused her of [intentionally scheduling Democratic primary debates at times which would result in low viewership.](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/12/18/martin-omalley-and-bernie-sanders-bristle-at-holding-debates-on-weekends/). In more recent weeks, the DNC (reminder: she's the the Chair) rolled back Obama's restriction on [donations from federal lobbyists and PACs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/dnc-allowing-donations-from-federal-lobbyists-and-pacs/2016/02/12/22b1c38c-d196-11e5-88cd-753e80cd29ad_story.html). Clinton has consistently stated her goal to limit the role of money in politics, but was surprisingly silent on this issue. Even more recently, Schultz voted [to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFTP) from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/mar/30/tim-canova/debbie-wasserman-schultz-attacked-bank-donations-a/). In [the article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-canova/debbie-wasserman-schultz-payday-loans_b_9360186.html), written by Tim Canova, he suggests that Schultz's large donations from commercial banks, including Goldman Sachs, may have influenced her vote. Will a Hillary Clinton presidency accomplish the goal of getting money out of politics? I'm skeptical at best.

4. [Haim Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haim_Saban): Saban is a staunchly pro-Israel media executive. Among his pro-Israel positions, he has made conflicting [remarks in regards to the Iran Deal](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/08/13/top-hillary-clinton-donor-clarifies-stance-on-iran-nuclear-deal/), initially saying it was a ""bad deal"" which needed to be fought against. He then 'clarified' his views, saying he thought the deal was ""far from perfect."" Saban has also told PM of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, that if Netanyahu found the deal ""unsatisfactory,"" then he should [""bomb the living daylights""](http://forward.com/opinion/national/325490/does-hillary-clinton-have-a-haim-saban-problem/) out of Iran. Why does this matter?Well, Hillary Clinton has received more in donations from Saban [than any other individual](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/11/19/the-top-20-donors-who-have-given-the-most-to-support-hillary-clintons-political-runs/). You may say that this does not mean he has influence over Clinton. Think again. [Here's a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2158218-hillary-clintons-letter-to-haim-saban-against-bds.html) Clinton wrote to Haim in regards to the BDS movement against Israel.

I've been looking into consolidating my loans. My plan is to move back home with my parents in order to make some bigger payments in the beginning. I'm also expecting that I should be able to make a $2,500 payment once I graduate with my leftover ""college"" money. 

  

I do currently have a part time job at Costco, making about $800 a month. The plan would be to pay $400/month until I find a better, full time job that pays better so I can jump up to $500/month. According to my calculations, by paying $400/month from July-December of this year, then $500/month from then on, with $900 payments in January or February from tax refunds, I can have my loans paid off in less than 5 years. 

  

I guess what I'm wondering is, is this feasible? Has anyone had experience with consolidating their federal student loans?

545 vs. 300,000,000 People
-By Charlie Reese

Politicians are the only people in the world who create problems and then campaign against them.

 

Have you ever wondered, if both the Democrats and the Republicans are against deficits, WHY do we have deficits?

 

Have you ever wondered, if all the politicians are against inflation and high taxes, WHY do we have inflation and high taxes?

 

You and I don't propose a federal budget. The President does.

 

You and I don't have the Constitutional authority to vote on appropriations. The House of Representatives does.

 

You and I don't write the tax code, Congress does.

 

You and I don't set fiscal policy, Congress does.

 

You and I don't control monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Bank does.

 

One hundred senators, 435 congressmen, one President, and nine Supreme Court justices equates to 545 human beings out of the 300 million are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country.

 

I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered, but private, central bank.

 

I excluded all the special interests and lobbyists for a sound reason. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a President to do one cotton-picking thing. I don't care if they offer a politician $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes.

 

Those 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fault. They cooperate in this common con regardless of party.

 

What separates a politician from a normal human being is an excessive amount of gall. No normal human being would have the gall of a Speaker, who stood up and criticized the President for creating deficits. The President can only propose a budget. He cannot force the Congress to accept it.

 

The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Who is the speaker of the House now? He is the leader of the majority party. He and fellow House members, not the President, can approve any budget they want. If the President vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to.

 

It seems inconceivable to me that a nation of 300 million cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted -- by present facts -- of incompetence and irresponsibility. I can't think of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to those 545 people. When you fully grasp the plain truth that 545 people exercise the power of the federal government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to exist.

 

If the tax code is unfair, it's because they want it unfair.

 

If the budget is in the red, it's because they want it in the red.

 

If the Army &amp; Marines are in Iraq and Afghanistan it's because they want them in Iraq and Afghanistan ...

 

If they do not receive social security but are on an elite retirement plan not available to the people, it's because they want it that way.

 

There are no insoluble government problems.

 

Do not let these 545 people shift the blame to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish; to lobbyists, whose gifts and advice they can reject; to regulators, to whom they give the power to regulate and from whom they can take this power. Above all, do not let them con you into the belief that there exists disembodied mystical forces like ""the economy,"" ""inflation,"" or ""politics"" that prevent them from doing what they take an oath to do.

 

Those 545 people, and they alone, are responsible.

 

They, and they alone, have the power.

 

They, and they alone, should be held accountable by the people who are their bosses. Provided the voters have the gumption to manage their own employees...

 

We should vote all of them out of office and clean up their mess!

personalfinance,Friend did the dumbest thing - any way to get out of this? (IRA distribution of 40k then 90 days later put it back in),"Hi /r/personal finance,

So as the title says, a friend of mine took out 40k for a home down payment and then 90 days put 50k back in. He already owned a home beforehand so he would not qualify for the first time home buy exception of 10k. Further, he does not qualify for the 60 day exception because he reinvested the money back into the IRA 90 days after taking money out. He's filing married filing separately so he can't get a 5,500 IRA contribution deduction. The only known exception I can find is writing to the IRS a Private Letter Ruling to get it exonerated but that is a no go because it costs 10k to even get the ruling. They withheld federal taxes @ 25% but he'll be hit with a 4,000 federal tax penalty (early withdrawal penalty) and be hit with state taxes (not withheld).

Is there anything he can do? Advice is much appreciated!",finance,1459605573

personalfinance,"Buying house from grandparents in private sale - do I absolutely need a home inspection, title search &amp; insurance, escrow account, etc.?","My grandparents have moved into a retirement home and I am buying their old but well-maintained and remodeled house that they bought back in 1989.

They have agreed that they/their estate will carry the note and I get an interest rate of 2.25%, which is this month's Applicable Federal Rate. I am having an attorney who specializes in probate/trust and real estate law oversee the transaction, although I may also consider doing a lot of this myself through National Family Mortgage, who can handle the mortgage payments and register the loan with the county recorder so I can take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction.

My concern is that I want to expedite this as much as possible, because I don't know if the AFR will rise next month (2.25% is pretty damn good). I am very familiar with the property and all the work that has been done to it (indeed, I helped with some of it), and I'm also familiar enough with the property that I would be very surprised if there were any liens or encumbrances that would come back to bite me. My wife and I are also very savvy savers that I don't think we would need an escrow account to pay the taxes and insurance, as we can set money aside for that directly. Given how much time this takes to set up, I'm wondering if I can skip all this and just get the appraisal, promissory note, and other associated paperwork done without all the extraneous stuff that usually goes with having a bank or mortgage lender involved?

I am, of course, going to bring all of this up when I talk to my attorney, but I wanted to see what PF thought.

personalfinance,Problem with BofA credit card,"I know there is a credit card sub, but you can see the tumble weeds blowing down the street there. In Jan I mailed a payment in for my Bank of America credit card. A few days before the payment was due in Feb, I checked online, and the check had not arrived. I called into BofA customer service and they suggested setting up online payment/link to my checking account. (Which is with a different bank.) I did, and I made a min payment to give the check more time to show up. The next month, the check still had not arrived, so I called BofA again, and asked what I should do about my lost check floating around out there. The  person I talked to said I should put a stop on the check, and pay online. I said I did not what to have any problems if the check showed up. I was told there would not be, and that a note would be left in my file about it. So I issued the stop with my bank, ($31, thank you sir may I have another) and payed online. The check did in fact show up, BofA tried to cash it, and it obviously did not go through because of the stop. They then issued a returned check fee ($26, ...) . I called to complain, and the person I talked to said that yes there was a record in my file of everything, but they were still going to assess the fee even though I did what they told me to do and they said there would not be a problem. I have filed complaints with the state and the fed. I should try and remain calm, but I am completely outraged. Any suggestions on what else I can do to make them answer for their actions? 

addendum1: Thank you for the feedback. I will get on the phone Mon and try to hunt down a supervisor. Also, I paid off the balance originally owed online already, so the fee and mandatory interest 

on the fee are all that is on the account now.


addendum2: Called BofA again today (Mon), and they removed the charge. They seemed to agree that the charge was wrong in the first place. Someone should tell that to the person I talked to on Friday. Thank you again for feedback.",finance,1459615387
politics,"Clinton's top 20 campaign contributors make up 33.5% of her total campaign funding.

This makes up 33.5% ($48,734,847/$145,412,945) of the Clinton campaign's funding. What's the meaning though right? A lot of these funds really don't look like the kinds of interests the Sanders campaign has been talking about. ""Women's Self Worth Foundation"", ""DE Shaw Research"", ""Center for Middle East Peace"", ""Renaissance Technologies"". No big money interests here right? WRONG. Almost all of these innocuous sounding foundations represent the interests of a very select few extremely wealthy or politically aspiring people. Let's dive in shall we!

We'll start with the most insidious sounding one. #3 on our list: [Euclidean Capital](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-21/billionaire-simons-said-to-hire-ex-bofa-cio-for-family-office). Sounds kinda shady right? What's even *more* shady is that Euclidean was founded by the exact person who founded Renaissance Technologies, [James Harris ""Jim"" Simons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harris_Simons):

James Harris ""Jim"" Simons (born 1938) is an American mathematician, **hedge fund manager**, and philanthropist.

&gt; For more than two decades, Simons' Renaissance Technologies' hedge funds, which trade in markets around the world, have employed mathematical models to analyze and execute trades, many automated. **Renaissance uses computer-based models to predict price changes in financial instruments. These models are based on analyzing as much data as can be gathered, then looking for non-random movements to make predictions.**

Sounds innocent enough right? Well think again:

&gt; On July 22, 2014, Simons was subject to bipartisan condemnation by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations for the use of complex barrier options to shield day-to-day trading (usually subject to higher ordinary income tax rates) as long-term capital gains. **“Renaissance Technologies was able to avoid paying more than $6 billion in taxes by disguising its day-to-day stock trades as long term investments,” said Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.)**, the committee’s ranking Republican, in his opening statement. “Two banks and a handful of hedge funds developed a complex financial structure to engage in highly profitable trades while claiming an unjustified lower tax rate and avoiding limits on trading with borrowed money,” said Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) in his prepared remarks.

Not exactly the most admirable of business operations. Together, Euclidean and Renaissance contributions comprise 3.8% ($5,513,650) of Clinton's *total* campaign. Even if the average American's political contribution was $200 (it's far, far lower), that's still 27,568 times the average contribution amount.

Next let's tackle the Women's Self Worth Foundation. What could possibly be questionable about this foundation right? Well, let's take a look:

[Cheryl Saban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Saban), founder of the Women's Self Worth Foundation:

&gt; Playboy included her in a pictorial titled “Disco Queens. She later divorced her second husband and struggled to provide for her children.

&gt; In 1986, she accepted a job as an assistant for Israeli-American Haim Saban. Haim was an Egyptian born Jew who was raised in Israel and later moved to France where he became a millionaire selling recordings of television theme music.

Not to take anything away from Cheryl Saban but she is clearly not a self-made woman. The Women's Self Worth Foundation would not exist without Haim Saban, who just happens to be the founder of #5 on our list, Saban Capital Group.

&gt; Haim Saban is an Israeli and American media proprietor, investor, philanthropist, musician, record, film &amp; television producer.

&gt; Saban has been a generous and consistent donor to the United States Democratic Party according to his mandatory Federal Election Commission filings. Mother Jones, in an analysis of the major donors to the campaigns of 1998 election cycle, ranked Saban 155th among individual donors. **Amy Paris noted that Saban's Clinton-era ""generosity did not go unrewarded. During the Clinton administration, the entertainment executive served on the President's Export Council, advising the White House on trade issues.""The New York Times reported that Haim and his wife ""slept in the White House several times during President Clinton's two terms.""** Saban remains close friends with the former President. Clinton described Saban as a ""very good friend and supporter."" Saban contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the William J. Clinton Foundation.

My, my, my. That's a pretty cozy relationship the Saban's have with the Clintons. Together, the Sabans contribute 3.46% ($5,034,695) to the Clinton campaign. Nothing like having friends in high places! Mr. Saban also just so happens to fund this little thing called [The Center for Middle East Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Middle_East_Policy), which hosts this little thing called [The Saban Forum](http://www.brookings.edu/about/centers/middle-east-policy/saban-forums)):

&gt; On December 4 to 6, the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings hosted its 12th annual Saban Forum, titled “Israel and the United States: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow.” The 2015 Saban Forum included webcasts featuring remarks by Israel’s Minister of Defense Moshe Ya’alon, Chairman of the Yesh Atid Party Yair Lapid, National Security Adviser to President George W. Bush Stephen Hadley, Secretary of State John Kerry, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (via video), **and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.**

If this isn't an incestuous political relationship I really don't know what is.

This leads into our next specimen, The Centre for Middle East Peace:

It was  founded by someone named [S. Daniel Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Daniel_Abraham) (the creator of SlimFast):

&gt; Abraham was born and raised to an Orthodox Jewish family in Long Beach, New York. **He is frequently included in Forbes 400 list of the 400 wealthiest Americans.**

&gt; **He is a long-time donor to the Democratic Party and the Clinton Foundation.** He gave $1.5 million to the party and ranked as the number one contributor of soft money to the national parties in 2000.

&gt; Abraham is the author of the book Peace is Possible, **with a foreword by President Bill Clinton**. Abraham also published his memoirs in 2010, entitled Everything is Possible: Life and Business Lessons from a Self-Made Billionaire and the Founder of Slim Fast.

Look at that... more cozy Clinton relationships.

Closing out or group of contributors with ties to Israel we have the Pritzker Group (#4 on our list), [owned by the Pritzker Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_family):

&gt; The Pritzker family is an American family of entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and one of the wealthiest families in the United States of America, being near the top of Forbes magazine’s “America’s Richest Families” list since the magazine began listings in 1982.

&gt; The family is most famous for owning the Hyatt hotel chain, and the Marmon Group, conglomerate of manufacturing and industrial service companies which has since been sold to Berkshire Hathaway. Other holdings have included the Superior Bank of Chicago, which notably collapsed in 2001, the TransUnion credit bureau and the Royal Caribbean cruise line.

The Pritzker Group isn't tied to any specific institutes or centres I could find but I just thought I would note them since they are literally one of the wealthiest families in America. [Oh and because of this this](http://blog.palestine-studies.org/2015/07/28/what-would-a-president-clinton-do/):

&gt; J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation. The philanthropic fund of the Chicago-based Pritzker family, owners of the Hyatt hotel chain. **In 2014, the Pritzker foundation donated between $5-10 million to the Clinton Foundation.** Penny Pritzker is one of Obama’s strongest supporters, serving as his campaign finance chair in 2008 and his unofficial liaison to the pro-Israel community. For her efforts, Penny currently serves as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. **Penny’s brother J.B. Pritzker served as the national finance chairman for Citizens for Hillary’s 2008 campaign. J.B. Pritzker’s chief of staff is Lee Rosen, who doubles as the chairman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).** The family has been criticized for building one of their hotels in occupied east Jerusalem following the 1967 war.

If we look at all the contributors with strong ties to Israel (including Soros), they make up 11.62% ($16,896,938) of Clinton's campaign funding.

Let's go a little farther down the list this time shall we? Sitting at #17 is [DE Shaw Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._E._Shaw_Research). Seems innocent enough right? Well this research group has ties to #6 on our list, Paloma Partners founded by [Donald Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sussman), as well as JP Morgan and one of Sussman's hedge funds. Here's where things get all kinds of incestuous:

&gt; S. Donald Sussman (born June 8, 1946) is an American financier and philanthropist, the Chairman of the Board of Trust Asset Management, the founder of the Paloma Funds and New China Capital Management LLC, and a member of the Board of Trustees of Carnegie Hall. Sussman has also served on the Board of Trustees of Skidmore College, the Center for American Progress and the Portland Museum of Art.

&gt; Sussman's career in finance began in 1958, when, at the age of 12, he made a 6x return on a $300 investment in the stock of Michigan Sugar, by correctly predicting that the Cuban Revolution would disrupt sugar supplies and drive up the price of sugar commodities. Sussman went on to found Paloma Partners in 1981, a Connecticut-based hedge fund with over $3 billion in assets under management. **Paloma’s middle and back-office operations were acquired by JPMorgan Worldwide Securities Services in February 2006 for an undisclosed sum.**

&gt; Following the sale to JPMorgan, Sussman has acted as a serial investor and backer of new hedge funds such as Naseem Taleb's Empirica Capital and **David Shaw's D.E. Shaw &amp; Co.**

You guessed it. D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. is the global investment management firm behind DE Shaw Research. But wait, that's not the really incestuous part.  Remember the [Center for American Progress (CAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_American_Progress) that Sussman was on the Board of Trustees for? Well they just so happen to have had a few interesting people work for them in the past:

&gt; The president and chief executive officer of CAP is Neera Tanden, **who worked for the Obama and Clinton administrations and for Hillary Clinton’s campaigns.** The first president and CEO was **John Podesta**, who served as chief of staff to then U.S. President Bill Clinton. Podesta remained with the organization as chairman of the board until he joined the Obama White House staff in December 2013. Tom Daschle is the current chairman.

That certainly is one talented Centre.

Our next guest is [Patricia A. Stryker,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Stryker) founder of #19 on our list, the [Bohemian Foundation.](http://www.bohemianfoundation.org/) Nothing to see here right? ""Bohemian Foundation is committed to the care and enrichment of our local, national, and global communities."" Sounds innocent enough. But Stryker isn't new to politics. It seems her other company, [Stryker Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stryker_Corporation), has had a little trouble when it comes to donating to Democratic candidates in the past:

&gt; Following fraud allegations in November 2007 involving Stryker Corp. overbilling for Medicare in South Dakota, Republicans called on Democratic organizations to return donations they had received from Stryker and her brother, **Jon Stryker.**

[Jon Stryker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Stryker) is another rich, rich guy:

&gt; Jon Lloyd Stryker (born ca. 1958) is an American architect, philanthropist and activist for social and environmental causes. He is a billionaire stockholder and heir to the Stryker Corporation medical supply company fortune of grandfather Homer Stryker alongside sisters Pat and Ronda. In 2015, his net worth was estimated at $2.1 billion.

Cross another innocent sounding foundation off the list.

Our second last subject is #20 on our list, the American Federation of Teachers. How, you ask, could this possibly be questionable. Well here's the answer. The president of the American Federation of Teachers is [Randi Weingarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randi_Weingarten):

&gt; A lifelong Democrat, Weingarten is a member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). She was an early and critically important supporter of Howard Dean as Chairman of the DNC. **She is a superdelegate who was pledged to Hillary Clinton during the 2008 presidential primary.** In January 2009, **she was mentioned as a possible candidate in the appointment process to replace Clinton's U.S. Senate seat.**

Another cozy Clinton relationship. Those Clintons sure are popular!

Finally we have the Barbara Lee Family Foundation. I've left the least shocking for last (sorry to disappoint). [Barbara F. Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_F._Lee) is very, very pro woman politician:

&gt; Since 1999, her foundation has studied and published non-partisan research about women gubernatorial candidates. The following titles are part of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation’s Governors Guidebook Series: Keys to the Governor’s Office (1998), Speaking with Authority (2001), Cracking the Code (2002), Positioning Women to Win (2006), Leading with Authority (2008). Turning Point: The Changing Landscape for Women Candidates will be published in June, 2011. Barbara has helped elect every sitting Democratic woman governor and U.S. Senator by providing strategic advice, candidate training, direct support, and voter mobilization. Barbara frequently hosts events to raise the profile of women elected officials and candidates, such as Women’s Senate, a biennial fundraiser that provides support for progressive women Senators. In 2008, she served as the Co-Chair of the Martha Coakley for Senate Campaign and in 2004, Barbara convened Revolutionary Women, which was held in conjunction with the Democratic National Convention in Boston.

Not that there's anything wrong with that. I just found it interesting.

What's the point of all this? Well, it's simple. A whopping 17.9% ($26.0M) of Hillary Clinton's campaign contributions come from entities that are controlled, funded, owned, or otherwise heavily influenced by just 10 people (if you include Soros) and represent a very limited part of the economy (mostly hedge funds and financial sector related). And these are just the ones I had time to look into (didn't bother with Newsweb Corp because that one kinda speaks for itself in terms of sounding corporate). These 10 people directly or indirectly contribute about 961,964 times the amount of the average Bernie Sanders supporter collectively.

Oh but that's right, Hillary isn't funded by corporate interests... or [Israeli for that matter.](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/at-the-aipac-conference-trump-and-clinton-try-for-a-do-over)

&gt; Clinton’s transformation has been going on for the better part of two years. In August of 2014, in the midst of renewed violence in Gaza, she gave an interview to The Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg in which she came off as a staunch defender of Israel and, at times, as a Netanyahu apologist. She made it clear that Israel could not be expected to pull its forces out completely from the West Bank in the near future. “If I were the prime minister of Israel, you’re damn right I would expect to have control over security,” she said. This amounted to backtracking not only from the official Obama line but from the parameters for peace set by Bill Clinton, which called for a withdrawal of Israeli forces within three years of an agreement. On Monday, Clinton again sought to distance herself somewhat from Obama when she said that she would “vigorously oppose” a unilateral solution put forth by the U.N. Security Council, an option that the President is said to be exploring.

DISCLAIMER: In no way am I trying to promote negativity towards the Israeli community. There is simply too great a connection here to be ignored. These donors with ties to Israel are abiding by the law and have every right to promote those who they believe will best represent their interests. Aside from how screwed up campaign finance is right now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that in my eyes.

btc,The halving disaster hoax debunked,"There will be no disaster. If bitcoin demand stays the same or higher or even lower but not by much the price will increase after halving.

Miners leaving do not make economic sense. The hoax is being based on a **fixed currency rate** that bitcoin is *not*, bitcoin is a **floating currency rate** that follows the law of offer and demand.

*""Currency depreciation is the loss of value of a country's currency with respect to one or more foreign reference currencies, typically in a floating exchange rate system. It is most often used for the unofficial increase of the exchange rate due to market forces, though sometimes it appears interchangeably with devaluation. Its opposite, an increase of value of a currency, is currency appreciation.""*

*""A currency appreciates as a result of increased demand for that currency on world markets: its value in the world market increases. This increase in demand can occur for several reasons: When a country's exports are high, the buyers of these exports need its currency to pay for those exports. When the country's central bank increases interest rates. When employment and per capita income in a country increase, the demand for its goods and services increases, along with demand for that country's currency in the local market. When the demand of the currency is high in foreign exchange market. Due to Government borrowing or loosening of fiscal policy.""*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_appreciation_and_depreciation

Halving does not mean higher demand for bitcoin but lower offer which has the absolute same effect as higher demand.

*""The bolivar is collapsing because the government keeps printing more money and the slump in oil prices means Venezuela is running out of dollars. The amount of cash in circulation or held in bank accounts in Venezuela has doubled from a year earlier, spurring the threat of hyperinflation. The country may face a $38 billion shortfall in its dollar income this year, analysts at Credit Suisse Group AG wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday, meaning a default on government debt is a real possibility this year.""*

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-03/venezuela-bolivar-falls-through-1-000-per-dollar-in-black-market

**How the block size relates to halving? It does not because demand for bitcoin does not need to increase during the halving to cause a price increase. We are already lowering the offer of new money by half which is a lot.**

Right now I'm a bit of a Amazon addict and make a lot of my purchases using Amazon with my debit card. I spend maybe $50ish a month on Amazon. Easily something I can pay off in full every month so I won't have to deal with their interest rate being pretty high. Seems like a good idea because of the rewards and $50 off your purchase for the first time. What do you guys think?

Currently have one credit card with my bank 750ish credit score, 20 years old and a job I don't really have to worry about making the payments. Kinda want to get maybe 1 more credit card so I can keep building my credit.",finance,1459621957

\**Note to the Bernie Sanders campaign*\*

Vet your vetting team.

At least two high level Sanders staff have ties to initiatives run and advised by current and former Clinton acolytes.   Aisha Dew and Joe Caiazzo of the Sanders campaign were both accused independently of sabotage in their own regions.  Allegations were raised over the past month from staff and volunteers under these people.

The Truman National Security Project is behind The Trans Pacific Partnership, which Sanders is against.

**Other info**

On Jan 9, 2013, ""The Truman National Security Project"" merged with ""Center for American Progress"" (founded by John Podesta)  
The Center for American Progress is part of The Democracy Alliance.

**What is the Democracy Alliance?**

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/16/AR2006071600882_pf.html

&gt; A year after its founding, Democracy Alliance has followed up on its pledge to become a major power in the liberal movement. It has lavished millions on groups that have been **willing to submit to its extensive screening process and its demands for secrecy**.

&gt; **These include the Center for American Progress**, a think tank with an unabashed partisan edge, as well as Media Matters for America, which tracks what it sees as conservative bias in the news media. Several alliance donors are negotiating a major investment in Air America, a liberal talk-radio network.

&gt; Democracy Alliance was formed last year with **major backing from billionaires such as financier George Soros and Colorado software entrepreneur Tim Gill**. The inspiration, according to founders, was a belief that Democrats became the minority party in part because liberals do not have a well-funded network of policy shops, watchdog groups and training centers for activists equivalent to what has existed for years on the right.

&gt; ""Everything we invest in should have not just short-term impact but long-term impact and sustainability,"" she said. The group requires nondisclosure agreements because many donors prefer anonymity, Wade added. Some donors expressed concern about being attacked on the Web or elsewhere for their political stance; others did not want to be targeted by fundraisers.

&gt; ""Like a lot of elite groups, we fly beneath the radar,"" said Guy Saperstein, an Oakland lawyer and alliance donor. But ""we are not so stupid though,"" he said, to think ""we can deny our existence.""

&gt; Those who make the cut have prospered. **The Center for American Progress (CAP), which is led by former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta, received $5 million in the first round** because it was seen as a liberal version of the Heritage Foundation, which blossomed as a conservative idea shop in the Reagan years, said one person closely familiar with alliance operations. CAP officials declined to comment.

&gt; **The exclusive donor club includes millionaires such as Susie Tompkins Buell and her husband, Mark Buell, major backers of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)**, and Chris Gabrieli, an investment banker running for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Massachusetts this September. Mark Buell estimated that about 70 percent of alliance partners built their own wealth, while 30 percent became wealthy through inheritances.

**What about this billionaire George Soros guy?**

Soros tied to both the Democracy Alliance, Hillary's SuperPAC, and Move-on?  interesting.  
Move-on is behind scheduling and co-ordination of protests that is giving Bernie's campaign a bad name.

http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/hillary-clinton-george-soros-218494

&gt; George Soros donates $8 million to boost Hillary

&gt; The massive check brings to $8 million the Hungarian-born investor's total 2015 giving to pro-Clinton groups.

&gt; The super PAC that received the $6-million check, Priorities USA Action, raised $25 million in the second half of 2015, according to a report it filed Sunday evening with the Federal Election Commission. The haul brings the PAC’s tally to $41 million for the year, and left it with a strong $36 million in the bank headed into the year.",finance,1459628978

politics,"In the context of US politics, First Past the Post has some awful and maddening consequences","(If you haven't yet, please watch CGP Grey's excellent explanation about the [problem with First Past the Post voting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo))

One of the inevitable consequences of first past the post is that it gravitates towards two-party rule and strategic voting against who you dislike rather than someone who truly aligns with your preferences. This duopoly allows Republicans to become increasingly far-right and Democrats to become increasingly corporatist with impunity. It also disconnects a ton of people from the democratic process, for they are fed up with two-party rule and disillusioned by the sheer influence a tiny elite have on politics and economics.

Under this system, even progressives, centrists, and center-rights cannot mount credible third-party challenges thanks to the spoiler effect: due to the lack of ranked voting, a vote for your true preference is also indirectly a vote against your second choice. It invites gerrymandering and other shit that makes the system even more unfair.

I have written about some of its consequences (minority rule, two-party rule, spoiler effect, gerrymandering, and artificially inflating batshit insane shits like Trump and Cruz) in more detail on my blog. If you'd like to give it a read:

personalfinance,Help with deciding the correct option for me? Consolidation or snowball?,"I have about $12,000 in credit card debt.

I don't have the best credit score so consolidation is for the most part out of the question - except for lendingclub... they are offering $12k, 36 months, but a 31.89% interest rate overall. My debt to income ratio is apparently too high to get approved for lower interest rates.

There are also lower amounts available, but same interest rate.

I make $2500/month right now, and pay $700/m towards credit card debt (just paid off a few, it was $900/m). This isn't the minimums, I'm just paying $100/m on each card, but the interest is taking away a lot of the gains.

My other expenses are utilities, 2 cars, cell phones for my wife and I (she pays the rent with her salary, that's it), and occasionally eating out.

My question is this: would it be a good idea (credit score wise) to pay all of the debt down quickly (consolidation) and then put most of my income towards that, or try the snowball method (which is what I've been doing, but it's very slow and may not improve my credit score fast enough - I'm currently at ~620 - to be approved for a home loan at the end of this year)?

I know the interest rate on the consolidation is very high, but with it my monthly would still be less than what I'm currently paying, and I could put way more towards it as I cut expenses elsewhere. I also know to throw out my credit cards that I do have.

Also, I heard about the Slate credit card, for balance transfers with 0 fees for 15 months, but does that require a high credit score?

Thank you much for looking at this, all advice would be appreciated.

And that's everything on my spreadsheet that I use to keep track of my finances.

Total Debt is around $38k if you include the cars, I owe about $1733.35 in minimums/mo including everything, and make around $2500/mo salary (not including other income but I don't count that).

Also; I'm getting a one-time cash influx of $3800 in 2 weeks. Not sure how to best use that.

Edit 3: There's a flaw in that program I think... it doesn't account for the extra disposable income I could put towards these debts ($600/m), it just accounts for the minimum payments due. How do I account for the extra money I could throw towards all this?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans (3.1% interest rate) or contribute to IRA?,"Hi,

I'm wondering what to do with my money: should I pay off my student loans in full or invest in an IRA/401k? I'm thinking that since I have the money to do it, and the stock market is currently pretty shaky, I should just pay off my loans, since that's a sure bet. I'm currently paying the minimum for my student loans (80 bucks a month) since it's a low interest rate. What do you think?

Some background on my situation:
- I have $6,000 in student debt at a 3.1% interest rate.
- I'm 25 y.o. and make $54,000 per year/full benefits.
- I have $22,000 in savings.
- I have an IRA with about $6,000 in it, invested in low-cost mutual funds.
- I have $0 in credit card debt or any other kind of debt.
- I don't have a car and don't foresee needing one anytime soon—nor do I foresee buying a house anytime soon.

The other consideration I have is that I should continue with the minimum payment (80 bucks a month) since—over the life of the now-7-year loan—I'd only end up paying about $1,000 in interest. I also hear Warren Buffet in my ear advising me to not worry about the state of the stock market and just continue investing in low-cost mutual funds.

investing,US dollar: what is next?,"We’re still in favour to US dollar buy. Here is our key talking points.

- US Economy is strengthening
- US dollar currencies have moved above its “crisis period”
- US dollar weakening is limited
- We are favour on buying US dollar

Last Friday, April 1 2016, right on the April Fool Day, we saw “unconvincing” US economic data. While Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) that shows monthly additional employment rose, overall employment figure said there were some crunches in the labor market. The impact, US dollar jumped for a while and incrementally slower toward the end of trading day.

Just view days before NFP data, we heard The Fed Governor, Yellen, said that the US economy should be warned of global slowdown and therefore, took a way to accommodate it. Market saw that statement as “dovish” and resulted the lower US dollar.

Now we raised the questions. What is actually happening with US economy? And furthermore, how we trade US dollar? The questions is simple. US economy is doing fine. And we are still in favour buying US dollar currencies.

However, still, cautious always there. US economy is not great yet – as what Donald Trump wants to ‘harshly’ go. But it is not that bad. We see some halts, but not really matters expect to keep it in pre-emptive mode. Shortly speaking, The Fed is “playing small” in keeping up US dollar.

Now talking to strategy. Baseline view is, US dollar has been moving away from its “global crisis” level in 2006 – 2010. It has broken the resistance and stepped on consolidation phase. While US dollar in sideways, one to see is how global economy will be doing as we have founded that Yellen move has been allegedly caused by China over-hyped economy.

By saying that, we believe US are playing smart here. US dollar is good, but it shouldn’t be that good to hamper US business and trade balance. Because, there is no point of keeping good while you can’t sell your products abroad.

Cynically, US want to be able to do export again. And to do so, they need to “help” China. It simply an “I make you rich so you can buy mine” rule.

personalfinance,I need to submit an Amended Tax Return for 2015 because I messed up the first time around and I have no idea what I am doing.,"Hey /r/personalfinance, I need some serious help. I will break this post down into what has happened thus far and what I need to be done. Any help is appreciated.

***Background***: I am a 23 year old nursing student and full time PCA. Live at home with parents but they DO NOT claim me as a dependent on their tax return. I pay for all of my education in full and I attend a local community college. My parents don't offer me any assistance with my taxes and they use their own accountant to handle theirs.

Last year I e-filed my taxes with H&amp;R Block. I had to pay back federal taxes and in retrospect I am pretty sure I fucked them up. This year I e-filed again but with TurboTax because it was free for the standard federal refund.

I mistakenly believed my parents were claiming me as a dependant so I had that box checked. As a result it didn't give me an option to select that I was covered under health insurance (covered under parents' plan until 25). After entering all of my information, TT said I had to pay about $550 in federal taxes. I filed my e report and paid my taxes.

***Today***: I found out today that I need to check that health insurance box or I will be fined $600 by the federal government, so I panicked and reviewed my tax filing. I asked my parents if they claimed me as a dependant, they said no.

So I decided to use TT to amend my tax filing. I stated that I was not claimed as a dependant and lo and behold, **I suddenly had a federal tax refund of over $2500 due to me.** Apparently I am eligible for education tax credits and I am due back my withheld taxes.

TT autofilled out a 1040X form for me with most of my information but it doesn't really give any info as to what I should do with it ***so I have some questions for you guys/gals***:

1. According to TT, my state tax refund didn't change; only my federal return changed. Do I still have to submit the state tax refund portion of this form?

2. Do I have to submit any other information/forms/documentation along with this 1040X?

3. Do I have to sign each page of this form where indicated?

4. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything that I have forgotten?

If you have the time to just outline the whole process regarding amending a tax refund that would be awesome.

Any and all advice is appreciated. I am so oblivious when it comes to tax information and its very unfortunate. I don't receive any guidance from anyone but I feel like with your help I can learn to do this on my own. Thanks again!",finance,1459710149

personalfinance,PACE vs. HELOC for energy-efficient home upgrades?,"My wife and I recently purchased a home (in California) and are planning to do some energy-efficient upgrades. To fund it we're trying to decide between two types of loans and I'm not certain what's best. 

The first is a **PACE** loan, specifically from a company called YGrene, which is special loan for energy-efficient upgrades. It's similar to a line of credit, but the payment is added to your property tax (like a Mello-roos) and thus is stays with the property and not us if we move.

The second is a **Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)** which I believe is a pretty basic loan. However, because we don't currently have much equity in the home, the amount we could take out is substantially less than the PACE loan.

Is there any obvious choice between these two types of loans? The PACE loan is nice because we have access to a lot more money, and if we move it doesn't stay with us, but it also has a higher interest rate and additional fees.

The YGrene representative also tried to claim that the entire payment (i.e. principle and interest) was tax deductible since it's technically a Mello-roos, but I'm not sure I believe him. Anyone have experience with this?

To summarize:

                            | PACE    | HELOC
--------------------|---------|---------
Available amount | $60,000 | $35,000
Loan Term | 20 years | 15 years

personalfinance,Will I ever know enough to invest?,"This my sound like a rant, and it kind of is, But I would appreciate advice as well.

&amp;nbsp;


 A while ago I asked a ill-informed question about investing in a mutual fund. The overwhelming response was that I should not invest in anything unless I fully understand it. For a while now i have been trying to. In the time I can spend learning about it, which i admit is not a lot. mostly because I find it painfully boring, and don't seem to have any real interest in it. yet, I don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. 

&amp;nbsp;


I started by reading the wiki on the side bar. After which, I felt like I had a good understanding of things. little did I know how simplified the wiki make it. That's pretty surprising for a wiki to simplify anything. normally is a link, to a link, to a link, and before you know it your reading about universal physical constants and equations in fluid mechanics. all of the links in the wiki for investments, even the one I expected to be complicated ""bogleheads wiki article"", were relatively simple and straight forward. 

&amp;nbsp;


Now I feel like I can start looking into companies. seeing if Schwab, Vanguard, or Fidelity would better fit my needs. It's at this point I am blown away by how little I know. Not only is there about 100 more options for every type of account then the wiki make it seem like. But, also the terminology for what I am only assuming is the same type of account is different.  And every little aspect goes 10 levels more in depth. for example. the wiki talks about 2 fees. I feel like i can look around and make informed judgments. but then there's  Sales ""Load"", Expense Ratio, Commissions that are different for different account types and by amount held, management fees with every option i can think of. Then getting more advanced, that there are factors that can change bonds prices, including interest rates, credit rates and liquidity, markups, commissions on the bond, if its an otc bond, or secondary market bond. 

&amp;nbsp;


That is only looking at fees, and I feel overwhelmed. This happens in every aspect that I look into. I understand, if it was easy every body would do it. everyone would be getting rich activity managing stocks and bonds. I understand that its not easy, and there is a lot to learn. Bu,t honestly I don't want to, I wish I did. It would only serv to help me. But my time is finite, and there are many, many other things I would like to, and would enjoy learning. There are honestly better uses of my time since I only now know there are is so much more I don't know about investing.

&amp;nbsp;


What I do know is that I have money in the bank earning very little in a high yield savings account. And I would like to invest it in a way that at least has a good change to have a better return. But I'm at a point where I'm not sure I will ever fully understand all the nuances of investing in a taxable brokerage account. So, what am I to do?

&amp;nbsp;


TLDR; Everyone says only invest if you fully understand you investment. But after months of research I only understand how little I understand. What is my best option? not to invest? or open an account with a reputable firm and hope for the best?

&amp;nbsp;


Edit:
Since people are activity trying to help. I had read the ""i have x"" section and the best i can figure is i should open a taxable brokerage account. I have a nest egg, I contribute much more to my 401k then they match, because that match a poor 50% maxed at 2%. I have a IRA from a previous employer (that i honestly need to move to somewhere better). I know at this time I should buy a house if i want to be smart with my money. But i honestly do not want a house. I have looked into buying one only to rent it, but unless i want to manage it, its will be a deficit every month. I have about 150K to do something with, but i cant see just putting it into a ira or a targeted date account, because i i'm saving for retirement anyway, and i want to see something from my hard work i do making it, but again do no want a house, or to blow it. So as far as i can tell, this is why a taxable brokerage account makes sense. maybe in 10 years Ill want a house, and can take it out without penitently, or i might not since i never know where i will be then. Is there something else to consider? or if i am correct in the type of account to use, this is where i am overwhelmed in options. even if i go with a ""simple"" 3 asset allocation portfolio,  there are still endless options. what stocks? even a logical, recommended options like a S&amp;P 500 has countless areas of debate (see conversation lower in page). What bonds? and at what price for bonds and fees with them (see original rant). I personally don't like to do anything without researching it and trying to understand what i'm doing. but in this area i have to give up. I'm not expecting to throw a stone and hit gold here. The question is, is there a good option for someone who cant absorb all the option? If a well informed person that knows with they are doing would get a ~1.5% return, and i can get a ~1%, (just making up numbers) i'm ok with that. I just don't want to make a stupid decision because i don't know any better and get .5%

personalfinance,Investing in my mother's business (NL),"My mother's boyfriend is a farmer, who hasn't been doing very well. He is a milk farmer, but the price of milk has plummeted in recent years. My mother helps out on the farm, but she doesn't get paid, neither in salary nor in dividends. The sad reality is that if she wasn't helping out, the farm would go under.

She has always been a resourceful woman and has always been very creative. Besides working out on the farm, she teaches sewing, helps out on a local daycare and sells eggs that her chickens lay. The chickens is what I want to focus on.

She currently has four chickens in a coop of about two squared meters. They lay about ten eggs every week, which she sells at slightly-above supermarket cost. The revenue is enough to pay costs and leaves her with a small profit. She's been thinking about expanding to twelve chickens, because supply has been vastly outstripped by demand. Even at supermarket cost, the eggs are selling faster than the chickens can lay them.

Obviously, I want to help out my mother, but I can only help out on the weekends due to my full-time job. However, me and my wife have been working on a nest egg for quite a while. I have been thinking about helping out my mother with a personal loan. The loan would be for one or two thousand euro's, interest free, with a period of two years. I'm hoping that expanding her business with the loaned money will make it much more profitable.

 I've discussed this idea with her and she's cautiously on-board. She wants to make a business plan first and figure out what her costs truly are, which I feel is a very good idea.

My reasons for this loan are, of course, not purely altruistic. Interest rates on bank accounts are historically low. Money sitting on the bank doesn't really gain us that much in interest. A personal loan for a business venture like my mother's would constitute a low-risk investment for us, with a reasonable chance of a higher return. On top of that, I have seen the product she sells and I can tell that's in demand because of its high quality and marketable qualities. The fact that she's been able to sell more than supply without any marketing to speak of (besides word-of-mouth) speaks volumes to me.

The problem I have is that I don't really know how to proceed. I know that lending money to family is a Very Bad Idea (TM), but I'm hoping to mitigate some of that risk with a contract. However, I've never done this sort of thing before, so I don't know what type of contract I would need or who could help me with that. I'm also worried that the costs for stipulating a contract will outstrip any potential profit I could make from this venture.

TL;DR: My mother sells eggs and is looking to expand. I want to invest in her business with a loan. What type of contract would I need?",finance,1459761700

personalfinance,Trade in / refinance car for more immediate benefits then refinance house or refinance house first,"Trying to decide what's the better option here for me now that my divorce is being finalized

I have the opportunity to refinance or trade down my car to one that will see me get more benefits in the short term e.g. Lower monthly outgoing sand potentially cheaper insurance, however that will obviously knock my credit score down and will take some time to recover (any ideas how long that'll actually be?) (Current car finance at 4.25% with incentives, could potentially refi at 2.00%)

I can think of a few additional benefits here in the fact that it'll lower my debt to income ratio slightly (I'm at 36% right now based on gross earnings) and will allow my home to accumulate a higher value

The downside is I'll have to wait on refinancing the home after my divorce which means interest rates are likely to increase. (Current mortgage rate is 4.25% with incentives, I could drop that to 3.7%)

I could potentially begin the home refinance process now instead however even after the refinance process I may not be at the 20% level necessary to drop PMI and escrow. I will however get to take advantage of a better rate. If I wait, the home may have accumulated sufficient value to bring me below the 20% threshold.  

Both options ultimately reduce my outgoing a short term and long term but it's the decision of which to do first that worries me. My credit has already suffered a bit from the initial car refinance I did back in November to get my ex wife off the title as well as account closures etc. a re-fi / trade down on the car would obviously impact that again.

personalfinance,How aggressive should I be with student loan repayment?,"So here's the situation (24 yrs old fwiw):

* $25k federal student loans - made up of 10 individual loans ranging from 3.15-6.55%. Minimum monthly payment total: $315

* $50k private student loans - 2 individual loans, both 6%. Minimum monthly payment: $540

* Currently I take home about $4k per month, with $1500 leftover outside budgeted expenses, which I've so far been using to build up an emergency fund.

* Have also been contributing 10% of monthly paychecks to 401k with 6% employer match. 

* Planning on getting married within the next 5 years, probably closer to 2-3. Full disclosure, I don't have much of an idea yet of what I'll be (or should be) spending on ring, wedding, etc. 

* No credit card debt or other loans. 

Now so far I've been very lucky in that my parents are handling the minimum payments for the private loans for now. I've got about $19k in cash built up, with about $15k earmarked as a 6mo. emergency fund based on current budget.

Now that I have that savings buffer my question is, do I throw 100% of my leftover cash per month (that extra $1500) towards the loans until they're gone? 

My general plan was to put an extra $750-$1000 per month on the federal loans til they're paid off, then picking up the payments on the private loans in about a year (contributing the same total amount for a slightly smaller overpayment due to the higher minimum, using avalanche method). Is that reasonable? Should I be more aggressive with extra payments? Is that $15k emergency fund accurate or would it be more beneficial to drop that to $10k-$12k to take a solid extra $3k-$5k bite out of the loans now?

How much should I factor in for saving for wedding-related expenses and when/how much should I start saving for that?

Any other advice is much appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks for the advice, everyone. Gonna have a couple conversations re: details on parents' payments and timing/cost for those possible upcoming expenses.

I'm pretty confident with job security so I'll probably drop my emergency fund down to $12500ish and dump as much money as I can into highest interest rate fed. loans. Then do a sort of combination of avalanche/snowball method - paying off the smaller-balance (federal loans) asap while parents cover minimum on private loans, then use that same large monthly payment to eat away at the private loans.

* Current tenants pay $800/mn for 2br, 1 ba which is slightly below market rate (but they lack central hvac and other niceties)  

* FHA allows 5% of the mortgage amount for energy efficient renovations (hvac, windows) so could finance a big investment like those 

* 4plexes are appraised by compatibles and appraiser (eg, relative) 

* 5+ plexes are appraised by rental incomes (eg, objective) 

* lot could accommodate a 5th unit by zoning

Although we loved our home a great opportunity came up in Los Angeles (where my wife and I are from) and we chose to rent out our home in Vegas, and move back in with my folks in LA while we get settled out here and my wife goes back to school.

Anyways, I have been looking at home prices out here (geeze!) and I am figuring over two years I could save $100k for a new downpayment on a ~$500k house here in SoCal. But I know there are other probably better options to leverage my money:

1.) Pay up to 20% equity on my Vegas home in order to drop the PMI ($85/month) and refinance in order to get a better interest rate (currently have a 0.5% penalty for the home grant program from Nevada) 
2.) Pay all my savings into the Vegas home and then refinance to bring my payments down to a minimal level, and then use the supplemental income from the rental for my new mortgage in SoCal.
3.) Leave the Vegas home alone and put all my savings into my prospective new home in SoCal in order to reduce my loan amount by as much as possible.

* I can use my HSA to reimburse myself for any qualifying medical expenses incurred since it opened. When rolling over to a new HSA administrator, can I reimburse myself for expenses incurred during the time my account was elsewhere, or do I start anew on this? The folks I've called thus far seem to be confused.

* Can I legally pay for any fees using non-qualifed funds? Most of the HSA providers that charge automatically debit their fees from the HSA account.

What I've looked at so far, thanks in no small part to searching old posts on here:

* [HealthSavings Administrators](http://healthsavings.com/). I like their fund selections (I'm a fan of DFA and, of course, Vanguard). They even waive the minimums for Vanguard admiral shares! $45 annual fee + 25 basis points isn't bad.

* [Elements Financial](https://www.elements.org/health-savings-account/) (formerly ELFCU). Is it indeed no fee? Minimum account balances? If I can just invest in ETFs and mutual funds through Ameritrade, I'll be a happy camper.

* [HSAbank](http://www.hsabank.com/hsabank/education/product-overview). $66 a year? I think that's the price if I keep everything in the Ameritrade investment account.

* [Saturna](http://www.saturna.com/individual/hsa/). I've pretty much written them off due to the fees associated with their investments (their no-transaction-fee fund list is minimal).

personalfinance,Student Loans interest discrepancy,"I have paid $1000 since January of this year, and it shows a total reduction in principal of ~$140. Accrued interest for this month alone is $249, as shown in the graphic. With the listed interest rates, it should be closer to $80 in interest per month on the remaining balance, correct? 

I went through historical payments for last year. Total reduction in principal was $7000, interest on my tax documentation was $900 and the account that I paid the loans from shows nearly $8500 in payments for the year. I keep very accurate records of all payments, so I have exact figures and all records.

What am I missing here? Can they front load interest charges for this type of loan? I am going to call them tomorrow, but I just want to get a feel for what questions I should be asking. Thanks in advance.

As a result of this, a large portion of my student loan debt is actually in the form of PLUS loans in my parents' names (~67K). I make the payments as we agreed on when we took these loans out, they were simply a method for avoiding any Alternative Loans with much higher interest rates at the time.

personalfinance,"Saving money for a car...Keep Liquid, or not.","Hi!

I am in college with a car fund totaling about $8000.  I enjoy alternative investing, and have found great success with Prosper peer to peer loans.  The problem is they are 3 year loans, but I get principal and interest paid back to me every month.  I am earning approx. 9.5% on this investment.

The question is should I withdraw the monthly amount I am receiving (both principal and interest), and set it aside in a savings account making 0.75%(APR) or should I reinvest it in the Prosper account.

What I am thinking, and you can tell me if I am wrong, is that most car loans are less than 9% interest rate, so even if I reinvest in Prosper and have a small down payment, it won't matter because it makes more sense to have the money invested than to have a larger down payment.

personalfinance,Sharing my story,"Hi /personalfinance/

I'm in a pretty good place with my finances and thought I'd share my story. I'm not necessarily looking for criticism but advice is welcome and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

I'll be 28 years old tomorrow, own a small house, two vehicles and have a net-worth of about 70k. I have no credit cards and my only debt is my mortgage. I work as a web developer and make roughly 42k a year.

This story starts about four years ago and there are a few things I need to note. My family has never had much money and I funded college on my own. I spent roughly 8 years in various schools first working on a vocational degree, then an associates and finally a bachelors. I suppose I should also mention that I live in Kansas (for better context).

I accumulated debt during that time but managed to keep it low by taking pell grants and only buying things that were absolutely necessary. Come to think of it, I didn't even have a car. I didn't have health insurance either. This was before they started penalizing people for that. After all was said and done, I owed about $24,000 broken into five loans with varying interest rates (anywhere from 3 to 5.6%).

I was supposed to graduate in 2012 but, due to poor scheduling, ended up with two classes spread over two semesters. By then I had acquired an old gmc truck and, with something to drive and a lot of free time, I found a paid internship. My salary was roughly $25k starting, but I was up to $30k by the time I graduated. Not too bad for only a few months. Unfortunately, that was around the time Brownback started making his first round of cuts. A good chunk of my income was going right into school so I could finish out my degree. Even so, I was starting to save.

I put back enough for my first few mortgage payments. So you could probably guess where this is going... I never liked the idea of renting and started searching for an inexpensive house. Somehow I had a credit score of 760 and the bank approved me for a $500k loan. It's no wonder so many people spent a lifetime paying off their homes... Anyway, it was a buyers market at the time and I found one that had been foreclosed. Two bedroom, one bath, new roof and a new ac/heater unit. It did need new siding, but was move-in ready otherwise. They were asking $25k and I made it mine. I put in another $7k on improvements in the last three years.

It's $250 a month, but I've been paying $350 to finish it off faster. The original loan ended up closer to $26k after taxes and fees but, as of now, that's down to $19k. Not a big difference, but I've spent the last three years focused on my student loans instead. I tackled the one's with the highest interest first. I'm happy to say that, as of early 2015, those were paid in full.

At one point I bought a reliable used car (no payments). I also have health insurance through work as well as a matched 401k. All things considered, I'm doing quite well. As long as there aren't any expensive emergencies, I plan to have my house paid off by 2018.

When the house is paid off, I'll probably rent it out and move to the west coast. I imagine I'd make significantly more, but the cost of living there will even it out.

I'm not sure if any of this is useful, but I'd be happy to answer questions or elaborate on the details.",finance,1459833971

MachineLearning,'2nd-degree' LSTMs with an LSTM for the state?,"Some time back, I wrote a blog post(https://codesachin.wordpress.com/2016/01/23/predicting-trigonometric-waves-few-steps-ahead-with-lstms-in-tensorflow/) describing how an LSTM could be used to predict the value in a trigonometric wave few steps ahead (predicting f(x + 20) from f(x)). 

The wave equation was something like A*sin(a1) + B*sin(a2) + C, with a1 and a2 both having different initial phases and frequencies. 

The LSTM alone couldn't figure out the wave (normalized), but when I fed in x, x' and x'' (first and second derivatives of the value), the model could understandably learn the pattern faster.

Now, I have been trying a new technique where I have a 'front' LSTM. Now at every iteration, this LSTM's total state (h:c) go through another 'meta' LSTM (whose state is 2*state of the front LSTM), and then gets fed back into the front LSTM. The intuition for this, is that the meta-LSTM will provide a higher degree of abstraction/understanding over the trends, and front-LSTM will use the understanding of these predicted trends, to compute the future value.

Programmatically, this is what I mean (in TensorFlow):



lstm_layer = rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(input_dim)

meta_lstm_layer = rnn_cell.BasicLSTMCell(lstm_layer.state_size)

lstm_state = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, lstm_layer.state_size]))

meta_lstm_state = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1, meta_lstm_layer.state_size]))

meta_lstm_output, meta_lstm_state_output = meta_lstm_layer(
    lstm_state, meta_lstm_state, scope=""METALSTM"")

lstm_output, lstm_state_output = lstm_layer(
    input_layer, meta_lstm_output, scope=""LSTM"")

lstm_update = lstm_state.assign(lstm_state_output)

meta_lstm_update = meta_lstm_state.assign(meta_lstm_state_output)

Does this make sense? Or am I just adding an unnecessary level of complexity? I am not an expert with the math behind LSTMs, and I am trying to work it out. But are there any obvious pitfalls here?",technology,1459852863
personalfinance,Credit Score Hit Due to Student Loans (advice)?,"Hi r/personalfinance, I was hoping I can get some advice for my situation.


Background: Last summer, I was denied a credit card due to my low credit score. This was odd, so I ran a credit report and found that I missed 2 payments to my federal perkins loan. I immediately paid off the loan. The loan servicer according to FSA is my university, but it has been outsourced to different companies that have changed over the years. I have 6 loans in total, 5 of which are serviced by My Great Lakes, except the one that I missed my payments on. In addition, I had an address change during the time I was in school. Regarding my exit counseling, I am part of a 6 year undergraduate-graduate degree program. I was offered an exit counseling after my 4 years, but I had the option to defer it since I was not graduating for another 2 years. I was never notified of the exit counseling when it was time for me to actually graduate. I wrote a good will letter explaining all this, thanks to u/micotu's advice

I had conversations going back and forth for a while and recently, I was notified that they would NOT change my derogatory remarks. My experian credit report from March still shows that I have a deliquency. 


My questions:
1.) Should I update Experian regarding the full payment of the loan, before I take further action?

2.) Should I take further action with my school? Because the loan servicer technically is my school, they did have my most up to date address, email, and phone number. However, I received no notifications about the loan or even when 2 payments were missed. Also, looking on the FSA website, there is no record of me even completing an exit interview/counsel. According to my university, there should have been a financial hold if this was not completed. 

So r/personalfinance, any advice? Or am I in no luck and just have to take the hit on my credit score?

personalfinance,College Financial-Aid Offers: What Families Need to Know (WSJ),"Here are highlights from the April 5, 2016 WSJ article titled ""[College Financial-Aid Offers: What Families Need to Know](http://www.wsj.com/articles/college-financial-aid-offers-what-you-need-to-know-1459857602)"", subtitle ""Here’s how to avoid seven common mistakes in reading financial-aid award letters from schools."" 

**Confusing ‘net cost’ with ‘net price’**

The “net price” of a school is the discounted sticker price - the total cost of attendance after subtracting grants, scholarships and other aid that doesn’t need to be repaid.  It is the amount of money families will have to pay from savings, income and/or loans to cover college costs.

Some colleges display a “net cost” figure on the letter instead, which subtracts the entire financial-aid package. But financial-aid packages often include loans, which don’t cut college costs and are instead a way of financing the net price.

**Underestimating total costs** 

Some costs may not be included in award letters. For instance, science classes may have lab fees and art classes may have materials fees, neither of which is typically included.  The cost statement may also include average costs for travel to and from the school that are far less than what a student who lives in a distant part of the country will incur.

**Thinking the letter is for more than one year**

Families often assume the aid they are given in the first year will be followed by identical amounts for the following three years of college. But some colleges may “front-load” grants, giving students more free money in their freshman year than subsequently.  Families have to file for financial aid each year, and each year the college will send a new award letter. 

If the money is expected to decrease over subsequent years, it is important to create a backup plan to cover the remaining tuition costs.

**Assuming you must borrow that full amount**

An award letter may show the maximum the student and/or parents can borrow in federal college loans, but it is also possible to borrow less or none.

**Counting on a work-study job**

Colleges tend to award more jobs than they have federal funding for, figuring some students won’t follow through. But in some cases, a school’s money runs out. A college’s allocation of federal work-study money could also be reduced in subsequent years. And the most desirable campus jobs may go quickly.

Students should have a backup plan for a job during the school year or on breaks if work-study income is less than expected. Students should apply for work-study jobs as soon as you arrive on campus. You can’t apply before then.

**Not understanding Plus loans**

Colleges often include parent Plus loans - a federal loan available if parents pass a credit check and meet other criteria - in the aid package listed.  Be aware that parental borrowers have to start making monthly payments right away. And with a current interest rate of 6.84% along with a loan fee of 4.27% on each Plus loan they take out, parents may want to think twice about using this pricey way to borrow.

**Accepting the financial package as is**

If your family has unusual financial circumstances, appeal to the college for additional aid by providing the financial-aid office with documentation. Unusual circumstances may include a job loss, the death of a wage earner or high medical expenses. Note any one-time income items that aren’t reflective of the family’s ability to pay during the award year, such as a conversion of a traditional individual retirement account to a Roth IRA.

Call the financial-aid office to ask about the process for appealing for more aid. Some colleges have a special form, while others tell the family to write a letter.",finance,1459866570
personalfinance,A complex conundrum regarding turning 26 and health care coverage.,"Ok so here's the deal:

I turn 26 in a little under 3 weeks (April 24th). I am currently employed on a short term gig in a warehouse - for possibly around 3 more weeks (No set date here). The company that I work for has benefits but they only kick in after two full months of work (June 1st). 

I would assume that I just get health insurance for the unemployed. However, the twist, I am applying for a full time position in another sector of the company. If I get that position then I still don't have coverage between my birthday and when my benefits kick in. What would I do about that?

I do believe there is an allowed gap by the federal government before fines start applying. I don't want to do that on a standard day but I've been having medical problems recently (woke up four days ago with something randomly) so I especially don't want to do that.

So does health care gap insurance exist? I doubt it's a very common necessity. Can I even get unemployment health care insurance given that I currently have a job? Is the best option the rather absurd practice to actually quit my job before my birthday?

Some possibly important factors: I've only been employed since mid-march and have otherwise been unemployed (searching for work) and I live in Washington state in Seattle.

I wont be on until much later to answer questions so I apologize for that. Gotta work.",finance,1459866909

personalfinance,Opinion on Balance Transfer Offer (1% fee),"Hello PF,

I frequent this sub a lot and understand budgeting and all the basics very very well. I just wanted to ask the folks this question:

I'm offered a balance transfer opportunity with a 1% fee and 0% APR on this BT until 12/1/16. The rate after that is of no importance since I will pay off the balance immediately before that anyway. **If you were in my situation, would you take this offer to buffer your cash cache as an extended e-fund or other similar uses?**

Here is my financial situation:

* 24/M working two jobs ($4,400 net/month) and in graduate school and will graduate this May (MS in Mech Eng.)
* $15,700 in federal student loans (4.5%, 3.86%, 3.4%, 3.4%) all planned to be paid off immediately after graduation as to not accrue interest
* Expecting a total of $5,300 in tuition reimbursements after I graduate
* $5,000 personal cash-loan from a college buddy that we agreed to be paid back by March 2017 (contract signed) - I plan to give him the lump sum for Christmas 2016 though.
* $8,700 in credit card debt (formerly student loans) riding 0% APR until late-June ($3,800) and mid-October ($4,900) also planned to be paid off before the promo-APR is up
* $7,750 debt for my car (1.49%) - No rush to pay this off at this APR
* $19,500 debt for my sister's car (1.99%) - Sister is paying me to pay this debt every month - I know how this sub feels about being in debt for family, but that's not the point
* $14,000 co-signed debt for my mom's car (3.99%) - I'm currently paying this every month until my mom finds a permanent full-time job and she'll start paying it herself
* $4,750 credit card debt (0% APR until September 2017) for an extremely close and reliable family friend - He will be sending me payments every month, he just needed it for a down payment to replace his '04 Camry
* My monthly expenses are estimated to be around $2,200 so I am able to save at a rate of around $2,000 per month (less misc. expenses, very little)
* I have $500 in a savings account, $11,000 in a Roth IRA, and around $11,000 between my two 401k's from my employers
* Currently $17,000 in checking ready to be thrown at my student loans when I graduate

Now here's my personal situation:

* I plan to change jobs mid-June and move out of the state for it, so I've planned for some moving-out expenses (≈$3,500)
* The realistic salary I'll be earning for that one job will be around $3,400 net per month
* I also plan to find a second job when I move, to increase my earnings for a little while longer

Based on this information (and I know it is a lot - I can link a picture of my financial calendar that I use every day) I'll be strapped for cash around mid-June due to the moving expenses. This 1% BT offer is enticing because the cost is extremely low, not as good as Chase Slate's 0% fee, but *this* offer can be direct deposited to my checking account.

I don't have an ""immediate"" need to take this loan out, but the peace of mind might be worth it in case I need the extra cash - let's call this BT1. This BT1 offer is part of an existing credit card debt (the $4,750 one from Barclay's Sallie Mae MC - let's call this BT2) but is entirely separate from that particular BT2. They recently increased my credit line by an additional $3,000 without my request so I'd like to try to make use of it since the opportunity is there. ***I don't care much for my credit right now (currently 715) since I am all set with loans at the moment, maybe only concerned with applying as a tenant to rent an apartment when I move.***

If I took this BT1 offer, I'll likely take the entire $3,000 with the cost of $30 to be paid back in 8 months. Seems like a steal and why not? I might not be able to charge this card anymore, but I already have my trusty Citi Double Cash for expenditures.

I guess I'm looking for some validation to confirm my desire to go with this offer based on PF's hive mind. I'll obviously double check with Barclay to see how payments will be distributed across the two balance transfer transactions that will occur on this account. I don't want to have BT1 end (and thought to be paid off) but that ""payment"" actually went towards BT2, etc etc.

The question lies in which direction do I go in terms of loans. I'm asking for $80,000 but I think I can make due with 60. I have 3 loan options:

A) 5-6% fixed equipment loan from a local credit union. 60 months max. 

B) 2.99% ($50,000 cap) fixed personal loan as a special through a local farm/construction equipment dealer

C) 3.25% home equity loan through my parents

The drawback to A is obviously the higher interest rate. The benefit is everything is in the business name which leaves me leeway to purchase equipment from anywhere (there has been some smoking deals out of state) which leads me to option B drawback. 

Option B drawback is that I'll only be able to purchase equipment through that particular dealer. Not a bad thing but limits me in selection and I will also have to pay sales tax on the equipment where as if I purchase from a private seller, I can avoid the thousands of dollars in sales tax. 

Option C drawback is that the loan will be in my parents name and I'm not quite sure how that will work in terms of writing interest off from the business, building my own credit, etc. 

You guys seem to have a good handle on this stuff so I figured I would ask the opinion of personal finance. 

Your opinion will be very much appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1459875013
personalfinance,I'm in the middle of a salary negotiation. Help?,"I went in asking 30% originally. I know this is high, but the department I'm moving to is known for being very intense. They have also had trouble catching up with work and keeping it fully staffed. I had a strong interview and had been expecting the offer.

Well today I got an offer, and it was only for 8%. I was pretty surprised by this. I thanked the recruiter for the offer and told her I was appreciative, but that it was below my salary expectations. I countered with 20% and told her that I wanted to make sure that I'm happy with my salary in my new position. I also emphasized my qualifications and schooling.

Well she said she would forward my offer, but tried to scare me by saying that they won't accept. I didn't really say anything other than ""OK, please let me know and thank you for your time"". How did I do so far? What should my next steps be? Should I counter again if they only budge a little, or is it too much?

investing,The Panama Papers: A bullish case for decentralized financial networks.,"You probably already know about the Panama Papers: http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/panama-papers-explainer.html?_r=0  
  
But if you want to make money, you need to look a few steps ahead: the concept of the off-shore bank account is going away, ladies and gentlemen.  The traditional idea of financial privacy is being demolished by cooperative governments seeking to shine light on any who would hide any part of their assets.  
  
Now I am not hawking decentralized financial networks solely as a means to store wealth privately, but the fact remains - they are very good at that, among other things.  
  
Most have become so blinded to the truth of what money is they think it *must* come from the Federal Reserve or be printed on strips of paper.  They don't realize that money is a language like any other, and thanks to new technology we are now learning to speak 'money' on a level never before possible.  
  
We have, for the first time in human history, private and untraceable money that can be sent across the planet instantly, nearly for free, and without anyone's approval whatsoever.  *This has never happened before in the history of Earth.*  I can't emphasize that enough.  It also does other things well, like enable an individual to save wealth in a way that can only be seen if the individual permits it, and allows people to make unique contracts that can't be backed out of (but also that others don't have to know about).  
  
If you are not up to speed on the latest developments in blockchain technology, you are sorely behind in the field of money.  People will use this technology for many things, and it will succeed as a result of these synergistic network effects.

datascience,"Cross-city and cross-time drinking water contaminant data is super hard to get, while the air data is already in good shape compared to water data.","The water we drink and the air we breathe are obviously essential for living and health.  Interestingly, cross-city and cross-time drinking water contaminant data is super hard to get, while the air data is already in good shape compared to water data.  Meanwhile, drinking water contaminant levels are already being measured and published annually at the municipal level by cities across the USA.  That’s a great thing.  But here’s the problem: This city-level water data just seems to get lost after the cities measure the water contaminants and deliver the paper printouts to residents.  The accumulated city data from each year, never quite all gets together into a combined, complete dataset, from across all the years of measurements, and from across all the cities, and in uniform data formats, and without gaps in the data, in an electronic format suitable for machine reading.  The city’s water report is on paper, or a PDF file.

So our water has a data problem.  Because of our data problem with water, our citizens really can’t very effectively analyze our water data yet.  Without good data, we can’t see water trends, and we can’t see many problems that might already be presenting.  Our water operation is like driving blind.  What happens when you can’t see well is obvious.  So we react, but too late.  Flint, Michigan is a sad story.  We need to get more in front of the upcoming problems in our water. Doing a better job of seeing our water data is a necessary step for avoidance of further water accidents, if you would consider this situation as an analogy to driving a car.

So let’s try to get our water data up to the level of our air data.  The downside is, that if we fail to up our game for the water data, then the public across the USA, if I had to guess, could sadly suffer additional nasty surprises such as Flint Michigan already did. It’s partly a matter of not seeing in time. We could avoid some water problems if we could see some of these water problems.  We are not seeing our water problems.  We need to use computers to help us analyze this data better.  It’s there if we look at it, but with water we have not looked at it until after the fact, after the big accident.  It does not have to be this way.  Sadly, if I had to guess, more such surprises are undoubtedly in store for Americans in unlucky cities and towns as long we don’t really try hard to get better at organizing and sharing our drinking water data coming from all the cities across the USA, every year, from all our local point sources of water contaminant measurements. We need to do what it takes to really look at our water data better.

Fortunately, our air pollution situation can show us the way forward in this regard.  See, on the one hand, the states across the USA actually have by and large made some substantial improvements in air pollution monitoring, and furthermore they have actually enjoyed some improved air pollution levels over the past decades.  

Small-particle (PM2.5) air pollution levels for a couple of decades now, have been sensed, measured, and recorded on a schedule, at city-level point collections across the entire USA. Those air pollutant data are recorded and stored uniformly in machine readable formats, collected together, and routinely disbursed back to the public, at a national level, and today this data distribution mechanism for air pollution sensors already includes rapid downloading and highly available access to this entire air pollutant dataset by any citizens with a computer, by downloading the air pollution dataset from the internet using a .gov web site.

By contrast, however, the drinking water contaminant recording and reporting framework, unfortunately, is lagging and unsatisfactory by comparison.  Even though the water we drink is equally as essential as the air we breathe, this same level of collected and organized data on the drinking water contaminant levels is just not there.  For water, there is just no way to get access today to the complete dataset. There is for now at least no way to do what we do with air pollution already, which is to analyze the levels of contaminants that are being recorded both across time, as well as across the point sources, the cities, and the states.  

It’s a shame -- and here’s the opportunity -- because the water data is already largely being both measured and recorded by municipalities at least once every year, as so-called “Safe Drinking Water Act: Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR)”.  The CCR is a start, it’s one step, but it’s not the goal post. CCR is not there yet at the goal line. So obviously the problem is not that the data aren’t being collected, because they are being collected in the water contaminant levels published locally in CCR reports in every city in the USA. Somehow, though, this CCR water data is not going all the way to the goal. It is not getting where it needs to go to win this game, not really a game at all, essential for life, it’s the water we drink.  The CCR water data is not yet in the machine readable format it needs to be in for analysis on computers.  CCR water data just sits on paper printouts delivered in mailboxes in the towns that produce them, and it sits in PDF files on a town computer, which is not good enough to win this “game” (not a game at all).  CCR data needs to be also provided in machine readable format if we want to see past trends, never mind what lies ahead, and this data needs to be a complete map of water data, not just one town’s data, the whole map of the USA is what we need to see. We need to see trends in time.  We need to see what town is close to what other town, both at the pollutant levels as well as geographically.  Looking at a paper CCR report from the city is good but it’s a baby step. We need to run with this ball now. We have the ball in our possession. We need to run with it. We can put our computers onto this data but not today because the powerful computer’s can’t see this one PDF file sitting on a computer disk in a box in City Hall. My computer is powerful but it still can’t open cardboard boxes. 

We need water data collected together from all the cities and all the years, we need it posted to one web site that’s always online, we need it in a CSV format.  We need uniformity. We need comprehensive collections.  We need to move away from scattershot data sharing by the limited set of heroic cities who are feeling the volunteerism and sharing this data outside of their own locality.  We need all these cities’ data, on time, every time, not in a cardboard box in a government office, but on a website in a CSV machine readable file for download around the clock.

Our drinking water data situation today is a bit like it’s being dropped on the floor by the cities and the states, after they did so much good work to get the water measured and sent to all the local residents in the first place.  It’s a shame we are just dropping the ball here for our drinking water data. It’s not like the cities are not trying, because they are trying. Cities are producing the CCR water reports, and they are delivering them on paper to people’s mailboxes, which is good, but like I said it’s not enough to avert some kinds of accidents. Cities of course don’t know what to do next to get this data to the next level.  They would if they could, but they just don’t know.  Cities need our help knowing what to do next, how to share data, how to analyze to see trends in our water data. Cities barely manage as it is. There are trends in the water data, if someone would just look at them. Cities are not equipped to handle this to take this water data to the next level. It’s OK because there are only enough city workers to keep up with one city’s needs. That’s all they can do really.  Another cross-city entity needs to step in when multiple cities need to combine their data, and that’s the state, or that’s the .gov web site. I’d say all states need to do this in a uniform manner and this is just not going to happen at individual states for the same reason it didn’t happen at individual cities. The scope of responsibility for cross-state efforts cannot be just one state at a time.

The cities just don’t know that they need to collect all the different cities data together into one big dataset.  It’s understandable.  And that’s not what cities are good at, collecting each other’s data.  The states and the USA needs to collect this water data together and keep it all, not summarize anything. They need to keep all the raw sensor data, keep all the time series data, keep all the different point sources.  Complete, organized, tidy, but unsummarized raw data is what we need to provide to the citizens, so anyone who has a job duty or even just a knack for this kind of analysis, can just go ahead and analyze our water data.  We need to get it from all the cities, and the natural grouping of all cities in the USA is the federal level. So the federal web site needs to be the one to let us download this water dataset from their website, whenever we want it without restrictions.  We really need immediate, free download of water data from all the cities.  It is just like we already have for air data.

The good thing is, we can do for water what we are already doing for air.  It doesn’t take a great scientific invention or a lot of time wasted looking for new answers, because we could do the same thing we are already doing with our air data, as I have detailed.  The water data is already being collected by cities and drinking water authorities across the USA but then it just sits there somewhere on a printout on paper in a file cabinet, where few can practically access this data all together, clean, up to date, in machine readable format like a CSV file, accessible right now on the .gov website for download.  That’s what needs to happen. Because today we have our heads down in terms of water quality, because we not looking at the road ahead. It’s not that hard. We just have to properly tidy it up, gather it, and publish our complete dataset of water data which we already have, to an electronic website where the public can just go get it.

Current Impediments Due Mainly to Absence of Federal Requirements for Water Contaminant Data Collection and Data Sharing:

- Municipalities not up-reporting existing annual point data measurements to state and federal governments, on a schedule, without omissions.

- Not storing data and publishing data in machine readable data formats.
Nonuniformity of data coding and recording.

- Excessive censoring of data, such as for nondetects.

- Excessive use of assumptions, such as for estimating time series parameters.

- Excessive time gaps between measurements and recordings.

- State and federal governments not electronically publishing a complete collection of annual point data measurements to public, in a manner free of the impediments listed above.

Bitcoin,BSave Upgrades Customer Account Security with Clef,"BSave, the world’s first Bitcoin savings account bearing interest by the minute, integrates Clef, a replacement for usernames and passwords and the most secure 2FA available.

April 5, 2016 - Today, BSave, creators of a new generation of Bitcoin savings account, announced an integration with Clef, a simple and secure login that replaces usernames and passwords. Starting today, Bsave partnered with Clef as its primary method and preferred choice for user login. BSave is the latest in a growing number of Bitcoin related ventures to add Clef to their features set. Many Bitcoin services deal with the transfer of currency and thus require high-level security. Clef is a highly visible way to demonstrate security and earn invaluable user trust. 

BSave is a London based start-up which has created the world’s first cryptocurrency savings account bearing interest by the minute. The platform allows individuals to create an account, transfer their bitcoin into the new account, and start earning competitive interest rates immediately. Interest is credited to customer accounts on a daily basis, and presently BSave sites a 2.89% APR for customer accounts. BSave also guarantees full liquidity on all accounts. Customers can withdraw funds at any time without financial penalties. The company has taken implemented a suite of security measures, the latest of which is the Clef integration, to assure the maximum level of customer account security. 

On top of the basic cryptographic login that Clef offers, BSave has also integrated Clef’s advanced protections through a feature called, “Distributed Authentication.”  Normally, when you log in with Clef, all of the cryptography happens on the Clef server, and then your information is passed to whatever site you are logging in to. With Distributed Authentication, the site gets a copy of your public key from the Clef server to verify the login. The site then sends a challenge to the Clef app on your phone, where you confirm and sign it. This lets the partner site verify the login independently of the Clef server, so that even in extreme cases of compromise, your account is still protected.

personalfinance,Student loans/credit card/general financial advice?,"Ok hi!  I'm not usually into this whole reddit thing, just didn't know where else to go.  Any advice is appreciated.

Here's the gist of it:


I'll be 22 this month.  My mom kicked me out when I was 18 and I've been financially independent since then.  My mother has always been horrible, terrible, awful with money and I'm determined to be the opposite.  Everything I know about money/credit, etc, I learned from googling things.


I had 4 student loans in my name (dropped out after a semester and went the employment route instead).  As of this month I have paid them all in full! (:D)  Now 1 of my questions is about that - 3 of the 4 have posted to my credit report as closed (I just paid off the last one this week), and my score dropped 11 points in 2 months to around 735.  I was worried it was going to be much worse, since those loans are the bulk of my credit history and my oldest accounts.  Once the 4th reports as closed do you think it will have a large affect on my score?  I didn't want to continue paying interest for the next 7 years but I don't want my score to drop 200 points either...


I also have 2 credit cards, the first is an unsecured capone, I've had it maybe 10 months.  After I built my credit a little I applied for a Chase slate card 3 months ago and was approved.  I was planning to cancel the capital one card soon, as the 2nd year has an annual fee.  Do you think I should just pay the fee (only $19), and keep it an extra year since my credit history will suddenly be so short?  Or is 10 months not really better than 3 months, and I should just ditch it?  I've never had a late payment on anything and pay the cards off in full each month.


Once I had paid all my loans in full I had intended to save 3-6 months expenses in an emergency fund before doing anything else.  I have an online savings account and have about 1k saved so far.


Now here's the problem. I think I may also owe my mother $6,000.  She covered part of my tuition when I went to college and made me sign some piece of paper in front of a banker, promising to pay it back.  I have always fully intended to pay her back, but we agreed I should pay off the federal loans first.  


But ever since I left her care 3-4 years ago, every single person I've talked to has told me not to give her a dime.  Long story short, she's bipolar, bulimic, narcissistic, refuses to take her meds, etc.  Physically and verbally abusive my entire childhood.  Big gambling problem.  We were always messed up with cops, and child protective services.  I spent the better part of a decade in foster homes.

I now live halfway across the country and the only reason I still have minimal communication with her is because she still has my brother, who's a minor.

On my uncle's advice, I'm always watching my credit report closely in case she opens something in my name.  

My father, my aunt and uncle, boyfriend, my cousins, all my friends, keep telling me to not give her that 6k.  But aren't I required to?  Is that paper legally binding?  Should I ask to see it?  We haven't spoken about it since it was signed years ago, but last year my father told me that my mom made a comment to him about ""I'm never going to see that money, am I?"".


What does that mean?  Did she lose the paper?  Is it not a real, legally-binding contract?  Should I just be the bigger person and pay it anyway?  And if I pay her the 6k, should I do that before or after I have an emergency fund established?


I wanted to go back to school soon, but if I owe someone 6k, that isn't happening for a while.


Thank you for any comments you may have and sorry for the choppy sentences.

personalfinance,Tax return held up to SSN discrepancy.,"(First time filing taxes so please forgive me for any ignorance).
Also please forgive me if this is the wrong place but it seemed like the best go.

I tried to file my takes back in the middle of January via turbo tax. I'm 23 and have one job with a regular paycheck as a source of income so it was relatively uncomplicated. However, a few days later I get an email from turbo tax saying it could not file my tax return due to a discrepancy with my ssn, so I had to paper-file, which I did. I got my state tax return back a while ago, but have yet to see my federal return. There was also another issue with a professional license of mine recently where I had to call and resolve the problem: a discrepancy with my social security number. I entered the correct number on all of these. The license one I got resolved. 

For my federal return, does it just normally take this long, or is there a strong possibility that its being held up because of a problem with my ssn? I tried calling Social Security to resolve this matter, but I could not reach a human being on any of the multiple times I called.

personalfinance,"Save for emergencies, or pay off student loan in lump sum? -- Budget included","Hello!
I currently have $14.9k in student loans (down from $42k in July 2014!). Husband and I have $25k in savings, and $15k in ""sinking funds;"" however, I have several medical bills (~$2k) that I will need to pay off in the upcoming months. I've included my budget to see if paying off the full $14.9k makes financial sense.

My income:
Full-time job: $3200/month (36 hours x $32.00). I am currently putting 20% into retirement (I'm 28). I've been picking up extra RN shifts, so this can sometimes be more. 

Part-time job: $1200-$1500/month (up to 24 hours per week x $32.50)

Total: $4400 on the lowest end.

DH's income:
So, DH is in school full-time, but he works part-time on the days he's not in school. He works three days a week, 8-10 hours a day, at $20 an hour. He will stay part-time as long as he can, but his class schedule will change in May. They're doing everything they can to accommodate him, but there are no 100% guarantees.

Income: $1500/month

Total Income: $4400 + $1500 = $5900

Savings: $15k in sinking funds; $25000 in a money market fund. 
Bills

Rent: $1435 (includes trash, water). We live in a VHCOL area (D.C. suburbs). We live in a two-bedroom, because our second bedroom is our office, which we decided to do for DH's school and it worked out well because I now telecommute as my second job. This is by far the least expensive 2-bedroom we could find that wouldn't have made our commutes an hour plus.

Cable/Netflix: $11. We cut cable in July. 

Phone: $140 for two smartphones, with a work discount. I know this is high and we could switch, and perhaps we will when our contract is up; we use A LOT of data and we're grandfathered in to unlimited data through AT&amp;T.

Internet: $72. I know this is really high. Unfortunately, our apartment complex has a contract with Cox, and it is the only service offered here. It's terrible. We opted for the slightly faster Internet, because DH's lectures are online.

Electric: ~$100/month.

Car/Renters/Personal Property Insurance: $160. This went up a ton when we moved, but we have all three insurances bundled together.

Debt

Student Loan: $14,900 total; $130.34 monthly payment (4.75% interest rate). 

We started out with $42k in student loans, $7k in credit card debt, and $4k car loan, and have paid that much off since July 2014.

Monthly Spending

Auto/Fuel: ~$160 

Groceries/Toiletries: $700. This is kind of a catch-all account that we have for groceries/eating out/entertainment/blow. 

Sinking Funds

School: $160

Clothing: $25

Haircuts: $10

Pet Care: $50

Gifts/Parties: $30

Home Maintenance: $30

Car Maintenance: $200

Medical: $50


What do you guys think? I was thinking of seeing how much we have left over this month (it's a 3-paycheck month, plus I'm getting a $1000 bonus from work and we're getting paid $1000 for cat-sitting my husband's boss's cat) and then throwing our monthly income leftover towards the loan, and then maybe taking out the rest from savings to cover the rest?

I feel nervous using the $25k to put toward the loan because I know with my luck something will happen requiring us to need that emergency money, but we'd have to collectively all lose 3 jobs for that to really crush us.

Employer provided 401k. Contribute 5% to get 4%. Fully vested. 

Here are my current investments and the net expense fees associated. Right now, since it's been kind of a bull market and I got started a legit retirement account late, I went all in on equity. However, I'm thinking that moving some to bonds would be smart in the near future.

12% - JSMGX  Small Growth - .79% ratio.

9% - MINHX  Foreign Large Blend - .78% ratio. 

9% - OSMYX  Foreign Small/Mid Growth .95% ratio

10% - VIMAX  Mid-Cap Blend .09% ratio

20% - VWNDX  Large Value .38%

17% - EKJYX  Large Growth .70%

I'll admit, I was pretty naive going into everything. I knew a little, but not a lot. I think I just picked an aggressive allocation on their retirement calculator and they came up with these percentages/fund types. As far as the funds themselves, I just used a site that rated their lipper, avg risk, etc into a 1-5 star rating. Tried to pick the best performing ones. 

So, I went back in and checked. Noticed I have a ton of overlap in the large cap area. I'm pretty sure with the S&amp;P, Large Growth, and Large value, I'm buying a lot of the same stock from at least 2 or 3 different funds. Obviously inefficient and more expensive than it needs to be. 

Given that this is employer provided, there's not a HUGE list of funds available. 

Here are the rest of my equity options and ratios:

HIEMX Diversified Emg Markets, Large Growth. 1.31%

PMBPX Mid Cap Growth - .85%

OIDYX Foreign Large Growth. 1.01%

GSSIX Small Blend .94%

BEQGX Large Blend .67%

Here are my bond choices:

Dfa Inflation Protected Securities I

Goldman Sachs Us Mortgages Inst

Metropolitan West Total Return Bond I

Prudential High Yield Z

Vanguard Short Term Federal Admn


I would really like to get into the emerging markets fund, but that ratio is fucking insane. Any suggestions on re-balancing? Bond allocation?

The only thing I can think of off the bat is consolidating those large cap funds. Perhaps dump the Vanguard Value fund into the S&amp;P, then put that 17% remaining into bonds?

investing,4 Promising Lithium Mining Companies and Evaluating Stocks in a Bull Run.,"So I've been watching a number of Lithium companies this past while and the four I've been watching have seen phenomenal gains since December.  Now I've become decent at evaluating the stability of a company regarding it's debt and cash flow and while none of these companies are ones I would endorse based on the balance sheet alone all four do have potentially lucrative projects in the works in an industry that is seeing high demand and low supply.  Any sound methods used to judge the fair price of a stock would be appreciated.  The companies themselves are ORL, LIX, LAC, and NMX.  




ORL is currently producing and is working on increasing production to break even numbers and has increased a 100% in price since December. 




 LIX is fairly new with a number of assets that need to be further explored and has seen its stock price increase 300% (almost indefinitely overvalued). 




LAC is another lithium mining play ,which I don't know a ton about, that is projecting high production and has a number of proven assets in Argentina and has seen its share price increase 100% since December.



NMX is a Canadian based company sitting on one of the largest 2P reserves in the world and is currently working on getting all the pieces in place to eventually start production.  They also have some proprietary methods for processing the product via electrolysis cutting soda ash out of the cost equation.  They also have strong support from both the federal and provincial government in Quebec which is very rare.  This is another company with share price that had went up 100% since December and in this case and 364% in the last year.

Now I honestly am not as educated as I will be if I do initiate a position on any of these stocks but the big caveat before I even consider investing is how to decide what a fair price is when these stocks have been seeing massive gains.  Trying to judge when the bull run will end is impossible so the next question to ask is how to  accurately judge where to enter when most of these stocks have very little revenue currently but still have high potential to be large parts of the lithium industry (I suppose what I'm asking is how to evaluate based on potential growth).  I hope I've made my quandary as clear as possible and any insight will be appreciated.",finance,1459902937

I have family that are willing to pay for a chunk of the money, but I'll need to cover about $20k/year on my own through loans (they don't allow you to go part time or work while in school).

There's the federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan with origination fee of 1.068% and 5.84% interest rate, max of $20,500/year. This is the go-to loan for most and something that I am considering. 

However, I was wondering if it would ever be worth it to take a private loan? My credit score is good (Credit Karma and Mint both show ~750) and I could have a solid co-signer. It seems like there are some low rates for variable rate loans. One search I found was from Wells Fargo:

https://www.wellsfargo.com/student/graduate-loans/med-school/

and they have as low as 3.17% variable with no origination fee. I found other rates from private loans tied with LIBOR + ~2.5%, and LIBOR rates have been pretty low (under 1% ?) (http://www.bankrate.com/rates/interest-rates/libor.aspx). 

TL; DR: So basically I'm asking how likely it is for me to get a private loan with a better overall rate than the Unsubsidized Stafford Loan?",finance,1459904244
worldpolitics,Hillary Clinton attempts to portray herself as a fierce enemy of hedge fund billionaires when in fact tens of millions of dollars from hedge fund billionaires have been flooding into her campaign,"Hedge Funds Are Part of a Tricky Money Maneuver to Put Hillary in the White House

By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: April 5, 2016

http://wallstreetonparade.com/2016/04/hedge-funds-are-part-of-a-tricky-money-maneuver-to-put-hillary-in-the-white-house/

At the Democratic debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on November 14, 2015, Hillary Clinton attempted to portray herself as the fierce enemy of hedge funds. She told the audience the following:

“You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a Super PAC and they’re advertising against me in Iowa as we speak. So they clearly think I’m going to do what I say I will do….”

But two hedge fund billionaires backing a Republican candidate pales in comparison to the tens of millions of dollars flooding into Hillary Clinton’s campaign from other hedge fund billionaires – including money flowing into a joint fundraising committee called the “Hillary Victory Fund” that is sluicing money to both Hillary’s main candidate committee, Hillary for America, as well as into the Democratic National Committee and 33 separate state Democratic committees, which has some observers crying foul.

A recent article at CounterPunch, which questioned the ethics of the arrangement, quotes Paul Blumenthal, campaign finance reporter for the Huffington Post, as follows:

“It is a highly unusual arraignment if only because presidential candidates do not normally enter into fundraising agreements with their party’s committees until after they actually win the nomination. And second, Clinton’s fundraising committee is the first since the Supreme Court’s 2014 McCutcheon v FEC decision eliminated aggregate contribution limits and congress increased party contribution limits in the 2014 omnibus budget bill.”

The Democratic National Committee has come under repeated fire for showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton’s candidacy versus that of Bernie Sanders. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show that the Hillary Victory Fund has given over $600,000 to the Democratic National Committee and tens of thousands of dollars each to the individual state committees that signed on to the joint fundraising plan.

Hedge funds and private equity firms are desperate to hold on to their tax perversion known as “carried interest,” which allows their winnings to be taxed at rates lower than those paid by some plumbers and nurses. In no small part, it’s how hedge fund operators ended up as billionaires, effectively subsidized by the wage earner.

Federal Election Commission records show that S. Donald Sussman, founder of hedge fund Paloma Partners, gave $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund while also donating $2.5 million to Priorities USA, the Super Pac supporting Hillary. Hedge Fund billionaire George Soros donated $343,400 to the Hillary Victory Fund while sluicing a whopping $7 million into Priorities USA to enhance Hillary’s efforts to move into the Oval Office. Jay T. Snyder of HBJ Investments, a private equity firm, gave over $300,000 to the Hillary Victory Fund.

Dozens of other hedge fund and private equity operators gave lesser amounts to the Hillary Victory Fund. For example, Scott Shleifer of Tiger Global Management kicked in $167,000 while Mark Gallogly of Centerbridge Partners anted up $66,800.

Other hedge fund billionaires have skipped the Hillary Victory Fund while writing out stunning amounts to the Super Pac supporting Hillary. On January 11 of this year, James Simons, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who now runs a family office called Euclidean Capital, wrote out a single check for $3.5 million to Priorities USA.

According to the latest filing at the FEC, the Hillary Victory Fund joint fundraising committee has raised $26.9 million. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Priorities USA has raised $55.6 million while Hillary’s own campaign committee, Hillary for America, has raised $159.9 million.",finance,1459905526
personalfinance,A bit scared,"Hey everybody, I am pretty scared about my student loan debt that has now amassed to $40,000. 

A little bit about me: I am 22, a senior English major, will be graduating in December of this year.

I will try to refinance at a lower rate after I graduate. I also have $20,000 worth of federal. Shit. Like many others, I had no idea what I was getting into, just following what my parents and brother told me to do. I wasn't even sure if I wanted to go to college at the time. 

Oh well, I am here now, about to graduate at the end of this year, so hooray for that. 

I just can't get this debt off of my mind. It scares the shit out of me, especially since I don't know what I am going to be doing after I graduate. I mean, I really want to pay them off, but I am just frightened by the amount. I've never had a ""real job,"" just summer gigs in between semesters, and I am simply terrified that I am going to wind up in a fast food kitchen trying to pay off this loan. 

Is $40,000 a lot in student loans? I read that the median is around $30,000. I don't know, I guess what I am wondering is how all of you handle the burden of debt? It has been eating my soul lately. I get depressed and anxious whenever I think about it. I should probably see a counselor about it.

personalfinance,Novice looking for advice on investments and next steps,"**Background**

When I graduated college I didn't know much about investing so I just started off right away by putting 10% of my paycheck into my 401k at work, and just chose a target date fund since it seemed like a good default.  Unfortunately due to not enjoying the topic of investing and avoiding thinking about it, in the 6 or so years since I never increased the amount or changed the allocations.  I could have increased the amount but wanted to save money to buy a house, but I probably missed some opportunity while the market was booming.  I've decided it's time to finally read into this some more and I'm looking for some advice on what to do next.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this sub and the FAQ, I've read through the major sections and found it extremely helpful.  I'd like to ask some specific questions here.  In general I want an approach that is very hands-off and set-and-forget since I don't plan to become an expert in this and I think if I frequently made custom changes I would just second-guess myself constantly.

**Info**

Debt: modest school loans @ 6.8%, mortgage  
Married, file jointly  
28 years old  
401k - Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 Trust Plus (can't find ticker symbol) ER .06%  
10% contribution  
No IRAs  

**Questions**

* I've read the FAQ about the standard three-fund portfolio and it sounds right for someone like me who wants to be relatively hands-off.  Awhile back I read some criticisms of target date funds due to high fees and poor allocations, I noticed the 2050 fund has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the past 5 years so that made me wonder if it's been a poor choice.   However the FAQ seems to regard them well, and it looks like the fund resembles the three-fund strategy, about 54% domestic stock, 10% bonds, and 35% foreign stock.  The expense ratio also looks good at .06%. Can I just stick with this, or should I strongly consider picking my own funds now?  I also noticed that this is a Vanguard fund but the plan is managed by Fidelity.  Is this weird, or any problems with it?  I can't find any mention of transaction fees anywhere, just the expense ratio.

* Should my next step be to increase 401k contribution, or to do a traditional or Roth IRA?  The info here says it is okay to max 401k first before doing IRA if your 401k options are good enough.  So I guess the question is if the Vanguard fund is good enough to solely focus on until the federal limit is reached before even considering an IRA. 

* If I need to do an IRA (would prefer not to if 401k is good enough), I'm still unclear on whether a Roth or traditional IRA is best.  They say Roth is better since you will probably be in a higher tax bracket when you're older, but won't your withdrawals in retirement likely be lower than your income prior, putting you in a lower bracket?  Why the assumption that you will be in a higher bracket when you're retired?

* If I increase from 10 to 15%, should the extra amount go to traditional 401k or Roth 401k?  Same question about the tax brackets as above.

* Any other steps to take now?

* Student loans - I paid off most of my student loans but still have about $6k left at 6.8%.  I don't know whether to pay that all right now, or to instead put that money into a Roth IRA this year before the deadline and keep making the payments.  The FAQ says it's generally a fine idea to pay any debts that are above 4%.  I don't quite understand the argument of ""if you don't expect to earn more than the debt's interest rate in the market, then pay off the loan first since it's a guaranteed return.""  Wouldn't the value of that $6k at 6% after many decades way outweigh the interest I would pay on that loan for the next few years (a few hundred dollars)?

**TL;DR**

401k contributions have been at 10% since graduating, want a hands-off approach, should I stick with Vanguard target date fund and increase to 15%?  And pay off small student loan debt at 6.8% or put into IRA?  Any other major changes I should be making or considering?

I was hoping someone might be able to help a bit with a problem I have. I would be very grateful

*****

I submitted my 2014 tax return last April - an 1040NR-EZ, and 8843 because I was a nonresident alien. In the 1040, I listed my federal tax withheld. I was due a rebate. 

However after some delays, I have received a letter saying that 'The information you supplied does not match the information we recieved from your form 1042-S, Foreign Person's US source income subject to withholding, filed by your withholding agent'. Obviously, I put my federal tax withheld exactly as instructed on the 1040 information sheet:

&gt; Enter on line 18b the total
amount shown as federal income tax
withheld on Form(s) 1042-S. The
amount(s) withheld should be shown in
box 10 of your Form(s) 1042-S. 

I did that. I have double checked with my withholding agent (i.e. my employer while I was in the US), and they've confirmed that the 1042 was correct, and whatever it said, they filed.

So I'm a bit baffled where the 'does not match the information' is coming from.

*****
I'm writing the IRS a letter saying: 
1. I'm very confused by the discrepancy.

2. I have double checked with my employer and they confirm the amount in the 1042s, and I handled that correctly based on the 'information for 1040NR-EZ' booklet. 

3. Could they please double check, or investigate if the discrepancy has some explanation?

I've been thinking about getting the lowest interest rate loan from a company or my bank to just pay them all off instantly to remove all monthly payments for them, and then just pay the single payment back to my lender each month. 

Does anyone have any advice or any recommendations for companies that help with this sort of thing? Maybe a credit card debt consolidation?

I know it's not a ton of debt, I just want to get it under control, I try to be as responsible as possible with my finances. Thanks for reading.",finance,1459953630
personalfinance,First year paying quarterly - what are my options,"2015 was the first year that I made 100% of my income as a contractor. My accountant (who is **not** a CPA, but a friend who works as an accountant for a large company) told me I did **not** have to pay quarterly because it was my *first year*.

That being said, 2016 would be my second year as a full time contractor, which means I will owe a quarterly payment in a week or so.

I've already payed my 2015 taxes and to the federal government I owed ~$8,600.

Moving into 2016 I am expecting to have to show more income than last year as a 1099 contractor, with about the same amount of deductions. But due to the volatile nature of being a contractor, that's just my best guess (I could get sick, the company could go under, the projects could get canned).

* My question(s) are/is, **should I pay quarterly**?

* What are the pros and cons of paying/not paying?

* If I am estimating ~$60,000 for the year and I **don't** pay my taxes until the end of the year, what kind of penalty am I looking at (number-wise)?

----

*The reason I am leaning towards not paying quarterly is because I have no real way of knowing what will happen in a month or two. I have projects and work lined up, but I can't say with 100% certainty what will happen. I'd rather not dish out ~$2,000 to the IRS, when I might need that for bills if something happens to my contract gigs (I don't have a substantial emergency fund set up yet).*

Thank you all for your time.",finance,1459957715
personalfinance,Work bonus &amp; student loan payoff,"My current situation is I make ~$120k per year. I have 18k left in student loans at 6.55%, 20k in an online brokerage, and due to a recent bonus at work my savings is up to $18.8k.

Now that I've had this windfall I'm thinking of just paying off my student loans ASAP (i.e. this weekend) and being done with them and their high interest rate.

personalfinance,(UK) What type of savings account would you recommend alongside a Help to Buy ISA?,"I am a doctoral student earning £20000 p.a. tax free. I've spent the last year and a half wasting money and I'm currently getting my finances straightened up and going to start saving for the remaining two and a half years of my programme.

I am already planning on opening a Help to Buy ISA (the one offered by the Halifax has the highest interest rate of any I have found, at 4%), however by the rules governing these I cannot save more than £200 pcm.

According to my budget I can afford to save a total of £450 pcm (actually slightly more but I'm currently abusing my interest free overdraft whilst moving and needing to buy a car), so what should I do with the remaining £250 pcm?

I cannot open another cash ISA whilst a stocks and shares ISA sounds like too much risk. 

Bonds require me to lock away a fixed amount of money, whereas being paid quarterly I can only spread my savings out throughout the year and I would like access to this savings account to pay for the occasional treat, holiday and birthday/Christmas presents. 

Regular savings accounts seem to only last 12 months, have tight upper bounds and require a current account with the bank as the catch to access the high interest rates.

Normal savings accounts are currently paying very little interest (0.25-0.5%).

personalfinance,"Which direction, continue 401k contribution, or temp halt that to pay credit card debt?","Hello /r/Personalfinance!! 

32 year old married male here, trying to figure out which path to take with paying down credit card debt. 

My wife and I started out the year a little over $20,000 in credit card debt. After my work bonus and income tax refund, my cards are all at balance of $0, except a mattress credit line which is interest free, payments of $155 a month, and will be paid off BEFORE the premotion ends, ao I dont really lump that in at all. My wife has between $7,000 and $8,000 balance remaining on her cards, and we are working to pay them down. The PLAN is to get them paid off and contribute extra towards mortgage principle monthly to get that paid off more quickly (30 yr foxed rate).

I am not sure what info would be needed....

Salary: little above $71,000 US / year
  *with company over 12 years

Wife salary: ~$45,000-$50,000 US / year
  *With gov't about 10 years, no 401k

My 401k balance $51,000
  Personal loan balance: $9800+ (104 payments left at over $103 per payment)
  Principle residence loan balance: $26,700+ (196 payments left at $161.57 per payment)
These loans are at 4.5% interest, HOWEVER, the interest gets paid INTO my 401k fund, the only cost is the 'maintenance fees' and whatever, which were pretty small and already paid, so there really is no rush at THIS time to get these paid off. Right?

I get paid bi-monthly, currently contributing 6% to 401k, which employer matches at 80%. Fidelity handles the investments for me. Additionally, I have a Health Savings Account ALSO with Fidwlity, which I have MAXED, whatever the family max is, between $6500-$7500 / year IIRC. So my plan is to keep thr HSA as long as possible as another retirement vehicle, provided no major health issues which drain that account (again).

NOW.... wife has 2 cards, one is just under $3000 balance, other is $4,000-$5,000 balance, both have VERY high interest rates, would have to check, pretty sure in the 20%-30% range.... she pays towards the cards as well, whatever she can. She makes at LEAST min payments, and goes above if she can. We have 100% separate finances, and each do our own thing. We racked up the cards after purchasing our house 2 years ago, and going a bit overboard on holiday gifts and our kids birthdays, in addition to maintaining a very comfortable lifestyle. These issues have been pow-wow'd, the spending has been CUT, so the PROBLEM has been solved, just a matter of finishing the cleanup. 

Now, would it be advisable to change 401k contributions to 0% for say 6 months, pay towards cards, then re-up to 6% once done, or NOT touch the 401k contributions? As for available cash, I have $300 a month CURRENTLY with NO CHANGES made that I am currently contributing towards the cards. Just made a payment a bit ago. ALSO, Will have another $300 a month extra once childs preschool is done for the year in a month or two. Additionally, I have 2 different savings accounts which I invest into, each is about  $1,500 currently. I have 1 as our emergency fund, and the other as a fun stuff account, like a family vacation, etc. Would it be best to take out of thise and out towards CC's? It wouldnt bother me to withdraw from them to take care of this, just want to try to keep from the next big appliance or automobile fialure from racking up the cards again.

After reading this and while typing, I am THINKING  that the 401k should just be left alone.... Just not sure though, and if I should leaving savings alone or not. Or might anyone know of a special credit consolidation loan or credit card that would accomodate $8,000 witha special 0% interest rate for a set time? 

We unfortunately don't have a budget, but are working towards learning about budgeting and getting one set up.

personalfinance,Questions about improving credit score.,"Hello, I have been trying to up my credit score and had a few questions.

Age: 24  Credit Score: 640 

CC1: Amazon Rewards Card  (Paid in full every month)

CC2: Bealles Card                (Paid in full every month)

Student Loans (On hold, still in school)  Totals 6,000

Car Loan $1500 (I took out the loan against a savings I opened up with the bank with the cost of the car (plus interest) in it, even if worst comes to worst I can pull the money and pay the car off in full and keep the money left from interest.)


The car Loan I am dragging out as long as I can to help with longevity, I explained this to my bank and since my family is in good standing with (pays to know people)  them I got a very low interest rate.  


Should I pay my debts off immediately or wait for the cycle to roll over?  Currently if I buy cloths for me or my daughter I charge it to the card and turn around and pay the card off at the same register.  With my Amazon card I just pay it off every Friday if I used it. 


How much does longevity affect your score? 


I have never made a late payment but when my target card closed due to inactivity my score dropped 87 points. 


Does putting my student loans on hold effect my score or any part of it?  does longevity mean how long the account was open or how long I have been making payments? 


My monthly bills include Probation a Lawyer and Child Support. Then Car insurance and a phone (both through my parents and I pay them directly). I rock climb every Monday at a gym and I might go out to eat, besides these two and filling up with gas (But I drive a Prius) I don't have much credit utilization. Typically &lt; 20%.  Will this hurt my score? 


My budget is pretty tight but I have managed to put 3,000 back for an emergency fund and continue to put 15% of every paycheck back.
 

Chances are that until I am off probation (8 years, I have been told point blank even though i'm on route to have it paid off in 4 years I'll be staying on for the full 10) I'll live with my parents. As much as part of me hates this they are happy with it and I know its best for me to stay with them, then get far away from this county when i'm free.",finance,1459960710

technology,What's Wrong with Google's Results Page?,"Google collected the best of the world's computer engineers, and they are working night and day, for many years, slowly and methodically, using the most advanced methods, in order to increase Google's revenues . Every element on the results page is a masterpiece of deception that  passed the test of billions of people. [1]

At the top of the results page, under the search words, in bright black letters,  appear the number of results.

To its Right, in brackets, in smaller dark black font - an indication of the duration of the search.

Every page results has ten results.

Every result has a blue title

Green link beneath it,

Date beneath it,

Followed by a snippet, which is a summary of the proposed document. The Snippet has usually two lines.

Inside the snippet in bold letters show the keywords the user typed.

Google's results page is full of deliberate diversions, elements which are wasting the user's time, obstacles placed on his way to the answer he is looking for.

The number of the results and the duration of the search are interesting for the engineers at Google but not for the surfer.

The title is not meant to be relevant. It is designed to allow the surfer to reach the document from which the snippet was taken. After exiting from any document the title changes color, in order to prevent the user from re-entering the document he already visited. The title of the sponsored links and of the organic links look identical (there's a tiny square with the word Ad in front of the sponsored links). It is designed as a trap that forces the user to click on the sponsored link, which is less relevant, but is placed before the organic link2]]. 

The colored link is irrelevant - it is not designed to be read.

The date is irrelevant - it certainly is not that important to be placed at the top of the snippet.

The number of results does not help the surfer to understand the answers. The hundreds, thousands and millions of results that are waiting for him on the following pages just confuse and frighten him [3]. A typical surfer sees only the first screen, and not even the entire results page, ie, the first five results [4].

Each result has colorful letters and black letters on a white background. As we know, colorful letters attract more attention than black and white letters [5]. If  the snippets were colorful and all the rest of the text was in black on white, we could understand that the main thing is the information, while the title and the link are less important, but the color is dedicated to the title and the link, and the impression is that they are meant to separate the results, and that the purpose of the result it to navigate outside by clicking the title.






Even the result that Google ranks first, because it is the most relevant, leads to a document that has, generally, many paragraphs, but only few of them are relevant and contain the keywords typed by the user.

Google's snippet is too short [6] and fragmentary, and it does not allow the surfer to best decide whether he should surf to the proposed document.

personalfinance,Car dealership offered to let us finance a car we wanted o buy outright to get a rebate. Want to know what you think about our liability to pay off all interest if paid early.,"So I went to help my parents buy a car outright, 3rd one I'm helping them with. I did this all over the internet and basically put dealerships up against each other until we got a price that multiple dealerships said they wouldn't touch. So the price is good.

Total is $36,500 and we put $500 on a credit car 2 days ago. On Monday when we shook hands in the dealership they said we could bring any old check and it didn't have to be a cashier's or certified. Yesterday we go in with our check and they said it had to be a cashier's.

What they also said is we could finance the whole thing, or a minimum of $9,000, and get an extra $1,000 rebate and pay it off in 3 months with no penalty for prepayment. 

Now none of us have ever financed a car before, we buy outright. What we don't know is if we'll be on the hook for all of the interest, or the finance charge, if we pay it off at the 3 month mark. The contract does say there is no prepayment fee but that has nothing to do with the finance charge.

Here's the specifics for the example contract he let us take home and look over.

APR: 4.49%

Finance Charge: $4,213.00

Amount Financed: $35,000

Total of Payments: $39,213

60 Payments. 

$653.55 per.

At the top it reads: ~You agree to pay the seller the amount financed and finance charge in U.S. funds according to the payment schedule below. We will figure your finance charge on a daily basis.

On the back it reads:

Finance Charge and Payments:

a. How we will figure finance charge. We will figure the finance charge on a daily basis at the APR on the unpaid part of the amount financed.

b. How will we apply payments. We may apply each payment to the earned and unpaid part of the finance charge, to the unpaid part of the amount financed and to other amounts you owe under this contract in any order we choose.

c. How late payments or early payments change what you must pay. We based the finance charge, total of payments, and total sale price shown on page 1 of this contract on the assumption that you will make every payment on the day that it is due. Your finance charge, total of payments, and total sale price will be more if you pay late and less if you pay early. Changes may take the form of a larger or smaller final payment or, at our option more or fewer payments of the same amount as your scheduled payment with a smaller final payment. 

d. You may prepay. You may prepay all or part of the unpaid part of the amount financed at any time with no penalty. If you do so, you must pay the earned and unpaid part of the finance charge and all other amounts due up to the date of your payment.

So if we pay it of at the minimum time of 3 months do we just pay the interest on 3 months or do we owe all of the interest in the final payment?

Also, with regard to the interest rate they said it's a standard rate if you want the rebate and has nothing to do with credit score. you're either approved or you aren't. And it's really a moot point if we don't owe all the interest when we pay if off in 3 months.

The example given was for 35 grand because of the check situation so we could leave with the car that day. We promptly said no and asked for the paperwork and said if we did it it'd be for the $9,000. I also don't know why there total financed is about $100 more than an interest calculator says it should be.  

Thanks so much. None of us have ever leased or financed.",finance,1459963319

personalfinance,PSA for new Honda owners / another reason to have an emergency fund,"For anyone reading out there, who drives a Honda and financed it directly through the Honda dealership, you may have noticed that Honda Financial Services dun goofed today. Big time.

I made my monthly car payment yesterday, and it went through successfully. However, when I checked my bank statement this morning, I noticed a second charge appear for the same amount. They double-charged the payment. I was very annoyed, so I called their 1-800 customer service line, and it was down (go figure). Got a recorded message saying ""all circuits are busy"".

I did some searching, and found that many other people were reporting the same problem. Explains why the ""circuits are busy""....

If you had this situation happen, it's not you, it's them. They messed it up. No word yet on how long they're gonna take to resolve this. You can try calling your bank to see if they'll stop/reverse the 2nd payment. That worked for me. Hopefully they would take care of any overdraft fees, if that happened to you.

And that leads me into the last thing I wanted to say. I'm very grateful for an emergency fund - this situation is a minor inconvenience to me, and I'm in no hurry to get it resolved. Didn't have to urgently re-dial the 1-800 number over and over, and didn't have to panic about getting it resolved immediately.

Sadly there are some people out there who are saying that this overdrafted their account, and they won't be able to buy groceries/gas/etc. Some of these stories may be exaggerated, but some of them are probably real.

Yes, Honda will work everything out with the bank and reverse it eventually, but if that takes ""3-5 business days"" or some crap like that, the grocery store won't accept that as a form of currency.

That would all be a non-issue with an emergency fund.

**tl;dr - For anyone who has their vehicle financed through Honda Financial Services, they apparently made a big mistake on their end and double-charged payments for tons of people. Then their customer service line went down, just to add insult to injury. So if this happened to you, call your bank, and see if they can help you.**

Bitcoin,Lightning Network Fees,"Lightning nodes are wallets, and need private keys to sign their own transactions.  A hack on a lightning node would allow the attacker to bitcoin contained within the node used for settlement. This means they will have to be hardened nodes, like modern mining rigs.

Yet, the security risk is an order of magnitude greater than in mining - because mining hacks can be detected and repaired quickly at a loss of 24 hours of revenue.  After the first 10 or 20 major breaches of amateur-PC lightning nodes, the amateurs will get out, trust-based services will crop up.  Attackers of LN nodes can dump funds to relay partners.  

Suppose I have 100BTC, and I run a node that costs me $29/month for a dedicated server running a hardened O/S like pfsense. How much will I need to charge to make $29/month?   OR maybe I buy a hardened, preconfigured raspberry pi for $150.  Suppose in the near future, lightning gets 200k transactions per day, and there are 100K bitcoin participating (P) across 5000 nodes (N). That's an average of 20BTC/node (which is very high ... in real life people will try to spin up smaller nodes).  Now each node will get 40 TX/day, or 1200/month.

Just to justify hosting costs (H), it would cost 2.5-cents per transaction for lightning.  Or to pay you back for that nice raspberry pi hardened LN node.  2.5 cents gets you zero return on investment for only a 5,000 node network. 

To justify the risk of exposing coin in a node, people will also want a return, maybe 1-2% or more -  which adds another penny or so.   The more nodes you have and the more bitcoin is committed, the more expenses are accrued.   The more actual risk of loss there is, the more the risk-adjusted rate will be. (Risk-Free Monthly Interest + Monthly Risk = AR).

Plug your own estimates of N, H, P, AR (detailed above) into the following and let me know what you get.

    TOTAL = N * H + P * AR
    TXCOST = TOTAL/TXMONTH

My personal estimate is 1-5 cents per transaction in expenses.  NOTE: The expenses have nothing to do with fees.   People may run nodes for the love of it.   But the expenses will just get spread around the Bitcoin ecosystem accordingly.

Obviously, if the number of transactions goes to millions on the lightning network... then, finally, you'll see true costs come down to under 1/10 penny.... since interest rates and hosting costs will remain relatively fixed by comparison.",cryptocurrency,1459968796

My mom has excellent credit and suggested we move as much as I can to a Citi card of her's with 0% interest on balance transfers until October of 2017.

OR maybe I buy a hardened, preconfigured raspberry pi for $150. Suppose in the near future, lightning gets 200k transactions per day, and there are 100K bitcoin participating (P) across 5000 nodes (N). That's an average of 20BTC/node (which is very high ... in real life people will try to spin up smaller nodes). Now each node will get 40 TX/day, or 1200/month.

Just to justify hosting costs (H), it would cost 2.5-cents per transaction for lightning. Or to pay you back for that nice raspberry pi hardened LN node. 2.5 cents gets you zero return on investment for only a 5,000 node network.

To justify the risk of exposing coin in a node, people will also want a return, maybe 1-2% or more - which adds another penny or so. The more nodes you have and the more bitcoin is committed, the more expenses are accrued. The more actual risk of loss there is, the more the risk-adjusted rate will be. (Risk-Free Monthly Interest + Monthly Risk = AR).

My estimate is 1-5 cents per transaction in real costs. NOTE: The real costs have nothing to do with actual costs. People may run nodes for the love of it. But the real cost will just get spread around the Bitcoin ecosystem accordingly.

Finally, if the number of transactions goes to millions on the lightning network... then, finally, you'll see true costs come down to under 1/10 penny.... since interest rates and hosting costs will remain relatively fixed by comparison.

    TOTAL = N * H + P * AR
    TXCOST = TOTAL/TXMONTH

personalfinance,"Starting a new job, should I keep or sell my car? (x-post)","Hey all. I am 21 and starting a new job (well going back to an old job) and the pay is just shy of $21/hr. 

I am a college student, and I have asthma/allergies and need some dental work done (yes this is pertinent later). Anyways, at this new job, I will have the option to work a lot of OT during the summer. My plan is to work 12 weeks of at least 60 hrs. 

What I need advice on is that, with all of this OT that I will be getting and the income that will be associated with it, should I use it to pay off my car that I got in February? It is a 06' Subaru impreza, nothing special automatic. Grey w/ spoiler. I owe just short of 6k on it. Here is my opinion of the car. It was half an impulse buy because I was sick of having to fix my old jetta vr6 99' which was manual. I put so much money into the car even after I paid it off, that I got fed up, plus I wanted something with four wheel drive since I live in a snowy state. 

However, I miss driving manual and looking back at it, I traded my paid-off jetta for a car that has less power (which I can live with), is automatic (regretting) and will cost enough money anyways since the loan was 6k, it will need the head gasket work in 1-3yrs, and it's due for the 100k maintenance. 

I'm seriously considering selling it because if I work all over the summer to make enough money to pay off the car, I won't have any money to do what I really want which is have enough money for next school semester (roughly $2k) get my allergy shots (~1-1.4k) pay off my credit card (~1.5k) and possibly start getting my teeth straightened. 

Can anyone help me sort out if I should try and sell my car, get a cheaper car that is older and that I can pay off right away (oh forgot to mention I go this new car to drive for Uber, which since then I have not done it at all) and is manual. I don't care for the power of the car, it would be nice, but I'm not going to cry over it. Or should I just keep it, pay it off and try and save money down the road. 

I plan on taking home 13k over the 12 weeks that I work OT and I have 3k in savings right now. Any advice would help. 

btw. my income won't stay at a 40+hr work week, because over the school semesters I will be working PT. Paying off my car means not having a car payment and a cheaper insurance payment, so I am thinking that I could to pay it off or buy a cheaper car (after selling this one) outright and then use the money I make over the summer towards the other things mentioned above.

 thank you. Sorry for this jumbled post.

tl;dr bought a car for 6k, but it needs maintenance which will run another 3-4k. partially impulsive buy. Starting new job that will pay 21/hr and can work OT over the summer.

gaming,"For people who don't play fighting games, what's the reason? i think the devs want to know so i'm asking for them.","So, anyone who already plays fighting games is welcome to read this thread and comment but please don't make fun or insult the people who don't play fighting games. this thread is mainly for them.

Okay, so.
Why don't you play fighting games?
Is it the execution barrier, i.e. difficult combos or difficult move commands?

Is it the community, the FGC as it's known? they are known for being a bit of a boys club and a very trashtalky community.

Is it the lack of meaningful singleplayer content? Street Fighter 5 certainly launched without much single player content. Mortal Kombat X on the other hand had a ton of great engaging singleplayer content and it sold 6 million copies which is a lot for the fighting game industry.

Is it the design decisions, such as tripping in Smash Brother's Brawl, or the built-in risk of losing your ranking or points simply by losing a match or two in Street Fighter 4?

Is it the character designs? there are a lot of voluptuous women and gruff muscled men in fighting games. In fact i have only ever heard of a single fighting game that let you play as an elderly woman that actually looked elderly, even though almost every fighting game has an old man character playable. and no, Blanche from Mortal Kombat X doesn't count lol.

The reason i'm asking this is i keep hearing from fighting game companies that they want to expand the market and help more people get good at the games but whenever i bring it up with my fighting game friends on eventhubs or shoryuken they always say things like ""Capcom only wants customers that are willing to commit"" or ""making controls easier makes it too overpowered"" or ""making controls easier doesn't help scrubs win so it's a waste of time"" or ""if you want to play fighting games you have to be willing to grind and suffer for months on end""... well that last one was a paraphrase but you get what i'm saying. I personally think Street Fighter 5 should have an offline-only super-easy control mode (with a built-in damage reduction), similar to how smash bros plays (ie: press a button and a direction to do a special move instead of inputting a complicated command and then having to input a followup to make it better such as the FADC from Street Fighter 4 or the multi-part grabs in tekken). but i would still want this mode to be using the 6 button control scheme. This was actually a real feature in Street Fighter X Tekken which is the only reason my parents can play Street Fighter X Tekken (they can't play any other street fighter games because they can't input any of the commands properly). it was called the Super-Easy-Control Gem and it made you do 10% less damage so it wasn't overpowered (although i think it should've been more like 25%). But we all know how street fighter x tekken was received (very very badly) which is sad because the super-easy-control was awesome for people like my parents, people who want to do special moves but literally can't move their thumbs fast enough to do them even with tons of practice.

what do you think, should fighting games give slight help to those who desire it, or should fighting games force people to all climb the same exhausting mountain of execution? should girls have unrealistic bodies in fighting games or should they look like real people? should the FGC stop being rude and sexist, or is it not rude or sexist at all?

In case anyone thinks i'm a scrub at fighting games, i sort of am i admit but i DID acquire B-rank online with T.Hawk in Super Street Fighter 4: Arcade Edition, and that was BEFORE they buffed his condor spire. Also i beat Street Fighter 5's 30-man survival with 2 characters and my Jack-6 in Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is pretty decent too (i'm just learning to do low parries on wakeup and it's really fun). i just wish the games were more accommodating to noobs so that fighting games can get more successful and popular instead of all these shooting games and survival horror games and whatnot (not to knock them though; i heard The Last Of Us was amazing)

btw i don't really go to tournaments much because i'm an aspie and the yelling and trashtalking makes me get overstimulated which makes me freak the f out sometimes... i'm not at all like most fighting game fans but neither are most gamers so i think i'm in the majority when you look at the big picture. maybe not... whatever!",technology,1459996013

personalfinance,How to source Down Payment for a first-time home purchase?,"Hello r/personalfinance! 

Due to a potential career relocation, I find myself in the interesting position of suddenly confronted with the necessity of purchasing a home in the next few months. As a renter in an expensive real estate market, this hadn't really been a consideration for me. After looking at the market where I'm moving to, I think I will be very happy in a roughly $200K home. I have approximately $8-10K cash on hand I can use for down payment

My options, as far as I can see them, are as follows:

(A) Combining my cash, I can withdraw about $30K permanently from my 457 account to scrap together 20% down for the mortgage. If you are not familiar with a 457, they are almost identical to a 401k, except I don't pay an early withdrawal penalty, but I will have to pay normal income tax on the disbursement.

(B) Cash + a $25K loan from my 457 + $5K from another source, either a disbursement from my 457 or begging relatives, friends, loan shark, etc. The $25K loan is the maximum allowed by the 457 rules, and needs to be paid back in equal payments over the next 5 years.

(C) FHA loan. Cash on hand should be good enough for the 3.5% down payment required. Downsides appear to be a higher loan interest rate, plus the PMI on the life of the loan. Obviously, this allows me to leave my 457 alone though. 

(D) Rent. The rental market where I'm relocating is not good though, and supply dictates either very low-quality housing (unsafe neighborhoods, slumlords, etc) or very pricey units where I would be paying quite a premium over what a mortgage payment + taxes + upkeep would cost, with the downside of not building equity.

So those appear to be my options, and maybe some of you could help me reason through this, or think up other options I haven't thought of? Thanks!",finance,1460001028

personalfinance,"Buying a home, feel like I have a shady lender.. (USA)","Hello PF,

So I'm in the process of buying a home. Long story short, I was going to use USAA for my lending on a VA loan. Everything seems nice. I was told 3.5% for rate, 3.5548% APR, but they told me some stuff, kind of unrelated, that made me want to shop just a bit.

My realtor suggested a loan broker type of guy, said he was real good. He called me back today and said that he got me a 3.25% rate, with a similar estimate on closing costs. He also said that he could wrap my closing into the loan at roughly 3.5% for the rate. I thought great, I can have the same rate and pay no closing or have an even cheaper rate. So I've now started the application with him.

However, it dawned on me that he didn't tell me the APR. I know that can give me an idea of what fees are associated with my loan and I wanted to compare it to the 3.25% rate to see just how expensive the loan was. I called back and asked what the APR was and he told me, after a brief pause, ""APR is kind of a relic, we don't really quote it anymore. The rate is what is important and all that usually matters is that the home payment is affordable""

That really sounds like some used car salesman shit to me. I looked up what I could, and it seems to me that quoting APR along with a rate is required by federal law for the truth in lending act. Am I wrong? Do I need to say something here?

Regardless, I'm just going to stick with USAA as I have always trusted them, but I just wanted to ask some folks who were way more knowledgeable about this stuff, and my realtor and lenders are probably not the people to ask.

I had an existing line of credit debt load of 8k + 2k in medical bills that OHIP didn't cover.

I'm no longer homeless nor am I in Canada (back in the US where I'm originally from). I've been chipping away at the largest debt and hope to have that paid off in the coming months; the medical bills I can handle in one shot by the end of the year.

I know paying back debt with interest does not actually improve one's credit score; what I have will be on the report for another  6 years or so. And I know I won't qualify for loans, credit cards even with outrageously high interest rates, etc.

How many years am I looking at when it comes to bringing the score back up to 650ish? 5 or 7? Shorter? Longer? Is it even worth attempting to rebuild it, say screw it, and stay in the US (where I have 0 credit history)? 

TL:DR;
God awful credit score due to lack of funds and stability over a very lengthy period of time. Paying down the highest, most outstanding debts first but know that does little to improve the score. Can't give an estimate as to how many years it will take to repair credit, if it can even be done.

When I signed the contract, I was told the APR was 28%.
My monthly payments are $334.20. Not that it makes a huge difference, but I always round up a dollar with each payment I make so the monthly payment totals $336. I check my payment history a few days after my bank mails each payment so I know the loan company received it.

I recently noticed a page on the site where its showing my daily interest rate. What is this? How is this calculated? Am I paying 28% APR? 7% daily interest? I don't understand.

I've tried to contact the loan provider and ask questions, but the CSRs are people who are sitting at home with a headset. (3 out of 5 of the people I have talked to had either a TV playing in the back or children yelling. I've verified during each call that I was in fact speaking with the correct company/person).

I've tried using Google and read that car loans are different than student or home loans in that they use a simple interest vs compound. So long story short, if I read correctly, the amount of interest and principal I pay each month will vary based on the days in between payments.

I considered paying an extra $100 a month, but I'm not sure if that will actually go towards the principal. With my luck it would go towards interest. No one has been able to give me the same answer twice over the phone.

I realize now that my decision to get this car was TERRIBLE. I was in need of a vehicle that weekend, the only down payment I had was the car I had at the time, I didn't have any money saved, and this was the only place that I could find with a reasonable, safe, problem free car.

personalfinance,£100k inheritance investment/management advice?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

More or less a x-post from /r/financialadvice as it seems to be dead over there. Have also added a couple of points after a chat with a friend yesterday.

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am about to come into some money and just wondered if anyone had any advice about where to keep/invest it, any advice greatly appreciated as I would like to make the most of what I'm getting.

The amount coming to me, after I pay off a couple of immediate debts and maybe splash a small amount, will be just under £100k.
My monthly fixed outgoings at the moment are about £800 give or take, and I am recently self employed so for the sake of argument lets say that at the moment my earnings are zero. I have been paying myself £1200/month from savings while I build the business and this covers all living expenses. Business costs are covered from earnings, I am just not yet making enough to live off but anticipate this changing over the next few months. I may give myself a £5-10k budget to invest in equipment and branding if further research suggests this will provide a decent return.

A few more pertinent facts:

*I had a pension in my old job but will want to set up some long term savings (I am currently early 30s) - doesn't have to be a specific pension scheme if this is not the best bet but would like to know that the long term is being contributed to.

*I would like to buy a house in the future, as we are currently renting. However, partner does not have any savings and I won't be a desirable candidate for a decent mortgage rate until the business is more profitable/stable, so it's not an immediate plan plus we like our rented house so we aren't in a rush. We would also like to await a dip in the market as prices where we live are out of our budget right now. I am envisaging putting around £40k on a deposit when the time comes, and hopefully spending &lt;200k overall. I know the help to buy ISA won't be the best place for a lot of money but I figure opening one can't hurt and potentially thinking of opening one in my partner's name also. We are not married if that makes a difference.

*I am open to investment rather than saving if this means a higher return, but as this is a very significant amount of money to me, I would prefer not to be taking big risks as I cannot afford to lose a lot.

*I do have student debt (£13k remaining) but I'm not overly keen on paying this off as a lump sum as it doesn't seem the sensible option. This has always been paid PAYE though so I don't know much about the current student loan interest rates and so on.

*My friend mentioned great returns on property bonds that he has some spread investments in. This friend is very trustworthy and mentioned 10% returns, but when I mentioned this to my dad he was very skeptical of these figures. I'd love to get some pointers on where to look into these types of bonds.

*My friend also mentioned some sort of government bonds along the same lines but with lower returns but also lower risk. Any ideas what these might be and whether they are a good choice?

First and foremost, I will be needing an account/multiple accounts to transfer the money into, which preferably would be giving me at least some interest, and ready access to the money before I decide on some longer term investments. Since I have no immediate big purchases in mind, I want to try and make the money work for me if possible, but I don't know the first thing about this. I'd love to keep quick access to around £40k for the house deposit but happy to have the rest tied up in investments in the longer term. So any advice on which savings accounts will work for this amount would be great. Beyond that, investment advice would be great.",finance,1460039462

I don't have any debts to pay off and even if I were to go over-budget, I could pay it in one shot without having to dip into my emergency funds but that would be a good chunk of change that would not be accruing interest.

Another factor is my credit score.  I don't have a house and I've never had to get a loan.  My score is about 810 on a scale of 900 which means I can expect to get a decent interest rate for the car.  I'd also like to get my credit score up, ideally above 850 even if this is more for ego-related rather than practical reasons.  Would the length or amount of the loan have an impact on this?

personalfinance,Handling credit card debt with a personal loan/refinancing debt? Is it worth it?,"First time poster here, looking for advise on debt. I'll try to make it as succinct as I can with relevant information.

My fiance and I recently purchased a condo, closed last November (2015), so there is a mortgage involved but we both make this priority number 1.  Admittedly it does make me financially tight month to month (~45% of my paycheck.)

The issue is that I am in about $7000 credit card debt on two fairly high interest cards (one is ~18%.)  I have had them for a while, but since moving the debt has gone up, mostly in day to day expenses but some big purchases as well.  Worth mentioning is that I am good about making payments on time, I do try to pay more than the minimum amount, and I do have excellent credit.   At my salary and what I can afford it will take several years at this point to pay off, with hefty interest charges.

Would it be worth, as an alternative, to look into a personal loan to pay this debt off/refinance the debt?  The fact that the interest rate would be significantly lower has me seriously considering this as an option- I figure either way, it will likely take me 2-3 years to pay this debt off. I also don't know if this is a good idea because of the mortgage that was just taken out.  

I have started making some changes to my lifestyle in an effort to curb spending: these include not buying lunch/coffee every day, quitting smoking, not buying beer as much, as well as physically keeping all credit cards out of my wallet until I can get more  financially stabilized.

TL;DR- use a personal loan to pay off $7K CC debt?  Pros/Cons of this?  Repurcussion if I have a mortgage already?",finance,1460053167

2. I've had some issues with the laptop - hardware-wise it was not defective, but decided to return within the 30-day period. I keep good care of my products and it was the same here. I spoke with a returns rep, explained my situation, and confirmed no restock fee would be charged as long as it was in good condition as discussed.

3. I return the laptop on Nov '15, receiving a confirmation of receipt on November 11, '15.

4. Now at this point I'm without a laptop and was hoping for the funds to come back before I purchase another one. I was told that the process could take up to 6 wks (30 business days), that's fine since I was the one that chose to return anyway.

5. Considering that it is the holiday season, I wait until the end of the year, periodically calling in to check when it will be processed. No definite answer is given.

6. By Jan 2nd, I've called at least 5x, it's been more than the 30 business days as quoted, and no answer is given. I am fed up, call my credit card company (AMEX) and explain my situation.

7. My CC company returns my funds, and I thought they took care of it.

personalfinance,Thoughts on my college situation,"I've only been admitted to one viable school, which is luckily the best school for my major in my state. I've just received my initial financial aid package from my school and I was wondering what pf thinks of my situation going into this. 

Grants/Scholarships:

* $1765.00 Pell Grant (renews every year)
* $2610.00 Grant from School (I think this renews)
* $865.00 random grant (I think this renews)
* $3090.00 scholarship (renews every year)

Loans:

* $3500 federal subsidized
* $2000 federal unsubsidized
* $7430 parent plus loan (I will not qualify for this)

Cost of attendance for my school (tuition, housing, food, cell phone, etc.) - $21,260

I have a total of $8,330 dollars of free money and $5500 in loans that I already qualify for. My dad does not qualify for parent plus loans, so I should be given more unsubsidized loans once that is updated. I do not think that I will be spending the full $21k per year because that includes things like 500/yr for clothes and cell phone bills that my grandparents kindly have decided to help with. I estimate my actual cost of attendance to be more like $18k/yr. 

I plan on majoring in computer engineering and like I said this school is by far the best engineering school in my state. Based on these rough numbers I'm assuming I will come out with $40k in debt at the end of four years without putting any cash down.

My father plans to help out with about $300-400/mo which would certainly help, but I do not think he will actually be able to do this so I am not counting on it. I believe I will have somewhere around $3000 cash saved up by the time school starts from working my own jobs. 

I do not have any other viable college offers, (Accepted to Purdue but they gave no grants and I would have to pay about 45k/yr hahahaha no thanks) so this is certainly the school I will be going to.

personalfinance,Info on retirement allocations,"Hey PF - I was curious about savings allocations and the 4% rule recently and it led to a few charts I thought others might be interested in. Just thinking about long-term financial goals.

What got me thinking was the S&amp;P 500 average return after inflation is 7% since 1950 ([source](http://www.simplestockinvesting.com/SP500-historical-real-total-returns.htm)). So why is the rule of thumb for retirement withdrawals 4%? And if market downturns have been pretty transient in the modern market (e.g. since the '30s when the Fed learned their first big lesson) then is it prudent to risk outliving our retirement accounts by putting a majority into bonds around the time we hit 60? 

The problem, of course, is that if we have a stock-based portolio in retirement and the market has a big drawdown (like it has twice since 2000) then we are selling a larger number of shares for the same spending compared to if we had limited our exposure to the more volatile stocks by moving some percent of our portfolio into bonds which we can sell disproportionately more of during a stock downturn. 

This is especially true if there's a big drawdown early in retirement. The S&amp;P, after all, dropped from highs around 1,500 to close to half that in both 2000-2003 and 2007-2009. How disastrous would it be to have to sell twice the stock for the same income if this happened shortly after retiring??

And it's not as if such volatility is unusual, even if you consider a ""modern"" era beginning in 1940 or 1950 (see [here](http://www.multpl.com/inflation-adjusted-s-p-500) for inflation adjusted S&amp;P on a log scale so the bumps aren't smoothed). 

Of course, following these periods the stocks return to trend fairly quickly, and with much greater earnings than bonds besides. 

I wanted to make a fairly superficial look at this by only looking at the very recent past. I used two funds - [VTSAX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0585) for total stock market, and [VBMFX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0084&amp;FundIntExt=INT) for bonds. I had to use a stock fund rather than index to get the total return, and I wanted a total stock fund and a total bond fund by the same company for consistency. I downloaded a price history for both *which includes fee, dividend, and interest adjustments.* 

I began with 2000 to simulate ""bad luck retirement"" shortly before a big drawdown and set up data series to simulate 100% stocks (in VTSAX), 100% bonds (VBMFX), as well as 80/20 mix and a 50/50 mix. The balanced portfolios re-balanced monthly and all scenarios involved monthly withdrawals of the same dollar amount based on that month's pricing of the funds. 

I then decided to see what would happen in the reverse, a ""good luck retirement"" at the bottom of a dip. Everything's the same except the start is bumped up to 2003. 

I picked $1 mil as an easy, round number with ~4% withdrawals. 

[$1 Mil - $3,500 per month from 2000](http://i.imgur.com/KYt0k3a.png)

[$1 Mil - $3,500 per month from 2003](http://i.imgur.com/WahKg28.png)

Since I already had the sheet and chart set up, I also decided to simulate saving for retirement in the same period with either all stock or by re-balancing. I've read numerous times that investors who go all stock don't actually see the theoretical gains compared to balancing with bonds because the balancing at low points in the market actually capitalizes on the volatility. I've never actually seen supporting data so I was curious if it was in recent market performance. 

Again, just picking easy numbers:

[$100k + $1k per month from 2000](http://i.imgur.com/tvtWkfK.png)

[$100k + $1k per month from 2003](http://i.imgur.com/KgV42T0.png)

**LIMITATION TIME:** This is only one time period (and a subset of that one time period). There have previously been and very well may be larger stock downturns, and by the same token we saw the bond market implode a mere 30 years ago. This is a snapshot exploration to see the impact of known downturns on a hypothetical portfolio, not a general model that you should consider reliable going forward. Not to mention this much shorter than you'll want your retirement to be, and it neither accounts for inflation nor spending habits in retirement. 

Still it's food for thought. I've found that the more aware I am of things like both how much and how little saving $1k per month for 15 years will yield helps me stick to my day-in day-out habits that make saving as much as possible less painful.",finance,1460060742

In this post, I'm going to show you why that advice is 100% wrong.  I recently walked another Redditor through these scenarios and thought the information would be useful for the new grads that will be entering the workforce in a few months.  This is especially applicable to those of you interested in FI/RE.

**Case study:**
Joe Redditor is 23 years old and recently graduated from college.  He has $45,000 in student debt at 6.2% interest.  Joe lives in a reasonable cost-of-living area and has landed a job making $52,000/year.  As a result, he has the opportunity to get super-aggressive with his loans and pay them off at a rate of $1,200/month and could completely pay them off in 3.5 years (GO JOE!).  But should he?

In this example, I'm going to use a Traditional IRA as the retirement investment vehicle because it's not dependent on a benefit your employer offers and is available to everybody.  The principles are largely transferable to other investment vehicles (with some caveats).  Also, regardless of the investment vehicle used, Joe should prioritize building himself an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months worth of expenses as soon as possible (where Joe should stash that emergency fund is another story and, ultimately, another post).

As mentioned above, Joe can pay $1,200/month and pay off his debt in 42 months, at which point he can start contributing to his IRA.  Conversely, Joe can pay $740/month toward his student loans and $460 towards his IRA, which is **exactly** what he should do.  By contributing $460/month to his IRA, Joe will reach the maximum annual contribution of $5,500.

Now, let's look at the numbers.

If Joe contributes $5,500/year starting at 23 and earns an average 7% return on that money, he can expect to have a nest egg worth $1,357,000 when he retires.  Using the [4% rule](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/), Joe could expect to withdraw $54,000/year for 30 years of retirement (note, the 4% rule may or [may not be appropriate any longer](https://www.stackingbenjamins.com/4-percent-retirement-withdrawal-rule-does-it-work/)).

If, on the other hand, Joe waits until he's paid his loan off to contribute to his IRA, under the same conditions, but with 3.5 fewer years in the market, his nest egg will only be worth $1,016,000, limiting Joe to withdrawing $40,600/year.

But what's happening to Joe's loans?  The difference between paying $1,200/month vs. $740/month is an additional 32 payments.  It takes Joe just over 6 years to pay off his debt instead of 3.5.  He does wind up paying an additional $4,009 in interest over the life of the loans.  However, when contrasted against the $341,000 ding to his nest egg and $13,000/year in withdraws during his retirement that Joe would sacrifice by paying his loans off early, this number is infinitesimally small.  When you factor in the $5,500 tax write-off Joe has for his IRA which allows him to pay $1,670 less a year in taxes, that $4,000 is wiped out in just a couple of years.

The reason for this is the power of compound interest.  It's purely a time-in-the-market play and **every single year** counts.  Congrats on graduating, grads.  Now go start funding your retirement!

personalfinance,"My wife and I have ~$18k in CC debt. Wanted to replace with a bank loan, but credit isn't good enough. What are my options?","Hi /r/personalfinance.  This is my first post here, so please let me know if I have anything wrong in terms of rules and such.

My wife and I have about $18k in credit card debt.  Much of that was accrued as a result of moving across the country and miscellaneous purchases.  Some of it (~3k) was my wife spending money we couldn't afford, and me finding out after the fact.  It's slowly grown over time, and we've not been able to pay as we go because I've been the sole provider for our family of 3 while my wife is in school and my daughter is in daycare.  (No family nearby to help watch the kid or anything.)

My wife is done with school and now working.  My child will still be in daycare, but in the next 1-2 months, we'll likely only need her to attend 2-3 days/week instead of full-time.

The point of this post is that my wife and I are hoping to pay off our CC debt in the next 9-12 months.  My CC rate is horrendous: it's about 20% APR, so we're paying $300+ per month on interest alone.  I know we can pay it off if we try really hard and I can get my wife onboard; we've done it once before (prior to moving to our current residency).  We got down to $0 CC debt, but unfortunately we're here again.  At least I have the confidence that we can do it again though.

The problem is this: I tried to take out a $15k loan in hopes of having a much lower interest rate, but I was only approved for $5k.  I also tried to apply for a new credit card that was offering a $0 APR on transfers for one year, but I was only approved for $5k there as well.  I used to have great credit, but it's unfortunately gotten into a not-so-great place over the years with our general lack of funds.

I'm not really sure what my options are other than either: a) paying off the debt as best we can now that my wife is working, or b) taking the $5k loan, using the $5k transfer at 0 APR, and tackling all 3 (scary).

Hoping for some suggestions and insight.  Thanks!",finance,1460062539

personalfinance,"Questions regarding student loans and marriage, please help.","I have 63k in student loans (grad and undergrad combined) all federal. I am enrolled in the income based repayment (IBR) plan and I am also taking advantage of the public service loan forgiveness program (pslf) as I am a public servant (I am currently 2 years into the 10 year program). I basically pay just over the interest in a given month so my principle is not really moving. 

I am getting married soon and I have some questions about how this would effect my loans. My fiancé is a nurse and makes about what I do (43k), but we are just starting out so that number will likely grow. 

Once we are married will her income effect my IBR payment? 

What happens if we eventually end up making too much to qualify for IBR, will I no longer be eligible for IBR and therefore not be eligible for the pslf? I am worried I will get 8 years in and not be eligible and waste all this time and payments that are basically just the interest. Is the IBR the only plan that qualifies for pslf? 

Can we file our taxes separately in order to avoid her adding to my income? Would we lose out by doing this?

When we get married would she inherent my debt? I don't want her to be at all responsible for it in anyway.

personalfinance,Car issues.,"I'll keep this short.

My boyfriend purchased a 2010 Mazda 3 in 2014.  He didn't have much trade-in value so ended up financing about $13k........... at in interest rate of 23%.  He had decent credit at the time (not good, but not bad), but apparently it was a personal loan hence why the interest rate is so outrageous. 

So this vehicle is in pretty decent shape (I'd rate it between ""good"" and ""fair"" on KBB or Edmunds), but it wasn't worth the price that he paid for it.  It's up to 103k miles and he still owes about $9,000 on it, with payments of about $300/m.

We've already looked into refinancing, but no bank will do it.  He makes decent money but that $300/m on top of his student loan payments are eating him alive.

I have two Federal Perkins loans amounting to $2000 from University A.
I transferred to University B and graduated in May 2013.

I called University A in February 2016 questioning why the two Federal Perkins loans are still in deferment status. Due to a glitch in the University A's system, the loans two Federal Perkins loans were deferred indefinitely. University A set to correct the mistake and placed the loans back into repayment status.
The loans are placed back into repayment status with the standard 9 month grace period backdating from when I graduated in May 2013 (thus ending Feb 2014). I am now charged interest from Feb 2014 until the present.

I requested, since it was always in deferment status until I called, if the interest can be waived. University A denied request. My financial situation is good at the moment. I can repay in full. 

I understand that the fact that the loans were always in deferment status until Feb 2016 was an error. However, my question is this, should I just pay the $2000 with interest or continue to ask about waiving interest? I am a little uncomfortable about the whole backdating deferment issue.",finance,1460067569

* ~$200 of medical debt I am paying off with my HSA

Remainder goes into PSL #1. YNAB tells me 65% of my take home pay for this year has gone into paying student loans. I tend to only splurge on food, and that only occasionally.

I saved up the money for an apartment because my living situation may become emotionally unbearable, so I'm giving myself a buffer if I need to sacrifice my financial security for my mental health.

**Current Plan**

* Pay off PSL #1 this year. 
I expect to be able to do this by October, leaving me with a few thousand the last quarter of this year.

* Take monthly remainder, open a traditional IRA, and max it out, if possible.
I like the tax refund implications of lowering my taxable income.

* 2017: Pay off PSL #2, then max traditional IRA.

* Next steps... undetermined.

**An Alternative Plan**

* Since I am planning on moving across country for graduate school (a plan I don't wish to have critiqued), it might make sense to (a) pay off a chunk of my federal loans, or (b) redirect the money that would go into retirement, and put it in savings instead, as a buffer for when I permanently move out on my own.

It didn't, and now the moribund American economy is being held hostage by dysfunctional monetary policy to save the banksters from their own bad debt","The Fed’s Policy Nightmare: How to Raise Rates Without Killing the Big Banks

By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: April 7, 2016 

http://wallstreetonparade.com/2016/04/the-feds-policy-nightmare-how-to-raise-rates-without-killing-the-big-banks/

If anyone needs one more reason to break up the mega banks on Wall Street, simply look at what happened following the Federal Reserve’s quarter of a percentage point rate hike on December 16 of last year. On that date, the Fed moved off its seven year zero interest rate policy (ZIRP), which had been a bonanza for the banks and a starvation plan for seniors living on fixed income investments like Treasury notes and CDs, and raised its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent from its former 0.0 to 0.25 percent.

The following then happened in short order in 2016:

By Friday, January 15, Citigroup closed down on the day a gut-churning 6.41 percent, bringing its share price losses to a whopping 30 percent from its July 2015 high. Citigroup had been the largest recipient of bailout funds from the government in 2008 as well as the largest bank bailout in the history of finance, receiving $45 billion in equity infusions, over $300 billion in asset guarantees, and more than $2 trillion cumulatively in secret loans from the Fed. It could ill afford to be bleeding off its equity capital as banking regulators were attempting to convince the public that they had fixed the too-big-to-fail problem.

By the close of trading on January 18, Morgan Stanley had lost 37 percent in share value from its July high; Goldman Sachs had lost 29 percent since the prior June; Bank of America was down 22 percent from July with JPMorgan Chase down by 19 percent in the same period.

By January 20, a mere 35 days from the Fed’s quarter point rate hike and promise of more to come, the U.S. domestic crude, West Texas Intermediate, was trading at a new 12-year low of under $28 a barrel; globally, stocks had lost $15 trillion since the prior May; the 10-year Treasury note which had closed at a yield of 2.29 percent when the Fed announced its rate hike and plan to begin gradually normalizing rates back up, had gone rogue from the Fed and moved in the opposite direction. Instead of moving up in yield, the benchmark 10-year Treasury was trading on January 20 at a yield of 1.97 percent. (This morning it’s at 1.74 percent.)

On that same day, January 20, Howard Silverblatt, the Standard and Poor’s Dow Jones Indices Senior Index Analyst, tweeted that as of 10:30 a.m. that morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s loss of 10.03 percent year-to-date was the worst ever start to a new year since 1897.

By the close of trading on January 27, Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had cumulatively lost a total of $219.7 billion in market capitalization over the prior seven months as the Obama administration was attempting to convince the public that the banks had become so much stronger as a result of his Dodd-Frank financial reform. The declines in market cap were as follows: Citigroup, down $60.74 billion; Bank of America, down $53.3 billion; JPMorgan Chase, down $47.7 billion; Morgan Stanley, down $30.3 billion; and Goldman Sachs, a decline of $27.7 billion.

On February 3, four of the mega Wall Street banks traded at their 12-month lows during the trading day. Those four were also among the top five holders of derivatives: Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

Since the Fed began backing off its narrative of more imminent rate hikes, the Wall Street banks have recovered a little of their lost ground but are still dramatically below their 2015 highs.

The Fed now finds itself in the following nightmare policy scenario. It desperately needs to reload its monetary policy bazooka by getting its benchmark rate to a level where it could actually effectuate an easing policy in the next recession or financial crash. But corporate earnings are now in serious decline and even quarter point rate hikes spawn both a perception and the real impact of tightening. On April 1, FactSet reported that earnings declines in the S&amp;P 500 for the first quarter of this year are estimated to be a negative 8.5 percent, noting that if there is another decline this past quarter, it would “mark the first time the index has seen four consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines in earnings” since the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2009.” (Lately, comparisons to 2008 and 2009 have been popping up like crocuses in spring.)

What played out in the second half of last year and earlier this year is that the Fed’s incessant talk of coming rate hikes sent the price of the U.S. dollar up and crude oil prices skidding. The market perceives the ability of the Fed to raise rates as a signal that the U.S. economy is improving, which means the U.S. dollar will strengthen further as foreign money seeks a U.S. haven for higher rates of return without worry of losses when that foreign money wants to convert back into its own currency. Unfortunately, a higher U.S. dollar negatively impacts the price of oil which is priced in U.S. dollars, as the market perceives that foreign currencies that are declining against the dollar will be able to afford less oil purchases.

Oil price declines feed into share price losses for the major banks. As we reported on February 24, the five largest Wall Street banks have over $203 billion exposure to the energy sector and there is growing concern that the banks are extending and pretending – that is, failing to take adequate reserves for losses while extending out the maturities on dubious loans. The trading action on February 23 was further testimony to this. As we reported, “oil prices dove, the broader stock market swooned, but the mega Wall Street banks took a worse beating than the broader stock market averages. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.14 percent yesterday while Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley were off by more than 3 percent. In an unusual twist, JPMorgan Chase, the bank that analyst Mike Mayo has preposterously called the Lebron James of banking, performed the worst among its peers yesterday, down 4.18 percent.”

Has the Fed backed itself into a policy conundrum in which it is damned if it does and damned if it doesn’t? On September 17 of last year, Reuters reporter Ann Saphir asked Fed Chair Janet Yellen at her press conference if it could be that the Fed would never escape its zero bound range. Yellen’s answer was not particularly reassuring. (The full exchange is below.) Mull all of this over carefully and then ask yourself if the country would have been better off today had it reinstated the Glass-Steagall Act after the crash of 2008 and separated the FDIC-insured deposit-taking banks from the globe-trotting, derivatives-trading, dark-pool casinos on Wall Street.

Ann Saphir: “Ann Saphir with Reuters. Just to piggyback on the global considerations, as you say, the U.S. economy has been growing, are you worried that given the global interconnecting this, the low inflation globally, all of the other concerns that you just spoke about that you may never escape from this zero lower bound situation.”

Janet Yellen: “So, I would be very– I would be very surprised if that’s the case. That is not the way I see the outlook or the way the committee sees the outlook. Can I completely rule it out? I can’t completely rule it out. But really that’s an extreme downside risk that in no way is near the center of my outlook.”",finance,1460086935

Does it make sense to use an equity loan to pay off the student loans? They are all federal. Since this was graduate school, the interest rate on most of them is over 6%. I believe the home equity loan would be at a lower rate. 

Also, not that this is my plan, but if I should experience financial disaster at some point in the next 10-20 years, I could always walk away from the house, but I know student loans are not dischargeable. On the other hand, federal loans have the option for percentage-of-income payment plans, something the mortgage company does not.

Saving and investing are important. I have said this before, and I will say it again. There are two classes in society, labour and capital. Unless you are a creditor or owner of a company, you are in the labour class. Means your wealth depends solely on the result of your time invested at work.

Saving and investing in bonds (creditor) and equity (shareholder), puts you in the capital class. This transition between labour class to capital class is probably more important to us, now than ever, since the gap between both classes are widening at a quick pace, (read: Thomas Piketty) and its expected to worsen.
**
Basics of Buying ETFs**

Its painfully simple. Exchange traded funds should be in your saving portfolio, because it’s easy to manage, provides instant diversification, and is difficult to screw up.

**What are ETFs?**

ETF is a big shopping bag of financial stuffs. The stuff in question can be stocks/bonds/derivatives/other ETFs. Anything with a cash flow and is actively traded in the financial markets can be put in this shopping bag. ETFs usually follow some pre-defined rules in terms of what to put in that bag. It could be stocks only from Russia (RSX), or only gold mining firms (GDX), or only bonds (MINT) etc. The funky letters in the parenthesis tells you the identifying ticker name for these ETFs, in case you are interested in doing some homework before investing. Google the tickers + etf. ETFdb is an ok website to use.


**Investment motive**

The first thing I would do is to examine my motives for investing. Are you investing because you want to finance a home in 10 years, or build a retirement nest egg? Maybe even just to try it out and find out why everyone is talking about it. Or perhaps you want to have the thrill of making money speculatively, in pyjamas on a Wednesday afternoon, scratching your balls in your chair? Whatever your motive could be, I shall show you in this article how ETFs can help you achieve your goals and not burn half your money, unlike your divorce.

**Financing big purchases**

First, I would set a target date, for when the expected withdrawal needs to happen. Then I would go make myself a cup of tea, because we are in this for the long game. Might as well take a chill pill. Usually, depending on the target date in mind, its good to start off aggressive and slowly tone it down as we get closer to the target date.

**Retirement income**

Well, you need a target date again, which will be your target retirement date. As you draw closer to the target date, keep to less volatile holdings and go into capital preservation mode. Its OK to lose half your money when you are 27, not so cool to lose half your money when you’re 72.

You know that jumpy financial advisor in that ugly glazed double-breasted gray suit, calling you every other week to recommend you some top-of-the-line investment product when you are in your golden years. Ignore him. He does not have your well-being at heart, he only cares about the commission he will earn from you. Don’t make any exotic, opaque, risky investments in your silver and golden years. If necessary, take the money out from a trading account, and in to a savings or fixed deposit account.

**Trying it out**

ETFs are the best for beginners. It’s really hard to lose all your money with ETFs. If you follow the rules below, you’d be fine.

**Speculation**

ETFs are not for you. Stop reading and go to the casino.

**Risk appetite**

Asking for your risk appetite is a polite way for those pesky financial advisors to ask you, “how much money can you lose before you shit your pants?”. The problem is, those guys asking you the questions don’t manage your money, and those guys managing your money have no clue who you are. The slimy guys at your banks probably direct your money to one of the low cost ETFs, and pocket the difference in commission anyway. Some banks charge a lot for fees, to do something so simple! Investing through your bank increases the risks too, since usually there are two counterparties instead of one. Investing is not rocket science, you can do it yourself. If you want to pay someone to do it, get an actively managed ETF then.

If you hate taking risks, that’s fine. Me too. Nothing wrong. All the better. Start constructing a portfolio with a conservative philosophy. If you are a risk taker, that’s fine too. It’s entirely up to you if you choose not to rubber up, when things get hot and heavy with the person you just met at the swingers’ club. Same for how you build a portfolio. At the end of the day, build a portfolio that doesn’t keep you up at night.
Remember, we are in for the long game, ain’t nobody gonna be checking the portfolio every 5 minutes. The whole point of investing is to put the money to work, while you work too. Its counter-productive if you have to manage your portfolio and a job. That’s why we define a time-frame, philosophy, strategy and stick to it.

**Rules**

There are some rules that are good to follow, since we’re talking about your hard-earned money.

**Expense ratios and sales charges**

Keep these as low as you can. Expense ratio is the cost to YOU for owning the ETF. There is strong correlation between low gross expense charges and good long term performance. Most big ETFs from Vanguard &amp; Blackrock have an expense ratio below 0.3%. That means you get charged $30 for every $10,000 invested. Pretty reasonable. Anything more than 0.99% is too much, in my opinion.

Some good looking sales bro will call you ever so often and tout that his firm has unlocked the secret to long lasting excess alpha returns, through smart beta, and adhering to some modified, multifactorial index, yada yada yada. The first question you have to ask him is how did he get your phone number. The second is can you take me off your phone list. And lastly, what’s the expense ratio? These are 3 questions which he will try his best to avoid answering.

**Volume**

Buy ETFs that are traded. Volume should be 6 digits. Anything less, you’re asking for liquidity troubles. Imagine when the shit hits the fan and you can’t sell your stuff or when you are making sick bucks and you can’t sell your stuff.
A good indicator is to glance at the trading volume column. Be sure to check it during trading hours. Another less reliable method is to check the assets under management (AUM). Anything with more than $1 billion is usually traded frequently.

**Diversify, diversify, diversify**

This is so important, it has to be said thrice. Your risk appetite will define the way you diversify. You ought to diversify over the following: asset type, geography, size, equity type.

**Asset type**

There are ETF for bonds, equities, commodities, derivatives, other ETFs.
If you are conservative, put 60–70% of your money in bond ETFs, and the rest in anything that catches your eye; as long as you follow the rules. If you are aggressive, put 60–70% of your money in equities ETFs, and the rest preferably in some bonds ETF; rules apply too. Any allocation in between conservative and aggressive are acceptable too. If you’re interested, go google Asset Allocation

**Bonds**

Buying bonds makes you a lender. The borrower is up to you to choose from, it could be a government, a municipality or corporates. Its healthy to have a good mix between the different entities you lend to. You can only lose what you put in.

Bonds are safer than equities simply because there is less uncertainty in cash flows. The bonds dictate how much has to be paid out, and the borrowers usually repay it. 

Especially for governments, since governments usually prefer to print money to repay the bonds than to default and be blocked off the capital markets (Argentine-style!). Do take note that interest rates and exchange rates will affect the valuation of your bonds and cash flow. However, if you cast your net wide enough, and have a long enough investment horizon, there is nothing much to worry about.

I recommend governmental bonds and corporate grade bonds. Municipal bonds are tricky. Town councils like to default. Municipal governments can’t print money too. I avoid them.

There are different classes of government bonds. Usually they are split between developed economies (AGG, BND) and developing economies (EMB). BND for example, holds 17,301 different bonds in 1 basket. That is more than enough diversification. EMB top 10 holdings includes lending money to Russia, Argentina, Hungary, Poland, Peru, Uruguay. Since holding emerging economies bonds are more dicey than developed markets, they pay more to you for interest. Another cool thing about owning bonds is that you can go to their citizens and say, your country owes me money. Absolutely true!

**Bonds Duration**

Bonds are separated through the duration. As usual, when in doubt, diversify through the distinctions. Google “Bond duration” if interested.

**Equities**

Means you are a part owner of the company. You can earn money in 2 ways, the value of your stock goes up, or they send money to you in the mail (dividends). Again, you can only lose what you put in. Taxes apply.

**Geography**

You want to spread out your purchases across continents and nations. This insulates you from country-specific events. A good rule of thumb is not to have more than 40% of your portfolio based in one continent. North America is an exception.

Remember to diversify based on your needs. For example, if your primary residence is in the US, your job pays in USD, and your job is based in USA, then you have more than enough exposure to the United States of America. It would be very pointless in the view of diversification, to invest your savings in Singapore. I act on this. My portfolio has no positions in my employing company, nor in the country where my livelihood is based on.
If you are aggressive, go for emerging markets (VWO, EEM, IEMG) and frontier markets (FRN) ETF. These usually experience more volatility. Meaning that the value of your portfolio jumps around a lot, and there is a stronger chance for higher returns.
If conservative, go for the developed markets like North America (VTI, SCHB) and Developed Europe (VGK).

The mentioned VTI and SCHB have 3723 and 2054 holdings respectively. Meaning to say that by buying VTI, you are purchasing 3723 companies in 1 go. This is recommended because you have instant diversification. Assuming equal weights, if 30 companies go bankrupt, you would have lost less than 1% of your money invested in VTI. Its much better than buying individual stocks. Take note that VTI and SCHB both have very low expense ratios too. You pay $3 for every $10,000 invested, and you gain from such diversification.

**Size**

Equities come in more or less three sizes. Large cap, mid cap, small cap. Cap is capitalization, not the thing that cool kids buy to hide their freckled, stunted foreheads. Conservative investors should stick to large cap. Large companies usually have everything in order, have strong market share, good cash flow, and make money in general. There are less surprises with these boys. The more aggressive you are, the more you should include mid and small cap in your portfolio. Note that in a recession, smaller cap companies suffer a lot. Smaller cap companies also experience great jumps and drops in prices.

**Equity type**

Other than by size, equities are also split by type: Value, Core, Growth. It’s good to diversify across the 3 types as well, and I feel it’s OK to have a preference if one wishes.

**Value** are stocks that are comparably cheap, considering their earnings. This can be due to their industry, which has little growth prospects, or perhaps the company is domiciled in a country with short-term turmoil, hence a lower price due to the uncertainty.

**Core** stocks are the backbones of the economy, whose stocks are a best representation of the domestic economy. These are usually well known companies and have a strong brand value. IVV which represents the core of the US economy, includes Apple, Microsoft, Exxon, J&amp;J, GE, Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon etc. It’s usually good to have some global core in your portfolio.

**Growth** are stocks that are usually comparatively expensive, considering their earnings. This is due to their growth prospect, and the promise of better returns in the future. Typical industries that have growth classification is Tech and Healthcare. In my opinion, the most bubbly valuations can be found here, as it’s hard to quantify future earnings accurately. Personally, I don’t hold too many growth ETFs if I can help it.

I understand that managing by geography, size and type can be too troublesome for the retail investors. There are tools like Morningstar X-ray out there, where you can key in your holdings and this pops out.

http://imgur.com/4bS59l6  My ETF holdings some time ago (Produced with Morningstar)

As you can see, my holdings are mostly in large caps, because I am pretty conservative when it comes to investing. I try to stay away from small cap because those guys are too volatile for me. I have strong preference for value stocks too, which I will explain later why. For now just try to keep the stock style matrix well spread out or top heavy and you will be OK.

**Sectors**
Different sectors behave differently, and you will have to diversify likewise accordingly.
http://imgur.com/SoJlbLa My ETF holdings some time ago, split by sector (Produced by Morningstar)

If you are more conservative, go for utilities, telcos, consumer staples and consumer discretionary. Materials and Industrials somewhat applies too.
If you are more aggressive, then hold healthcare, energy and IT stocks. Try not to have more than 20% of your portfolio in one sector, as sector valuations commonly move together.

**Fund houses**

Vanguard, Blackrock, Guggenheim, Credit Suisse etc. These are fund houses. You should try to diversify your holdings across fund houses because funds from the same house can have a selection bias. The selection bias may lead to a concentration in your holdings. We want diversification, not concentration.

**Leveraged ETFs**

Avoid them. The roll costs are usually too painful. Owning leveraged ETFs is like owning a pet crocodile. It’s all fun and dandy at the start, but if you keep them for too long, it will return to bite you in the ass. Time horizon for keeping leveraged ETFs should be max. a few months.

**Inverse ETFs**

Avoid them. Roll costs again. Betting against the market long term, correlates with negative returns.

**Investment Strategies**

Here, we shall discuss some of the investment strategies prevalent in today’s markets.
Buy and hold

Personally, I like to buy and hold. Less transaction charges, which correlates strongly with better long term performance. Set aside some money from your income every month, and put them in pre-defined ETFs. Then just hold them all the way till you need the money or you are convinced your holdings are too overvalued. (For valuation, google either: PE, Shiller PE/CAPE, PB)

I believe the market is cyclical. Like the oft quoted phrase, the stock markets short term is a voting machine, and long term a weighing machine. What I do is when I am drinking coffee in the morning and reading the news, I keep an eye out for turmoil. Usually everyone is selling &amp; dumping when turmoil hits, so you just wait and watch the discount grow while the fear mounts. After some time, I invest in that country or sector. Then I forget about it. Since my investment horizon is a few decades, I have time to spare till that sector or country picks up again.

**Case**: At time of writing,

1. Russia is placed under sanctions and experiencing weak oil prices.

2. Brazil has political turmoil through a corruption scandal of Rousseff

3. Malaysia political class is facing corruption allegations, suffering oil prices

4. Energy sector getting destroyed through low oil prices

5. Financial sector battered through low interest rates

These are stuff you see on the news all the time. For point 1,2 &amp; 3, you can purchase Russian (RSX), Brazilian (EWZ) or Malaysian (EWM) stocks or their bonds (ELD, EMSH), or both. Usually they are at a discount when crisis hits.

For point 3 &amp; 4, you can purchase sector specific ETFs. Energy (VDE, XLE) and financial (VFH, FNCL, XLF)sectors are relatively cheap compared to before.

You can make proxy bets too. Ask yourself. If oil is cheap, which countries or sectors would benefit the most? Countries like India (INDA, EPI) and Philippines (EPHE) import a lot of oil as a percentage of GDP. Airlines (JETS, ITA) and transportation (IYT) companies spend the majority of costs on fuel. Cheap oil bodes well for all of them, so you can expect their business outlooks to improve and that they will provide good returns.

My strategy is basically bargain hunting. I wait outside the supermarket till something goes on discount, then I saunter in and pick it up. Buy low, sell high, remember? Unfortunately, this strategy is not for everyone. You need to have patience to ride out the market turmoil and cycles. You also have to keep your hands away from the trading platform, which is harder than expected. No matter what, remember to keep your investments diversified.

I shall include the other strategies here for discussion sake. I do not necessarily think these are good ideas.

**Smart Beta**

Smart beta is the new game in town. Personally I think it’s stupid. Even sad to a point. The idea is so dumb, they put the word Smart in front of it. Its like naming your son Smart, hoping that it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Smart beta is the desperate way asset managers try to remain relevant today. The sorry sad fact is, most asset managers suck sweaty balls. When they outperform, they can’t repeat the fluke. You are better off just indexing. Asset managers realized that, and try to reduce a winning strategy to beat the index, by making an index with simple rules, then following it blindly.

The rules are anomalies identified from academic literature. They back-test (also known as lying to themselves) it, then fiddle around to find a formula to deliver the best result they were looking at. The problem is, once an anomaly is discovered in the market, it cannot continue. People will arbitrage the profits away. Well, at least most of these funds are kind of diversified.

**Momentum**
These ETFs seek out stocks or sectors that are gaining momentum. They are usually an ETF of ETFs, which results in higher expense ratios. Momentum ETF usually have 
different geographical focuses. Expect the global ones to incur more expense charges. The high fees are why I avoid them.

The most held momentum ETF is First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 ETF (FV), which as of the time of writing includes:

First Trust Utilities (FXU)

First Trust Consumer discretion (FXD)

First Trust Internet (FDN)

First Trust Consumer Staples (FXG)

First Trust Energy (FXN)

This ETF holds 5 different ETFs of the 5 sectors that have the most momentum in trading. Sly mofos double-charging their expense ratios too. One thing to take note is that because the ETF changes its holdings drastically, it could create unexpected concentration risk in your holdings.

**Long Short**

Long short can have long and short positions in different assets. Long means you own the stock. Short means you sell a stock you do not currently own, in the hopes that the price drops and so you can conduct the cancelling trade and profit. There may be an underlying objective, where the ETF claims it will be 130/30 for example. This means its 130% long and 30% short. I avoid long shorts because their expense ratio is high, averaging near 1%.

**Volatility Hedged**

These ETFs invest in equities and volatilities derivatives. In English, it means that they buy insurance against wild swings in prices. The good thing is the downside is supposedly hedged. The bad thing is that you have to pay for this protection, meaning that the hedge hinders performance. I have not tried their services, and hence can’t recommend them.

**Merger arbitrage**
This one is cool. I am not sure though if this strategy provides long term returns. When a company buys another company, the buyer usually has to pay more for the target. Merger arbitrage funds (MNA) will check out the M&amp;A scene and hold positions in the target companies, to earn this premium. Problem is, an ETF like this typically holds only a few stock. Since mergers and acquisitions typically happen in only a few industries where scale pays off, your holdings in a fund like this would be concentrated too. Thirdly, you are not protected against a market sell-off. Worse still, in the event that there is a sell off, the merger would probably not take place and you would not have earned the premium.

Momentum, Long-short, Volatility Hedged, Merger arbitrage ETFs are usually actively managed. Means more fees to pay.

**Conclusion**
ETFs are really simple to get started, and to put your investments in your hands. Through ETFs, its easy to gain diversification. Decide if you are a risk-taker or risk-averse, define an investment philosophy and hone a strategy, then cast a wide net across geographical, asset types, asset sizes, sectors and fund houses, forget about your investments, until the day you need money to cure the cancer you got from midnight binge on dank memes. Good luck.

The situation: For the past 3 years, since my wife and I both landed salaried jobs (#winning), we've had a net federal tax burden of ~$8500. Married filing jointly, itemized deductions (we have a kid and a house, plus decent charitable giving). Every tax season, it seems that our refunds are getting bigger and bigger...to an excessive degree.  As we are finally in a solid place financially (6 month emergency savings, almost paid off my student loan debt...), I'm coming up with a better investment and savings plan for our excess income and would rather not have $10K+ in the hands of the IRS each year from excess withholdings instead of working for me in a CD or my retirement funds. I've tried to fix this with my HR department, even used the IRS withholding calculator (https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator) and submitted a new W4 last month, however my latest paychecks (after the new W4 was submitted) are still withholding a lot more for federal taxes than is necessary.

My question: My wife and I are each paid bimonthly, 24x a year. Given our estimated taxes of $8500, we need ~$200 withheld from each paycheck ($200x 24 paychecks x 2 people= $9600, giving a little cushion in case my deductions decrease for some reason), how many allowances should we each claim in order to withhold the correct amount of money?",finance,1460119444

* I graduated with about 90k in student loan debt.  My salary has increased fairly dramatically in the years since graduation (about 40k total in raises) - Basically, I live comfortably, but nothing extravagant
* The debt is now at about $58k.  Here is the breakdown:
     * Loan 1: $16k at 6% (in my name)
     * Loan 2: $34K at 7.9% (in my dad's name)
     * Loan 3: $7.5k at 8.5% (in my dad's name)
* I can get a loan through SoFi to cover the remaining amount of all loans at an interest rate of 5.375%.  My credit score about 730.

Okay, finally to my question.  If I take out that loan through SoFi, will no doubt save money over the remaining life of my loans.  HOWEVER, the loans in my dad's name will now fall under my name.

Yes, I know legally they're in my dad's name, but at this point it's not worth stress on the family to just stop paying and pretend like they don't exist.

My financial situation is far better than my dad's (who's near retirement), and I work a stable/growing job market with high salary potential as I continue to ""climb the corporate ladder.""  I appreciate any thoughts here.",finance,1460124496

Started with 207k in student loan debt.,"Hi PF, I have learned a lot from you over the last couple years and now I think it is time to have you all weigh in and critique me. 27 years old - Single - no children - only debt is mortgage and student loans - medical professional - stable career - I will be getting a 25k gift from my parents shortly need help selecting the proper loans to pay off to maximize the value of this gift. Also, I will be moving my parents into my house due to their age and health status. Instead of me charging them rent, they want to contribute $1k a month to my student loans to help me pay them off quicker. (They are financially independent - they are moving in strictly so I can keep an eye on them, making sure they take their medications - get to MD appointments etc -  and I will be giving them my first floor master bed and bath so they don’t ever have to make steps - and no I am not Asian). I don’t mind my parents living with me too much I will pretty much have a basement that is setup to be a 1,000 sq ft income suite.  My goal is to pay off the student loans as soon as possible. Once they are paid off, I will either buy myself another house (if there is a girl in the picture) and let my parents and my brother live in my house for cost or (if no girl in the picture) just dump as much cash as I can into saving vehicles and FIRE before 50.   I was also wondering what PF thought about purchasing an “own job” disability insurance. My company does not offer a good group policy and was wondering if the cost was worth it for a person in my situation. Thanks PF!

We are thinking about buying a home because we are tired of losing money renting and want to start a family soon. Would this be a good idea to do now or should we wait until I've worked for a year? We have been looking at homes around the 200-250k range. We would be able to take advantage of some incentives provided by the city we live in and my wife's work, potentially covering a majority (if not all) of the down payment. This opportunity is also somewhat time sensitive since we will most likely receive more aid if we buy now before I start working... Another aspect I've been thinking about is that we are planning to live in this city for another 3-7yrs and then moving outside of the city (or possibly to another city closer to family). 

Another question: Should we start saving money when we have 180k in loans to pay off? It seems hopeless saving when we have debt, I feel like we should put all our money into loans... I am also looking into the federal loan forgiveness program where, if you work for certain companies (like non-profits, the federal government, etc.), they will forgive your remaining balance after 10yrs of payments on time. I need to confirm, but I am fairly sure the organization I am working for will count.

From what I know about economics the two above are the factors that 'should' be driving currency to their fair price. Just wondering if any of you use this for your trades and if you do, just a couple of questions.

For purchasing power parity, do you look at the inflation for trading goods (CPI ex housing would be pretty good imo) or some other measure?

For interest rate parity, I know uncovered basically never holds but covered always holds (forward rate * foreign i = domestic i) and forwards rates are god awful at predicting future spot rates. Do the forward rate and spot rate converge as t = 0 or are forward contracts just super illiquid as t gets closer to 0? How exactly do you build this in to your strategy?

personalfinance,Bankruptcy vs. withdrawing TSP vs. trying to tread water,"Greetings from a throwaway account. I feel like I need people who are not currently staring down the barrel of the financial gun to speak sense to me.

Some context: I'm early thirties, working as a contractor with decent pay (no benefits - natch), and living with my fiancée in a horrifically expensive area because that's where jobs our fields are. I'm on an installment plan for last year’s federal taxes, because there is no withholding as a contractor and every cent that shows up in my bank account has gone to trying to stay afloat. We're currently going in to the negative at the end of every month, because I only get to invoice once per month and they take their sweet time paying me. We used to have a protective cushion, but that got wiped out by an unrelated paperwork snafu that was eventually resolved in our favor, but not until 5 months had passed, by which time my fiancée lost her well-paid job and when we got the cushion back it had to go to putting out fires related to that. Now our student loan payments are behind, our credit card and insurance payments are behind, and for the first time in either of our lives, we've bounced a rent check (the bank had my paycheck ""pending,"" but they floated it until they bounced the rent check, then deposited immediately after, the bastards). I basically am alternating between violent anger, and wanting to crawl in to a hole and die from shame. I used to be a federal employee before making the mistake of having dreams and going back to school. I had what I considered to be reasonably good financial sense and control, with 6 months of savings, a booming retirement account, and no debt. Now I have massive debts, a negative savings account, and we’re one wrong move from being evicted.


Here’s the question where I need a sanity check. As I see it, I have three options here.

1)	Continue as we are. Keep trying to slip by, fall behind where we do, and hope nobody hiccups our direction while the account is in the red. I’m working on selling some collectibles I own from happier days to try and bring the account back up to where the rent won’t bounce again, and we’re looking at moving, but with our credit ratings gone to crap and a recent bounced rent check, I don’t know if we’ll even be able to find a place that will take us without security deposits larger than we can possibly afford. Honestly there are very few places within commuting distance of my job that will save us much.

2)	Declare bankruptcy. It seems ludicrous that we’re even talking about this while simultaneously making more than the median household income in the US, but rent is eating an insane 40-45% of our pay, and we are hugely behind on bills. As it stands, $5,000 would make an enormous difference, and $15,000 would clear the way for a stable climb back out of this pit, but five thousand may as well be five million in our current situation. A debt consolidation loan would make more sense, but I don’t know that we have the collateral that would be required for such a loan. It’s doubly complicated given that we’re not married yet, but will be soon, so it might have to be multiple loans or something like that.

3)	I have a small TSP account from my federal service. A full withdrawal on this account would, after taxes and penalties, net us about $20,000 – enough to completely change our situation and lift the cloud of doom that has been sending us both over the edge for months. The problem with this is, of course, that this is a retirement account. Both of us are extremely aware of how the math works on these things, and I was raised from childhood that retirement accounts are things you do not touch under any condition until it is time to retire. Basically, my instinct is that we would be wiser to live out of our car and scrounge garbage to eat than we would be to break open this account, but the fact that it could so easily resolve our current issues, for which there seem to be so few other remedies, makes it disturbingly tempting. 


When it rains, it pours, and right now we’re in the rainforest during monsoon season. We both have graduate degrees, we both have years of work experience, and we both are desperate, but aware that desperation leads to bad decision making. Does anybody have any insights or suggestions regarding the above? My apologies for the extensive list of complications. This is very new territory to me.",finance,1460138512

I'm currently 27k in debt spread across 6 student loans. I've placed all my loan balances, monthly payments, and interest rates on [unburyus.us](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=572.59&amp;name_0=1.01 Stafford Sub&amp;balance_0=1751.23&amp;payment_0=34.34&amp;rate_0=6.8&amp;name_1=1.03 Stafford Sub&amp;balance_1=2788.67&amp;payment_1=49.35&amp;rate_1=6.8&amp;name_2=1.05 Stafford Sub&amp;balance_2=727.72&amp;payment_2=16.31&amp;rate_2=6.8&amp;name_3=1.01 Stafford Unsub&amp;balance_3=5471.75&amp;payment_3=100&amp;rate_3=6.8&amp;name_4=College Advantage&amp;balance_4=8493.47&amp;payment_4=172.59&amp;rate_4=7.5&amp;name_5=Chase Undergrad&amp;balance_5=7954.97&amp;payment_5=200&amp;rate_5=9.25&amp;) for reference.

I'm familiar with the Avalanche and Snowball method of paying down debt. I know I should pay down my highest interest ""Chase Undergrad"" loan (9.25%) as quickly as possible which I am. The monthly minimum for that loan is around $98.00, which would take forever, so I've been paying $200.00 each month to speed up those payments.

My smallest loan ""1.05 Stafford Sub"" has a current balance of $727.72, I have about 2k in my savings right now and I'm considering paying this off completely to save about $200.00 in interest in the long run. Is this worth it in the end or should I take the $727 and put it towards my ""Chase Undergrad"" loan to pay that down faster? I could use even more of my savings right now towards that loan, and according to that loan calculator if I payed $1000 right now that would save me about $500 in the end but would use half my savings.

I'm struggling with this decision because I feel like eliminating 1 of my loans all together right now would help my confidence in making these repayments (snowball method), and would feel like this is actually working. What do you think?

Here's some info about me and my current situation, not that it's crucial to this post but maybe it'll help you understand my situation a little better. I'm 29, male, live in the Los Angeles area of CA, have a steady job making about $50k/year. My Fiancée and I are getting married in November (with help from her parents, thank goodness), but were trying to save up for a down payment on a house in the next few years. And I've been struggling to save any money at all with $600 in loan payments every month on top of $700 rent and all other expenses. Her mom has offered to match up to 10k of our savings towards the purchase of a home (there's no deadline - whenever we're ready). So this is why we're trying to prioritize which is more important in the long run, **saving for a house or paying more towards my debt?**

We've been pretty good about keeping our expenses low and are still looking for other ways to save. But any suggestions or advice on this subject would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1460145901

personalfinance,Post College financing - New to Auto Loans,"After 5 years of school I finished my bachelor's degree at the end of last summer's semester. To be honest, I am late to the party in terms of scrambling to soften the economic blow that are the heavy amount of loans that I have, both federal and private. The amount I took out was justified during school or living and school expenses other than just tuition. But now I'm at a crux.

I deliver pizza for a living, and honestly it's a comfortable wage. I make 5.40 an hour plus tips and at the end of every shift I get extra cash based on the number of runs I take and money I handle. The company goes above and beyond to make sure their employees are happy and paid well enough to live. In the end, the amount of cash I make isn't all accounted for and I'm left with a sizable amount of money that is unclaimed. When doing taxes and health insurance things, I've always been very consistent in my numbers and things typically go smoothly, until now.

I've applied for an auto loan to purchase a really nice car that's recent in year, low mileage and so it's still under factory warranty. The sale is extremely affordable and I've checked the vehicle history and have driven it and I'm set on doing everything I can to buy it. The main reason being it is a rebuilt salvage title. Im doing everything i can the lessen the risk a lender might take on it, such as a sizeable down payment and what not. And I know I know, always riskier for any lender when the title is a salvage, therefore less likely to get approved. When I apply for the loans I stay consistent with my tax bracket and other information and it comes back declined due to the debt/income ratio. 

Fortunately I have one option to get the loan I need but I need a coapplicant to complete it. Needless to say I don't really have any one around me that is in good enough standing to do me any good, and even less people enthused to lend a hand. I'm new to the whole process but I'm trying my best.

Is there any stones I need to make sure to not leave unturned? Are there well known lenders, not dealerships, that anyone knows would probably work with me?

personalfinance,Should I pay estimated tax?,"My AGI for tax year 2015 is about 40k higher than 2014.  As a result, my federal tax obligation increased by about 17k.  Since my withholding did not cover all of that, I now owe Uncle Sam about 5k.

Since I had a tax refund last year, I wasn't slapped with an under-withholding penalty.

My question: Should I make estimated tax payments for tax year 2016?  If my AGI remains constant (likely), my withholdings will cover about 90% of my tax obligations.  I want to avoid the penalty if possible, but don't want to pay too much that I'd get a refund.  Can I pay any amount I want, or is it determined by some formula?

About to file for 2015. 

I moved into freelancing this year and made ~65k in taxable self employment income as a contractor. I didn't make quarterly payments (bad, I know) and ended up with a huge tax bill. Even with business deductions, I owe 18,000 (fed and state). I was advised to open a SEP IRA and contribute as much as possible to reduce the tax burden, but since this is taxed when I withdraw the funds in say, 40 years, is this the best option?

I have 20k in student loan debt and much less steady income this year, so the thought of owing the government such a significant amount of money scares me. I have about 16k in cash on hand and a 401k from an old employer that's mostly mine (~80% vested). Would a financial planner be wise for better understanding scenarios like this?

* Direct Subsidized Stafford $2,864.31            6.550%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford $3,679.42 5.750%

Older brother will be main provider of $$, makes roughly 55k in expensive urban area. 

College: USC. I will be studying business with focus on California business consulting/investment banking/finance

This package is reflective of my low-income status. 
Estimated entire cost w/cheapest housing and meal plan: 67,773

Now I have many questions. I don't want to take 5500 in loans per year, I would much rather take just the subsidized loan of 3500 per year, or even less if that is possible. So then that drives the final price up to 7446, with an estimated 14,000 in loans at graduation (of course I will work jobs to try to make it less)

And then there's the fact that this is in need-based aid, not permanent scholarships. So I know that there will be extra costs due to ""frontloading"" where the grants don't grow just as much as the rising tuition. The estimates for that are 2 to 3 percent per year? 

In the end I am a bit terrified that I will enroll freshman year and then the costs will just rise astronomically as I progress into the school years, and then I'm paralyzed financially. Is USC worth it? Also, I don't think I can appeal for more aid, that's a crapload of money for it to not be in scholarship form.

In a nutshell, since I turned 18 I was forced to sign up for credit cards by my father. He spent the funds on our living expenses as well as his gambling addiction. There are cash advances on several cards. 

I have 8 credit cards under my name. My father has passed away last week by committing suicide. Before, he wouldn't let me have control over my own credit cards and I had no idea where ""my name"" was at, financially. 

Now, it's my priority to handle the debt ASAP.

My aunt suggested Debt Consolidation. What are the perks of going this route? 

My lawyer friend advised me to call up each of the credit card companies and ask  for reduced interest rates/minimum payment. Is this a better route--doing the negotiating with cc companies myself instead of relying on a debt consolidator? 

I have no doubt in being able to dedicate any possible income towards paying off the debt--I'm not gonna go off and apply for more credit cards. These credit cards are going to be locked up--cut up. 

I'm just not sure if I should take my time, getting rid of the smallest credit cards first (like the BUY POWER CARD by Citi which is $250 balance) or if I should resort to debt consolidation. My two highest balances are Chase Freedom with $5k+ and Citi Diamond Preferred with $5.2k+.

But what does she really mean by this? 

When we look at how she gets her money there are no real clear answers. In fact we have to dig to find anything, but we find that Hillary Clinton is no stranger to the Corporate interest groups and lobbyist.

Uranium One in three separate transactions after being purchased by a Russian atomic-energy agency, Rosatom from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons. Soon after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.

We now know that [Egyptian Companies and Government Entities](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clintons-state-department-increased-chemical-arms-sales-middle-east-countries-1949653)   gave money to the Clinton Foundation while Her State Department cleared Egypt to continue purchasing arms the U.S. government classified as toxicological agents, a broad designation that included chemical and biological weapons. Once in 2010, Mubarak government paid Bill Clinton a $250,000 speaking, less than 4 months before the Egyptian revolution began , And again  in 2012, a firm with an ownership stake in the company that manufactured the tear gas reportedly used by Egyptian security forces against the protesters paid $100,000 to $250,000 for another Bill Clinton speech.

Clinton’s massive campaign machine is built and fueled from the very thing — super PACs, secret cash, unlimited contributions — she says she’ll attack once she wins the White House.
How is it that Clinton still claims that she is “THE MOST TRANSPARENT CANDIDATE IN MODERN TIMES” when her Foundation [Failed to Disclose 1,100 Foreign Donations](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-29/clinton-foundation-failed-to-disclose-1-100-foreign-donations)  .

So once again we see here that Hillary does not mind muddying the waters, Saying that she will be hard on these banking institutions while taking more money from these banking institutions that any normal person could ever hope to make in a lifetime. 

Then there is that added issue of the [Panama Papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/), and  the issue of Clintons Foundation and Campaign connection to it and the vast array of institutions caught in this scandal. In lobbying for the Panama-United States Trade Promotion Agreement, Clinton paved the way for major banks and corporations, most notably the Deutsche Bank, to skirt national laws and regulations.  Once she resigned as the Secretary of State, the Deutsche Bank paid her $485,000 for a speech. While criminality can’t yet be definitively established, this may change when the “Süddeutsche Zeitung” publishes its comprehensive list at the end of the month. In addition to the aforementioned connection, Clinton’s name has already surfaced in connection to a billionaire and a Russian-controlled bank named in the files. Which I imagine is a connection to the Podesta Group, a lobbying firm co-founded by Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta and his brother, Tony Podesta, a major Clinton bundler. According to the Washington Free Beacon, which first reported the connection, Sberbank registered with the Podesta Group last month to lobby on issues related to economic sanctions against Russia and on stock and bond trading for its U.S. clients.

When he served in the House of Representatives, then-Congressman Sanders voted against “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” in 1993 and the so-called “Defense of Marriage Act” in 1996. Sen. Sanders hailed the landmark Supreme Court decisions in 2013 and 2015 which struck down DOMA and recognized same-sex marriage is a right in all 50 states, calling the decisions a “victory for same-sex couples across our country as well as all those seeking to live in a nation where every citizen is afforded equal rights.”

personalfinance,Should I pay off my husband's student loans so that we can qualify for a conventional mortgage?,"Hi Reddit,

My husband and I recently got married and we're looking to buy a two family home in a busy college town. We would live in the larger unit while leasing out the one-bedroom to cover about 50% of the mortgage. 

We both have good credit (720 and 750), but do not qualify for a conventional loan because I'm a student and not earning income (postbac pre-med), and my husband is a fourth-year resident about to enter fellowship. He is the sole income earner, has about $30,000 in retirement savings and $230,000 in student loans. However, I am debt free and have $380,000 in investments which return about 10% annually. 

My understanding is that mortgage companies calculate an applicant's risk of defaulting based on their debt-to-income ratio. Since my income is zero I don't qualify for a conventional loan, and because my husband's debt is so high relative to his current resident salary he doesn't qualify either. We've been offered a FHA loan but that sounds like complete shit when it comes to the PMI. We've looked into a physician's mortgage but they don't seem to really help our particular situation since they are designed to allow soon-to-be-doctors with high earning potential to buy a house with little to no money down in exchange for a slightly higher interest rate. Since we have plenty of cash, we really want to minimize our interest rate (and other monthly expenses, such as the PMI for FHA loans) and aren't worried about the amount of money we need to put down. We've even considered paying cash for a home, but I don't want to put all of my money into a single piece of real estate.

Due to these circumstances, would it be a good decision to completely pay off my husband's student loans so that we can qualify for a conventional mortgage? Doing so would leave me with enough money for the down payment with about $70,000 left over.

Can someone assist me with some obvious deductions come tax time? If any? I'm told there is no, ""Master list"" of deductions.

* I think the house would sell reasonably quickly (no more than 2 months till an offer is made an accepted), but they haven’t even listed it yet, just preliminary talks with an agent.  


**In Laws Buying Situation:**

* Looking to buy for 300 – 500k.

* If a desirable house came on the market tomorrow, they will try to use home equity line of credit to come up with the capital needed for the purchase, and then pay it off when their house sells.  

**My questions:**

* At their age, I’m concerned that they are going backwards.  They would effectively be retiring to a house that costs the same as they have now.  A few houses ~ 450k have come on the market and they showed interest.  My initial reaction was that they were crazy, no one sells and retires to a house that costs more than what they have now.  Am I making a bigger deal over this than I should?

* They are going to act very impulsive to buy because they are deadset on finding a house as close as possible to us, and will jump on any oppourtunity.  But, I can see them dragging their feet on getting the wheels in motion for selling.  Father is very excited about moving closer, but mother is going to want to take her time figuring out what to downsize and pack.  Worst case scenario… they close something in June/July, and their house doesn’t sell till October / November.  Other than them paying 4 – 6 month’s worth of interest (or even longer if it doesn't sell as fast as I think), are there other hidden dangers / costs?  

* If they do go the home equity route, what specific type of loan do they want?  From my research, they would want a HELOC?

* For the home equity principle amount, how much should they be borrowing to put into the new house?  Do they borrow as much as they can against the current house to lower the principle on the new house?  Or do they borrow as little as possible against the current house, and put down enough to cover PMI on the new house?  Or is it as simple as “minimize the principle of the loan with the higher interest rate?”, and re-finance after the house is sold.

* Any other advice / things they should be thinking about?

politics,"Did you know that the DoD is actively seeking to create new nuclear weapons under a 30-year, $1 trillion plan? I am against this proposal because the Dept. of Energy can't safely store the current nuclear waste from the Cold War...","Further reading (via article from The Center for Public Integrity, 9/1/2015):  

Nuclear cleanup project haunted by legacy of design failures and whistleblower retaliation:  Twenty-five years after the project began, the Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant at Hanford is nearing a three-fold cost overrun, and not a single drop of waste has been treated

The largest and most costly U.S. environmental cleanup project has been dogged for years by worries about an accidental nuclear reaction or a spill of toxic materials that could endanger residents nearby, as well as a history of contractor retaliation against workers who voice worries about persistent safety risks.

But it hasn’t fully turned the corner yet, according to recent comments by the federal officials now overseeing its operation.

“Changing the culture takes time,” said Mark Whitney, the Department of Energy’s assistant secretary for environmental management, at a special hearing last week before members of an independent federal watchdog group that monitors safety problems at federal nuclear facilities. “I’m not going to sit here today and tell you we have everything solved.”

Whitney spoke inside a ballroom at the Three Rivers Convention Center in Kennewick, Washington, 17 miles from the Hanford Site where generators churned out plutonium, the lifeblood of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, for a half-century during the Cold War. More than **55 million gallons** of pasty waste now lie in decomposing barrels beneath the ground at Hanford, posing a potential safety hazard to thousands of people who rely on the nearby Columbia River for drinking water.

The Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant project there, known as WTP, is meant to exhume the waste, freeze it in glass, and give it a proper burial. But it’s been plagued by delays. It was expected to cost $4.3 billion and be built by 2011. Instead, the cost has swelled past $12 billion to date, with an estimated $7 billion in work left to be done. So far, not a drop of waste has been processed.

personalfinance,Help me plan for second house purchase 3.5 years from now,"I've read through most of the sidebar stuff so I think I'm doing well so far. Just need some help on planning for the next 3-4 years. Let's call it 42 months to make the math work. My goal is to use my money the best way with the plan to sell my current house and buy a new one in 42 months. 

I have about $100k in equity in first house (owe $385k total) and my monthly payments will subtract roughly $600 from the principle per month. So let's say that would give me an additional $25k in equity. 

My annual pay is variable so I estimate I will have an additional 15-25k each year. 

I max out the federal limit for 401k and I currently have $30k in cash and another $10k in an investment account. My mortgage is a 4% loan. I have no other debt and two cars completely paid off. My credit score is 690 due to a few late payments so I will concentrate on getting that increased the next few years (I've read through the recommendations for that). 

What should I do with the extra $45-$75k over the next few years?  My long term investment profile is high risk/aggressive but I want to be a little more conservative and liquid with this money. Does it make more sense to just pay down the principle more because it's guaranteed 4% investment?  Or do I look into another investment vehicle?",finance,1460216442
politics,Hedge Funds are Part of a Tricky Money Maneuver to Put Hillary in the White House,"At the Democratic debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on November 14, 2015, Hillary Clinton attempted to portray herself as the fierce enemy of hedge funds. She told the audience the following:

    “You have two billionaire hedge fund managers who started a Super PAC and they’re advertising against me in Iowa as we speak. So they clearly think I’m going to do what I say I will do….”

But two hedge fund billionaires backing a Republican candidate pales in comparison to the tens of millions of dollars flooding into Hillary Clinton’s campaign from other hedge fund billionaires – including money flowing into a joint fundraising committee called the “Hillary Victory Fund” that is sluicing money to both Hillary’s main candidate committee, Hillary for America, as well as into the Democratic National Committee and 33 separate state Democratic committees, which has some observers crying foul.

A recent article at CounterPunch, which questioned the ethics of the arrangement, quotes Paul Blumenthal, campaign finance reporter for the Huffington Post, as follows:

    “It is a highly unusual arraignment if only because presidential candidates do not normally enter into fundraising agreements with their party’s committees until after they actually win the nomination. And second, Clinton’s fundraising committee is the first since the Supreme Court’s 2014 McCutcheon v FEC decision eliminated aggregate contribution limits and congress increased party contribution limits in the 2014 omnibus budget bill.”

The Democratic National Committee has come under repeated fire for showing favoritism toward Hillary Clinton’s candidacy versus that of Bernie Sanders. Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings show that the Hillary Victory Fund has given over $600,000 to the Democratic National Committee and tens of thousands of dollars each to the individual state committees that signed on to the joint fundraising plan.

Hedge funds and private equity firms are desperate to hold on to their tax perversion known as “carried interest,” which allows their winnings to be taxed at rates lower than those paid by some plumbers and nurses. In no small part, it’s how hedge fund operators ended up as billionaires, effectively subsidized by the wage earner.

politics,"Hillary's dogwhistling and racist rhetoric are bad for America, and they are especially bad for African Americans.","As an African American I am deeply concerned about the support for Hillary Clinton coming from the African-American community. To my view it is badly mislead. This letter discusses the thinking behind that view.

So I will start at the beginning. As a Millenial my familiarity with Hillary Clinton as a politician began in 2007 during her campaign for the nomination as Democratic candidate for President, which was against Barack Obama. During that campaign a hope was revived in America which Many of us had never seen. Barack, the promising young Senator from Illionois, ran an issues-focused campaign and ignored many of of the attacks coming from Hillary's campaign and from her surrogates, so many of the tactics employed by them went largely unnoticed and were drowned out by the hubbub of the profoundly positivity-oriented campaign which President Obama ran, although some of them did backfire quite heavily.

It is with sadness that I now feel obligated to inform people that Clinton has not been the candidate who is for African American people, as she portrays herself to be. What follows is a list of racist and/or racially divisive and inflammatory rhetoric which Hillary and her surrogates attempted to capitalize on in her race for the nomination:

(to be fair, Hillary later described this joke as a ""lame [sic] attempt at humor."" and stated that she regretted having made it.)

In “Blessed Experiences: Genuinely Southern, Proudly Black” Jim Clyburn writes that Bill Clinton once called him at 3AM, irate that Hillary had lost the primary in South Carolina. ""“If you bastards want a fight, you damn well will get one,” Clinton ranted. “He exploded, used the word ‘bastard’ again, and accused me of causing her defeat and injecting race into the contest,” Clyburn writes. “It was clear that the former president was holding me personally responsible for his wife’s poor showing among South Carolina black voters, and it was also clear that our heated conversation had not changed his mind,” , “Bill Clinton wasn’t just defining his wife’s loss in South Carolina as a ‘black political event,’ he was defining it as a ‘Jim Clyburn black southern event.’ So this is what he meant when he said he’d show us a fight,” wrote Clyburn. 

The day after that phone call, Clinton said ""Jesse Jackson won South Carolina in ‘84 and ‘88. Jackson ran a good campaign. And Obama ran a good campaign here,""  Clyburn interpereted the comment as dismissive of Obama's accomplishment and saw it as opening racial fault lines.

From [""Bill Clinton's 2 a.m. Phone Call to Jim Clyburn:](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/02/11/bill-clintons-2-am-phone-call-to-jim-clyburn)


Orlando Patterson wrote of Hillary's infamous [3AM ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yr7odFUARg) in the New York Times that ""I was left with an uneasy feeling that something was not quite right — something that went beyond my disappointment that she had decided to go negative. Repeated watching of the ad on YouTube increased my unease. I realized that I had only too often in my study of America’s racial history seen images much like these, and the sentiments to which they allude...I have spent my life studying the pictures and symbols of racism and slavery, and when I saw the Clinton ad’s central image — innocent sleeping children and a mother in the middle of the night at risk of mortal danger — it brought to my mind scenes from the past. I couldn’t help but think of D. W. Griffith’s “Birth of a Nation,” the racist movie epic that helped revive the Ku Klux Klan, with its portrayal of black men lurking in the bushes around white society. The danger implicit in the phone ad — as I see it — is that the person answering the phone might be a black man, someone who could not be trusted to protect us from this threat...For more than a century, American politicians have played on racial fears to divide the electorate and mobilize xenophobic parties. Blacks have been the “domestic enemy,” the eternal outsider within, who could always inspire unity among “we whites.” Richard Nixon’s Southern strategy was built on this premise, using coded language — “law and order,” “silent majority”""

Mark Penn, Hillary's campaign manager, may be personally responsible for planting the seed of the birther-ism later spread by Trump and the Tea Party when in March 19, 2007 he wrote, [“I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values.” and proposed targeting Obama’s “lack of American roots.”](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2008/08/penn-strategy-memo-march-19-2008/37952/)

Maggie Williams, Clinton's 2007 Campaign Manager said in response to the accusation that Hillary's campaign circulated a photo of Obama in Somali Garb that [""If Barack Obama's campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing traditional Somali clothing is divisive, they should be ashamed. Hillary Clinton has worn the traditional clothing of countries she has visited and had those photos published widely.""](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/25/barackobama.hillaryclinton)

It was Hillary herself who made the incredibly polarizing and controversial comment that [""I have a much broader base to build a winning coalition on, ... Sen. Obama's support among working, hard-working Americans, white Americans, is weakening again, and how whites in both states who had not completed college were supporting me.""](http://www.politico.com/blogs/ben-smith/2008/05/clintons-white-americans-008545#ixzz3pbJLaY6B)

Which, while true, misses the point of \#BlackLivesMatter almost entirely.

One other response Hillary had, in the context of a conversation with a \#BLM leader was [“I'll just talk to white people.”](http://spectator.org/blog/63810/hillary-clinton-says-shell-just-talk-white-people-about-blacklivesmatter)

And none of this discusses her work in expanding the drug war and mass incarceration, union busting, her hawkishness, or her [self-aggrandizing](http://www.racismreview.com/blog/2015/04/12/hillary-clinton-good-for-white-feminism/) statement in her book Living History that “By the time Bill and I left the White House, welfare rolls had dropped 60 percent.” which was a fact due to not to decrease in poverty but rather a reduction in federal benefits to those living in poverty, many of them working poor. I will leave those subjects for another time.

This is to say nothing of Bill's more recent attacks on BLM, or Hillary's insinuating that Barack Obama may be assassinated, or that she is unsure of his stated religion.

I will leave those subjects for another time.

And so in conclusion I must simply ask those who are supporting Hillary in part due to her claim that she is strong on the issue of racial injustice: Is this really a candidate who is a strong champion for African Americans as Hillary portrays herself to be? You tell me.",energy,1460227447

Most of my debt is monopoly money - I'm on PSLF/IBR and my employer and another org make my student loan and bar loan payments. I'll never pay off the student loans before they're wiped in 10 years, but the bar loan has a high interest rate and I could try to aggressively pay it down. 

Credit score is ~600, with some bad marks from nonpayments on student loans I didn't realize were due between undergrad and law school.

SO has a small income, a decent amount of assets (trust fund she doesn't use on principle), and a bad credit score (due to identity theft). She'll be able to front a down payment in a year or two once her assets recoup some value. SO has little debt but a mortgage that should be paid off in a few years (owner-financed, if that impacts its visibility on credit reporting).

Anyway - I'm not a real credit risk, but it looks like I have a massive amount of debt. We'd like to get a mortgage in the next couple of years and feel like it would be feasible financially. What can we do now to help make that case to lenders in the near future?",finance,1460230203
personalfinance,[Debt] Recent college grad. Went on manic credit card frenzy senior year. Just need some advice.,"So, sorry if these kinds of questions have been shoved down this sub's throat, but I would appreciate if anyone could help with my own unique situation. 

Throughout college, I built my credit score way up because my parents financed a car for me and had credit cards in my name throughout high school. Basically, I'm a spoiled fuckwad, and my ability to manage finances is impressively bad, especially since I now have a degree in business. This sub actually got me interested in rewards cards and smart use of credit. I started applying about 18 months ago. Not surprisingly, I was approved for all of them. It didn't take me long to realize that I didn't have the discipline to pay my cards off every month, and I got caught up with partying way to much. The good news is that I have learned my lesson, and I'm doing much better with my impulses and staying financially self aware. I am proud to say that I am now drug/alcohol free and have begun diligently working on my stupidity. Writing this post is honestly a huge step for me. 

My debt at the moment totals $16,000. I'll break it down:

College Subsidized Federal loan: $7000, payments start in June. 

Sallie Mae MC: $4700/$5700 limit, 24% apr

Citi Simplicity: $2200/$3700 limit, 22% apr

Amex Blue: $2000/2100 limit, 18% apr

Macy's Amex: 0/3500 limit, 28% apr. Worked hard to bring this down from $2300 and that 0 balance (reached last month) was a huge relief to me. I dont' plan to use this card again. Although I've had it for four years (got it as a stupid 19 year old...), so it is helping my credit score now, right?

My credit score is 630. 

I just moved back in with my parents, so I have almost 0 expenses now. My income is about 2000 a month, starting this month (previously unemployed), so I will be spending as little as possible and working odd/freelance jobs to get this all behind me. 

My questions for you... What are the best ways for me to handle this/make it easier? Lending Club sent me something today. Is that a good thing to look into? Should I try to do a balance transfer on yet another credit card? I feel like having so many different credit lines is a lot to keep up with. How can I consolidate and make this much easier for me? Also, my parents don't know about my debt. They are both very well off financially, probably millionaires. But I'm so embarrassed and I always feel like a hassle asking them for money because they work so damn hard while I'm suffering from crippling depression and not worth shit. Would it be in my best interest to just tell them and see if they can help? I know, that's personal, maybe just anyone with that kind of experience can shed light...

Regarding my college loans. Any advice on what schedule/amount I should choose? I'm still working this out with my loan officer.

personalfinance,Student looking for advice on moving forward and building/fixing poor credit score.,"Hello everyone, I was hoping I could get some advice as to how I can (re)build/fix my credit score. For the record, I am I am 22 years old, and I am a senior in college.

I checked my credit report for the first time ever earlier this week, and everything was marked as ""ok"". I then checked my score, it said it was 591. I currently have a Chase Freedom card with a $1000 limit through my parents. Our system is I pay my parents for anything I use the card for, and then they pay the bill. I have never missed a payment, and have always paid in full. 

Here's some information to help you get a better idea of my situation:

**My cash:** 

* $1300 in main bank account, $500 in an emergency fund
* Will be making ~$7k/month for summer internship starting in May.

**Student Loan:**

* $7,641.68  @ 4.29% fixed rate through FedLoan (have not made a payment yet).

**Credit Scores:**

* **TransUnion(CreditKarma):** 752 Excellent (I think this is wrong)
* **Equifax(CreditKarma):** 580 Poor
* **TransUnion (Paid for, before I knew about CreditKarma):** 591 Poor

**Credit Report:**

* Everything is listed as ""ok""

**Chase Freedom Card:** (limit: $1000, age: 3y4mo)

 | 03/2016
:---|:---:
Balance: | $251
Scheduled Payment: | $10
Amount Paid: | $0
High Balance: | $1467

The high balance on the Chase card came from last summer. I totaled my car, so I had to pay for a lot of large bills quickly. I did pay the full $1467 that month though, so I had no balance to carry over. 

I am planning on getting a new credit card to start building my credit score back up. My top 2 cards are the [Discover It Secured Card](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/secured/) and the [Capital One Secured Card](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/secured-mastercard/).I plan on making a large purchase soon (MacBook), so it would be nice to get some rewards from it, but rewards are really not a priority for me at this point. I just want to start fixing my score.

I also have some questions I was hoping people could answer for me:

1. Let's say I have a secured card and put in $2000. If I use that card to pay for a $1800 purchase, can I ""re-fill"" my card in the same month by adding money to it?

2. What can I do about the Chase Freedom card? It's paid off in full, but I think the high balance is hurting my score. I've read that I shouldn't close out cards, so how can I move past this? Should I just stop using it and ignore it?

3. I now understand I should stay under 30% of my credit limit. Does this still apply if I pay my monthly payments before my billing cycle?

4. I have also read that putting securing payments on the card can help build history. I don't have any recurring payments (No Netflix, etc.). Should I open up a Netflix account to put on my card to start that cycle?

5. Right now, I can pay about $1k towards my students loans. Should I just pay the $1k outright, or should I set it up in payments? Negative is that I accrue interest, but if it improves my score should I just bite the bullet and go for the long haul? I plan on putting additional $1k/month payments towards my loan during my internship.

6. I want a credit card as soon as possible to start the rebuilding process. Do you think I have a better shot at the Discover It Secured, or the Capital One Secured card? I want to minimize my chances of rejection.

**My goal:** I'd like to get my score up to ~650 by next April. With wise decision making, is this realistic, or am I shooting for the moon?

Thanks for reading my post. I'm new to this, and I really want to take the proper steps to fix my credit, so I would appreciate any advice at all.

personalfinance,"Tax assistance was confusing, unhelpful... can I really not claim this dependent?","I'm posting this here because I'd really love some advice on this... I asked in the tax tuesday thread but nobody replied, I think I came too late to the thread.

I need advice on what happened with my tax assistance yesterday.

I went to H&amp;R Block, because my taxes this year are very complex; my parents put their condo in my name and I now ""technically"" receive rent etc. on it.

Apart from the egregious fee and the fact that my tax rep didn't actually speak much english (this other non-tax-certified dude had to come over and translate everything she and I said to each other) and the whole thing taking 2+ hours, I felt like she knew what she was doing.

HOWEVER, I asked her if I could claim my significant other as a dependent. I had read [here] (https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Family/Can-I-Claim-a-Boyfriend-Girlfriend-As-a-Dependent-on-Income-Taxes--/INF14242.html) and on /r/personalfinance that you could claim a GF/BF as a dependent if you paid over half of their living expenses and they made under $4k.

My girlfriend fits both those descriptions. I have paid her monthly rent for about 9 months because she is disabled and unable to find a job (before anyone starts, it's murderously hard to apply for disabilities with chronic pain and depression), and consequently she only made ~$3k last year.

The tax rep said that I could not do it. Apparently we had to be married, or she had to be under 24 (which she was last year!!) and also a student, or she had to be under 18... that's what they told me, at least. But that's not what the internet is telling me.

At that point it had been 2 hours already and I was really fed up trying to communicate with this person and I just gave up and signed and paid everything to get out of there. Do I have any ability for recourse? Was the tax rep right; am I not able to claim my GF as a dependent? I spent $500+ on her every month last year and I just want to be able to get some of it back.",finance,1460233662

I have a comfortable cash e-fund saved up and would like to grow part of that that e-fund (over 3mo expenses) in low-risk bond funds/etfs (or maybe some other funds) that are relatively liquid. I just don't want that much cash sitting around getting eaten up by inflation.

 I know a lot of people suggest holding some of your e-fund in a Roth, but what about a taxable brokerage? Any major difference, especially if I am looking at tax-free bond funds?

Additionally, what funds/etfs/etc would you recommend? My issue with vanguard and fidelity is that they have relatively high minimum initial investments (10k and 2.5k, respectively). I want to ease myself into this, and don't want to drop that much cash in until I am perfectly comfortable. Schwab on the other hand only requires $100. This is a lot easier to stomach (getting my feet wet slowly!). I guess I could eventually transfer over to vanguard/fidelity once I met their minimums. 

My risk tolerance is just enough that I feel safe having 3mo of expenses totally liquid (savings account) and 6-12mo in something that is ""safer"" and can still be accessed in a few days time.

I'm currently a first year science teacher at a public school, so I fall in to the category of those eligible for PSLF.  I was thinking of teaching for 10ish years before moving in to something else, but if I'm not able to continue my payments I could teach a little bit longer as I continue to pursue higher education.

I was reading the 2015 Annual Report of ABN Amro (http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ABN:NA) when I realised that its book equity of 17.584 billion is more than its market cap of 16.704 billion. The bank recently IPO'd after being taken private by our government following the onslaught of the 2008 financial crisis. Is it normal for a bank to have less market cap than its book equity? If yes, do interest rate fluctuations play a large role in this? ABN Amro relies mostly on mortgages which should provide little interest rate risk. In addition, it seems very unlikely for the bank to fail again anytime soon. How can its market cap be so low, when looking at its book numbers?",finance,1460244953

politics,The Panama Papers prove we need to rethink taxes,"I think it's only natural for the wealthy to dodge taxes. If they didn't know how to minimize expenses, they wouldn't be wealthy. Some of the names in the panama papers were all about higher taxes and banking transparency. Yet they couldn't help but hide their money.

Instead of treating people like criminals for trying to keep their money. I think we need a revolutionary egalitarian tax revenue source that you cannot hide from. It's no hurry since we're solving a problem we've lived with since *ever*. But here's what I think the long term solution should be.

A 1% transaction tax taken from both ends of *every* digital transaction, totaling in 2% revenue. No ifs and or buts. Doesn't matter if it's milk money or a corporate merger. Everybody pays into it, no matter what.

How it's distributed is certainly a matter up for debate. But I'd recommend a non bureaucratic flat rate autonomously collected and distributed, where 0.25% goes to the federal govt, 0.5% goes to the state govt, another 0.5% goes to your local govt and last but not least every individual is equally compensated 0.75% for inflation through a tax payer dividend (AKA UBI).

An unintended consequence would be that high order goods with lots of components, resources and labor put into them would see a price increase. Vertically owned chains of production would undercut the hell out of the competition. But I think it would be worth it.

In order to receive the tax payer dividend, you'd have to be an un-incarcerated adult US citizen. Parents would split their child's dividends with their local school system. Immigrants would not be eligible until they obtain legal citizenship. So in this sense you could have open borders.

This could save allot of money by eliminating a dysfunctional bureaucracy. We wouldn't have to worry about social safety net programs. There would be no waste, fraud or abuse of the tax or welfare system.

If you don't think a 2% tax would generate enough revenue, the federal reserve has estimated the average dollar changes hands 55 times a year. I think that number sounds a little generous.",finance,1460247014
politics,Lies From the Left,"I get it, you're upset. You want to be able to go to college without a mountain of debt to pay off, you want higher wages for the working people of America, and you think everybody should be able to have access to healthcare. Well, what if I told you that all of it and more was possible without having the government's hands in your pockets, and having an authoritarian nanny-state running your life for you? Would you believe me? Well, if you're listening to the media or any Democratic politician, that answer is most likely no. They say that these right-wing libertarian nuts are greedy, and out to get you, when the reality is, that we're the biggest fighters for equality and liberation that you've got, and the leftists are feeding you every lie in the book to keep you from seeing that. So I invite you to read on, and take a walk with me as we look at things from my perspective of thinking. You might just agree with what I have to say.



   So by now, with Bernie Sanders plastered all over the place, from radio, to tv, to buttons and t-shirts, you've no doubt heard his rhetoric about how capitalism has failed us, the rich are hoarding money, the corporations are refusing to pay higher wages because they are greedy, and that we need to raise minimum wage laws and adopt more social programs and keep spending more money to add to our 19 Trillion dollar debt in order to give working-class people the rights that they are entitled to. Well, how's this for a plot twist: The very government that he and other far-left politicians are pushing for you to give more power by voting people like him in, are responsible for these problems that ail you in the first place. They correctly diagnose the problems, but they have awful solutions to them. It's like if your doctor said that you had a broken leg, your leg is there on the table snapped in half, and to treat it, he suggests that you have your buddy whack it with a crowbar out back in the parking lot! Let's look at wages for example. Bernie says that Americans aren't getting paid what they deserve for the hours that they work, and that the cost of living is rising, and that it's the result of these evil corporate monsters that are forcing you to work for them, refusing to pay you because enough is never enough, and they don't want their employees to do well, all while they raise the price of their products because they want more money. Well, as somebody who helps run a business, I can tell you that it's completely false. Government intervention has ruined America from having what was once the highest standard of living in the world, the best economy, and highest wages in respect to the cost of living. This all changed when the government decided to step in! Since when was being successful a crime? In a true free market, everybody has a chance to be as successful as they can dream of if they are smart and work hard. It is greedy of you to think that you are entitled to leech off of the hard work and success of another individual who earned it. Social programs don't help people, equal opportunity does, and that is achieved through a true free market, which sadly, we do not have here in America as of now. We have crony bullcrap that allows the government to regulate and limit the market, and billionaires buy our politicians. This does need to be broken up. You have correctly diagnosed many problems, but the solution is not giving more power to the monster that created them in the first place that will drive this country into the ground. 
I'll give you a real world example of why exactly business owners can't afford to pay their employees more. My family and I own a bar in town that myself, my uncle, and my grandmother help operate. Now, the law in my state says that we aren't allowed to purchase any of our alcohol from any place except for a select few liquor companies, none of whom sell the same product. We are not legally permitted to go to a store that sells liquor, such as HyVee, Quick Trip, or any place that sells alcohol to non-corporations (individuals), or if discovered, we will either have to pay a huge fine, or we will be shut down depending on how many times we've been caught. Well, to save a few bucks, my uncle and I broke the law a few weeks ago when we had this huge benefit for the funeral expenses of a customer who had passed away, and we ended up at a HyVee buying our beer for the night. Well, upon calculating the cost of each individual bottle of Bud Light that we purchased from the store, we determined that the liquor company charges us $0.36 more per bottle of Bud Light than the grocery store does, and that's due to government regulation telling us that we MUST purchase our Bud Light from this company, which means that the liquor company can charge us as much as they want, and we don't have the freedom to go and buy it at a cheaper rate, or we're going to be shut down. Now, I know that $0.36 doesn't sound like a lot, but when you're selling 400 or 600 bottles of beer a day, the amount of money that we are wasting because of your government trying to regulate us with stupid laws adds up fast, which means that by the time we pay all the bills and restock, we are left with a whole lot less to pay to our employees than we would be if the government would stop regulating us, taxing us to death, and making us pay these stupid licensing fees for things such as a liquor license that basically means that we have to pay a fee to say, ""Yeah, we sell alcohol here."". Bernie and the rest of the left want to keep these regulations, possibly stack more onto us, and raise the minimum wage, and that means that we're going to have trouble staying open, paying our employees, and that eventually means that we'll go out of business and our bartenders will be on the lookout for any new job openings. The way that you achieve higher wages for your work is not by restricting the very places that give you these jobs and your paycheck to begin with. Less money for them means less money that they have to pay you after they have to deal with the cost of staying open, it’s that simple. And no, they can’t just pay you these low, low wages, because places are competing for labor, and as a result of that, the place who pays the best wages will see employee slots fill up faster, and their business expand more, while the cheap guy who doesn’t want to pay up will see his employees quit their jobs, and his business fail. That’s how it should be, an open competition for the people to be able to choose whom they want to work for to suit their own best interests. 



  Low wages aren’t the only thing that your government has managed to bring about you. You know that massive blob of student-loan debt you owe after you try to go and better yourself with a college education? Well, your ever so responsible government is to blame for that as well. According to statisticbrain.com (Who cites the Federal reserve Board, Chronicle of Higher Education, and College Board as sources), the average student loan debt as of the time July 1st, 2015, is roughly $30,000, the approximate amount of people with outstanding student loan debt in this country is 39 and a half million people, over 12 million more students borrow annually, and out of every college student in America right now, about 60% of them are subjecting themselves to this debt by having to borrow money to cover the outrageous cost of tuition. The leftist solution to this problem is to tax, tax, tax their way to paying off the cost of tuition for every college student in America, using the money from a Wall Street exchange tax, and taxing the richest of us. Well, they must realize that in the countries with heavily socialized education systems, the average taxpayer shells out at least a quarter of what he brings home in taxes to help fund this stuff, such as in Germany, where everybody pays a flat income tax of 25%, plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge. Well, it gives people a free education, but if there was a way that taxpayers got to keep the most of their money, and education was affordable for nearly all students, wouldn’t you rather have that instead of making the hard working people of your country pay more of the money they earned into some entitlement program? That’s exactly what can happen if you tell your government that enough is enough. You see, the reason that colleges are charging so much right now for students to attend them, is because the government is giving out a student loan to anybody that applies for one, which most do because of how expensive they are, and that money doesn’t grow on trees folks, this is coming from taxpayers. Workers, who are trying to put food on the table, and build better lives for themselves, are having to pay more than they should in taxes because your government is allowing these universities to charge people so much. The reason that they are able to do this, is because they know that no matter how much they charge in tuition, the government is going to cover it at the expense of you and me, because they have a soft spot for a kid that comes to them and says that he wants to go and try to get himself an education, and make a life for himself. The universities know this, so they hike the rates. Simple as that. If we were to say no to our government, and tell them to stop using our tax dollars in this way, those colleges that leave is in a squalor of debt, harassment from debt collectors, and financial uncertainty, would be forced to drop their prices to rates that people like you and me can afford, or else they’d see a drop in people applying to go to their schools, and of course, a drop in profits. They wouldn’t be able to even stay open unless they dropped prices, and the best part of that is, that you and other taxpayers wouldn’t have to pay a dime for it. As a matter of fact, you’d end up getting to keep more money, since it wouldn’t be used to subsidize these loans that the government gives away to people. If you don’t like the sound of getting millions of students out of debt over the coming years all without costing anybody one cent, then I’d vote for a leftist. If you’re for eliminating the outrageous cost of tuition, stopping putting our young people in a pit of financial despair, and getting to keep the money that you busted your ass earning, then make a stand to your government, and tell them that enough is enough!




   At this point, you’re probably wondering what the government hasn’t screwed up for you. Well, I can tell you that you won’t find your answer in the field of healthcare. Government regulation has also killed a system that was at one time, a great one. Back in the day, low-cost health insurance was available to nearly every American, doctors made house calls, and those who couldn’t afford went to charity hospitals and received the medical care that they deserved, at no expense to people like you and me in the form of increased taxes to fund social healthcare programs. Since the times of the 1940’s, 50’s, and 60’s, the government has crushed the healthcare industry with thousands of regulations on doctors, hospitals, and health insurance companies, and with the establishment of Medicare and Medicade. The government tells you that you are limited only to the healthcare programs offered within your state, instead of allowing them to compete as they once did in an open, free market as they should. The average cost of healthcare in the United States has increased from $2,384 in 1970 (I did adjust for inflation. People in that time cost an average of $380 annually per person to receive healthcare annually) per-capita, to well over ten thousand dollars now in 2016(Source: Kaiser Family Foundation, National Conference of State Legislatures). Boy, I wonder what about our healthcare system might have changed since then? Government involvement in the industry perhaps might be our answer. We must deregulate the healthcare industry and purge it of all laws that drive up the cost of healthcare, and lower availability of being able to get medical services. For example, every state has a law that mandates that a healthcare provider give coverage to people with certain disabilities and diseases. In doing this, they are reducing consumer choice, and causing the cost of healthcare to rise, and in doing so, cause Americans who can’t afford to pay the higher rates to go without health insurance, and rely on social medicine paid for by the taxpayers to get their healthcare, or they don’t get any healthcare at all and are left to make it as long as they can, and hope that they might get better after a few Hail Marys. We must also remove all of the roadblocks that the government has set up, including the FDA, that is keeping life-saving drugs out of the hands of the sick patients that need their healing properties now, not in ten years when they get approved, and they are already nailed shut in a coffin. This is supposed to save us from harmful drugs, but what the FDA has become is a fat ass obstacle that is standing between so many effective medicines, and the people who need them that are suffering as you read this very sentence. For instance, the FDA took about a decade to approve the drug Propranolol, a heart medication used to help treat angina and hypertension, causing roughly 100,000 Americans who could have been saved by this drug to instead die because of it. Folks, your government is killing us. Literally killing us. And who do the leftists want to give more power to? Why, the very government that causes all of this of course!



  Branching off of healthcare, another screwed up mess we have in that same field, is our government allowing pharmaceutical companies to place patents on the drugs that the FDA eventually passes. This means that the drug company that develops the medicine is the only company that’s allowed to sell that drug, and that means they are able to charge people whatever they want for the drugs that they need to save their lives, and they better pray to God that they have good health insurance, or else they might be in a bit of a pickle. Somebody that needed a steady supply of Soliris (Eculizumab) for instance, in order to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare disease that destroys red blood cells, would have to pray that they had an extra $440,000 laying around somewhere to get them through a yearly supply if they didn’t have health coverage. In the United States, PNH affects only about 8,000 Americans, but the total sales revenue for Soliris racked up $1.55 billion in the year 2013, meaning that not everybody who had the disease was able to get the medication that they needed, because otherwise, sales would have topped out at well over $3 billion for that year if all 8,000 people who had the disease were covered by an insurance company that had the means to fit the bill. Those are more Americans that are dying because Alexion Pharmaceuticals, who manufactures Soliris, has created a monopoly on their drug using the patent system, and can charge somebody with PNH or their healthcare provider as much as they want to, because it’s a matter of “Either fit the bill or you die”. Sadly, not everybody can fit the bill because of the broken system, and this is because your government isn’t allowing for the free market to work in healthcare, meaning that thousands of Americans who have serious diseases like PNH die every year because they cannot fit the bill. Eliminate this silly patent system, to allow more companies to manufacture the product, breeding competition, and the cost of life-saving drugs to plummet ten-fold. It doesn’t cost companies anywhere the price that they sell these drugs to produce them, and by letting other companies produce and sell them, you’ll have a price way that will bring costs for life-saving drugs to reach rates that are affordable to people and their healthcare providers. After all, if you had PNH, and could either buy your annual supply of eculizumab from Soliris at $440,000 a year, or from another manufacturer for $5,000, which company are you going to buy your drugs from? I’ll leave it at this: We have well over 100 car manufacturers all over the world, but it’s a crime if we were to allow more than one company to produce a life-saving drug and have a competitive market without a predatory monopoly protected by the government that allows thousands of Americans to go without the drugs that they need to live? If more than one company is allowed to make cars, microwaves, cell phones, steel chairs, pencils, staplers, televisions, computers, video game consoles, and pretty much any other product available for human consumption mass-produced on the planet, then why is our government allowing drug companies to create monopolies on their products that results in American lives being lost, and makes them exempt from the principles of the free market system that should be in place instead? Well, sure beats me. Maybe we should say something about it.",finance,1460247129
politics,A history of Clinton Scandals: The mental gymnastics of trusting Bill and Hillary,"This is something that's been bothering me all election cycle. Polls consistently rate Hillary as [untrustworthy](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/17/poll-hillary-clinton-least-honest-and-trustworthy-of-all-presidential-candidates/), and even exit polls among Dems say that Bernie is more trustworthy. However, these same people are VOTING for her, in droves. 

How can democratic voters ignore the striped past of Hillary? How can they ignore the even worse past of Bill? Do you really think he's going to be content in a ""First Lady"" role?  I'm only 33, but I can easily remember the Whitewater incident, Operation Infinite Reach, Lewinsky et al, etc.  

I have only seen ONE article from the MSM this election cycle about this topic, from the Atlantic: [LINK](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/tracking-the-clinton-controversies-from-whitewater-to-benghazi/396182/)

I could understand where younger voters may be unaware of the history, but Hillary's support is largely from the older 40+ voting bloc, which should have no trouble remembering many of these incidents (links primarily go to Wikipedia overviews of each incident):

**In (mostly) chronological order:**

**1978-1979:** [Cattle Futures scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_cattle_futures_controversy) - In 1978 and 1979, lawyer and First Lady of Arkansas Hillary Rodham engaged in a series of trades of cattle futures contracts, based on advice from a personal friend who was, at the time, a top legal adviser to Tyson Foods Inc. Her initial $1,000 investment had generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. 

In 1994, after Hillary Rodham Clinton had become First Lady of the United States, the trading became the subject of considerable controversy regarding the likelihood of such a spectacular rate of return, possible conflict of interest, and allegations of disguised bribery, allegations that Clinton strongly denied. There were no official investigations of the trading and Clinton was never charged with any wrongdoing. 

In a Fall 1994 paper for the Journal of Economics and Finance, economists from the University of North Florida and Auburn University investigated the odds of gaining a hundred-fold return in the cattle futures market during the period in question. Using a model that was stated to give the hypothetical investor the benefit of the doubt, they concluded that the odds of such a return happening were at best 1 in 31 trillion.

   
**April 25th, 1978 - 1999:** [The alleged rape of Juanita Broaddrick and subsequent coverup(s).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanita_Broaddrick)

   
**1992 - 2000:** The [Whitewater Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewater_controversy). David Hale, the source of criminal allegations against the Clintons, claimed in November 1993 that as governor of Arkansas, Clinton had pressured him into providing an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. 

A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation did result in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project; and Bill Clinton's successor as governor, Jim Guy Tucker, was convicted of fraud and sentenced to four years of probation for his role in the matter. Susan McDougal later served 18 months in prison for contempt of court for refusing to answer questions relating to Whitewater. The Clintons themselves were never prosecuted, after three separate inquiries found insufficient evidence to prosecute them related to the land deal, and McDougal (as well as others convicted through Whitewater) was granted a pardon by President Clinton before he left office. 

The term Whitewater is also sometimes used to include other controversies from the Bill Clinton administration, especially those such as Travelgate, Filegate, and the circumstances surrounding Vince Foster's death, that were investigated by the Whitewater independent counsel. Kenneth Starr's successor as Independent Counsel, Robert Ray, released a report in September 2000 that stated ""This office determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that either President or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any criminal conduct."" 

Ray nonetheless criticized the White House in a statement regarding the release of the report, saying delays in the production of evidence and ""unmeritorious litigation"" by the president's lawyers severely impeded the investigation's progress, leading to a total cost of nearly $60 million. Ray's report effectively closed the Whitewater investigation. The length, expense, and results of the Whitewater investigations turned the public against the Office of the Independent Counsel; even Kenneth Starr was opposed. In particular, Democrats portrayed Whitewater as a political witch-hunt, much as Republicans had at the end of the 1980s Iran-Contra investigations. As such, the Independent Counsel law expired in 1999.

   
**1992** - [Gennifer Flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennifer_Flowers) comes forward, claiming a 12-year relationship with Bill. She produced recorded phone conversations which the administration discredited as being doctored. She later sues both Clintons and their involved aides in a defamation suit, claiming they orchestrated a campaign to discredit her.

   
**May 1993 - 2000:** [Travelgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_travel_office_controversy), followed by the suicide of her friend and staffer [Vince Foster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Foster) and [Filegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_FBI_files_controversy). Hillary allegedly instigated the firings of seven White House travel office employees, ostensibly to replace them with a contract to a company the Clintons had personal ties to. 

Hillary Clinton gradually came under scrutiny for allegedly having played a central role in the firings and making false statements about her role in it.  ""[Hillary] Clinton, upon learning of [Vince] Foster's death, at least realized its connection to [the] Travelgate scandal, and perhaps to the Whitewater matter, and dispatched her trusted lieutenants to contain any potential embarrassment or political damage."" 

(Independent Counsel) Ray's full 243-page report was unsealed and made public on October 18, 2000, three weeks before the Senatorial election. It confirmed that neither Hillary Clinton nor David Watkins would be indicted. It included some new detail, including a somewhat unsubstantiated claim from a friend of Watkins saying that the First Lady had told Watkins to ""fire the sons of bitches."" Ray cited eight separate conversations between the First Lady and senior staff and concluded: ""Mrs. Clinton’s input into the process was significant, if not the significant factor influencing the pace of events in the Travel Office firings and the ultimate decision to fire the employees."" 

Moreover, Ray determined Hillary Clinton had given ""factually false"" testimony when questioned by the GAO, the Independent Counsel, and Congress about the travel office firings, but reiterated that ""the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt"" that she knew her statements were false or understood that they may have prompted the firings. (note: I am not alleging that the death of Vince Foster is mysterious).

   
**1993-1997 -** [Healthcare Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_health_care_plan_of_1993#Litigation).  In 1997, federal judge Royce Lamberth levied $286,000 in sanctions against Bill Clinton’s administration for “running amok” in a “cover-up” of Hillary Clinton’s health-care task force. The scandal began when deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster made contradictory assertions about the first lady’s job status, in an attempt to keep the work of the task force secret. 

The First Lady's role in the secret proceedings of the Health Care Task Force also sparked litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, in relation to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) which requires openness in government. The Clinton White House argued that the Recommendation Clause in Article II of the U.S. Constitution would make it unconstitutional to apply the procedural requirements of FACA to Mrs. Clinton's participation in the meetings of the Task Force. Some constitutional experts argued to the court that such a legal theory was not supported by the text, history, or structure of the Constitution. 

Ultimately, Hillary Clinton won the litigation in June 1993, when the D.C. Circuit ruled narrowly that the First Lady of the United States could be deemed a government official (and not a mere private citizen) for the purpose of not having to comply with the procedural requirements of FACA. Also in February 1993, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, along with several other groups, filed a lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and Donna Shalala over closed-door meetings related to the health care plan. 

The AAPS sued to gain access to the list of members of the task force. In 1997, Judge Royce C. Lamberth found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded $285,864 to the AAPS for legal costs; Lamberth also harshly criticized the Clinton administration and Clinton aide Ira Magaziner in his ruling. Subsequently, a federal appeals court overturned in 1999 the award and the initial findings on the basis that Magaziner and the administration had not acted in bad faith.

   
**May 6, 1994 -** Sexual harassment suit by Paula Jones ([Jones v. Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Jones#Jones_v._Clinton))  and subsequent appeal by Clinton to Supreme Court ([Clinton v. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_v._Jones)). The Supreme Court's ruling in Clinton v. Jones led to the District Court's hearing of Jones v. Clinton, which led to the Lewinsky scandal, when Clinton was asked under oath about other workplace relationships, which led to charges of perjury and obstruction of justice and the impeachment of Bill Clinton.

As as result, he faced the following administrative sanctions in lieu of a criminal proceeding: (1) President Clinton’s admission of providing false testimony that was knowingly misleading, evasive, and prejudicial to the administration of justice before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas; (2) his acknowledgement that his conduct violated the Rules of Professional Conduct of the Arkansas Supreme Court; (3) the five-year suspension of his license to practice law and $25,000 fine imposed on him by the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas; (4) the civil contempt penalty of more than $900,000 imposed on President Clinton by the federal court for violating its orders; (5) the payment of more than $850,000 in settlement to Paula Jones; (6) the express finding by the federal court that President Clinton had engaged in contemptuous conduct; and (7) the substantial public condemnation of President Clinton arising from his impeachment.

   
**1995-2006** - [The Barrett report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_Report) into Clinton's potential abuses of the DOJ and IRS as tools against citizens. 120 pages were redacted by court order before its release.

   
**1995** - [Wampumgate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wampumgate) : Documents uncovered by Congressional investigators, lawsuits and an Independent Counsel showed evidence that political contributions and pressure from lobbyists from rival tribes caused Bruce Babbitt to overrule staff recommendations and deny the casino application. President Clinton supported Bruce Babbitt in his overruling regional Interior officials. Records from the Interior Department showed that the office of Harold Ickes, then Pres Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff, did in fact contact Babbitt's aides about the Hudson project. 

   
**1998** - [Lewinsky Scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewinsky_scandal) and subsequent [failed impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_and_acquittal_of_Bill_Clinton). 

   
**1998:** [Commercegate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercegate) - allegations Clintons were involved in scheme to sell seats on planes during trade missions in exchange for large $50,000+ donations. Sec. Commerce Ron Brown died in a plane crash in Croatia before the investigation could interview him. (note: I am NOT alleging that his death is mysterious.)

   
**Aug. 20, 1998** -[Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory bombing, Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shifa_pharmaceutical_factory). Beyond the death and injuries from the bombing, estimated tens of thousands died from lack of anti-malarials the factory produced before it was destroyed. Bombing was based on a soil sample that contained a precursor to a nerve gas agent in proximity to the factory. 

Also see [Operation Infinite Reach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile_strikes_on_Afghanistan_and_Sudan_\(August_1998\)). The missile strikes during the operation (including the factory bombing) had the effect of strengthening Al-Quaeda in the region.  Following the attacks, the ruling Taliban reneged on its promise given to Saudi intelligence chief Turki al-Faisal to hand over bin Laden, and the regime instead strengthened its ties with Bin Laden. Maulana Sami ul-Haq, leader of the Pakistani Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) party, concurred that the strikes ""turned Osama bin Laden, an ordinary man, into a hero."" A 1999 report prepared by Sandia National Laboratories stated that bin Laden ""appeared to many as an underdog standing firm in the face of bullying aggression,"" and added that the missile strikes ""provoked a new round of terrorist bombing plots."" These plots included the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000. 

Also see [Operation Desert Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Iraq_\(1998\)) in 1998, where Clinton bombed Iraq on the pretense that Iraq forced out UN weapons inspectors (who had actually been told to withdraw by the US).  Additionally see the US participation in the [bombing of Yugoslavia in 1998](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_of_the_NATO_bombing_of_Yugoslavia). All of these operations have been criticized by detractors as being a ploy to distract from the Lewinsky scandal.

   
**September 11, 1998:** [The Starr report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starr_Report) is released. It covers improprieties ranging from Whitewater to Travelgate.

   
**1999-2001** - [Pardongate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton_pardon_controversy): In addition to some earlier pardons, Bill pardoned 450 people on his last day in office. Pardons included his brother, Puerto Rican terrorists, Henry Cisneros (see the Barrett Report), and several people who made $$ payments to Hillary's brothers and/or the Clinton Foundation in exchange for clemency. 

This also includes the [Hasidic Pardons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_York,_2000#Hasidic_pardons), which were alleged to be a kick back in exchange for votes for Hillary during her Senate run. Most controversial was probably the pardon to Marc Rich, a federal fugitive wanted on counts of tax evasion, fraud, and connections to the Iran hostage crisis. Rich’s pardon was among Clinton’s last-day sprint, and came under much scrutiny after it was found that Rich’s first wife, Denise, had contributed $450,000 to the foundation for the Clinton Presidential Library and $100,000 to Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaign.

   
**August 12, 2000:** The [Gala Hollywood Farewell Salute to President Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gala_Hollywood_Farewell_Salute_to_President_Clinton) AKA the [Hollywood Fundraiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_New_York,_2000#Hollywood_fundraiser). Hillary Clinton's former finance director, David Rosen, was indicted on January 7, 2005 on campaign finance charges related to a fund-raising event produced by Peter F. Paul. 

Paul, a convicted drug dealer who would soon after be convicted on stock fraud charges after being extradited from Brazil, stated that he spent $1.2 million to produce the August 12, 2000 Hollywood Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton event, which was both a tribute to honor President Clinton and a fundraiser for the First Lady's 2000 Senate campaign. The Justice Department indictment charged Rosen with filing false reports with the Federal Election Commission by reporting only $400,000 in contributions.

   
**2001:** [White House furniture](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/10/news/mn-23723) and items appropriated by the Clintons, and gifts totaling $190,000 accepted by Hillary from the period 1992-200. They later returned the items and paid for $85,000 of the gifts received in the year 2000, after the concerns had been brought to light.

-----------------------------------------------

Since I limited my list to mostly the presidential years, these are just a partial list of all the scandals and lies that the pair have been caught in over the years. Some I have purposely left out because while the scandal occurred during their watch, there's nothing that ties them as being remotely at fault (example: Chinagate - the theft of US nuclear warhead plans by China operatives). 

Hopefully, most voters will remember fairly recent events like Benghazi, ""coming under sniper fire"" in Bosnia, claiming to be ""broke"" when they left the White House, the email scandal(s), speaking fees, donations to the Clinton foundation and possible State Department quid pro quos, etc. 

The question I originally posit remains. Faced with all of the mounted evidence that the Clintons can't be trusted, WHY do people continue to vote for Hillary?

------------------------------------------------

**EDIT**: Just a note, I've been a left-leaning Independent my whole adult life. I was a teen in the 90s and at the time like most of the public I had a high opinion of the Clintons (he peaked at like 60-70% approval during the impeachment hearings). This isn't a petty attempt from the right to discredit her. I am hoping this thread will produce some intelligent debate.

In fact, many of these investigations didn't originate from the right, but from within the White House itself-- several of the items on the list were investigated at the order of Janet Reno or other officials in the Clinton administration.

**EDIT x2** As of about an hour after I posted this, it has 27 points (65% upvoted) and 54 comments. This topic clearly struck a nerve for many (for various reasons) and I'm very happy to see the dialogue coming from all sides on this.

**EDIT: Electric Boogaloo** An interesting point brought up in PM that I thought I'd share my thoughts on here:

I think a lot of people have very little idea of how federal investigations or independent commissions work. To be honest, that's not all their fault-- these investigations sometimes go on for years, are mired in lawsuits and countersuits, and by time the report comes out people are so fatigued of hearing about it that they can't bother to actually investigate what the (usually huge) reports contain.

If the conclusion of the report was that there wasn't enough evidence to convict, then there won't be a recommendation to prosecute. Why-- more time, money, and resources wasted on what may be a losing cause. This doesn't mean that some/most of the allegations don't have substantiation. But people don't seem to get that.

I purposefully left out the Republican hatchet-jobs and crazy conspiracies. If you want some fun reading of tabloid level tinfoil hat stuff, break out the popcorn and check out the nutso archives of [Sam Smith](http://prorev.com/wwindex.htm).

politics,"""Corruption is Legal in America"": How can we best move forward in making our government work for everyone?","I've seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig) by **Represent.Us** floating around in various threads, but I wanted to post it again because I think it's something that everyone who is interested enough in politics to visit this subreddit should watch. It covers a number of individual subparts of the overall argument that corruption is indeed legal in America, but two of these really stick out to me:

- that the beliefs and desired policies of the average American have a near-zero impact on policy-making on the federal level

- that corporations put forth a ton of money toward campaign contributions and lobbyists, yet reap benefits that are larger than such contributions by several magnitudes

In theory, a representative government should represent the interests of its constituents - unfortunately, this theory has been swept aside by the realities of our current political system.  In order to change this system, people need to first understand what the problem is. My hope in posting here is to both inform people and start a discussion on how to move toward a more representative political system.

Some initial ideas:

- Pass the [American Anti-Corruption Act](http://anticorruptionact.org/).

- Appoint a new Supreme Court justice who, if/when presented with a related issue, is willing to overturn decisions like *Citizens United* and *McCutcheon v. FEC*.

- Elect officials who favor the passage of anti-corruption legislation.

I'm interested to hear this sub's thoughts, because while we may disagree on finer policy points and the direction we want the country to go in, I think one thing we can all agree on (assuming none of you are corporations) is that our political system should serve the people.

personalfinance,How likely am I to qualify for a mortgage?,"I'm applying for a mortgage right now, and I'm wondering if I'll qualify for a good rate. Here are my details:

**The good:**

Married, wife stays home, 2 kids: 14 months and 6 years old.

I make $74K/year, plus bonus. This year is was $10k. That's all before taxes.

I have just under $12K in a 401(k)

I've been with this company since Feb 15 (I actually started 2 days after my son was born). I worked for another company for 10-ish months before that, and I was in graduate school before that making peanuts (*and science*).

**The Bad:**

I owe $75K in student loans. $68k to gov, $7K private. I'm paying 171/month to both. IBR repayment plan. I'm paying so little because.......

$20K credit card debt. I'm putting all of my extra money toward my credit cards. It was 3 cards last year. I'm paying them off and cancelling them as fast as possible. It isn't the best for my credit score, I know, but my priority for a while has been to get debt free. That's also why I'm paying so little every month on the student loans. The interest rate on the card is higher, so I'm paying them off first.

I owe $15K on a Hummer H3. I know what you're thinking:  ""Who the heck buys a hummer when they owe that much, and right in the middle of grad school?"" It was kind of a big ""up yours"" to my hippie ex-wife who hated hummers. I do a lot of off-roading and I have a work car so I don't spend a lot of money on gas. I don't spend a lot of money on other stuff, seriously. No TV, and I sold a lot of stuff related to other hobbies. I know the smart thing is to sell it, but then I'll end up sitting around and doing nothing and going a bit crazy.  Anyways, the interest rate on it is really low and I'll have it paid off in 3 years.

I also owe my parents some money. They loaned me some to get out from under the credit cards. 

I have no down payment. I'll borrow from my 401k and then pay it back with next year's bonus.

Credit score - 643. I have no late payments, but high credit usage because of the way I've been paying off cards and cancelling them. I have a collection on my record. I went to school for 3 weeks or so, decided it was a bad idea, and dropped classes. They charged me $2500 and I didn't want to pay it. Now it's in collections. 

**The Ugly:**

Right now we live in a 2 bedroom apartment. It's tiny and driving me nuts. Rent is $1095. Square footage is less than 800.

I'm looking for a small-ish, less fancy house. I want to pay less than $180K for it. I found one that's not huge. It has no backyard and shares walls with the neighboring houses so I figure I can save on watering and HVAC. I am aiming for total mortgage (PMI, insurance, taxes) to be less than rent. Home prices in my area are also pretty low. I have a pretty good idea that they are going to come back up in the next couple of years.

The houses I'm looking at have mother-in-law apartments. My brother may need a place to live and I'll probably let him live with us for pretty cheap.

I planned on living in these apartments for another year after the lease ends in August, but I'm honestly going a bit crazy. It's a tiny apartment and I think my money is better spent on putting it towards a house and spending less on shelter. OK thanks for feedback.",finance,1460273047

personalfinance,When is the right time to refinance my auto loan?,"Hi, about a year ago, I bought a new car because mine didn't pass inspection. At the time, I had almost no credit, and I had a few medical bills that went to collections in college because I thought I had paid them and apparently I hadn't.  Either way, I didn't have much credit other than student loans, and what credit I did have wasn't great. Since then, I have been paying monthly on a credit card I have, my student loans, and now this car loan.

Now, to my point. The interest rate on my car loan is enormous (~11%), and I am hoping to refinance to get lower payments, but I'm conflicted as to when the right time to pull the trigger is. I know that I can get a lower rate now, but the additional inquires will make my credit score drop, so I don't want to do it too early and wind up not getting a very good rate and having to make up the dip in my credit. Is there a good way to determine when the right time to refinance is so I'm not dumping tons of money into interest every month, but I also don't want to miss out on a better deal if I can get a better one by waiting. My credit score is firmly in the ""Fair"" range per credit Karma. As of now, my credit score is sitting at 670 per equifax and 662 per transunion.

Additionally, any advice you can give about shopping around for auto loans would be much appreciated, since the last time I got a loan was just through the dealer, so I haven't really looked online.",finance,1460295782

I'll try to make this short and to the point.

My wife recently took a new job. The new pay is significantly lower than her previous income. The new job is in government, and has great benefits. Also PERs for retirement that the employer pays.

We're seeing the writing on the wall with regard to our debt/monthly bills. They were maintainable and easy to pay off with the previous job, not so much with the new one.

-Option one is I pay this month, but that means me basically having no money going into next month. It's the simplest, but the riskiest.

-I ask for an installment/extension plan. The IRS site talks a lot about how if I do this I'll also be paying interest on what I owe. How much is that interest and can I afford it? 

-They also suggest that taking out a loan or charging something to credit will often be cheaper, interest rate wise, than just the installment plan. I have never taken out a loan or had a credit card.

-I'm kind of in a tax form frenzy. I've figured out that I should submit my filing on time to avoid that penalty, but everything else is a little up in the air.

I was lucky enough to get my undergraduate degree completely paid for, by an amazing scholarship.  That scholarship give me 3 years of free school, plus a couple thousand dollars, so they are willing to pay for my first of 2 years of grad school.  

I'm starting grad school this fall, and I have $4,000 in Stafford loans (I took them in the first year, to cover our finances until my wife started working as a nurse).  I have been offered $20,000 in Stafford Loans for this coming year, a year that's already paid for by my scholarship.  I'm shocked I was even offered that much, considering our tax return showed we made 95k last year.  I was set to dismiss this loan, but my wife and I started thinking about some of our other debts.  We have a credit card with 11k debt, at an almost 12% rate.  The student loan rate is fixed at 4.29%.  Aside from that, we have a couple of other smaller debts (2k and 1.5k) with high interest, as well.  

The only other thing to consider is that I will need to pay for that 2nd year of grad school (about 9k for the year) somehow.  I'm assuming that I will get another loan offer.  Either way, $9,000 for 2 years of undergrad and 2 years of grad school isn't bad (my 2 years in community college were paid for with grants).  

Would it be wise to take the money I don't need this year, pay off these high interest debts, and lower our interest rates with it?",finance,1460311497

We have about $16,000 in student loan debt (woo hoo), currently earning 0% interest as they are all subsidized. Once he is done in school (Sept 2017) it will be at 6.5%. 

We currently put $600 a month towards those loans.

Additionally, we max out our IRA contributions annually (11,000 each). We have a mix of ROTH &amp; Trad based on tax sheltering needs. 

We are hoping to buy a house in the Cleveland area (max 200k). So my question is this: What is our best approach to saving for a house, retirement AND a downpayment. We are looking to buy summer of 2017.

We currently have about $10,000 to swing around, but I'll be unemployed in T-60 days without stable income in sight :( ** EDIT: I have job prospects and am not entirely worried about earning enough to live- I do not know if I will be able to SAVE extra in the coming year. 

Some options I've thought about:
-Stop student loan repayments, and save that $600 a month towards a house (it'll add up to: $7,200 in 1 year (April 2017) putting our downpayment closer to 17,200. 
-Plan to pull 10k each from our IRAs to help towards downpayment, plus our 10k of savings (closer to 30K, but drains our retirement savings)

I just started working part time at my university library in January at a max of 29 hours/week for $13/hour with no benefits. I'm paid monthly and after taxes, I make roughly around $1300, but some weeks I work less than 29 hours because of school vacations/holidays so my pay varies. Unfortunately, my hours are going to be cut in May because the library will be closing early and doesn't need as many temporary staff members so my paycheck is going to go way down. 

I currently have $500 in my savings for emergencies which I know isn't a lot, but it was what I've been able to save. I've also saved $400 so far to pay part of the interest on my loans and my boyfriend and I saved $113 to pay the car registration in May. I don't have too many expenses since I live with my mom, my younger brother, and my boyfriend but I have been supporting both me and my boyfriend as he also searches for a permanent job (we graduated at the same time): I pay $400/month in rent and I am responsible for buying our own groceries, clothing, medicines, ect (other things we might need). I'm still under my mom's health insurance since I'm 22. I don't have a car and I've been trying to save up for one, but have been having trouble saving on my income while supporting two people.

Last night, my boyfriend's parents offered me a job at their nail salon. I would work for them full-time, be paid $2400/month (not including tips) working six days/week, I could live with them rent free, and they would help me make a down payment on a car so that I wouldn't have to rely on my boyfriend's vehicle. They are really in need of help since two of their staff quit this month and it's just been them and one other worker at the shop. I worked for and lived with them during the summers when I was a student. I enjoyed living with them and although I hated the job, I was making great money and the people I worked with were nice. Plus, working for family has its benefits like the shop being closed so that we could all go on vacation in the summer and being able to leave early when it wasn't busy.

I was hoping to get some advice from this subreddit because I'm not sure what to do. I feel like the offer is too good to pass up especially since I'm losing a lot of hours at my part time job in the summer.

personalfinance,"Renting a second home, is it worth starting a ""business"" to hold the asset?","Hey Personal Finance,

TL:DR, We're considering buying a second home to rent. Should we create an LLC to own the property or own it personally?

My wife and I are considering buying an investment property to rent. We bought a house we live in now in the same neighborhood for $53,000, and it recently appraised for $110,000 after 3 years of weekend renovations. We’re about to remortgage anyway (to drop our 5% interest rate now that our credit is more established), and we only owe $35,000 still on the house. A house recently came on the market for $60,000 in about the same shape as our house, so it seems like another pretty good deal. We’ve got experience renting rooms in our house, and we have a big network of potential renters through people we know in our church.

All those caveats aside, my question is, is there any benefit in creating an LLC or corporation, rather than owning it personally? For at least the first several years, I don’t really plan on making any cash, all the revenue will either go into mortgage, upkeep, or improvements to the property, so I wouldn’t pay much in the way of taxes, but I thought it’d be easier to separate those into a company than to try and keep it all straight within my own finances.

personalfinance,[Investing] Vanguard confusion,"I need someone to explain Vanguard to me. 

Current situation, using Vanguard's terminology for clarification purposes:

Rollover IRA Brokerage account: $2,605.33

This is money from my old employer's 401k that I rolled over to Vanguard when I left that job.

Roth IRA Brokerage account: $732.23

This is money my accountant advised me to invest when we were doing my taxes this year. Because of my low income, I got a lot of this money added back on my return.

When I view my Balances &amp; Holdings overview, it shows the money from the Rollover IRA as being in a Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund, while the Roth IRA money is in a Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund. What's the difference?

What I think I'd like to do is the Target Retirement Fund with a mix of either 80/20 or 90/10 ratio of stocks to bonds to start. Then as I understand it, the ratio goes down over time, getting more conservative as I approach retirement age.

What I'm confused about is how to actually go about doing this. Their website isn't super intuitive to me for some reason (probably overthinking or overlooking something). I've read good things about their customer support, but I want to know exactly what I'm asking for before I call them. I have some social anxiety and don't really like talking to people on the phone, especially if I'm not very confident in what I'm asking them for.

So I guess I'm looking for some reassurance. Do I do the Target Retirement Fund with both accounts or just one? Can somebody walk me through how to do that or should I just call and talk to someone? I do see the option to convert the Rollover IRA account into a Roth IRA; is that something I should be doing or just leave it go? Should I contribute to both accounts equally or just one?

Current financial picture for reference: I'm 26. Last year I quit my miserable retail job under the impression my long-term bf and I would be moving to a different state shortly after. Due to some hospitalizations/deaths in the family, moving got put off until this summer. Ended up making about $19k last year. I have about $16k in an Ally savings account for moving expenses and as a general emergency fund. $2.5k left on my student loan, which I plan to pay off completely after my half of moving expenses are taken care of. No other debt of any kind, but will need to get a car very soon. Not sure if any of that is relevant but might as well give you more info.

personalfinance,$800/month car allowance. How much of it should I actually spend on a car?,"Hey everyone, 

Starting a new job that will give me $800/mo for a car allowance. Whatever I don't spend on a car I can keep. I am trying to decide how much is reasonable to actually spend on a car, and how much I should use to aggressively pay down student loans. 

First, this is a professional sales job, so appearances do matter. I will need to drive something that is functional for taking clients out, and will give a good impression. 

Second, I will have to buy a car. My current car is a 2 seat MT sports coupe that is neither comfortable for the type of driving that I'll be doing, nor appropriate for the context. It is paid off, however. 

Third, my financial picture: ~20k student loan debt @ roughly 5% APR. No credit card debt. Base salary $50k. Mostly manageable expenses (rent, phone, gym, grocery, etc), but roughly $300/mo in medical expenses. $4000 emergency fund. I do not have the money to pay cash for a car, though.

Fourth, paying off my student loans as quickly as possible is my top priority. I also don't like the idea of having a car note, in case I need/want to leave my job.

So, given the above factors, I am trying to determine how much of the $800 I should spend on a car, and how much I should earmark for student loans. I will have to take out an auto loan, as well. 

I am comfortable buying used cars (private party or dealer), so my current inclination is to buy a $10,000-$14,000 used entry level luxury car that should hopefully be low maintenance (Lexus IS250, Acura TL) on a 3 year loan (this comes out to $275-$375/month). Am I potentially overspending here, or is this reasonable? I could also do a shorter loan term and spend more per month to pay it off quickly, but the car loan interest rate will be lower than my student loan interest rate so I'm not sure if that's advisable. 

PHEW! That's a lot of info. I hope some of your wise folks have some words of wisdom for me. I have looked through other 'car allowance' posts, but didn't find anything that pertained to my circumstances too well. Any advice you can offer is much appreciated!",finance,1460319017

My wife and I are considering putting the breaks on our savings in favor of paying off our student loans.

We both max out 401k employer matching benefits, we have no interest in changing this.

We currently have $45k in student loans, 80% which is 6.55% - 8.74%.

We have ~20k in liquid savings earning at ~1% interest.

Our combined salaries gross income is $134k + whatever year end bonuses may come our way. We own a couple businesses, but currently we re-invest at 100%, so we are not counting the potential impact on our personal financials from them at this time.

Our jobs are stable.

We have a baby due in late June, and we have cash set aside to meet our deductible for the birth. 

Our situation is that we have a decent chunk of savings set away, and our student loans eat up around $700/m of our current ""checking account"" money. They are a guaranteed return above the normal stock market and savings account interest rates and are fixed rate loans.

We save at a rate of 25%, so we could potentially put a significant dent into our student debt payments (that 25% would go on top of our existing $700/m payments).

Is this a smart move? Anything we should evaluate that we're not? We're a bit nervous to just straight up stop saving, but feel we're secure enough in our savings to at least attempt the idea of doing so.

months 3-6 contribute to loans at 770/m
6-9 pay all to debt

I am pursuing a degree in Exercise Science(pre-physical therapy) and hope to go to graduate school later to eventually become a PT. I receive about half of my costs paid for by my athletic scholarship, but i set it up so i receive as much money as i can monthly from the athlete support services so none of my tuition is paid for thus i receive about $1100 a month for each month besides the summer months. i did this because i dont want to ask my parents for help paying for rent, food, etc. i also receive about 4.5k in a pell grant each year and my remaining costs for tuition is about 5k. Currently i have just over 14k in student loans and about 1k is savings/emergency fund (i was pretty dumb and didn't save any money my first two years.) My rent is about 500 including utilities and such and i spend about 200 on groceries a month. My parents do help me with cell phone and car insurance but i never ask them for any extra money help because i know they already do as much for me as they can i they have their own finances to take care of. i also have zero credit card debt.

My questions/topics of needed help:
Should i just save my money or start paying off my student loans as quick as i can? my parents always told me to ignore those for awhile since they are low interest rates but a lot of other people/ advice i've seen is that getting rid of it quickly can be extremely beneficial.

My graduate school debt can/ will be very expensive (anywhere from 60k-100k, depending on where i go or get accepted into) but PT's salary on average is around 70k. What is the best way to prepare myself to combat such a daunting loan debt?

Would any type of investing be advisable that i can put money into and sit on over a long time that will help when i get older?(i know this is pretty generic, but i truly have no idea)

I don't have any time to work during the school year since being an athlete is basically a job in itself, but i do work over summer and make a small amount, what would be a good option for my summer income, too apply that to my debt or save up?

for the sub loans i am confused because they are all different interest rates so they will grow at a different rate monthly, thus making it separate groups?

Now, I estimate I'm in need of car repairs in the order of ~$800 (Bald tyres, CV joints need replacing etc), and I've currently put them off too long.

I just finishing paying two overlapping leases, I handled the rent fine, but equipping my new place wiped out my savings (oops).

For context, my credit history is very bland, but I've had my credit card (and haven't ever been more than a couple of days late) for a few years now, and my bank frequently advertises credit limit increases to me.

At this juncture, I'm trying to work out how best to tidy everything up without risking my car suddenly developing a serious problem (it hasn't had a proper service for a _very_ long time), and without piling a heap of expense on.

My current plan, assuming I change nothing, is to keep putting $100/week into savings (until I've got a full fortnight of pay banked up), $50/week on my card, plus an extra $100 on the first of each month (to make sure it registers as a payment). This doesn't account for my car, however, and I could probably put a bit extra away.

I guess I'm here to ask if I should be rearranging that saving structure, whether I should be adding any extra measures, and whether I should consider trying for something like a balance transfer (note: I don't understand these) on the card, to cut down interest costs(?). My bank also offers a card with a ~$20 higher annual fee, but almost a 6% reduction in interest rates, so even if I wasn't trying to play a ""shuffle the balance"" game, that would still be a non-trivial saving.

My current hope is seeing if I can pay a mechanic in two or three instalments, as that would give me a buffer for it being more expensive than expected, but would allow me to get my car seen to ASAP. That would prevent a more costly breakdown, and allow me to focus on the other two issues (building savings, paying off my debt).

Last thing to note is that I'm about to start a new job, so I'll be entering probation again. I don't foresee that being a problem, but it's worth noting.

Any advice about how to optimise my debt burndown would be appreciated!

personalfinance,I just found out that my FICO score is 776. How can I improve it?,"Two suggestions that the credit card company website gave me were - 

1. Proportion of balances to credit limits on bank/national revolving or other revolving accounts is too high

As one of the most important score factors, FICO® Scores evaluate account balances in relation to available credit on revolving accounts. Your score was impacted because your proportion of balances to credit limits on these accounts is too high.

Keep in mind:

People who pay revolving account balances, such as credit cards, as owed tend to show responsible credit behavior to lenders. However, keep in mind that consolidating or moving debt from one account to another will usually not help since the total amount owed remains the same.

2. Lack of recent installment loan information

FICO® Scores consider recent non-mortgage installment loans (such as auto or student loans) information on a person's credit report. Your score was impacted because your credit report shows no recent non-mortgage installment loans or insufficient recent information about your loans.

Keep in mind:

In general, people who purchase with an installment loan, and pay back the loan on time tend to demonstrate the ability to manage a variety of credit types. However, a new account opening, and to a lesser extent the credit inquiry associated with applying for a new account, may demonstrate higher risk in the short term.

Here are some questions I have -

1. What sort of interest rates can I expect based on my score? (I know it probably depends on a lot of factors, but if I would like a ballpark number)

2. How good or bad is my score compared to most people?

3. Based on the suggestions the website gave, should I request an increase in credit? Is there any downside in doing so?

4. Is there any downside in requesting to see your FICO scores?

personalfinance,Attempting to help friend with Financial planning,"Right now I am trying to help a friend get on track financially with all the knowledge I have learned here its been pretty straight forward. She has trouble spending money so I am working with her to get the money out of her hands and do something useful before she can spend it. 

Because of her lack of expenses I am working with her to max 401k contributions to get close to the federal 18k limit. 

My friend makes 65k. After looking at calculator I saw that to get max contribution she should max to 27%. Right now she contributes 10% I have recommended this to her since she has no real official plan other than saving to get a house in the ""near future"". 

I asked for her 401k employer plan and she sent me this. 
http://imgur.com/F8eg9ZG

If I am reading this right it states that the max contribution is 12%. I hope I am reading this wrong. Also If I am reading this right the max contribution from employer is up to 2%? She is currently at 2 years and 20% vesting. Can someone help me explain this to her in simple terms so I seem really smart? Any advice would be great.

Also she is currently in school and since her highest interest debts are school loans I have recommended her to aggressively pay them off before she graduates in a few years before it starts becoming a bill.

I've been told this is a bad idea because I can make more money by investing it in the markets. I agree with this analysis. So then why has it been considered a bad idea for someone to take out a home equity loan on a house which has been paid off to fund investments? It's still a tax deductible mortgage with similar interest rates.

personalfinance,Need advice for handling college expenses.,"This is a little convoluted, but your advice would really be appreciated.


Following high school, I enrolled at my dream college, of which my parents agreed to fund the first year. However, after my freshman year, the expenses were too great to assume myself. I went on inactive status, moved home, and picked up 2 part-time jobs and a full-time courseload at community college as a visiting student.


My routine was exhausting and not gratifying, so the next semester I enlisted in the military (reserves) and spent January-June at basic training and occupational training, which gave me a considerable amount of pay to return to college with, and a happier life. Returning home, I had only two months to settle down before having another month of training, after which I immediately moved back to the university. 


During these two months, my mom announced she was moving out and divorcing my father. My two siblings and I (all similar in age) would stay with him, though he makes about a quarter of my mother's salary. He is a self-employed contractor with lots of expenses, on top of those for our house, related to his business, and couldn't help with tuition. My mother, whose saving abilities are poor, agreed to contribute $1,000/semester for my meal plan, since she was already paying for the family's groceries, but this was just a drop in the bucket of the larger number.


I picked up a weekend campus job pay rent (cheaper than campus housing), and began receiving my small reservist's GI Bill. I paid over $14k out of pocket, earnings from more than a year. I also have decent merit scholarships. I filed the FAFSA, but received less than $10k in aid (max amounts for federal loans and Pell Grant), only $3k more than when my mother contributed to our household income (over $100k/year). There is no way to appeal it for more aid.

I didn't claim to have paid half or more of my year's expenses because while I have provided food, housing, education, and transportation for about 4 months of 2015, I spent an additional six at training, where my needs were met by the Army. I am also not independent since my father still claims me, and I've read that it's not likely I would be granted this legally if there aren't extenuating circumstances.

I tried asking for greater flexibility from the office of the bursar, who notified me I'd be withdrawn due to my outstanding balance. I explained my situation, and how I am solely responsible for my tuition and housing. Unfortunately, there was little they could do, and though I'd covered roughly 80% of the academic year's charges, I was withdrawn, and my spring tuition taken off my bill. The office of the bursar recommended I accept the withdrawal unless significant payments could be made on the remaining $12k.

Honestly, after their lack of empathy, I'd rather transfer schools for next time (after taking more time off, since I cannot afford to go anywhere for this fall-- they've cleaned me out). But in regard to this 2016 spring semester, I'm looking either for resources/tips to help me finance the spring 2016 bill (if possible) so I don't lose my grades, or advice in support of letting spring go and maximizing my potential for aid elsewhere given the circumstances.

Thank you in advance for your help!",finance,1460391168
Bitcoin,First Known Satoshi Nakamoto Sighting,"&gt; This text is presented without attribution to the original author. He may come forward if he wishes so. I did my best to redact the couple of lines that would've easily hinted to his identity.

What the Hack?
 
When the titan Prometheus offered this human the fire, I saw the heat.  I knew that heat would burn away my life.  I loved my life and did not want it burned.  I've lived that life. Now I am left with the debt owed to those that did carry that great burden of fire that I did not accept voluntarily, 11 long years ago
 
I have the years of interest as past due payments to those whose lives were burned instead of mine.  I will always be grateful to those few, the Satoshis.  To start, it is important to explain my perspective on the matter before us.
 
I do not want the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto to become known against his consent.  This would be wrong, and a personal betrayal of a confidential conversation, and would bad for bitcoin.  Individual personalities are dissected in the media, and dehumanized.  The media will make much ado about all of the personal trivia information and exploit every human flaw.  Issues such as who they are dating, what kind of underwear they prefer, and all manner of nonsense would detract from the work that is done and to be done yet.  A legend is greater than any human can be and revealing identity can only damage the project.
 
He is who he is.  He is a zen warrior, a samurai for truth, yet some truths die.  As a human he may be more like a Tesla than Jobs or Musk, he is seen as a heretic in his time, and likely as a genius by any standards of the future.  Like Newton, I hope he will live long enough to see that future and be recognized for his genius, if I have anything to do about it.
 
However, as a servant of the truth, this event must be recorded...
 
I've been attending the Netherlands quadrennial hacking conferences since HIP97. 
 
In between speeches at the 2005 ""What the Hack"" event during a rare period without much rain, I went out to grab a free toastie which were given out with a free anonymous domain registration at a path-side cart at this hacker festival in Liempde.  I had been putting my video camera to use grabbing some random shots of the tents, the environment, the people.
 
Whilst doing this I noticed what looked like an interesting conversation in progress, between a few people and I thought of joining but it seemed to be winding down so I took a few shots of the group.  After they finished talking one of the group walked up to me, he did not appear to have known the others to whom he was talking.  He was a dark-haired man with a backpack, probably a graduate student as he was too old to be undergraduate.  We struck up a conversation.
 
We greeted each other and he asked in a sort of casual but no-nonsense manner if I had been to one of these conferences before.  He hadn't and was looking to find his way to what he would find interesting.  I was happy to help since I had been to 2 of them previously in the Netherlands and was familiar with the way these unconferences worked, so I told him how in 1997 I came on what was our honeymoon, and I shared the story of my online marriage with a little bit of pride.  I had also been at the HAL 2001 conference and I mentioned my work on the electric car leading up to that.  He asked what I did and I told him of my work for Infonet and then the acquisition by BT.  He asked If I would like to hear what he was working on and of course I thought I should listen to what he had to say.
 
His stature and soft but confidant voice was both kind and authoritative and he used a sort of Socratic method to find the level at which we could communicate the technical aspects of what he about to describe.  Though he seemed a little younger than I was, he had a depth of knowledge about his field that I recognized as characteristic of someone with a deep interest in the subject matter.  I assessed that he was probably a graduate student or post doc somewhere because of the backpack and attire, his speaking was the polished and directly precise speech characteristic of intelligent people, and the notebook he pulled from the backpack was of the sort you might find in a university, though not one in the USA.  He struck me as a researcher of some sort.   He spoke calmly with confidence and excellent accented English.  He seemed continental in his style, but not entirely comfortable, and he had the UK diction but there was another accent beneath that, not British but similar. 
 
As we were talking the sun was a bit hot and while there was a breeze, the direct sunlight can be punishing and as there was little shade to be had, I made it my practice to stand in the sunshine so that my hat would provide some shadow for his head.  Given the time of day and the season and location I could very likely determine his exact height if I were inclined to do so.  It seemed a bit of a trade off for him, standing in the shade of my hat put me within his personal space and I could feel a bit of tension as if he wanted to step back to a more comfortable distance for him, but would then be looking into the sun.  After a few such encroachments, he chose the comfort of the shade my head provided over the discomfort of standing in close proximity.  I noticed that his personal space and talking comfort range was quite a bit larger than my own.
 
He began the discussion by pointing out that credit cards were designed before the internet and that they were in need of an update or replacement for use on the internet, and that they are not well suited at all for this purpose.  The main change that he thought was needed was removing the counter-parties and the 3rd party trust required by making the money source distributed, and peer-to-peer, and with his solution many other benefits may follow. 
 
He mentioned that these sorts of applications were very resilient and difficult to stop citing the differences between Napster, and Gnutella and TOR.  This had my attention.  I was familiar with of other projects using a similar method to secure messaging, where the message parts were broken up and distributed, and I mentioned this to him along with citing my background in messaging, and he said it was nothing like that really, and he continued on with his questions of my understanding of the basic principles.  He did not quite interrupt me, but he was clearly eager to discuss his project without too much interruption.  I saw that he knew that I was following and interested, but that he was going to have to explain the elements to me.
 
He asked if I knew any cryptography, and I admitted that I did know a good bit about it.  He then asked if I knew about elliptic curve cryptography and I responded that I was familiar with it such as its use in PGP but would like to hear how he was applying it.  He took this as a clue to launched into a brief description of elliptic curve cryptography fundamentals and he displayed a very good understanding of not just how it worked but also what it could do, as though he had lectured on the subject.  I chimed in with acknowledgment of understanding and some of the underpinning mathematics so as to let him know that we could skip the mathematics lecture. 
 
I mentioned that I'd worked with some noteworthy cryptographers in the US, and he said “Oh you are from the United States, then you know of the Liberty Dollar?”, I told him that I didn’t and he said that it was an alternate currency based on precious metals, which reminded me that I had read something about it in one of my coin journals and that I might even have a piece or two.  I wanted to bring that up, but I could tell he wanted to get back to talking about his project, and I also wanted to hear more about that so we moved on.
 
Then he asked me if I had ever heard of a block chain, I said yes, thinking that he meant block cypher.  He didn’t seem to believe that I was and so he started describing it, and at that point I admitted my confusing the term and that I had never heard of this.  He then went into a fairly detailed description of the way a hashing algorithm could be used to add information to a continuously growing append only file by hashing the new block along with the hash of the old block, and how that this could be done competitively in a distributed fashion creating a proof-of-work method so that whichever system found the best hash would send this out to all the others, and that this was a proposed solution to the Byzantine General problem which he also described to me.  He started talking about Merkle trees and hashing but only briefly as he could see that my mind was moving on to the greater implications of what he was working on.  It was potentially disruptive on a massive scale.  It could change and improve just about everything in human interaction on the internet. 
 
By this time I'd realized that I wasn’t talking to a random kook but a genius, and one who had thought this through in some great detail, and that this was pretty seriously interesting stuff.  What he was working on was truly amazingly revolutionary and I started to get a bit animated, and excited.  I asked him if he realized how incredible this was and the impact it would have on the world.  I was very much excited at this point.  He kept his demeanor more calm than mine but there was a bit of a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye as he could see the effect he was having on me as the implications were becoming more and more clear.
 
He went on to explain that the currency could be awarded to the people running these servers that were doing the calculations to create the block chain and that this could be distributed among them over years.  He suggested that it be on decreasing amounts over time by halves and so would asymptotically be limited.  This would provide a finite cap on the amount of inflation but which it would approach in ever smaller increments over time.  This schedule would be a part of the code and that it would not be changeable without leaving the group of those doing the calculations and being off the chain and on a new one.
 
These rewards to those calculating the blocks would be sent to a public key associated with the private key of the elliptic curve cryptographic method.  These coins (he called them “coins, for lack of a better word”) could be sent to anyone and exchanged and that these transactions would be reported to the servers securing the block chain.
 
I was pretty blown away by this.  I told him that I thought that this was incredible and revolutionary and that I thought that the libertarians would love it, and that the federal reserve and central banks were going to hate it.  He gave a bit of a smile at this but said nothing about that at all.  He asked me who the libertarians were, and I explained that they are a political group in the US that seeks to limit government.  I thought at the time that this guy was pretty reserved because he was very clearly enjoying my excitement but not getting very emotional about it otherwise.
 
I asked some high level questions of him to get a sense of the scope of the project and his depth of work on it, for example would this be able to be GAAP compliant and he responded that those would be possible but would be outside the protocol.  The protocol was for the money itself, and such things as compliance regimes would change and in order to avoid any need for the protocol to do so additional software could be written to interface with any of the various standards.  I agreed and then mentioned a few other standards and how our company (Infonet and BT) was global and sympathized with the many standards across the various geographies.  It made sense, and I was impressed by the depth of thinking and analysis of what he had designed.  Furthermore I recognized that he had all the fundamental pieces that could lead this to completion without getting wrapped up in scope creep or distractions.  This was not an idle endeavor; this was a worthy project indeed.
 
He told me that he was looking a programmer to help with writing the code for the client software and asked me if I would do so.  I felt that this was a weighty decision, and although I greatly wanted to help and be a part of this, there are others that could do a better job of coding it, or even better that he could learn the coding needed to get it to a test phase himself. Since he was familiar with C I recommended Visual C and for him to do it.  
 
He looked a bit surprised at this because by the things I was saying to him this project was clearly very much something that provoked passion in my mind and was an effort close to my heart, so he asked me why I wouldn't help him at that time.  I told him that my company had just gone through a merger, but more importantly I had a young child and family and would certainly need to protect them.  This would be the sort of thing where I would have to work separately and secretly and would not want to expose them.  I told him that I could not do 'what he is doing' referring to the extreme privacy he was keeping in the discussion.  I was revealing quite a lot about myself, and he took great pains to reveal nothing about himself.  He could not know that I was a trained observer and how much I could glean from the short time we were together.
 
That seemed to make sense to him and he asked if I knew where he might find folks that would work on it.  The project was also right down the ally of a group that I had been involved with and was reading and watching called the Cypherpunks and that there were some of them at the conference, including some of the founders.  I had seen a tent of theirs earlier and pointed the way toward it.  He asked what the cypherpunks were.  I told him that the cypherpunks are programmers, but not just programmers, they were particularly very well suited to work on this sort of thing.  Privacy and automating the modes of authority, relegating these to mathematics rather than central authorities.  I hoped that he would discover someone better suited than I for what he needed.  I understood the stakes, and the requirements for a ""Randian hero"", unattached to personal social encumberances. The radical individualism was not something I could accomplish without sacrificing my marriage and family or they would be endangered.  My life situation would not permit me to put those most close to me at risk.  Someone better must and would be found...
 
As he turned to walk away, I called to him and said,  ""Wait, I would like very much like to work on this later, when the project has progressed more.  How would I be able to find it?  What is the project called?""  
He paused.
 
This seemed to trigger a thought in his head, which appeared to me as a trust evaluation and though was clear to me that he had a project name in mind, but that he was reluctant to say it.  This man was clearly good at keeping secret things secret and I respected that quite a lot.  I am no stranger to getting people to reveal their secrets, but I wasn’t going to let him go away without something to use as a referent.  How else would I be able to fulfill my promised involvement.  I surmised that possibly domains hadn’t been registered or something and he didn’t want to say.  I then asked him if I could take the paper he had drawn the diagrams of the block chain and the mining network, and he said no so I asked if I could take pictures of it and he again said no.  So I asked him how I would know his project from other similar efforts, and that is when he told me to look for him, Satoshi Nakamoto.  I had never heard this before (and indeed, perhaps no one had in 2005) and it seemed not to match at all with the person to whom I was speaking so I asked him to repeat it, which he did - Satoshi Nakamoto.
 
At that point I let him walk away, across the hard packed and recently dried dirt and sprouts of grass struggling to take back the terrain.  I thought about taking a few more pictures of him as he walked away to help me remember something that felt momentous.  Instead I returned to my campsite and wrote down what I remembered of the conversation including the name on the bottom of the paper, Satoshi Nakamoto, as well as what I could reproduce of what he had drawn on his notebook paper, the diagram of the block chain, Merkle tree, fees to miners, miner reward halving, finite coins, and mining network.
 
I realized that with what I knew, from the system and method architecture that he had described to me, that I could then have done the project independently, but I was confidant that a better path was ahead for me, and that my time to be helpful would come later.
 
I would like to think that my encouragement and what little advice and feedback I gave in those early days were helpful and meaningful to him, and that I played some small early role in making what was eventually to become Bitcoin come to fruition.

My understanding of the annual percentage rate (APR) is a broader measure of the cost to you of borrowing money. The APR reflects not only the interest rate but also the points, mortgage broker fees, and other charges that you have to pay to get the loan. For that reason, your APR is usually higher than your interest rate.

Market Overlook 4/11 - 4/15/2016

&amp;nbsp;

This week the S&amp;P 500 and the overall markets are resting inside of a three week consolidation. With the large number of recent Fed meetings as well as more upcoming meetings, it seems the markets are being pulled in both directions. The S&amp;P has hit highs of 2,075 and until it can break the 2,080 level it is still in an overall bearish trend. The key for this rally to turn into a reversal is for 2,072-75 to become support instead of resistance. From there the markets will be able to move forward.
April markets are in full swing and I expecting to see normal to higher than average volume in the coming weeks as building excitement into earnings season. This season we should expect a number of disappointments around the market with a few key exceptions. Retail is an area with a number of overbought stocks that are just asking for reality checks.
We were treated to a number of Fed talks last week, and as usual, nothing happened.The Fed was not very aggressive at all. In fact, they expect less growth and inflation. The Fed still projects for there to be two rate hikes in 2016. I belief and have for sometime that the Fed has far less effect on the market than they believe they do.  When you consider the only interest rate they actually have access to is the Fed Funds rate, which is exceptionally short term, it’s pretty interesting that they feel they can influence 30 year deliverables with their inaction.  The actual market reaction to Fed leader Yellen shows any market sentiment changes caused by a “Fed Talk"" is temporary.  These can provide some exceptional opportunities for nimble traders to profit from these market extremes.  I hope any Fed news this week causes just as much two-sided action as always.

&amp;nbsp;

This is my short list on things I am following and watching for in the week ahead.

&amp;nbsp;

SPX http://imgur.com/WjcIYFw

&amp;nbsp;

For SPX I think we are seeing a few critical things here. The very first is that the market is still in a bearish trend overall. Which is odd given the last few weeks. But since the all time highs we have seen lower high patterns and despite this recent run up we came up short. Market can’t seem to break the 2,080 levels continuing the bearish pattern. If you look closely we also have an overall lower lows pattern as well. We have not retraced that much so I would not call it a break just yet. The technical analysis here is pretty neutral as well. We have a lot of conflicting indicators. The first thing that looks bullish is the moving averages, In the chart you can see we have the 10 (green) and the 20 (orange) above the 200 SMA (dark blue). In addition the 50 (red) is really curling up now. What sets me off about the moving averages are that the 100 SMA (light blue) is still below the 200 SMA (dark blue). If you look back there has not been one sustained rally since the 100 SMA broke under the 200 SMA. If we also look at some of the indicators they are not looking that great either. The MACD is sloping down however, it is still above the 0 line and still has some decent divergence. The stochRSI is looking bearish. While it is oversold and can move to overbought, most decline will remain oversold for several days, so until it crosses above the 20 line, it is bearish. For SPX we need to look for two key areas for support at resistance. Look for support at the 200 SMA and resistance at 2,080.

&amp;nbsp;

Here are a few things I’ve seen from a Tech analysis in Commodities.

&amp;nbsp;

Up first Oil /CL http://imgur.com/gqk3Gs7

&amp;nbsp;

From a technical analysis standpoint, oil is looking decently bullish overall.(FA on oil says we should be at $30 a barrel, but as traders/investors we play what the market is telling us and its clear the market wants oil above $36 for now…)If you look at the MACD is moving to cross above the 0 line and the stochRSI is moving up bullishly. It's moving to pass the 80 line where it would be able to really breakout. Oil was obviously in a massive downtrend and I am not calling a bottom. The upside I do think however is limited and a bigger short opportunity may be presenting itself. If we look closely, oil has been getting rejected at the 200 SMA (dark blue lines, circled area) all year long. It hasn't been able to break at all and was even rejected quite recently. With the bullish indicators it looks like a test for the 200 SMA is quite possible. Just keep in mind there really isn't anything fundamentally bullish about oil, it just looks good on a TA level.

Up next /NG: http://imgur.com/wnoksut

&amp;nbsp;

Natural Gas has been in a long uptrend and is looking quite bullish. It has been a ""buy the dip"" type of commodity lately. There are a few bullish things to notice here. The first is that the fast moving averages are all trending up. The 10 SMA (green) crossed the 20 SMA (orange) and just crosses the 50 SMA (red). The 20 SMA is heading towards the 50 right now as well. In addition, all three of those moving averages are sloping up and are heading for the 100 SMA (light blue). The MACD is well above the 0 line along with the fast MA above the slow MA. The stochRSI is also still quite bullish. It is heading for overbought which could let allow for it to come down to oversold but if you look back, all of its biggest runs are while its overbought.

&amp;nbsp;

While /NG is looking quite bullish I do have one significant concern. The main area of concern is the circled area. If you look closely, the setup is extremely similar. In the previous setup, the 10 crossed the 20, and then later crossed the 50. The 20 was heading for the 50 and then ended up breaking it; however, it was rejected quick and made new lows.

&amp;nbsp;

The chart is showing that we are now in a very similar setup as we are approaching the 100 SMA (light blue). It was previously broken but came down very quick and was rejected the next time it was faced. In addition, /NG is currently in a wedging pattern. You can see the movement is narrowing down and an outbreak is due soon. With all this adding up, it makes sense that NG would be in an outbreak pattern. Breaking the 100 SMA will be crucial to continue the trend up; otherwise, expect some decent movement to the downside. (Don’t forget warmer weather is on its way and could/will affect  /NG)

&amp;nbsp;

Last but not least that shiny stuff...Gold /GC http://imgur.com/SY7dvD5

&amp;nbsp;

From a technical analysis standpoint, gold is looking bullish here as well. There are a lot of bearish bets being placed on gold and gold miners; however, it has been showing strong support and has not broken support since the recent run-up. Not only that, we also have every single moving average now above the 200 SMA which is very bullish. In addition, we have recently had a wedge pattern break. There was a lot of downward pressure to the support but it had a big breakout towards the upside out of the wedge. With the MACD above the zero line and the stochRSI trending bullish, it looks like gold wants to run on this breakout. If it can bounce off the support of the breakout area it could start to make some real moves towards the 52 week highs. Gold seems to be potentially channeling so do not expect new 52 week highs without some sort of a catalyst. I also think gold is being helped by a overall “mood” of uncertainty still.

Things to look for  in the week 4/11 - 4/15/2016
This week the biggest thing to look for is whatever comes out of the closed door Fed meeting. This was an unexpected meeting they say is under ""Expedited Procedures”. This meeting is going to be on Monday and they will be discussing rates. No conclusions can be drawn from this per se; and for reference, the last time this occurred the rates were raised roughly one month later.

April expiration is two weeks away. It’s time to think about rolling your short options to the next cycle in May to collect some more premium and reduce your delta risk.   Volatility has made a bit of a comeback as of Friday, but it’s more of a rumor at this point compared to the all-star stage-show it will be when it really comes back to play. And as a derivatives trader I have but one thing to say...Long live Volatility!! Bring me back to the promise land!",finance,1460396306

personalfinance,Student Loans - Refinance or Home Equity?,"I'm due to graduate in little over a year, with ~130k in student loans (majority of it consisting of fed unsub loans, some grad plus). I was wondering if anyone had any advice or comments about whether or not I should go with refinancing my student loans or go with a home equity instead.

I understand that a home equity would be somewhat more risky since my home would be put up as collateral, but are there any advantages to going on this route vs. refinancing through a private lender? I currently don't have a job, but I do expect to get a job offer or two lined up before I graduate.",finance,1460397367
personalfinance,"$32k in student loans, about to start med school, and in need of a car. What to do?","Hey personalfinance. Trying to figure out my financial situation and am in need of some advice since I know next to nothing about money. As you can see from the title, I owe $32k towards student debt because of grad school, which I'm about to graduate in May. I was accepted to medical school and will be beginning that in August. I was also fortunate to have received the military scholarship so all my tuition for medical school will be covered. With that scholarship, I'll be receiving a $15k signing bonus (after taxes) towards the end of summer. In addition to the signing bonus, I'll be receiving a $2k stipend (after tax) every month while I'm in school for the next four years. 

Since getting accepted to medical school, I've been eyeballing a used 2008 Toyota Camry ($9k with 90k miles) for the past few months. I need something that will last me for at least the next 8 years of my life if not longer and I know that Camry's are extremely reliable cars.

Here's a summary of current financial situation:  
1) $31,800 in student debt:   
** $20,500 Direct Unsub Stafford Loan at 6.21% interest rate.  
** $5,000 Direct Student Plus Loan at 7.21% interest rate.  
** $6,300 Direct Student Plus Loan at 6.84% interest rate.  
2) My credit score is 750. I guess that's a good score? I've only had a short history of about 2-3 years though so I'm not sure how that impacts my situation.   
3) Will be receiving $15,000 at the end of summer from scholarship money and will be receiving a $2,000 stipend every month while in school.  
4) Eyeballing a used Toyota Camry that's $9,000 - might be possible for me to haggle it down to $8,000.  

My question to y'all is this: Is it feasible for me to make a move on this used Camry? I'm currently driving a family car, but I'd like to send it back to my parents for their use since one of our family vehicles was recently totaled. I just started looking into getting an auto loan through a bank, but I know next to nothing about them. Still digging through the internet to find more information. 

Can I afford this car or can't I? Would it be wiser for me to pass it up and pay off my student loans from grad school as quickly as possible? I'm not going to owe any student loans for medical school because of my scholarship. Because I'll be in school full time I can potentially defer my loans for the next four years, but I'll still be accruing interest.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",finance,1460397620
personalfinance,"I'm 36, have been awful at managing my finances all my life, and now I'm in trouble. Advice requested.","This might be a bit longish, so please bear with me.

I'm a 36-year-old male. I have been going through my entire adult life getting bailed out by my parents when I needed it. They have fully covered my comfortable living expenses as I worked to complete my undergraduate degrees, and both parents (now divorced) have made it clear that the money gets cut off when I graduate next month. I cover my tuition myself through student loans. Yes, I know I am very lucky to have this situation, and I hope you don't judge me for it.

I have actively tried to curtail my expenses and clean up my financial situation in anticipation of this. I have never really kept a budget (was never taught how) and no savings (other than a small retirement account). Now, as graduation nears, I did the math and see that I am about $2500 in debt for various bills which must be paid by the end of the month. I will be receiving $1,332 on the 15th and $500 on the 30th. 

My credit report is mostly clean, but short. My FICO score is 587/570.  I am waiting on one dispute to be resolved before I apply for a credit card. I have lived almost my entire life on cash only, but that is starting to become unsustainable.

I don't want to ask my parents for the $2500. They have paid enough and it is entirely my fault for not managing my money properly.

I could drain my retirement account, but the government would get about 50% of it, so that's not really an option. Plus, at my age, I should have *something* in retirement.

Does anyone have any advice whatsoever? I am willing to take a loan for the $2500, but with my poor credit score and what the loan is needed for, I doubt I would get anything that doesn't have an appalling interest rate. Help?

TL;DR: 36 y.o. male. Badly managed my funds all my life. $2500 needs to be paid by the end of the month. Poor credit, no savings. Requesting advice.",finance,1460398120
personalfinance,About to take on more debt for law school than expected--how should I proceed?,"I am currently set to attend Berkeley Law School this August, and have always known that I could expect to accrue a large amount of debt doing so. Because I am under 30, my parents' info must be included in my FAFSA (I'm unsure if this is standard practice or a UC/California thing, so forgive my ignorance). Together, my parents make 6 figures. My mother was also unexpectedly laid off in 2015, resulting in a large severance package that blew out my chances of getting much federal financial aid. My parents have made it clear that they will NOT be assisting me in paying for law school. 

I recently learned that not only am I receiving NO gift aid from Berkeley, but the estimated cost of attending is much higher than I expected, as well: quoted at $83,160 for the 2016-2017 academic year alone. Thus, barring me being granted California residency for in-state tuition for 2L and 3L (which I'm told is not impossible, but difficult), I'm looking down the barrel of nearly $250,000 in student loans. While I'm open to exploring my options, I'm not particularly interested in public service, which I understand is the basis behind most universities' loan forgiveness programs. 

I'm interested in pursuing patent law, and have long wanted to attend Berkeley, as it is the #1 ranked law school for it. Back when I was initially applying to law schools (now nearly 2 years ago), I was also considering George Washington University, which is overall a less prestigious law school, but still houses a strong IP law program. They originally offered me a substantial scholarship, leaving me on the hook for ~$70,000 total. I know that pedigree comes into play quite a bit in the job search for law school grads, but I'm having a hard time gauging how my professional opportunities might stack up against saving myself from such a significant amount of debt. 

Am I wrong in thinking that $250,000 is a crazy amount of debt to take on here (especially considering that my interests COULD very well change once I find myself in an actual law school classroom)? Would it be financially irresponsible to attend Berkeley with these numbers, when I could still attend a decent law school for a fraction of the price? Is the sticker price of the #1 ranked program worth that large an investment, when the law school as a whole isn't T5? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1460401816
personalfinance,My DOB on file with the IRS was incorrect. Can I use the incorrect DOB to e-file my taxes?,"This should be a quick question for someone who knows what they're talking about. I e-filed my taxes with TurboTax about 3 weeks ago. The IRS rejected the e-file based on my DOB. I went down to the SSA and corrected the DOB with them. I waited a week to refile and it was rejected again. My question is, can I simply use the old DOB that the IRS has on file? I was able to use the incorrect DOB to get my filing PIN just now, so it must still be on file. TurboTax suggests that I snail mail the paperwork, but also says that New York State requires state taxes to be submitted electronically if it was prepared though tax software. Basically just want to get this all wrapped up. Thanks!!

UPDATE: I got impatient and decided to e-file with the old DOB. If I do not get an answer on this I will at least update to say if it went through or not.

UPDATE: Federal and State were rejected on DOB :(. I'm assuming that they did in fact correct my DOB in their system at this point, but still have my PIN attached to my old DOB. Used the old DOB to obtain my PIN and resubmitted the return using my correct DOB. Federal was accepted! Still waiting on State return to be accepted or reject... will update when that happens or when a SWAT team shows up and I am arrested for tax fraud (allegedly), so either way.",finance,1460402062

I have all intentions of using all the money to pay down my debt one way or another.

personalfinance,Was wondering if I can get some general help on my student loan situation. I don't really have anyone to go to.,"I would just really appreciate some feedback from some people who are seasoned in this discussion. My mother, who I usually go to with questions like these, passed away in October. My dad unfortunately isn't very knowledgeable.

I am a 22 year old. I went to 3 years of community college, from 2011 to 2014, and graduated with an Associate's Degree. I have four federal student loans owed right now, in the amounts of 6.5k, 4k, 3k, and 500 dollars a piece. For some reason there are no loans for 2012, but whatever. I never applied for any scholarships or whatnot to lower the loan costs.

Anyways, my loans are governed by Navient and my APR is 19.99%. (Yes, I know, 20%! It's unusally high and I don't know why!) I've called them before to lower my monthly payment to $90 a month. My mom battled terminal cancer for a couple years so I got stuck at a minimum wage job. A career wasn't important at the time, not to mention I still have no idea what the hell I want to do. So at $90 a month and 20% APR, the total amount of 14,000 never goes down.

So here I am now. My mom's life insurance gave me $20,500 to add to my $6,000 saved up. I've been holding on to the money, but figured I should pay some loans. I wanted to pay off 2 or 3 of them and continue to pay off the $6,500 monthly. But now on to my questions.

Would there currently be any way at all for me to get the loan amounts lowered? Or lower the APR? By applying for anything federal or whatnot? I figured I should find that out before I pay them in case I can save some money. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I noticed I could apply to make a federal loan into a private loan. My credit is good and think I'd have no problem. I just read some comments in a post saying its a bad idea, though. But the APR is significantly less. The monthly payments are only $10 more. And I have the money and would still pay off 2 or 3 of them off immediately. Would you recommend doing this? Is it a no-brainer? Thank you so much for taking the time to read, sorry its a bit long.",finance,1460403039

personalfinance,"Should I [28M, no dependents] keep my variable comp. life insurance policy?","Good afternoon, folks! This is my first post to PF, but I've found this community to be very helpful, so I thought I might trouble the hive mind for some perspective.

I have a few quick questions regarding a variable comp. life insurance that was taken out on my behalf about 16 year ago by my grandfather. Before I get into the question, here's the policy information:

Insurance Policy
- ~$505M total death benefit
- ~$3.1M annual premiums (currently reduced to ~$2.5M after the dividends from the total cash value are factored in)
- ~$44M in total cash value
- ~$19M in a loan against that total cash value @ 5% simple
- ~$25M net surrender value
- ~$355 in taxable income if surrendered
- The beneficiaries are my two younger, less well off sisters

So, this policy was taken out against my life back in 2000 by my late grandfather, who was initially paying the premiums while he was still alive. I've been told that it was he's way of supporting his (potential) future grandchildren, which was a sweet gesture by an amazing man. Fast forward to today, when I foggily remembered that the policy exists, reached out to the insurance company (Northwestern Mutual), and asked for updated details on the policy (see above).

As it turns out, I have not been contributing to the policy, which is why I didn't remember the policy was in place until I started to actively think about it. The insurance company has been paying the annual premiums by borrowing against the total cash value (hence the loan) for the last 5 - 7 years.

Personal Financial Background:

I am 28, employed in a very stable job that carries with it a good salary (~$75M) and annual, performance-linked bonus that have ranged from $50M - $75M. I own a condo in my East Coast city with minimal debt, have an emergency fund that likely is over-funded, and have healthy retirement / investment accounts (Roth, 401(k), taxable brokerage). 

Given that context, my questions are as follows:

1. Should I keep this insurance policy, or surrender it?

2. Assuming I decide to keep the policy, I should definitely re-pay the loan and save on the 5% interest rate in a non-taxed account, right?

3. Assuming I decide to keep the policy, am I better off using the dividends to reduce the premium or reinvest that?

4. I don't have any plans to have children in the immediate future, but that might change in the next few years, and I am assuming that if I were to cancel this policy and take out a similar policy in the future, the annual premiums would be considerably higher - is that an accurate assessment?

5. Other than the cash pay-out, which I obviously won't benefit from, it appears that there is ~$44M in cash value that is invested, tax free. Other than through growth, will this ever increase? Does any portion of the premium get contributed, or is that 100% due to Northwestern for the eventual payout?

The insurance agent (who knew my grandfather well) seems like a nice, honorable guy, but I could use an outsider's perspective. Thanks in advance, internet strangers!",finance,1460404156

personalfinance,Stopping 401k contributions to build up emergency fund + pay off debt,"So I just read the the [""How to spend your money"" flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4e8n3n/how_to_spend_your_money_the_flow_chart/) and I've decided to re-evaluate how we're currently putting money away and trying to pay stuff off. I feel like we've been way too lax about it, and on top of the we just got hit with $5k of medical expenses which drained our savings. Honestly I had a freak out moment, which I think is good bc it made me realize we need to do something different. This may be long but I'll just lay out our situation:

My wife and I make roughly 145k / year. We have 3 kids, 1 of which is in daycare for another year. I would say our jobs are very stable overall, her's more so than mine but she makes a lot less. I have been contributing $470 a month towards our 401k even though my company doesn't really match. I thought this was a good idea because it reduced our taxable income, but it seems like it makes more sense to use it to build up our savings for emergencies, and then pay off debt after. I am REALLY tired of being in debt and feeling like all of our money is tied up, despite making a good bit.


Debt: Car loans ($30k), student loans ($15k), and an old credit card ($5k).  Also have a home loan ($325k). The interest rate on each is very low, 1.5% on car notes, 4% on student loans/credit card, and 4.25% on house note.


I have maybe $8k in my 401k (started late unfortunately, and she has retirement through state), $1.5k in savings since being drained, and not much extra in checking.


Our monthly expenses are around $7k, which we're really trying to get down by being smarter about our grocery bills (currently $200-250 / week) and eating out ($60 / week). 


So I guess my questions are: 1) Is it a good idea to stop the 401k contributions to save up? 2) If so how much of an emergency fund to I need to build back up? 3) My wife's job is super stable so her check will always be there, so I am thinking monthly expenses minus her check which is $4500, times 3 months? 4) Can the money in my $401k count towards any of this?


Thanks for listening to my rambling.",finance,1460406860

personalfinance,How to choose the best credit card for me?,"I've been using the same credit card for the last 17 years - United Mileage Plus. (And don't worry - I pay it off in full every month, so I've never paid them a penny in interest.) I got it when I was living on the East Coast, where United is fairly dominant, but I've been living on the West Coast for many years now, so I wanted to get a card with Alaska Airlines miles.

I also run my own small business (very small - I'm the sole employee of my LLC) so I get credit card offers all the time for things like American Express Business Platinum Card and many others. (I get my homeowner's and car insurance through USAA, so they're also sending me credit card offers all the time too.) I kind of liked the AmEx Business Platinum, since it would give me access to frequent flyer perks like airline lounges, early boarding, etc.

It's a hassle to look through all of the Ts &amp; Cs of the different cards. What would you recommend for someone like me? Again, to recap:

* Upper middle class income
* Have a sole proprietor business (legally set up as an LLC)
* Use credit cards for virtually all purchases (business and personal) and pay it off in full each month
* Fly predominantly Alaska Airlines, but also others
* Travel internationally a couple times a year
* I don't plan on needing to take out any loans anytime soon. I have a fixed rate mortgage with a low interest rate, don't plan on getting a car soon, and otherwise just don't worry much about my credit score. (Which I believe is high but I haven't checked in a while.)

Trying to think if there's any other relevant information that would be helpful. If I've missed anything, let me know!

personalfinance,Complex student loan repayment question (Defaulted awhile ago but back on track).,"**Backstory:**

I graduated college in 2006 with 290K in student loan debt (Private school, 6 years, B.S. Engineering degree, 0 financial aid for 4 years) and didn’t get a “real job” (making more than min. wage) until mid 2009. By this time I had already defaulted on all of my student loans and the struggle began to get them back under control. In 2009 I started making decent money (80k+ / year) and since then I have doubled that amount. 10 years after graduation I’m making 127K + bonuses, last year clearing 169K on my W2.


**Current situation:**

As soon as I got financially stable in 2009/10 I started calling up my student loan companies and making payment arrangements and I haven’t missed any payments in the past 6 years but I am just treading water and not making much progress on some loans since a few were kicked into high interest mode by my defaulting. Aside from upping my interest rates and killing my credit for several years defaulting did have one bright spot for me. My biggest loan, which was at 169K when I started paying on it back in 2010 got dropped down to .001% interest with a 1K a month payment until paid off. Defaulting sucked but I think this saved me a ton of money. On top of that insanely low interest rate, the company gave me a full settlement offer of 51K on the remaining 137K last time I spoke to them (37% on the dollar), with an option to counter that with a lower offer.

Here is where my question really begins. I’m trying to figure out the quickest / most cost effective way to go about paying off my remaining loan balances and one of those option is to take out a low interest rate personal loan of 40K, and use that money to either pay off my higher interest rate loans or make an offer of 40K on my remaining 125K balance of my low interest rate loan. I have gotten several “Pre-approved” personal loan offers so I am assuming I can get one but my credit isn’t great, so my interest rate may be fairly high which I understand would defeat the point of taking out this loan all together. Part of my question is figuring out if I should bother borrowing anything at all and at what interest rate borrowing money to pay off these balances, becomes a bad idea. My current assumption is anything lower than 10% is good based on the loan breakdown below. Is this assumption correct?

Here is the breakdown of my loans / current payment. Note I live in an expensive area (San Diego) and I could only reasonably afford to pay an extra $200-400 bucks a month tops towards these loans and still maintain my lifestyle (which isn’t glamorous but isn’t bad either). I currently have 6K in my emergency fund and I contribute 6% of my income to my employer matched 401K (max employer match).


**Loan breakdown:**

1) $287/month@12.185% | Bal: $12,182 | 4/11/16 | Payoff in 56 months at current payment

2) $250/month@10% | Bal: $27,400 | 4/11/15 | Payoff in 22 years (lol..cry..lol) at current payment (only $9/month going towards principle…This is obviously a huge problem)

3) $221/month@3.875% | Bal: $37244 | 4/11/16 

4) $1000/month@.001%| Bal: $125K (Settlement of $51K offered when loan was at $137K) with option to counter amount which means they are willing to take less than 37% of the loan

**Total $1758/month | Approx: $202K left to pay** (I could afford to bump this up to 2k/month and still be comfortable)


**Plan Going forward???**

With that in mind I have a few options I’m mulling over (would love to hear more options if anyone has any):
1) Use the $40K personal loan to pay off my loan #4, saving $85K up front on settlement offer means saving = Approx: $36-41K by the time the 40k is paid off.
     Assumptions:
     This assumes that I can get this loan at a decent rate with my 680ish credit score
     This assumes they accept the offer which I think they will (they may counter with $45k or something similar based on their last offer.

2) Use the $40K personal loan to pay off my high interest loans: #1 and #2 (totaling $39581)
     Assumptions:
     The current rate i’m paying off loan #2 is unsustainable and would take 22 years (this is a fact not an assumption really)
     If my interest rate on the new loan is less than 10% I’d be saving approx: $43K in interest 39K interest on #2 and 4K on #1 and the payoff would be 5 years instead of 22

3) No personal loan and adding the $400 or so $ I can spend extra per month to these monthly payments, either on one loan or split over multiple loans.

4) Give up my American citizenship and move to a non extraditionary country (we can always dream can’t we).


I’m looking for any advice on this situation. I know I’m leaving out some opportunity costs and probably other factors i’m not considering. But the best choice seem to be to pay off the two high interest loans as quickly as possible and continue to pay off my .001% loan as slowly as possible due to the low rate. I’m just not sure if the settlement offer of approx: 37% on the dollar negates the fact that i’m paying close to 0 interest on that larger loan. *note by my quick math i’d be saving more by going the settlement route, especially assuming I could put more money towards my high interest loans once the personal loan is paid off. This is getting more and more complicated the more i think about it.


**TL:DR**

If I got a 40K personal loan at an interest rate lower than my current high interest loan rates (lower than 10%), should I put it towards those two loans $12.1K@12.184 interest and $27.4k@10% interest. Or use the 40K personal loan to pay a settlement offer of approx: 40K to my highest balance loan $125K@.001% interest. With this second option I’d save 85K on the loan and at an interest rate of 8% on the personal loan (just a hopeful guess) I’d end up paying 8.6K interest over 5 years saving a total of $76.4K on the total loan vs saving $39581 on the high interest payoff option, if i were to continue paying those at the slow rate I am now, I'd be paying on them for 22 years, which is obviously not going to happen.",finance,1460412545

financialindependence,"Went from homeless to helping build a ""unicorn."" I don't know about finances. How crazy is my 5 year plan?","I grew up a poor kid. Food stamps poor. Rough childhood. Never got on with my folks all that well. Homeless a few times. Had a felony. Went in debt about ~50k. Spent my early 20s drinking and working at McDonald's.

Then I taught myself how to program, moved to San Francisco, and helped build one of the ""unicorn"" companies you read about in the news. I'm not rich now, but compared to what I was 10 years ago, I'm filthy rich. The ""unicorn"" will net me about $600k. $200k of that I have right now and I'm debt free. It's sitting in a mutual fund. I have the other $400k coming when the IPO of the company happens, which might be 5 years out.

I'm 33 years. 1 wife (of 9 years). 1 kid (he's 18 months).

I'm also tired. Building the unicorn has taken a lot out of me. I'd like to not be programming, though. I want to be traveling. I want to spent time with my family. Or just not have a boss would be great.

With my current stash, I calculate that I'll be out of money before I'm retired, so I started to look into being financially independent and retired early. I wouldn't say I'm a very smart man, but I know how valuable of a position I'm in right now, so I want to learn how to grow my wealth. Let me tell you my plan, and you tell me how crazy I am.

1. [next 6 years] Continue working for the foreseeable future. Until the IPO, 200k isn't that much (I can't believe I'm saying that). I make $130k right now and I can save about $40k of that per year with my current situation in the Bay Area.  The $400k is an estimate and would be subject to short term cap gains if I touch it prior to one year after the IPO, so I'm not counting on that money for at least 6 years.

2. [this year] I really would like to provide a home for my family (something I never had), so I've been looking at $350k properties in Portland, which will reduce my stash by ~80k. Summing up mortgage, tax, insurance, repairs, let's say it costs $2k a month ($24k per year). This means I can save closer to $50k per year with current salary, but let's be conservative and still only save $40k.

3. [this year] Now I want to work on financial diversification. All of my income comes from my job, so I want to find something that keeps me afloat if I want to take a couple years off. I thought mutual funds, but frankly, I just don't understand it. So my answer what rental properties (under a legal entity). I grew up in the midwest where I can get SF property for $200k and rent it for $1.5k a month. Rough calculations says that the mortgage + tax + insurance + 1 month vacancy lands me around 1.1k a month. Let's say I buy two SF properties, which nets me $800 per month, but let's round down to $9k per year. The interest rates are still pretty low. The repairmen/key handlers would be my old friends who still live in the area and are always looking to make an honest dollar. (data source for the numbers: redfin cross-reffed with craigslist/locals who I chat with daily)

4. [this year] After those three house purchases, I've got $45k + this year's savings (roughly $40k) left to float me, which I'll keep in a rainy day fund.

5. [five years from now] I've been able to save $40k a year, which I used to buy another 5 SF properties in the midwest (one per year). Now I own 7 properties (+ my own home), which nets me ~$31k per year. But let's pretend one is a wash and I only net $25k/year. Finally, I'm ready to pay my mortgage with my rental properties, and I could take a few years off.

6. [six years from now] Hopefully the ""unicorn"" IPO'd the year prior and I'm finally able to capitalize on another series of investments. At this point, I've got 7 mortgages, which to me seems crazy. Would it be better to start to pay these suckers off, refinance them, or look elsewhere with the money?


Note: this is not a throwaway account. This is a new account that I'll be using just for these types of conversations.

edit: To clarify, I've already left the ""unicorn."" I exercised my shares, paid an enormous amount of taxes (I was subject to short term cap gains because I had no capital to pay taxes), and ended up with 200k left over. I still have about 400k worth of stock at it's current level. When I sold my shares privately, I had to sign a new contract saying that I was unable to sell the remainder shares otherwise subject to ROFR.

The ""unicorn"" should've IPO'd a few years ago. It's already worth 1.3B, share price at the low end of $20s. I bought at $0.17. The founders are biding time and waiting for an advantageous market, I suppose. I know the company is profitable and doing fine internally.

Overall, I didn't do so well considering that other people in the company have already made a few million off the deal and I was employee #12, but I'm not too sensitive about it. Really. I was young and *truly* naive. Unbelievably naive. I'm just thankful for having the opportunity to do what I did there. I'm thankful for getting such a great education building a successful business.

I know that the other $400k is only a pipe dream. My crazy five year plan above is all about what I'm doing with my $200k that I have and my current savings rate, not about the IPO. Apologies for making it sound like I'm depending on it.",finance,1460419692

financialindependence,FIRE vs Mini-retirements,"Hi FIRE squad,

I've recently began planning moves for the future as I have come to the first point in my life out of college where I have savings, a small investment, and stable paying job. To keep things short and for help/consideration in your reply I've got my stats here below of the current situation:

Annual salary from day job: ~40K
Side business salary: ~15K
Monthly expenses: ~ 1.5k 
Beginning Vanguard investment: 5.5K
Cash Savings: ~ 30K

We rent a house with three bedrooms and the other two rooms currently cover our rent each month beyond some small utility expenses, so monthly costs are fairly low and consist of only entertainment and food.

My issue is that my current day job is destroying my health and overall mental well being (long hours, poor office, environment, understaffed). It's also in an industry that I have absolutely no desire to remain in and got into the job as kind of an accident when the position opened up and we needed some cash. We are just under 30 and would still really like to see some of the world while we're young and able.

Having read the 4HWW, I'm a big fan of Tim's mini-retirement concept. Does anyone have any suggestions as to jumping ship on a not so desirable career for a mini-retirement (~1 year) before heading back into things more seriously? Or would you stay in to continue to leverage the current situation and go for FIRE at an earlier date?

Side note: Leaving my current position would likely result in a stagnation of my side business income as it is very location oriented, although I might be able to manage it from abroad if I set up a system before we left.",finance,1460421210

personalfinance,"Help with ""Credit for Qualified Retirement Savings"" on taxes","I have already filed my 2015 taxes, using a free edition of Turbo Tax. But I think it may be worth filing an amended return, because I came across an amazing tax credit I should take advantage of. I need some help understanding it, and would hugely appreciate it!!

Because of a my low income, I can get hundreds of dollars of tax credit for funds I contribute to my Roth IRA, through the Federal Tax Return Form 8880, titled ""Credit for Qualified Retirement Savings Contribution."" I'm looking for help understanding this and maximizing the benefit I can get.

My income is in the lowest possible bracket on this form. If I am reading this correctly, I can get a tax credit of 50% of the amount I contributed to a Roth IRA.

I can still contribute to my Roth today and count it for 2015 contributions. So if I put $2000 more into it, I will get a $1000 tax credit? It seems to good to be true...

Obviously there must be a limit to this. What amount could I contribute to my Roth IRA to maximize my tax credit?

The main question here is probably box 11 of the form, the ""limitation based on tax liability."" I can receive *either* 50% of the amount I paid into my Roth, *or* I get the amount in box 11, whichever is lower. I don't understand how the number in box 11 is generated (it's currently 321). And if I contribute more to my Roth IRA, will that number will go up or stay stuck at 321?

Should I go ahead and pour extra money into my Roth IRA, count it for 2015 contributions, and amend my tax return to get a good credit?

Extra question, I also contributed $500 to my Roth IRA for the 2014 year, but was not aware of this form and didn't claim it. Is it still possible for me to amend that return and get a credit for that amount?

This could potentially get me hundreds of dollars, so any advice someone can give, I would love to take. Thank you!!",finance,1460421864

My immediate response was ""well why didn't you tell me this in 2014 or 2015 when I called to pay those taxes? The answer I think, was to rack up the late fees on me.

Something that irked me even further was that they received a payment from me in 2013 for what I owed them (according to Turbotax). Why did the agent on the phone let me pay if she didn't have my paperwork? This is North Carolina, btw.

I have done my taxes through Turbo every year, and have always asked them to file my state for me. I have been off and on the phone with them for days and there is nothing they are going to do to help me out.

So now, my only option is to file my state taxes for 2012 and 2013 again, pay what I owe, *again*, and that's that. So after paying for taxes for those 2 years, the state is telling me I need to do it again, as well as 25% for every $100 owed, and 2% annual interest in late fees. Complete bull.

I make about $8,000 - $10,000 a month.

When i get paid, i immediately transfer 25% of the payment to a separate account for paying gst/taxes.

I don't have payroll or dividends or anything set up yet. currently, i just transfer money to my personal account to pay for stuff (rent, groceries, gas, etc)

Now, it's my understanding that the corporation is taxed on income as well as i personally am going to be taxed on whatever i pay myself.

So, i feel like i have the corporation covered--i can pay all my gst/taxes with that 25% and will probably have some left over.

However, i also have to pay tax on whatever i pay myself, right? like cpp, federal/provincial tax, ei, etc. So should i also be putting away money to prepare for that? because right now i'm not. am i going to owe a bunch of money that I don't have to CRA?

Also, if I pay myself $50,000 a year and the corporation makes $100,000 a year, that's $50,000 that belongs to the company. What if i want that money? I feel like i'm just making money for the company which I'll never use? Or if i want it will I have to pay a ton of personal taxes on it?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my HELOC loan immediately (which was used to finance home purchase)?,"When we purchased our home 3 years ago, we did so by using an 80/10/10 arrangement our mortgage broker recommended. We paid a 10% downpayment ourselves, got a HELOC loan for the other 10%, and were thus able to qualify for better conventional loan terms with 20% down (and avoiding PMI).

The original HELOC loan was for $42K and has a current balance of $32K. It's a variable interest rate of 5.49% (but it's tied to the prime rate, so hasn't changed in the 3 years we've had it).

I've got the cash to pay it off immediately: $50K+ in savings (and another $40K or so in investments and 401Ks). Last year, our average spending was about $5.5K per month (does not include savings or payroll contributions to healthcare/retirement). We live in an expensive area, so our savings rate is decent but not as high as it could be: probably ~$15K per year, on top of 401K contributions.

This may be a dumb question but: how much, how quickly would you pay off this HELOC loan?

I know the ideal scenario is to pay it all off immediately and save money on that interest, but given the whole financial picture and the desire to keep a healthy emergency fund intact, what's the smartest thing for me to do in this situation?

I graduated college in May 2015. I started working full time for a local government social services agency in June 2015. I know without a doubt I qualify for PSLF. I have already submitted paperwork to start tracking my payments, which at this point are $0 due to being on IBR with a salary of almost $32K. I have about $36K in federal loans and $7K in private loans. I have been paying towards the private loans since they came into repayment in December.

 I also have 1K in CC debt from an unfortunate situation in which I was furloughed from Oct-January because of the PA state budget crisis and was not eligible for unemployment due to not being employed long enough. This will not be an issue in the future as I have now been employed long enough to receive unemployment if it were to happen again. I have since created an emergency fund as well, in the unlikely case this would happen. This instance was the first in the history of the agency's operation where lay offs took place. I have this down from $2.5K in just the past 3 months. I plan to have it eliminated in the next 2 months.  

My living expenses are all about to change as well. I currently rent and pay all utilities plus personal bills myself. My boyfriend's family owns multiple properties and has offered us a house for basically free. All we have to pay is our utilities and property taxes.  We have estimated this at about $700/month. We will split the cost $350 each. The house is further from my work however. I currently live on the same street I work on. This house will be a half an hour drive each way from work. However, my expenses will go from my current $1000/month to about $600/month (does not include gas or food). I have $1k in savings/emergency fund.

I currently own a 2004 Jeep Liberty with 119K miles. It's completely paid off and I've had it for 6 years. She's been good to me but I get roughly 16 mpg. I have been looking into getting something more fuel efficient for my upcoming commute. I also have to travel frequently for work. I am paid mileage, but it's only $.45/mile. Specifically, I have had my eye on a hybrid that gets 36/41 mpg for $14,994. I would either trade in my Jeep or sell it privately, which would take hopefully $3-$4K off the price. 

I've been lurking for a while and I'm nervous about making the commitment to a monthly payment again. Any input is appreciated. 

* Monthly take home income: $1780

**Debt**

* $7K with 3.5% interest- private loan

personalfinance,"I screwed up my taxes big time and owe $3,000. I can pay it, but am worried about consequences. Please help. :/","Firstly, this is majorly embarrassing.  I've done my own taxes for years without any issue, but since getting married things have gotten complicated.  This past year was a culmination of things that I didn't factor correctly.

First of all, and most importantly, my wife gets a stipend from her PhD program every year of around $25,000 tax free.  It's literally a couple of giant checks.

Second, I got a big raise in 2015 ($10,000), which I didn't properly account for.  In the past I've upped my withholding to cover both of us, but I didn't up it enough this year.

So, even though my wife has been in her program for three years now, we both got raises and I didn't notice that the extra money each paycheck was unusual.

My tax burden this year is somewhere around $4,800, but if I open an IRA for my wife and put in the maximum contribution, it drops us to $3,200 or so, and I'm inclined to do that.  But I have a couple questions:

1. What late fees/penalties can I expect for screwing up so badly??  (I already upped my state and federal W-4 for 2016 by the amount needed to pay an additional $4,000 in taxes this year)

2. Should I purchase the audit protection from Turbotax for $150 or whatever it costs?  It seems likely that I'll raise some flags at the IRS.

3. Is the IRA contribution a good idea or will it somehow make things worse?  I saw an option to defer payment into it until October as well - can I do that here?

4.  I've always claimed the stipend checks as miscellaneous income and there's no tax form that comes along with them, I'm literally left on my own to figure out how to claim it.  For an unmarried grad student making a total of $25,000 a year, it's not a big deal.  For us though, our combined $100,000+ income turns taxes into a freaking headache, and potential liability.

5. WHAT ELSE AM I FORGETTING?!?!?!

Hopefully a simple question. I'm pretty fed up with Wells and want to transfer completely away from them, but I always hear about how closing accounts you've had for a long time is not good for your credit. I guess my question is how bad is it and what are my alternatives?

personalfinance,Paying Off Debt,"I am a 25 year old working professional with a salary job. I just recently started really diving into researching personal finance/budgeting and am trying to pay off my debt. I currently have about 31K in debt, not including my mortgage and I am investing $400 a month into the stock market. I am considering halting my investment's to aggressively pay off debt, but not sure if it's worth it. Here are my current debts:

Credit Card: $600 - Will be payed off end of month.
Bedroom Furniture: $1.5K - $105/month at 0% interest
Car Loan: $28.8K - $505/month minimum at 2.89% interest, currently paying $630/month.

I have enough cash on hand for roughly 4 months of emergency expenses and pay $6,000 off my debt up front. I am also contributing 6% of my salary  to my 401K (outside of the $400 a month brokerage account) with a 3% employer match which I'm leaving as is.

Obviously most of my debt is in my car which I just bought new in June. My question is, with the very low interest rates on my debt, is it worth stopping my investments to pay off my debt? I know that paying off debt is a guaranteed investment return, where's the market is not. Since I am only 25 years old I would like to build up my investments now so that i can maximize compound interest down the road.

More to consider, I am also paying an extra $250 a month on my mortgage at 3.875%. Since the interest rate is higher on my mortgage than my car loan, I feel like i should keep paying extra on my mortgage. But if I applied that to my car loan as well I could pay it off considerably quicker. Would love to hear your thoughts.",finance,1460480861
personalfinance,Creditor says they are unable to remove past reports for delinquent payment?,"I have a student loan account that I recently closed (by consolidating). There is a delinquent payment credit report on it I'm trying to remove - I would have been eligible for a deferral at the time, but didn't know the loan was due (I had just started grad school). 

I asked for the report to be removed, and the creditor (ACS) told me that they cannot remove the report because it was accurate and federal law prohibits them from removing it. That doesn't jive with my understanding that you can often pay for delete on credit reports. Thoughts? I have asked for a retroactive deferral, no response yet. 

Their letter here:

We are required under FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act) to truthfully report your loan status to the credit bureaus.  That includes reporting any months that the account was delinquent. We are unable to remove derogatory information unless a valid condition existed at the time the delinquency occurred such as a deferment, forbearance or a payment received. Our records do not show that a deferment or forbearance was requested nor was a payment received to prevent the reporting.
 
Per Federal Regulations, we are obligated to report delinquent accounts to the National Credit Bureaus once the account becomes 60 days or more past due.
We would like to confirm that your account status is reported to the credit bureau each month. The report(s) that was made to the credit agency was valid we are unable to remove it.

personalfinance,[Europe] Am I being too cautious?,"Hi everyone,

Some facts first. 24 year old. I make about 43k yearly before taxes, 25k afterwards. I'm working in a tech company and I have a contract until the end of this year and unless something catastrophic happens, I'll be staying with the company for atleast another 1 year contract. We're growing quite a bit and just recently got some investment plus they really like my work.

I took over 18k of debt from my parents and have been paying it for some months now. I have about 11k or 12k left plus whatever interest rate. From what I recall from the agreement it should be tied to Euribor. (side question: which should be good for me, right? Because that seems to be close to zero?)
I think that when the guy did the math at first it would be something like 3k/4k at the end of interest? (4 year deal).

Plus, I need a new car. I'm thinking of getting one around 20k and would be able to start with about 10k (of the 15k I have in savings). By asking for a 10k loan, let's say 2/3 years, I would probably end up with about a third of my monthly income after taxes tied up to these two loans. I currently have no major obligations besides this, still live with my parents and can continue doing so. 

Even though I can currently well afford both loans and still would be able to save quite a lot to terminate the loans earlier than expected, I'm feeling a little bit edgy about taking the step.

I've been probably overthinking things and whether I should try to hold on buying the car (something I can do, but really didn't want to) and just use the 10k to pay off the loan, whether I should make a smaller entrance and try to put some of the savings money into that first loan and so on. On the other hand I think that if I don't take the step and do the car when I have a good salary and job security, in 2/3 years I might be thinking about leaving home and will need to pay rent plus the car (assuming my old one doesn't die on me first and leaves me to make a rushed purchase).

I'm a university student a year away from my bachelors in Finland. I've decided I'd like to use the opportunity the goverment provides for a student loan. As in, the goverment is the guarantor (or whatever the secondary person who offers to pay in case the loaner cannot is).

The banks marginal for the loan is 0,5%, and in addition to that I can choose between Euribor 12kk or the banks own Prime- option (0,8%). The Euribor 12kk today is -0,011%. If I were to choose Euribor, would this mean that the interest for my loan would be 0,489% for the first year? This negative interest rate confuses me.

Is it safe to assume that Euribor 12kk for the next 5 years won't rise drastically above 0.8%?

personalfinance,"Am I doomed to being taxed twice on HR's residency error? (1099-G MD, VA)","For all of 2014, my company erroneously reported me as a MD resident and withheld MD taxes.  I was a VA resident for all of 2014.

For 2014, $8k had been withheld for MD, $0 withheld for VA.  I filed a non-resident return for MD, got the $8k back, and paid VA taxes out of pocket.  The MD return (505) even has a checkbox ""Check here for Maryland taxes withheld in error,"" so this must happen frequently.  On my Schedule A (5a) I deducted the amount I *actually* paid (not counting MD, since I paid nothing).

For 2015, I received a 1099-G from MD.  My $8k withheld in error is now refund income.  According to TaxAct, because I used the state income tax deduction (even though I didn't deduct the MD taxes, which I didn't pay), that money is fully taxable.

So, it looks like there's nothing I can do but have the $8k taxed federally in both 2014 and 2015?

Was I supposed to have done something different, or was I screwed because I didn't notice HR's error for an entire year?

My expenses are listed below:

$400: rent (my half)

$50: electric

$60: internet

$75: phone bill

$300: CC ($300 limit that I max every month, but also pay in full)

Groceries/sanitary products: ~$150

Total= $1185. As you can see, there's not much wiggle room, but we get by fine. My SO doesn't have a credit card so she has some extra per month, but not much.

SL1 (fed): $2,123 (deferment)

SL2 (fed): $3,560 (deferment)

private university: 13k (in collections)

Total= $29,918

Story: I foolishly attended a private (45,000/year) university straight out of high school. I got some partial scholarships and was approved for a $10,000 loan to cover my first semester. However, my second semester loan request wasn't approved. I attended school for the second semester anyway, thinking that my dad would find the money somewhere (17 y/o me). That didn't happen. Now I owe the school 13k for transcripts that I don't care to have. I tried going to my local community college to enroll, thinking that I could just start over as a freshmen using my high school transcripts, but they informed me that, no, since I had attended university, only those transcripts can be used (needed to verify the 2.0 gpa needed to get into the school). It will take me some time to pay off the 13k to have my transcripts released. I have been shopping around for jobs, but without a degree I haven't been able to find anything higher than 12/hr which is my current rate of pay. My question is this: Should I file for bankruptcy to discharge the 13k? (I'm aware that my SLs cannot be discharged). I know it will remain on my credit for 10 years, but if I get the debt discharged I'll be able to go to school, get a higher paying job and work to repair my credit when I'm older. I know that I could eventually pay off the 13k, but I don't want to wait until I'm 23 or 24 to go back to school. Is this a good idea? If not, what is your advice?

personalfinance,Somewhat lost in college and considering military service to help pay.,"Currently, I am an undergraduate seeking a CS and Econ degree, and I am learning Arabic as well as being able to speak Polish. 

Throughout high school, I was a depressed teenager who put no effort into anything and did not join any clubs or sports. Going into college, I considered the army to see if it could instill some sort of discipline in me, but then decided against it mostly due to my mother. Although I kinda knew it and just didn't want to think about it, my education has been entirely financed on loans. Currently, I have 17k in federal loans and 33k in private loans after 2 years. It only recently hit me how much this was, and how much it was going to be, and I've been desperate to not have it affect my family significantly, as they already just barely get by with their current bills. 

As a result, I'm considering enlisting in the National Guard for two main reasons: to make me a better person with some sort of structure, as I wanted to before going to school, and the financial help. I've spoken with a recruiter and a few ROTC/National Guard students, but I figure Reddit has a tremendous diversity of opinion so I should stop by here. 

As I understand it, my pay while in the service would be improved if I joined AFTER school, as opposed to during the summer/taking a year off DURING school. What I'm worried about is that during my training, my family will be paying off my loans, so all of my wages during my service will go to the loans, and I want to be sure it's enough. If it's more than enough, then I will tackle my private loans first via the avalanche method (IIRC). My FAFSA loans will be paid via GI Bill (once again, IIRC). In addition, after leaving the service after 8 years, I will get significant financial help getting a Master's in CS, which would be great. 

Is there anything I should know/ go over with a recruiter in detail before signing up? I'd love to be able to use my CS skills while serving, so which MOS should I be aiming for? Would I be able to sell my skills and my education well after leaving the service? Thanks in advance.

I am 24 now and I am heavily in debt. I wish I could go on about how most of this is due to my student loans, but it isn’t. I could account to it being due to poor financial decisions as well as helping out my family when needed. Throughout the past 6 years, I eventually ended up digging myself into this gigantic hole. 

I got my first personal loan for $10,000 with the intention of using that money to consolidate my credit card debt. About 1-2 years later, I ended up asking for another personal loan of $10,000 to, again, consolidate my credit card debt. This strategy clearly didn’t work for me seeing as I only accumulated more debt. At this point, I really should have cut up all my credit cards, and solely rely on REAL MONEY and spending it on the bare necessities. Unfortunately, I didn’t. 

Here is the breakdown of my situation:

$11,500 @ 5%- Student loans (currently making monthly payments of $250/month)
$15,000 @ 8% - Personal loan (used to consolidate debt as previously mentioned)
$4,200 @ 10% - Line of credit 
$17,000 @ 11% - Credit card debt total

I don’t have a ton of money in my savings account. I will mention that I do have a CSB, RRSP, and a TFSA. The total combined in all three investments(?) aren’t much tbh. And I would prefer not to say the total. I am currently making monthly deposits of about $400 into all three savings accounts. I know it doesn’t really make a dent, but I am debating about cutting off most of these deposits and putting it towards my debt. I am also thinking I really don’t need this CSB. I only opted for it because it’s money that is harder to reach, which in turn will allow me to accumulate some sort of cushion. 

I will mention that I don’t have much in my chequing account. I actually don’t have much money to play around with at all. I currently make about $44,000/year (gross income) with flexibility on annual income only because I am paid hourly. My shifts are not stable and vary from month to month.

I really want to get out of this. I intend on being able to purchase another car (my 2001 is hanging on it’s last legs) as well as I really want to start saving towards my future. I am aiming to get out of this within the next 2-3 years. It’s taken me a really long while but I am finally opening up about this and want to make a change.

Please advise!

personalfinance,Amended Return After Refund Received,"I recently filed my girlfriend's taxes using the free H&amp;R Block software. Initially, I did not claim her as her parent's dependent, and her Federal Refund was around $1700.

However, her father would like her claimed as his dependent and asked me to file an amended return. I went on the H&amp;R Block software to file an amended return, and it said her new refund would be $477. For some reason (glitch in the software?), it does not register that she got a $1700 refund for tax year 2015 a month ago.

It is instructing me to file a 1040X by mail, with no mention of repaying the refund difference. 

How do I go about doing that?

Should I just file the 1040X and then will the IRS contact her to get back the refund difference or is there something else I should be doing?",finance,1460518294

personalfinance,"Wife wants to move on buying a house, I know what I'm comfortable with spending but her thought process is giving me severe anxiety.","Hello, r/personalfinance. I'm looking for a little advice (or just reassurance that I'm not being paranoid). 

My wife and I live in NJ and make a combined 90k yearly. We've been renting for the last 5 years and our savings is what I'd call insufficient based on our lifestyle. We have roughly 35k available as a general fund - it's all we have. We have no student loan debt and roughly $900/monthly auto/cc debt (I just cut up my card with the intention of not replacing until the balance was zeroed). We've been pre-approved for 225k, which means nothing based on experience.

We have very different ideas about home affordability. I'm extremely nervous about going into home ownership without 20% down. Our rent for a small 1 bedroom is $1200 monthly and that even makes me cringe most days. I don't want to mortgage a house that has me paying more than $1400 monthly with taxes and insurance included, which means either building a greater down payment or spending less (both things that don't really bother me - I just want a decent school system). I know we're not ready.

My wife thinks we're loaded. Our real estate agent is a family friend and showed us a house in the town we live in over the weekend - asking price $225k. Great house and location, don't get me wrong. Under normal circumstances with the proper financial backing it would be a slam dunk. My wife, however, thinks it's perfectly fine to go in with 3.5% down and forego PMI for a .5% increase in the interest rate. Almost $1,800 a month before we turn the lights on, which is 38% of our monthly take-home. She's adamant that we put in an offer this week. 

I know our spending habits are not ideal. Our budgeting needs major work. We should have tripled our savings given the length of time we've been together. Am I insane for thinking this house is a bad idea?",finance,1460536276
Economics,"Article of the Week: Japan's Liquidity Trap (Akram, 2016)","**Japan’s Liquidity Trap**


This working paper was selected from the top of SSRN's 2016 published articles. 

This paper takes a look at Japan’s liquidity trap in the context of Japan's structural and macroeconnomic outcomes over the past few decades. 

* [**HERE**](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2753107) is the link to the the article's SSRN abstract page. 

***

Japan has experienced stagnation, deflation, and low interest rates for decades. It is caught in a liquidity trap. This paper examines Japan’s liquidity trap in light of the structure and performance of the country’s economy since the onset of stagnation. It also analyzes the country’s liquidity trap in terms of the different strands in the theoretical literature. It is argued that insights from a Keynesian perspective are still quite relevant. 

The Keynesian perspective is useful not just for understanding Japan’s liquidity trap but also for formulating and implementing policies that can overcome the liquidity trap and foster renewed economic growth and prosperity. Paul Krugman (1998a, b) and Ben Bernanke (2000; 2002) identify low inflation and deflation risks as the cause of a liquidity trap. Hence, they advocate a credible commitment by the central bank to sustained monetary easing as the key to reigniting inflation, creating an exit from a liquidity trap through low interest rates and quantitative easing. In contrast, for John Maynard Keynes (2007 [1936]) the possibility of a liquidity trap arises from a sharp rise in investors’ liquidity preference and the fear of capital losses due to uncertainty about the direction of interest rates. His analysis calls for an integrated strategy for overcoming a liquidity trap. 

This strategy consists of vigorous fiscal policy and employment creation to induce a higher expected marginal efficiency of capital, while the central bank stabilizes the yield curve and reduces interest rate volatility to mitigate investors’ expectations of capital loss. In light of Japan’s experience, Keynes’s analysis and proposal for generating effective demand might well be a more appropriate remedy for the country’s liquidity trap.",finance,1460540275
Bitcoin,What most likely happened with Igot.com and Rick Day,"We can assume one of two scenarios with Igot.com, but cannot confirm either for now:
1. Igot was created as a money making scam from day 1, based on the following information:
 1.1 Igot.com has made false claims regarding being ""local"" and has advertised being the biggest ""Australian bitcoin exchange"", while Bitcoin was not regulated or recognized in most of the countries where it operated, and it wasn't recognized as a ""bitcoin exchange"" in Australia either!
1.2 Igot.com does not publish any phone numbers, or identifable and staffed office locations
1.3 Founder ""Rick Day"" has changed his name from ""Raghav Dayma"" and is using his brother's nick name ""Ansh"" in a manner which implies they're attempting to hide their ethnicity and country of birth, especially when no reference is made to India in any way
1.4 The dispute resolution process -as per their terms and conditions- is litigation in Hong Kong with no trial by jury or class action, which is a catch 22 for people with small investments who are unable to reach for lawyers in Hong Kong
1.5 There is information online on other Indian entities founded by ""Rick Day"" and his family with suspicious operations (Fake Rolex business)
1.6 Igot.com staff have reduced significantly and their staff shrunk to two brothers with limited to no support to customers on social media or through tickets
1.7 Igot.com have replied to clients via support ticket or direct email with several promises of payment which weren't fulfilled
1.8 Rick Day has confirmed to many clients that he is unable to directly settle their debts at this time.
1.9 No audit reports or statements from regulators or accreditation bodies has been posted to vouch for the sound financial position of Igot.com as ""Rick Day"" has claimed
1.10 A Winding up notice has been served from Digital X in Australia against 13TH PTY which is one of Igot's Australian entities for not paying their 180K AUD. Digital X used to be a mining company which provides exchanges with bitcoin and retail solutions. SO most likely Igot.com got some bitcoins from them but not enough to account for all the purchases made by clients. A statement which Jessie Chenard's statement to ABC supports. 

The Other scenario is that Igot.com is a poorly run business by an Indian born national who changed his name to avoid any prejudice against him and tried to attract investors from the US to acquire liquidity after having his accounts closed in various countries due to his poor protection and Anti-Money Laundering processes. And because Rick assumingly loved Igot so much he wanted to protect it from being heralded as a failure back in early 2015  following his claims of DDOS attacks and bank account closures. Rick probably ran to Kenya and the US to secure funds to start paying clients and getting bitcoin reserves and negotiated with banks to unfreeze his accounts. Nonetheless, even if this scenario was true, his poor service, lack of transparency and withholding people's money for up to 9 months is inexcusable when the justification is nothing but arrogance or denial.

personalfinance,Can refinancing cause credit score to drop? [credit],"My BofA credit card just started offering a monthly credit score. They're using Transunion. I signed up yesterday and was surprised to see a score at least 30 points lower than I expected. A history back six months is also shown, with the score consistent by a couple points up or down each month.

The last time I pulled my score and reports was the end of 2014, and my scores were in the low 700s across all three bureaus. I did buy a new car right after pulling those scores/reports, but have paid on time since. 

The only other change expected on my reports was refinancing my mortgage to a much lower rate November of 2015.

I pulled my reports this morning to see if there were any other changes that might've pulled my score down. Besides the refinance and car loan, there is nothing on any report that wasn't there at the end of 2014, and no negative marks dating back several years.

My car loan is a pretty low balance (&lt; $9k) and the mortgage is less than $100k. My credit to income ratio is very low. I have two credit cards, which I use and pay completely off monthly.

Back in 2009, I had several months non-payment of student loans (federally backed, not private) - I requested my loans go into deferment immediately after I graduated, but did not follow up to make sure the deferment happened. I wasn't receiving any more bills, so I thought I was good. Turns out, they needed some info from me and only contacted me via my college email address for the first several months, waiting ~6 months before actually sending a bill or calling the phone number they had on file. I paid up to date over the phone immediately, but the ~180 late was on my credit report by then. 

Those loans have been paid off for years now, but the negative marks are just now starting to fall off, so I was expecting an increase in my credit score as those fell off, not a 30 point decrease. 

I do follow my score on Credit Karma (which I know is not 100% accurate because of different formulas), which shows a score much closer to what I expected.",finance,1460542324

My mother is currently renting a home, but she is going to buy it by April 29th.   
My long term boyfriend and I have been looking to buy a house this year for around $170,000.00
She has offered to sell it, with her as the financial instituion, to my boyfriend and myself with a 3.75 interest rate and the price of the home at $220,000.00. This would be a 35 year loan with balloons written in every 3 year's for 9 year's.  
This would be contractually bound with a down payment from us. The homeowners insurance is $801.00 and the taxes for this year were $2228.53.
For the rest of this year she will personally pay half of the taxes and half of the insurance so we can get moved in comfortably.  
So here is my problem:  
The house is more expensive than what we were looking for. Its within our price range and is less than the rent we pay now($1300.00 a month not including the utility payments which we cover entirely) but it does not leave a lot of room for saving.  
She has stated that the tax returns for a homeowner are more substantial and I should consider that. 
I know this is a good deal, and in this year's market the house would sell for closer to $300,000.00.   
Long term it's the perfect house in one of the best neighborhoods in our area.   
But financially my boyfriend and I are unsure.

What are these tax breaks she is talking about?

personalfinance,How to RAISE your tax liability?,"I know it might seem strange to want to raise your tax liability, but allow me to explain. I recently pre-ordered the new Tesla Model 3, which I'm super excited about. The US Federal government is providing a tax incentive for consumers of EV manufacturers. If you're lucky and you get the full incentive (I won't get into the details of how, but let's just assume for this case we get the full incentive) it works out to be $7500.

Now, from what I've read, this money is given to you at the end of the year with your tax refund. It is taken out of your total tax liability and given back to you. (Ex. You pay $12k in taxes over the year. End of year you only owe $8k, you get $4k back. The $8k remaining is where they will be giving you the $7500.)
SO, with that being said, apparently if your tax liability is &lt;$7500, than you only get whatever that number happens to be. (Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.) Well I happen to fall short of $7500 tax liability by quite a bit. I make about $43k a year before taxes. Based off of an online tax calculator I found that I have about $4.8k in tax liability. Which means I would only get that $4.8k instead of the full $7.5k. 

So, how could I raise my tax liability the year i buy the car? I was thinking about possible taking money out of my 401k and using it to buy my first home, I'd be taxed on that money, hence raising my tax liability, right? Please, let me know if there are better ways! I'm sure many other reservation holders are curious about how this all really works.

tl;dr 

Pre-ordered Model 3, want to raise tax liability for full federal tax incentive.

EDIT: Okay, so literally everyone is saying I can't afford the car, so I guess I'll be canceling my reservation then:( 
I just wanted to be apart of something big. I've always been in love with Tesla, and have always been huge fan of Elon Musks work.. I knew this was more car than I could afford, but with the tax incentive bringing it down from the 35k and I live in a state where the incentive here is no tax on EVs.. I thought it would be SOMEWHAT possible considering that I do live home... And that I'd have a 21+ month head start on a healthy down payment, but yeah making more money is easier said than done.

These lists always seem to be siloed into an analysis of one type of tax and I have never seen a credible one that analyzes all types of taxes, including municipal taxes, as a whole. It would be especially useful for an analysis of which state is better for a homeowner paying property taxes vs a renter.

My personal anecdote is my move to Ohio several years ago. I knew I would be renting so essentially ignored property tax burden and was comfortable going in with my knowledge of Ohio's comparatively reasonable state income and sales tax. It was not until I moved here that I discovered municipalities in Ohio take their own income taxes! My city takes a 2.5% flat income tax which is fairly par for the course. My view of Ohio having very reasonable ""sub-federal"" taxes changed in a hurry. Municipal taxes such as these never seem to get any sort of publicity or discussion in the ""best tax states"" argument.
Likewise, I often see posts from states such as Texas decrying ""awful"" taxes on property but with no analysis on how they make out when compared against states with lower property taxes but a state/municipal income tax.

And *these* are some of the wars which those ""certain someones"" have been willing to wage in order to punish any sovereign entities (Iraq and Libya most recently) who dare to try establish a banking system which is *not* subordinate to the BIS (Bank of International Settlements a/k/a ""the central bank of central banks"") and the global hegemony of the Fed's PetroDollar as established a hundred years ago on [Jekyll Island](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=creature+from+jekyll+island):

&gt; The owners of Blockstream are spending $75 million to do a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin by manipulating the Core devs &amp; the Chinese miners. This is cheap compared to the $ trillions spent on the wars on Iraq &amp; Libya - who also defied the Fed / PetroDollar / BIS private central banking cartel.

And *these* are the usual rag-tag bunch of supporting cast of amoral corrupt middle managers, clueless technocrats, obedient foot soldiers, petty tyrants, censors, absolutist religious kooks, and other assorted necessary useful idiots enlisted by the Masters of the Planet to ""embrace, extend, and extinguish"" the code and the community of the newest threat to their power, namely Bitcoin:

- [amoral corrupt middle managers](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/48din1/austin_hill_in_meltdown_mode_desperately_sending/) like /u/austindhill;

- socially tone-deaf, [economically ignorant](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc+bitcoin_classic/search?q=author%3Aydtm+maxwell&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), borderline autistic programmers like /u/nullc, /u/adam3us, /u/petertodd;

- despotic tyrants and censors like /u/theymos;

- [monarchist murderous monotheistic](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/492ztl/lukejr_the_only_religion_people_have_a_right_to/) mentally ill attack-dogs like /u/luke-jr;

- juvenile snarky toxic bootlicking sycophants like /u/Lejitz, /u/brg444, and the never-ending stream of newer ones like /u/Classic-Rekt deployed to torment Gavin [eg yet again in this thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4egnvh/peter_todd_worried_about_those_willing_to_fork/);

- [apologists](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42xrcy/uydtm_has_created_seven_posts_in_rbtc_in_the_last/) like /u/aminok and [appeasers](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ecx69/uvampireban_wants_you_to_believe_that_a_lot_of/) like /u/vampireban, etc.

So far it's costing those ""certain someones"" only $76 million to run their little coup against Bitcoin - plus whatever it's perhaps costing to stablize the price around $420 (another cruel joke?) to prevent a rush to the exits (and a spinoff / full hard fork) while their controlled demolition of Bitcoin continues.

Pretty cheap compared to the $2-3 trillion those ""certain someones"" threw away on the war against Iraq after that country tried to break away from the Fed's PetroDollar.

TL;DR:

- There is tens of trillions of dollars invested in the *old* system based on planet-killing bombs and soul-killing bureaucracy;

- The current strategies being deployed against Bitcoin, involving social disruption, psyops, censorship, [election-rigging](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ecx69/uvampireban_wants_you_to_believe_that_a_lot_of/), arm-twisting, FUD and technological ""embrace, extend, extinguish"" (RBF, LN) are what they *always* do (initially - before sending in the [""jackals""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confessions_of_an_Economic_Hit_Man)) against any new system which threatens the power of their toxic debt-based fiat;

- The people who support Blockstream are the same kind of of useful idiots those ""certain someones"" *always* enlist (amoral middle managers, borderline autistic anti-social technocrats, petty censors &amp; tyrants, and drive-by character assassins) to pull this kind of shit off.

It's the same old pattern always used by [the people who ""own"" us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsL6mKxtOlQ), and it's repeating itself again here as they try to destroy Bitcoin, using the exact same grab-bag of dirty tricks and useful idiots they *always* use.

And this is why Satoshi is anonymous - because he understood the lengths which those ""certain someones"" would go to, in order to preserve their ecocidal, genocidal Rube Goldberg contraption of toxic debt-based fiat, backed by bombs and bureaucracy, which is slowly killing our planet and quietly killing our souls.",cryptocurrency,1460567616

I've took a look at how to save and I'm familiar with the majority of them, but I'm feeling at the end of my rope as I did the unthinkable and had to use credit card for weekend grocery run once or twice.

technology,Transcript from congressional debate supporting H.R.2666 net neutrality bill. [short],"The first paragraph is bureaucratic junk, but the base-less, fear mongering pitch starts a few lines below. Take note the lack of evidence supporting the claims. 

MR. BURGESS: HOUSE RESOLUTION 672 PROVIDES FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2666, THE NO RATE REGULATION OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS ACT. THE RULE PROVIDES ONE HOUR OF DEBATE, EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY OF THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE ON RULES MADE IN ORDER THREE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE, ALL THREE OF WHICH WERE SUBMITTED BY THE MINORITY. FINALLY, THE RULE AFFORDS THE MINORITY THE CUSTOMARY MOTION TO RECOMMIT, A FINAL OPPORTUNITY TO AMEND THE LEGISLATION SHOULD THE MINORITY CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THAT OPTION. H.R. 2666, THE NO RATE REGULATION OF BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS ACT, WAS INTRODUCED BY MR. KINZINGER, A MEMBER OF THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF AN OUT OF CONTROL, INDEPENDENT AGENCY, THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, OR THE F.C.C. THE BILL IS TARGETED AND DOES ONE THING ONLY. IT PROHIBITS THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION FROM REGULATING THE RATES CHARGED FOR BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS. IN FEBRUARY OF 2015, THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION VOTED ON A PARTY LINE VOTE TO ADOPT RULES THAT RECLASSIFIED BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS AS A TITLE 2 TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE, REVERSING THEIR PREVIOUSLY STATED POSITION THAT THEY WOULD NOT RECLASSIFY THE INTERNET UNDER TITLE 2 AND IN FACT AFTERWARDS THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF INTERJECTED INTO THE DEBATE AND DEMANDED THAT THE COMMISSION RECONSIDER AND THAT THEY DO SO. THE RULES PREVENT BLOCKING AND PAID PRIORITIZATION OF THE INTERNET. THIS HE RE-CLASSIFICATION POSES A SERIOUS RISK FOR RATES CHARGED BY PROVIDERS FOR INTERNET SERVICE, A MOVE THAT'S NEVER BEFORE BEEN TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT. UNDER THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION UNPRECEDENTED USE OF A 100-YEAR-OLD STATUTE TO REGULATE THE INTERNET UNDER ITS, AND I'M QUOTING HERE, NET NEUTRALITY RULE, CLOSE QUOTE, THEY GAVE THEMSELVESES THE THRT TO REGULATE THE RATES THAT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS CHARGE TO CONSUMERS FOR SERVICE. IN RESPONSE TO THIS POWER GRAB BY THE COMMISSION, THE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE HELD OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND THAT RESULTED IN THE DRAFTING AND PASS ODGE OF THE LEGISLATION BEFORE THE HOUSE THIS WEEK. WHICH IS INTENDED TO PREVENT THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION FROM USING RECLASSIFICATION OF BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE TO ENGAGE IN RATE REGULATION. WHETHER THAT BE DIRECTLY THROUGH TARIFFING OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. RATE REGULATION OR EVEN THE THREAT OF RATE REGULATION OUT OF THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CREATES MASSIVE UNCERTAINTY FOR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE OF THIS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD SLOW OR STOP ALTOGETHER THE INVESTMENT AND WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO OFFER SPECIALIZED OR UNIQUE PRICING OFFERS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. AS THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CONSOLIDATES MORE AND MORE POWER TO REGULATE THE INTERNET, AND MAKE NO MISTAKE THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION IS VERY EAGER TO REGULATE THE INTERNET, PROVIDERS WILL HAVE FEWER AND FEWER AVENUES FOR PROVIDING CONSUMER SERVICE PLANS AND PACKAGES. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION, TOM WHEELER, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA, HAVE SAID NET NEUTRALITY RULES WOULDN'T RESULT IN F.C.C. REGULATING RATES. YET LESS THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE RULE WAS ADOPTED, DURING AN ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE, CHAIRMAN WHEELER STATED THAT THE F.C.C. SHOULD AND WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REGULATE BROADBAND RATES UNDER THESE NEW RULES. LIKE ALL GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS, LIKE ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATION COMMISSION CAN'T HELP ITSELF. IT SEES AN UNREGULATED SPACE, THE INTERNET, AND CAN'T ALLOW IT TO GO ON WITHOUT GOVERNMENT CONTROL. UNDER NET NEUTRALITY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE INTERNET. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. UNDER NET NEUTRALITY, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THE INTERNET. EVEN IF THIS CURRENT FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION CHOOSES NOT TO REGULATE THE RATES CHARGED, THE COMMISSION'S NET NEUTRALITY RULES PERMIT FUTURE F.C.C. COMMISSIONERS FROM DOING EXACTLY THAT. THESE RULES FROM THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATION COMMISSION HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO COST WELL NORTH OF 43,000 JOBS ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES TELECOM ASSOCIATION. THE BILL BEFORE US THIS WEEK WILL TAKE A STEP TOWARD PROTECTING INTER-- THE INTERNET INDUSTRY FROM THOSE JOB LOSSES. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT TODAY'S RULE AND SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING LEGISLATION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM AN OUT OF CONTROL FEDERAL BUREAUCRACY. I RESERVE THE BALANCE OF MY TIME.

We are both 32 years old, we have a beautiful 6 month old baby, and we do pretty well for ourselves. We have made some decent life choices and have Zero credit card debt. We purchased a Two-Family house (in Massachusetts) 6 years ago, and since then have made many updates and upgrades. The initial idea was to keep the property as an investment property for the long-term, however, we have grown tired of being landlords; too many variables - too many headaches. We have an opportunity to flip the property for over twice as much as what we paid for it, which will allow us to meet a lot of goals quicker than dealing with Rental Income. We are looking to net around $260,000 off the overall sale of the property. The idea is to use the profit to pay off all of our fixed debt that we currently have. I will break out everything below. 

We do not have much of a savings account currently, only $3,000, since most of our savings go into my 401k. We intend to have a decent safety net after buying our home. We are looking to put down 20% and *only* use monthly income to pay our mortgage. We obviously want to avoid using savings to pay our mortgage or monthly expenses. With that said....

**I have 3 Questions:**

1. How much house can we afford at a 3.50% interest rate over 30 years? 
1. Should we look into a financial planner when we sell and buy a new house?
1. What should our goals be moving forward?

personalfinance,Need Some Advice on my Financial Situation (Current and Future Planning),"All,

Please note, I have set up a throwaway account to protect my identity. I have friends who follow me on here, and I would like to keep information I am about to disclose a secret. I have a slightly complex financial situation, and I would like some information on the best strategy moving forward.

**Information:**
Male, 27, Single, No income tax state, BA and MS holder

**Current Financial Situation:**
**Income:** $79,600 pre-tax. $21,000 income from renting, $6,500 per year in dividends from taxable portfolio currently valued at $155,000. 

**Primary Debt:** 223,000 mortgage balance against a property value appraised at $345,000 recently. 30 year fixed mortgage, 4% interest non-escrow tax, but paid on 12/31 every year. CC paid in full every period, no other revolving debt obligation. The $21,000 in rental income is from rental spare rooms in my house. 

**Taxable Investment portfolio value:** $155,000

**401k/Roth:** 401k currently value of approximately $15,000, Roth at $3,000. I only apply 4% of my income to receive the company match. I haven't funded my Roth in about five years. 

**Other miscellaneous assets:** $15,000 in gold bullion, $3,000 in silver bullion. 

**Net cash after all expenses and 401k deductions available for investing:** About $4,000 per month. 

**Things on my mind**

**1)** In the future, I will have a sizable windfall from my parents. I am fortunate enough to come from a fairly wealthy family, so between my siblings and I, this is projected to be an eight figure number between us. The timetable is unknown at this time because my parents are currently in their late 50s. 

**2)** I place a very high priority on cash flow, which is why I opt to invest the minimum into my 401k and Roth, and invest heavily into my taxed account. I like this because it gives me cash I can use to replace my current income or use as supplemental income. 

**Questions**

**1)** What is the optimal strategy here in order to preserve wealth (pre-windfall)? The windfall is one of the largest regions why my safety net is so high. I'm against paying down my mortgage for tax purposes, but I am also inclined to pay it down faster so I can roll it into a new home into the future. Is this a better strategy than investing into a taxable portfolio? If I pay down my mortgage, my return is technically the interest rate * (1 - tax rate). The problem is, the cash is not liquid anymore.

**2)** Based on my current situation (not including the windfall), what is the best tax strategy to use that does not involve maxing out my 401k? What is the best capital flexibility strategy?

**3)** Can I use the future projected windfall to take on calculated risk elsewhere? For instance, purchasing real estate vs stocks?",finance,1460582917

So for spring term I took that aid (through direct unsubsidized Stafford loan) and used it to pay off the CC. I'm planning on working full time in the summer and will be able to prevent the interest from being tacked onto the principle every month.

Does all of this sound like a reasonable/financially safe and sound idea?

personalfinance,Credit card company says I have to default on a payment before they will lower my minimum payment.,"I'm stupid sometimes and weed makes me more stupid. I racked up $4000 on a credit card buying weed and other stupid things for myself and my spouse along with $2000 on 2 others for a grand total of $8000 in debt. 


Last year I quit a high paying yet stressful retail job to pursue my dreams of becoming an artist/graphic designer or at least finding something less stressful. It's been somewhat successful. I managed to find a temp gig that got me qualified for unemployment...for a while. I had a part time job that helped me extend my unemployment that I lost about a month ago because my boss was crazy.

Now I'm 6 months pregnant and no one wants to risk hiring me at this moment. 

I receive about $1,200 a month and have a balance of a little over $4000 left to receive.

My husband is currently looking for work.

I have a $250 car payment to make, $125 minimum on the highest balance credit card, $65 and $25 on the other. In theory I should be able to handle these payments however, when I get paid and when the bills are due screws me up. I get paid twice a month and one check mostly goes to bills since they are all due around the same time. This keeps me in the cycle of barely affording groceries or any extras that come up. I washed my phone accidentally and had to replace it along with renewing my car registration which really made money tight. 

We live with my in laws who are very thankfully turning the large extra family room into somewhat of a studio apartment for us. Until the floors are done I can't get my computer or desk set up to create. We very fortunately don't pay rent. 

We should get a little over $1500 back on our taxes. I'm struggling to get the $4000 card paid off and when I talked to the company they said they had programs to help me pay off the debt....once I default on my payments. I asked her how many payments I would have to default on to get help and they said I could call the day after a missed payment and get help. They could not offer me a lower interest rate. It's currently 25%.

Should I risk lowering my credit score even further and default on the payment? We're trying to save money for our first child and we're already off to a bad start. By the way I haven't smoked in over 7 months and I hope to continue after he's born.

Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Edit: I know I should be making more than the minimum payment. If I didn't have to pay such a high interest I could get the card paid off a lot faster.",finance,1460587483
personalfinance,10yr nonprofit loan forgiveness for student loans?,"I got an offer from a company called Axianta Financial Partners regarding consolidating my student loan debt and one of their programs is supposedly a program introduced by the federal government which basically states that while employed full time for a public service organization, if you make 120 on-time payments, the remainder of the loan would be forgiven at the end of that.  I'm thinking of starting my own nonprofit anyways later this year and they say that would count.  So I could start my nonprofit, maintain at least 30hrs a week working for my nonprofit, making the minimum monthly payments, and at the end of 120 payments, the remainder would be forgiven.

personalfinance,Kinda strange question about student debt,"So my parents were co-signers on my student loans. I finished a few yrs ago with a couple different federal and state student loans to the tune of a little over $100k. Since my avg interest rate was around 11% and my parents had paid off the mortgage in their home, they took out a new mortgage at around 6%, paid off the debt, and now I pay their mortgage each month. Note: this was very generous of them and I'm very appreciative.

My question: I have a good job and make decent money. Can I take out new student loans on my own, pay off their mortgage, and continue to pay the funds off as student debt? Or would I be required to use the funds for education if I were to take out new loans? 

I just don't want to get screwed down the line if there is some sort of federal student debt forgiveness program (like what was just announced for student borrowers with disabilities) when I really wouldn't need a co-signer at this point, and they're really student loans in spirit (not that I would expect to be able to rationalize the situation with a bank or govt entity, but just so my thought process is clear).

As you can see, no room for entertainment in the budget. I am single, with no prayer of dating until I get my finances in order. I am 35 years old and have poor spending habits.

That's all my outgoing.  I did some reviews online looking for a not for profit debt consolidation company and applied for a personal loan equal to the amounts of my credit card debit to pay those off, hopefully get a lower interest rate and have 1 monthly payment that I can pay off quicker.

One Main Financial offered me a loan of up to $7500 48 month  personal loan with a monthly payment of between 240 and 340 depending on other services I wanted.  By my calculations that seems about a 20% interest rate...not ideal

Consolidated Credit Solutions offered a monthly payment of $204 with and estimated time for 4 years to pay off my lenders while those accounts get closed.  3 of the credit card company's accepted around 9% interest rate while Citi accepted a 16% interest rate.

So my question is would it be more beneficial to take the personal loan and pay off the debts, keep the accounts open but not ever touch the cards, or do the debt consolidation route and close the cards but pay less monthly?

Also if you know of any reputable debt consolidation companys  that may offer a lower monthly payment or a better avenue to apply for a personal loan that may offer a lower interest rate please let me know.  My credit score is between 600 and 640 all credit cards and car loans are current and no late payments showing ever. I have a checking account and savings account with Chase.

personalfinance,"Fiance has over $7,500 in credit card debt. Need advice!","TL;DR - My fiancé told me she has $7,500 in credit card debt. We get married in 6 months and want to fix this ASAP. I just started my career and make $70,000 a year. She's a student and part-time worker, making about $15,000 a year. I need advice on how to proceed with paying off the debt.

I’ll be honest, I need some really good advice right now. I have always been really good with my money, keeping everything in the bank and spending very frugally. I have never had any credit card debt. I use a credit card, but always pay off the balance at the end of the month. Unfortunately, I'm about to marry somebody who's the exact opposite. I was speaking with my fiancé about her finances a couple days ago and she revealed to me that she has taken on over $7,500 in debt. This wasn't a huge surprise because this isn't the first time that this has happened. We've been together for over 6 years and she's always struggling to pay off her credit card debt. But this is definitely the worst it's ever been. We are getting married in October and need to make some quick decisions! 

My fiancé has agreed to let me take control of her finances including handling all of her paychecks, bank accounts, and debt.  Her debt is split between a personal loan and a credit card.  She has about $5,600 on the loan and $1,900 on the credit card.  The loan has a 14.75% interest rate and the card has a 10.9% interest rate.  In total, she’s accruing about $82/month in interest. 

Here's some more information about us. My fiancé and I are both 25.  She is a student who works at a retail store part-time and makes about $15,000 a year. I graduated from college in December and just started my career as a nurse making about $70,000 a year. I managed to finish school with no student loans and no debt. My fiancé has some debt from student loans, but I'm not too concerned about it right now because she is going to be in school for a while. We live in a condo that is owned by my grandfather. Due to an illness he no longer lives here and my family is letting us live here rent free. We pay the homeowners association fee and utilities, but that totals about $350 per month. Other than the normal bills (insurance, her car payment, internet, phones, etc.) we don't have any other major monthly bills. 

This is where I could use some advice. There are few different ways we could pay off the debt, but I'm not sure which would be best. I currently have the money to pay off all her debt in one lump sum but I'm reluctant to do this because it would significantly drain my accounts. Another option I'm considering is opening up a credit card through my bank that advertises 0% interest for the first 12 or 18 months on transferred balances (depending on the card I choose). There is, however, a 3% fee for all transferred balances which would cost about $225. Assuming I’m approved for the total amount of the debt, I see this as the best option.  We belong to different banks (I have BofA, she has a Credit Union), but I spoke to my bank and they said the transfer could be done if I add her as an authorized user on the account.

My big concern is the potential impact on my credit score and ability to borrow money or open other accounts in the future.  I have a good FICO score (761) and don’t want to destroy it.  Again any advice you can give would be much appreciated. We obviously have a lot of financial issues to work through, but that's a completely different conversation.",finance,1460603593

personalfinance,"Which type of loan is best, Rural Development or Conventional?","First time home buyer, trying to figure out which route to go in selecting a loan. One loan officer recommends rural development, which is ""0 down"" but carries a 2.75% USDA fee that rolls into total loan amount, so borrowed amount will be greater than selling price of home. Another officer recommends a conventional loan saying that ~3% could be better used to create equity, and will put me in a much better position when selling the house b/c the loan amount will be for less than selling price, and might prevent me having to come up with money at the closing table. The catch with conventional is the interest rate is so much higher (3.375% RD, 4.25% conv. (taking a hit to not have to pay PMI)). 

The Loan Estimates show that after five years for RD I'll have spent $51,500 on P&amp;I and $16,000 on principal, and with conventional I'll have spent $45,200 on P&amp;I and $13,200 on principal. The total interest percentage is much higher on the conventional (77% vs. 59%) but I'm more interested in the 5 year number, as I don't plan to stay in this house long. If I understand this correctly I could say that technically the $4400 I've put down adds to the principal on the conventional, so that after five years I'd actually have ~$17,600 equity in the house, whereas with the RD, I'd still just have $16,000?? Another way to look at it is I can spend $51,500 to get $16,000 in equity, or $45,200 to get $13,200 (or $17,600 if my above hypothesis is right) in equity over five years. The RD loan also requires private mortgage insurance for the life of the loan at about $60/month, so that would put it's five year cost up another $3600.

Based on my limited understanding of loans I'd say the conventional is better in the short term because, although I'll have to come up with more money in estimated closing costs, I'll have a few thousand more in equity, with less spent on P&amp;I payments and a smaller loan to pay off when selling.

First time borrower for auto besides my school loan so it could very well be an easy mistake. Sorry for grammar and spelling and I suck at math so that could be it also.

1st place I went to for loan will be called: Bank 1

My works credit union will be called: Bank 2 

I bought a new car in Jan of 2015 it was around 40k-42k but I put 10k down and took a loan out for the rest should be around 30k-32k. My payment book that I got from the bank 1 says 36 payments at 543.94, last payment will be jan 18th 2018. Now if we do a quick math problem right here 543.94 x 36 = 19,581.84 which is about 10k lower then what it is suppose to be, did someone fuck this up?

Moving along my work open up bank 2 and I heard threw a lot of people to go refinance your car loan after a year or so for a better rate. I would have gone threw them in the beginning but they opened up a few months after I bought my car. So I go talk to the guy at bank 2 we go over all the details. I did have to call bank 1 they said I have about 28k left to go(again doesn't add up) but I did find I have about an interest rate of 6.89% probably sounds high but again im under 25 credit score about 640ish and have a student loan out in my name.

Bank 2 said they could get me an interest rate of 5% at a monthly payment of about 518 for 5 years. Quick math check 518 x 60 = 31,080 on a 28k loan sounds about right with interest. 

So if I had to guess it sounds like bank 2 is right and bank 1 is wrong but why would they send me a payment book for 36 months when I should have to pay for 60 months? Quick math check for that 543.94 x 60 = 32,636 which does sound closer to right then before. Will they be sending me another book with 24 months left in which case what idiot thought this would be simpler for me? Should I go to bank 2 and ask as there math seems to add up more then then bank 1? 

Disclaimer: For people who are awesome at math and would like to run the numbers please be advised most of the number I got were ball park figures close to what they actually are so they might not add up to the cent as long as they are around 1k I would say that's about right. Nothing is set in stone and subject to change once I get the 10 day payoff from bank 1 which should come soon and can update with the actual solid numbers if need be.

I'm a grad student in the United States, and I've been here for about a little more than a year, which classifies me as a non-resident alien. I'm able to save around $1000 per month, and I've been putting all my savings in my Wells Fargo savings account which provides a paltry annual interest rate of 0.01%. I have around ~$15k in there.

However, one question that I was hoping someone can answer: in economies like Sweden where GDP growth is back to pre-recession levels (4.5% YoY in Q4 2015, http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/gdp-growth-annual) and inflation is below their target (core CPI: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/core-inflation-rate, headline CPI: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/sweden/inflation-cpi), why would the Riksbank use negative interest rate policy to keep their currency weak and stoke inflation? 

The economy is already growing strongly and negative interest rates only increase the risk of the economy overheating or distortions in various markets, like real estate for example. Why wouldn't Sweden employ the mid-2000s China playbook of building up substantial FX reserves to keep their currency weak, provide their central bank with greater monetary firepower backed by FX reserves, and also limit price distortions from negative interest rates?

Put simply, why is Sweden not ""printing"" it's way out of an overvalued currency and low inflation? Is it only because that would signal explicit currency intervention (and generate negative political goodwill) whereas the monetary policy route is more an implicit action?",finance,1460660015

I've stopped that and barely use them at all anymore but the damage has been done...and seems literally impossible to work myself out of it.

$20k in credit card debt
$5k left on a personal loan
$5k left on my car
$2k left on federal student loans

the car, personal loan, and student loans are not my main concern.  they all have end dates within the next 2 years, they'll be paid off.  so there is light at the end of the tunnel for these

my concern is the $20k in credit card debt spread out over 3 cards.  I make payments every month but with the interest it goes no where.  there is no end in site for them.  after making payments on the other 3 debts, and paying all my other bills and expenses, I generally have like 300-500 to put towards the credit cards and that does nothing.  not to mention the fact that just about every penny I earn goes towards a bill or a payment of some sort, I occasionally have to use the credit card to pay for stuff, especially big unexpected stuff.

I was in denial for a long time thinking id be able to get it under control eventually, but life experience has now made me realize unexpected and necessary expenses arise all the time.  and months and months of being good and not spending much at all can be wiped out in one swift stroke if an unexpected large expense arises...

I just don't know what to do at this point.  bankruptcy?  is there some sort of debt consolidation option?  I am thinking of taking another pension loan in july once my current one is paid off. to put towards one of the credit cards, because the interest rate on a pension loan for me is lower than the credit cards and I am already used to the deduction from my check at this point, but that will only be about $6k.  I'll still have $14k in credit card debt....

I mean budgeting at this point seems like it is not gonna do anything.  I am already budgeting for the most part...seems like at this rate my credit cards will never be paid off...

sorry, this has been building for like 2-3 years now and my denial and ignorance is finally wearing off and panic is starting to set in.  just wondering if anyone could give me an idea of what my options are at this point....again the problem is interest, I have calculated that if interest wasn't a factor I could pay off the whole thing in like 4 years.  but this is the real world and interest is a thing, so I don't know what to do...",finance,1460663122

29 year old Married with a year old kid, single earner. Income: ~$170k/yearly Salary(~145k)+Bonus.  
Auto Loan: $8500 at 2.5% (3 years left)  
Mortgage: $513500 at 3% (5/1 ARM, 9 months into a 30 year loan) I know ARM might have been a bad decision. At that time we were planning on living in the house for only 6-7 years but things have changed and we might live here for the foreseeable future.    
401k: ~$50k (Contributing full amount yearly with 50% match)   
Savings: ~$32k Cash (Easily good for 6-7 months)     
I bought a new house last year for $650k(High COL) with 20% down and no PMI. At that time, back of the envelope math suggested that if I pay off the loan fast enough, I will come ahead with a low interest of 3% 5/1 ARM (2% yearly cap after Year 5) than 3.8% 30 year fixed considering the net present value of the future cash flow will be lower for the higher interest payment later. This would be the case if I paid a substantial amount in the first five years before the interest rates increase. So unless interest rates go through the roof, my gamble should pay off.    

I plan on saving ~$50k per year extra towards loan payment from here on out and more if my income increases. I am a relatively frugal guy and have been saving at that rate in the past to pay off my student loans(I have two masters degrees) and build my down payment.  One of the things that I hear is that if your effective interest rate is lower than 2.5% (Mortgage interest being tax deductible) you are better off investing that money rather than paying off the loan.   

I am conflicted right now whether to start paying of the mortgage right away or invest it such that I can make a lump sum payment in year 5 if my interest rates are going to go up.  I have already gambled by taking the 5/1 ARM and betting on the interest rates to not go up substantially so gambling on risky investment wouldn't be ideal but I cannot find any safe investments that give me a better rate than what I am paying for my mortgage. Do you guys have any suggestions on what I should do ?  

Should I start by paying off my auto loan and then start aggressively paying off my mortgage or should I invest and if so, where should I invest ?

1) I want to open one more credit card, just to have the line of credit open and not to change our spending habits whatsoever. It's meant to be a credit-boosting move. I understand that I should not open it really close to applying for the new house, and I assume 2 years out would be fine. But how close to the purchase of the new house is too close? 18 months out? 12 months out?

2) We're paying off student loans, but I also know that closing those installment loans can hurt our credit in the short-term. Our last lender said that any installment loans with fewer than 10 payments left wouldn't count against us in the home buying process. Is that standard? We are capable of paying them off completely about 12 months out from the purchase of the new house. Should we go ahead and pay them off then or pay them down to 10 payments and then just let them hang there, closing them up quickly after our new mortgage is secured?

Based on the advice here it seems obvious I should just pay off my loans as rapidly as possible, starting with the highest interest rates. The only complication is that I'm not sure my income will stay at this level, and it's likely to drop substantially. I'll make this much for a couple more years, but then may switch to something (also public service) that pays much less. If I do that, my IBR payments would drop back down and I might save a bit.

investing,A short explanation of unconditional versus conditional expectations (aka educating /u/Vagina_Fang),"This post is one last attempt to get through to /u/vagina_fang who was quite insistent in the following (now locked) thread that using the historical average of past returns was the only correct way of coming up with expected returns for the market.

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4duabs/mark_cuban_claims_that_cash_is_king_and/

You want to take the unconditional average of the historical returns. That’s perfectly fine. What the various people you were arguing with were saying is that you might also want to consider what’s going on more broadly. In other words, using historical realized returns as a proxy for expected returns is not the only way to make a forecast.

You may already know all this, but it may be useful to review what a conditional versus unconditional expectation is. Suppose you are interested in forecasting the temperature in Los Angeles. You look at the data for last 100 years and take the average. That’s the unconditional expectation. Is that the best you can do when making a forecast? Yes, if that’s all the information you have. But suppose you also know that it’s summer time. Obviously your forecast of the temperature, conditional on it being summer, is going to be higher.  Again you use the historical data, but now instead of using all the data points, you use the ones for summer. Suppose you further know that the forecast period is night time. Again, you’d incorporate this other piece of information to get the conditional temperature forecast for a summer evening in LA.

So when you are shouting 9% as the expectation for stock returns on the basis that it's the long-run historical average (calculated correctly with the right data, hopefully), you are like the person who always forecasts 15 degrees Celsius for the temperature in LA. If the forecast period is night time in the summer, you can do better by using this information. Similarly you can form better expectations of stock returns if you account, for example, for the very low level of interest rates.

Here you might object that using information about interest rates is based on opinions and views. Of course you are right since the term structure is based on how market participants are pricing bonds.  But it’s a very mild and reasonable use of conditioning information. Again, if we go back to the weather forecasting analogy, we are using something like day versus night or the season of year. It’s using some conditioning information, but nothing like the mountains of atmospheric data that actual weather forecasters crunch with their supercomputers.

Similarly in markets, you’ve got hedge funds and other institutional investors crunching huge amounts of information using very sophisticated computer programs. You don’t understand or trust this sort of approach. Fine. But that doesn’t mean you should completely ignore ALL information about the current economic environment. Finally, if you think information surprises don't matter since they ""just average out"" over the long run, take a look at Elton's 1999 paper. He finds that there are periods of over 50 years in which risky long term bonds underperform the risk free rate! How does that square with your notion that using the unconditional expectation is the always the right thing to do??

**TL, DR:** Always predicting 9% (or whatever) for the market return is like being the weather forecaster who always predicts 15 degrees Celsius for the temperature in Los Angeles. You can do better by taking into account what else is going on.",finance,1460672691

The April 18 tax deadline is coming up. If you need more time to file your taxes, you can get an automatic six-month extension from the IRS.

Obviously, the best option is to finish your taxes on time.  [The IRS will be keeping its toll-free telephone service lines open](https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/Tax-Time-Guide-Use-Free-File-for-Help-with-Tax-Returns-Extensions-and-More) at 1-800-829-1040 from 9am to 5pm local time on Saturday, April 16, to assist people as well.  (Hat tip: /u/these-things-happen.)

Even if you are filing an extension, you should estimate how much you owe and pay that amount by April 18th to avoid interest and penalties.  If you can't afford to pay the entire amount, pay as much as you can and apply for an installment agreement (both of those actions will reduce penalties and interest).

Here is what you need to know about filing an extension:

- **Method 1: Use IRS Free File to file an extension.** You can use [IRS Free File](https://www.irs.gov/uac/Free-File:-Do-Your-Federal-Taxes-for-Free) to e-file your extension request for free. Free File is only available through IRS.gov. You must e-file the extension request by midnight April 18. If you do request an extension, come back to Free File to prepare and e-file your taxes for free. You can access the program at any time through Oct. 17.

personalfinance,"(CAN) 26 year old student, with no savings and 4500 dollars in credit debt looking to work towards something better.","Hello all. I'm currently living on my own in a bachelor suite and attending school this semester. I haven't decided on a program but I'm taking relevant prerequisites to the science field, and I'm fed up with my spending and lack of saving for the future. My sister recently got married and I couldn't even get her a wedding gift or contribute to her honeymoon fund because I'm so poor, and basically living paycheck to paycheck.

My suite I'm renting is 695 per month, without cable or internet. I have a smart phone which is 58 dollars per month, and my internet bill has gone off promotion to 120 dollars a month. I also do martial arts classes that are 170 dollars a month, however due to the lack of financial balance in my life I'm considering putting it on hold and coming back to it later. I don't even know what I spend on groceries since I've moved out I've been eating out more and skimping on grocery shops to try to save money, and I often throw away fresh food when it goes bad :( I usually try to spend less than 200 dollars per month on groceries. I've used a tax free savings account for several years but very often life has hit me in the face and I've had to spend hundreds on physiotherapy and other unexpected expenses. I also had a period over Christmas where I couldn't get enough hours at my workplace which caused me to go even further into credit debt.

Some personal goals of mine are to pay off my credit card debt that is accumulating interest charges and getting me stuck in a loop, and I'd also like to save up for driving lessons and a car. If I could make those two happen as well as put away for some savings, I'd be extremely happy with myself. Also my pad is lacking some organizational solutions and a few pieces of furniture, and to be honest I'm embarrassed to have company over at the moment, but I can live with that for now.

Thanks for taking time to read my post, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and of course if anyone needs to know more just message me and I'll get back to you ASAP.

Last year we paid $170 for fed, state, education credit(1098t), city earning tax. Along with all of our forms we also sent them a print out of his account details from my husbands schooling. After filing our taxes I decided to double check the work and I discovered the amounts on the 1098t did not match the account details. So we had to get 2014 amended with this years. This year we added a form because my husband now works in a different state and we also bought a house. We sent them the account details again this year. After we receive the email to review and sign for our taxes I noticed they didn't include the education credit. I called and was told its because the 1098t showed we basically got $2000 extra in scholarships and grants, we did not. So I went over the account details and again, the 1098t was wrong! We got the new 1098t and they revised our taxes. They emailed us the invoice which was $395! I feel we were already paying them for a service which they failed to find an error on one of our forms. Is that not why we pay a tax professional to do our taxes?! If I didn't catch these errors we would have missed out on $1700 in returns. There's been something wrong on our last 3 returns that I've caught. Being my husbands friends parents, I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. She claims it's because the earnings tax was for half a year so the calculations took longer, she had to email my husband a few times for school receipts, and other forms took an hour and a half to do. She was pretty vague about the charges and when I tried to ask a question I was interrupted by her saying ""I already told you the extra costs"".

personalfinance,"2.5 years on the job, 1/2 through MBA (with debt), mention of a *big* promotion internally and I got an offer from another company. [Employment]","Hello and thank you for reading this. Throw away for anonymity reasons.


I've stuck through my current job with gradual, linear successes (raises, opportunities). Nothing large, just many gradual bumps in commission, account base, small hourly raises, etc. It's fair, but at my job it's difficult to get paid more--our management finds ways to obfuscate/block/stymy any initiatives to innovate and make more $ in commissions.


After I finish my MBA (currently part time), I will be about 55k in debt. I've got a leased car, a great (cheap) apartment, and the means to sustain it (I make about 55k/year plus benefits, medical/dental/vision).


So recently I've been told by the C-Suite/VP officers of my company that I've being considered to replace my boss (Director of Outbound Sales) with no clear timeline. He's been there forever, but has succeeded at being mediocre/unqualified at everything. Upon follow up conversations, I've been told that it, ""could wait until I am done with my degree"". I've also been asked twice if I, ""Feel ready"". I am ready, but am not confident, based on management's style, if they're going to support/appreciate/like my more humane approach (I love organizational behavior). I find this frustrating, as I will be more available for newer/betting paying jobs (that I'm not sure they would match) upon completion.


Mostly, this sounds good—stick it out and maybe there will be something awesome for me. The thing is, I feel like I am not growing anymore—I deal with archaic systems (ancient/error prone CRM), understaffed departments (most are running short by 2-3 people), and a bureaucratic system that takes forever to make decisions. For example, there has been private talk of Employee Ownership for almost a year. Nothings happened.


This brings us to the separate job offer. About 2 months ago I met a corporate recruiter who said he was interested in bringing me onboard his small company. 35k in salary + 20% commission of the salaries associated with my placements. I can also make my own schedule, but would have no benefits. This would allow me to dabble/try it, take more classes, and finish my MBA in a more timely fashion.

personalfinance,I'm asking to borrow an amount less than the total equity in my home. Why isn't this a slam dunk?,"So I'd talk to a banker but I'm effing busy as eff during the day. 

Backstory:  Took out a GreenSky loan for some basement work to the tune of $13,000 @ 18% APR.  It was quick to do and it's been interest free for the first year.  Slowly over the year I whittled that down to $12,000. (I can do more but I'm paranoid about dipping into my 6 month emergency fund, plus I've had to pay $300/mo tuition for my daughters all day kindergarten)

Depending on who you talk to my house is valued at anywhere from $200,000 to $225,000.

The current amount left to pay on my house is $160,000 so $40,000 of pure unadulterated equity in what is also a hot real estate market.

So I figured the bank that I've had a super long history with (Nothing more than checking, savings, credit card but long history regardless) would beg me to borrow money from them.

So I apply online and a week later get a rejection letter back saying my debt to income ratio is too much.

Why the hell are they concerned about that?

If I default on the full $12,000 they get a house worth $200,000 easy. Sure they have to pay $160,000 on it but in the end that's a $27,000 profit.

#1 What am I missing here? Why does the bank care about my debt -&gt; income ratio with the amount of equity in my home being substantially more than the amount I'm asking for?

#2 If I'm going to have this D -&gt; I ratio cloud over my head what's a good alternative for getting something to reduce this interest rate? Prosper and Lending Club can cut it in half but the term lengths are too short for my liking bumping up the monthly payment.

financialindependence,Approximate Time to FIRE: Savings Rate &amp; Current Net Worth vs Years to Retirement and Why Savings Rate is King (OC),"For the last few weeks I've been interested in doing a follow up to the famous MMM post that I'm sure made the idea of FIRE realistic to many of us (obligatory link: [MMM Savings rate Vs Years to Retirement](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)). My motivation is that I've increased savings rate while also increasing net worth; original post focuses only on years to FIRE assuming current net worth of $0.

In below crosstabs, I've combined current savings rate &amp; current net worth in order to approximate number of years until FIRE. It was easiest to convert everything into a fraction of current annual expenditure (included reference for how savings rate translates to that - 50% SR would mean each year you spend 1 year's worth of income and save 1 year's worth of annual expenditure). I've simulated across a number of average returns - all returns are real, aka adjusted for inflation. Staying true to the original MMM post, I'm only including returns during saving years and am simply solving for Savings = 25 x Annual Expenditure (4% SWR).

[Years to FIRE; 2% Return During Saving Years](http://i.imgur.com/p8SnhB5.png)

[
5% Return](http://i.imgur.com/h4yr9Vl.png)

[ALBUM](http://imgur.com/a/YHVCK)

&gt;Legend; Dark Red: &gt;20 Years to FIRE; Dark Green: &lt;3 Years to FIRE

***What immediately stuck out to me is that increasing savings rate decreases the variance associated with years until retirement.*** In all of the below scenarios (based on annual return during savings years and solving for 4% SWR), improving savings rates leads to a drastic decrease in the range of years until FIRE. For example, Years to FIRE w/ 7 years currently saved: 
&gt;20% SR; 33 @ 2% return &amp; 14.7 @ 7% Return 

&gt;80% SR: 4.2 @ 2% vs. 3.7 @ 7%. 

To get to the matrices I used wolfram alpha solver to get to 25x annual expenditure. Final equation I came up with was (can be fed into excel):

&gt;SRE = Savings Rate in Terms of Annual Expenditure; PV = Current Net Worth in Terms of Annual Expenditure; i = interest rate

&gt;LOG((SRE)+25(i))/(SRE+PV(i)))/LOG(1+i)

Edit: For additional info on how to interpret... I'm at 50% SR and 3 years saved:

&gt; 17.5 years @ 2%

&gt; 13.8 years @ 5%

&gt; 12.1 years @ 7%

&gt; 10.4 years @ 10%",finance,1460705022

I recently started a new job where I'm making 33k before taxes (I was making $24k before). I bought a newer car (my old one was a money pit with terrible gas mileage), a modest used Toyota for $5500 after trade in.

I also have 14k of federal student loans. Three separate loans, with interest rates between 4%-5%.

I have three options for this extra amount of money - 

* Savings.  I'm currently building an emergency fund and contributing a minimum $150/month towards it from my day job paycheck. I work as a waitress about twice a month and put this money towards it as well, so I usually put forth about $300 a month. At the current rate, it will take me another 1.5 years to reach my goal of $5000 (My monthly expenses are $1200/month).

* Car payment. I owe $5100, and pay $122/month. It's at 2.9% interest.

Would it make sense to pay off the mortgage faster in that case,  so as to maximize the rental income and divert that to paying off my wife's loans?  Or does the typical wisdom still apply here about putting excess income into the higher interest debts?",finance,1460729789
investing,The Case for BOFI,"I've been following Bank of Internet Federal Bank ([BOFI](https://finance.yahoo.com/q?uhb=uhb2&amp;fr=uh3_finance_vert_gs&amp;type=2button&amp;s=BOFI%2C)) for a good while now. It's got an interesting story behind it. To keep it brief, a former employee who was an internal auditor filed a lawsuit against the company last October, leading to shares dropping some ~30%. 

Yesterday morning, on April 14th, [this](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3965195-walls-closing-branchless-bank) article was posted to Seeking Alpha describing an update to the lawsuit released April 11th, it's main claim being that there is apparently more employees than just that one auditor coming forward.

The bulls argue that the writer of the article (appropriately named ""The Friendly Bear"") has skin in the short game, and was trying to reverse what quite possibly is beginning to look like a short squeeze. That or to cover some April 15th puts as one bull proposed. In the comment section of that SA article, there are many bulls who argue that:
1. The lawsuit is bogus and the stock will be back on track headed to the moon in no time
or
2. Worst case scenario, BOFI pays a few fines and continues on making money, however legal/illegal it is.

The bears argue that shares began to drop before the article was released, which I'm skeptical about because shares closed up ~5% on April 13th - 2 days after the April 11th lawsuit was released, but the day before the SA article was posted on the 14th. Something doesn't add up. How would the top dogs not know the repercussions of that lawsuit update immediately after it was released? I think the bears(/shorts) are dragging this thing down to cover their butts.

Shares somewhat tanked again yesterday down just over 16%. I picked some shares up, but obviously it's an extremely risky bet. I think it's really a compelling story and would love to hear opinions if anyone is familiar or wants to do a little digging along with me.",finance,1460729892
personalfinance,Amended Taxes = smaller refund. Do I send a check with my 1040X or wait until I get my refund?,"I'm sorry to make a separate post about a tax question, I'm a bit late for Tax Tuesday. 

I accidentally deducted an education tax credit based on a 1098-T form from my university for tuition that I was ultimately reimbursed for by my employer and on which I paid no federal income tax (I did pay state and local, which is why I was confused...). So I need to file an amended return. The amended return will reduce my refund by about $1k, but I am still due a refund, which I haven't received yet. According to TurboTax I should include a check with my amended return for $1k, but I'm hesitant to send it without having received my refund, in case the IRS reduces my refund *and* keeps my check. Should I follow TurboTax's advice, or I send the amended form showing the lower refund amount, without a check?

Forex,FNG Friday Forex question,"Lurking for about a month, probably going to become a regular

TL;DR at bottom

a Quick word about my experience so far: 

I've been using a demo FXCM account for a little over a month (+/-). Initially treated it like gambling and was down about $1.5K mainly due to trading stupid large lots because...well, I could. I'm now trading nothing higher than 5 lots, or 50K  and working my way back to even. I've gone from -1.5K in the red to about 750-800 or so in the red. I plan on using real cash when I've gone a couple thousand dollars past break-even. There really is no rush for me, I have a job and don't really want to do this full time - Truthfully I simply find this to be a LOT of fun.

I do have some questions for you though if you'll humor me:

What type of trader are you and how did you choose your style? Swing, day, position, scalper, sniper, X, Y, Z...there are probably dozens of styles idk about even after all the reading I've done so far.

In this same vein, (I am NOT asking you to choose my style) If I am at work and unable to do anything but watch the market and any stop/limits i placed before I left get hit (can't have phone, can't download platform)...do you have any *suggestions* for a style that would mesh with that schedule? Maybe people who are/have been in the same boat?

All of my profitable trades so far have been ""guesses"" or based on (2 specific) candlestick patterns at 30m and up. There was what I took to be a dark cloud cover indicator on the 12th at noon on the EUR/USD at the 1h interval (if you wanted to see it) that I read correctly that got me a good 100+ pips or so, and the shooting star prior to that netted me another 60-70. So I guess I enjoy candlestick patterns? I'm really just trying to find my groove here, and looking for people who have already been there/done that. Other than that my trades basically boil down to guesses - and even if guessing can get me 2,500$ in the green I'm not going to put real cash in until it's not *just* a hunch.

Fib levels, line/trend indicators and bollinger bands. These are currently the only indicators I use, and truthfully I ""use"" them horribly. I know there are more indicators, but these two are what I want to learn right now. babypips has multiple pages of info, fxkeys has info, fxfornoobs, informedtrades, etc. they all have good information but it's just not clicking for me yet. I understand I've only been doing this for about 4-6 weeks and I don't expect to be an expert, but I don't like feeling dumb either. ANY help on these (especially reading them) would be appreciated...I'm still reading about them, but this shit just isn't clicking for me yet. Some ELI4 type stuff lol.

TL;DR - New trader, lost 1.5k with stupid large trades and multiple 1m/5m ""sniper"" style losses, made 700 back with reasonable sized trades, has no trading style at all yet other than minor candlestick pattern recognition, curious how others found their groove, wants to understand fib/bollinger bands much better/at all. I'm not looking to be spoon-fed information, there are just some things I haven't found an answer for, I simply don't understand yet, or would be best answered with actual experience.",finance,1460734602

I'll do my best to provide enough information to let someone guide me, I apologize if I leave anything out. Please let me know what you might need in order to help.

I make all my money on 1099s. I made very little money last year. I did my taxes online using a free tax site, either recommended from here, or the IRS website. I attempted to pay the taxes with a bank transfer, using the website. The website said everything was gravy.

After some time, I get two letters saying the payments didn't work. Fine, whatever, I write two checks, and mail them off.

Then, I get a letter saying they've refunded my state tax into my bank account. This was before any money was ever removed from it. Neither the bank transfer nor the check had gone though. I'm assuming I screwed up my routing info and they billed someone else, refunded it, and sent me a letter saying so.

On april 8th, my check for state taxes was accepted, and on april 12th my federal taxes were accepted. That's to say, the money came out of my account.

Today I received a letter saying ""we reviewed your account and found that payements totaling $899.00 were misapplied to it. We have adjusted your account to correct this error, and as a result you have a balance due of $899.29""

personalfinance,Using Pell Grant as tax-free income to qualify for the American Opportunity Credit?,"I made a thread here a month or so ago and received good help but I lost it when Firefox lost my bookmarks...

I had no job in 2015, so no income. Living in TX, age 26, independent, first bachelor degree. I was told in my last thread that I could use my grants and loans as income that would end up being tax-free, and I would be getting money from the American Opportunity Credit.

For 2015 I have:

* $4700 in Fed Sub loans
* $3586 in Pell Grant
* **Total: $8286** without the following two grants:

* $1535 in TPEG grant (unsure if it's like the Pell Grant)
* $400 in SEOG grant (unsure if it's like the Pell Grant)
* **Total with these grants: $10,221.** I would use this as income in my 1040 form. I believe I was told it would be tax-free but I could still receive a tax return?

I'm confused why this income would end up being tax-free, is it under a limit? I was advised by them to use (if I remember correctly) Form 1098-t, 8863, and 1040?

Here are four images of my censored 1098t and other information:

personalfinance,Benefits of consolidating my school loans. Not sure what to do? Details enclosed.,"A little backstory on myself.

I went to college for 1 year and a half online and ended up with multiple loans over 20k combined. I dropped out of school and started working.

I currently make around $530 Dollars a paycheck (twice a month) depending on what hours i can get. Last year gross i made just over 16k.

Living with my parents they ""charge"" me with 250 dollars a month rent. Also i have the loan plan where i pay a fixed amount for x amount of years till the loan is done. I am paying 229.11 dollars a month towards my school loans.

So right now, one paycheck i pay my parents and the other i pay my school loan, the cycle just goes on.

I looked into consolidating my school loans today and it came with these results. 

My current status is - Current loan remaining 17k, 6 loans with interest rates from 3.4 - 6.8 % fixed rates on all loans. Paying 229.11 each month till loan is paid off, End up paying around 4k total interest for the rest of the loan. 

If i consolidate - Current loan remaining 17 k, Fixed rate interest around 6% I would pay 149 each month till loan is paid off, End up paying around 9k total interest for the rest of the loan.

It is hard enough right now to make things work because im getting like a paycheck a month I just dont know if going from 229 to 149 would help me. Even though it would last longer because of all the interest. Just looking for advice from you guys. I do not know much about this kind of stuff and i'm lost.",finance,1460747389
economy,Why am I wrong?,"So I went to the trouble of writing all this in response to a debate with someone over my bearish perspective on investing for the near term (it was subsequently deleted by a bot). I think it will generally be received favorably here from what I've seen of this sub, but I'm not sure where else it would be appreciated. This captures with less fine grain my opinion of the global economy.

Or just ignore it or whatever.

&gt;Even from a neoliberal perspective the idea of a business cycle with booms and busts is not controversial. On a long enough time line shit will hit the fan. I know that's not specific enough for investment advice, but in general the trend for the 20th/21st centuries are about a recession on the average of roughly 7-8 years.

&gt;But let's get away from the broad strokes and look at the world from a macro perspective. This will remain broader than the keyhole through which you stock market jockeys view the world but is what turns events when your models fail to account for fat-tail risk. First and foremost is the erroneous belief that stability of U.S. market is all that matters. The rise of globalization and interdependence as experienced in the last recession has shown that even relatively small catastrophes can have very large knock-on effects; for a prior historical example look at the south asian currency crises that started with the Thai Bhat and went around the world in 1997.

&gt;Even at the beginning of the year we had an economic downturn attributable, in part, to idiocy on the part of the fed, but also the decline of the Chinese stock market which in turns tanks developing world economies dependent on commodities for their economic growth. The foundation of all economic activity is production of material goods, you cannot have a service economy without this basic economic activity, but you can certainly have a production oriented economy without a service economy. The U.S. is built on a house of cards that has become detached from the underlying constraints of of their valuations. Any bubble works the same, you can have a tangible, scare resource from which are created derivative financial products, but those financial products cannot appreciate in value beyond the same tangible resource indefinitely. This is our current problem.

&gt;As you've said the current growth we are currently experiencing has been driven largely by the actions of the central bank but this is a horrendous problem for several reasons. Foremost is the rising inequality of both wealth and income, which on an accounting ledger means aggregate wealth and income are up, but without the corresponding benefits of a more egalitarian increase. In effect we have misallocated resources to add zeroes to someone who doesn't need it. This in turn increases their ability to achieve rent-seeking positions while driving down, in a vicious cycle, the ability of those people from who they seek rent to pay. It kills aggregate demand, which diminishes opportunity for investment, which leads to budgetary and labor constraints for business and the cycle continues.

&gt;Second reason is the failure of he central banks monetary policy to even meet its goals. At what many consider to be imprudent monetary policy the banks have only been able to keep an even keel on the economy, if that. They have consistently failed to hit their inflation targets and GDP and wage growth have been hugely sluggish, in fact a look at the last few recessions has shown these numbers growing at lower rates with each subsequent recession. In effect the monetary accelerator has been pressed all the way to the floor and we're still falling behind, all that is left is for the engine to burn out. At the same time the fed is looking as a matter of financial politics to raise rates and implement contractionary policy which will further retard growth in an already precarious market.

&gt;Third point looking to the global economy we have the failure of the ECB to act appropriately as a central bank and devalue the euro through the inflationary measures, to the disadvantage of PIIGS. The whole eurozone has foolishly been implementing austerity to no gain. Greece has defaulted 3 times in 5 years and will most likely do so again in July, hurting the euro and being a further drag on the european economy, which as I've said given the interconnectedness of the world will hurt the U.S. Part of the collapse in 2008 was the French freezing their assets in response to the bankruptcy.

&gt;As to China they are stuck with an economy that depends on a favorable exchange rate with the rest of the world, but is growing so fast they are losing that edge. They have two incompatible objectives, that is a rising standard of living and growth, but with cheap labor and their markets are overheating trying to prop up this paradoxical position.

&gt;Finally you point to reforms in the U.S. but these reforms were timid when originally implemented, or have not even been implemented yet while lobbyists continue to silently rollback the more relevant sections in the subsequent years. The market is a house of cards because people don't like to dig deep into cross disciplinary issues the challenge the general structure of our society.

&gt;When the economy tanks people will sink their money into bonds, particularly government bonds at shit rates not because it's a good investment on the matter of returns but because it's a safe investment, just like they did in 2008. And given this incredibly cheap access to credit the government will probably do something stupid because that's what passes for responsibility these days.",finance,1460747515

Another thing to mention is that the rest of the 181k loans was about 21 years left of repay, i now only pay those in 10. 11 years shaved right off. AS WELL as saving me roughly 130 dollars a month in payments as my monthly payment went from 575 to 438.

personalfinance,Friendly reminder: do not budget the money you do not have!,"Hello PF!

I want to tell a short story, so that you guys don't make the same mistake I made: relying heavily on a *potential* income and then never achieve it. 

So last year I moved to a nice apartment. It was my self indulgence, a treat to myself. It has a gym, a swimming pool, a game room, coffee machines, all the things I love. I never had (and still don't have) the plan to live there for more than a year (minimum lease period), but it was going to be a heck of a fun year. And it has been so far.

Of course the nicer place came with a higher bill. Prior to moving, I was able to save up to $800 per month, straight into my 6 months buffer. With the higher rent, I would be able to save about $300, already considering the savings with gym membership and gas (since the location is pretty central). This drop in my savings capability worried me a little first, but I was relieved by 3 factors: Three major out-of-schedule payments I would get. I was expecting a decent tax return, a respectable bonus from work and the profit from an employee stock purchase plan.

Long story short, none of them became reality. My federal tax return broke even between owed and withheld (I was poorly informed, simply based myself on the return I got last year), the company had a bad year, so nobody was paid any bonus, and also due to the bad year, they cancelled the employee stock purchase plan. 

So now I'm holding my breath every month to keep that $300 savings steady. I had projected that I'd have saved around $3000 in this first semester. Needless to say, I'll hardly reach half of that.

My boyfriend on the other hand makes $54,000 a year and gets about $10,000 taken out of his paychecks annually. However, is yearly tax refund is upwards of $2,000. 

My question is, am I doing something wrong? Is this a common problem? Am I getting screwed by the government more than the expected amount of getting screwed? Is there something I can be doing to either maximize my refund or get less taken out of my paychecks?",finance,1460769977

personalfinance,"Making $99,000 - how to minimize my tax burden?","I'm making $99,000 in MA and take home about $5226 every month. I filed for taxes as single, male and with no children. However I did claim 2 exemptions on my W4 (1 federal, 1 state).

Back in college I got huge refunds at the end of the year, but now I'm very concerned that I will instead have to pay the IRS more money at end of the year. Because of this, I'm considering increasing my 401k withholding. It is currently set at 6%, but I'm thinking of increasing it to 15% or more to offset my tax burden.

Does anyone have any tips on how to minimize the amount of taxes I have to pay and hopefully get a refund? What would be the ideal 401k contribution percentage in this case? Is there a calculator that can do all this math out for me?",finance,1460773856
personalfinance,(US-PA) Aunt whom I lived with is trying to claim me as a dependent. Need advice.,"I'm 24, and I moved out of my aunts house in November 2015. I made approximately $5,000 since July- Dec 2015. I filed my taxes at the end of January. I got my return taken by the fed for school loans. My aunt was filing her taxes today and claimed me as a dependent, or tried to anyways. Got a nasty series of texts about how I cost her $1000 for filing as independent.

Now shes come up with a new plan. The text is the following: We will work it out next year. You dont claim yourself, I will, and whatever you get back will still go to school loans. I would then give you a couple hundred.

This sent up like a billion red flags. At the time that I would be filing 2016's taxes, I will have been moved out for over a year. Isn't this fraud of some sort? I am at a loss for what to do.",finance,1460774561
personalfinance,"I just want to double check some info about income based repayment, annual gross income, and tax returns","My wife and I got married in December 2015. We filed our 2015 US Federal taxes as married filing jointly. She has about $160k in student loans from med school. For 2015, her gross income was around $50k, and she is on an income based repayment plan. For 2015, my gross income was around $100k. 

I just want to confirm that since we filed jointly, the next time the government has to adjust her loan payments, they will be using our combined AGI of $150k? Am I right about this? 

If this is the case, then is the best thing for us to do is to change the status of our tax returns to married filed separately so that the government uses a $50k AGI for calculating her monthly loan repayment? And we have until April 18th to make this change and re-file?

This should be the thing to do to save us the most money as the amount of money saved from having much lower loan payments will more than make up for the extra money we have to pay for filing our taxes separately right? Thanks for the help guys!",finance,1460778444

My husband was recently hired on at fedex express part time and we are considering putting money in their offered fsa for dependant care. This is all new to us and seems kind of scary to have our money taken out of each paycheck, but understand that there is a tax benefit. 

I bring home about 40k a year and he is part time, but will bring home around 35k a year at least. We pay $650/month for care 4 days a week for our 14 month old to my mother and we could very well switch to an in home care center for $800/month in the near future. 

My question is: will we only be able to adjust/cancel this contribution if there is a life change or is it an annual evaluation type situation? If I decide it is too much/too little, can I adjust this next year? Also, what kind of money will this be saving us? If you've used this, is it worth it?

**AS SECRETARY OF STATE:**

[Clinton pushed NATO to bomb Libya and it is now a haven for ISIS](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/hillary-clinton-libya.html), she opposed the [restoration of the overthrown elected Honduran president Manuel Zelaya](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/9/hillary-clinton-honduraslatinamericaforeignpolicy.html) and now Honduras is in chaos, she supported [free trade with Colombia that led to slave labor conditions in that country](http://www.ibtimes.com/hillary-clinton-pushes-colombia-free-trade-agreement-latest-email-dump-2326068) even after she had publicly opposed that same free trade agreement, she [made favorable deals with countries that had donated to the Clinton Foundation.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/hillary-clinton-foundation-state-arms-deals)

Clinton's foreign policy can best be described as ""hostile"", [favoring military intervention or oppressive sanctions, particularly in the Middle East.](http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/02/11/the-warmongering-record-of-hillary-clinton/)  This hostility complicates our reputation abroad and creates unintended problems.  However, there is an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" effect where the media consistently portrays Clinton as vastly experienced and capable in foreign policy, despite the ruins and/or chaos left behind in Iraq, Iran, Libya, Honduras, Colombia and soon Syria.

To further this ""Emperor's New Clothes"" effect, Clinton had her Senior Advisor while she was Secretary of State, Philippe Reines, [secretly communicate with journalists of major media sources to encourage them to use glowing praise for Clinton's foreign policy, including use of the adjective ""muscular"".](http://gawker.com/this-is-how-hillary-clinton-gets-the-coverage-she-wants-1758019058)  These journalists were happy to cooperate in exchange for exclusive stories.

[Clinton's embrace of her ties to Kissinger before an audience speaks to her foreign policy](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/02/hillary-clinton-kissinger-vacation-dominican-republic-de-la-renta), yet she seems to feel confident that the average voter will not know who Kissinger is and what he did.

Clinton has worked to maintain close ties to Israel's conservative Likud Party and its leader and oppressive Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Netanyahu dislikes President Obama for not frequently dealing with him.  [Clinton has worked through the Center for American Progress (CAP) and its leader Neera Tanden to smooth over relations with Netanyahu](https://theintercept.com/2015/11/05/leaked-emails-from-pro-clinton-group-reveal-censorship-of-staff-on-israel-aipac-pandering-warped-militarism/), including [a recent speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC)](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/03/21/critics-aghast-disgusting-speech-clinton-just-gave-aipac) where Clinton gave effusive praise for Israel and the need for America to maintain close ties with Israel and offer unconditional support for the country despite its mistreatment of Palestinians and exaggeration of Palestinian violence compared to Israeli usurpation of land and water rights in the region.

When Clinton was secretary of state, [she helped Swiss bank UBS avoid the IRS after they helped wealthy Americans dodge their taxes, then UBS gave $1.5M to Bill Clinton for a speech.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/hillary-helps-a-bankand-then-it-pays-bill-15-million-in-speaking-fees/400067/)

**AS A CAMPAIGNER:**

**Political favoritism**

Clinton got hundreds of superdelegate endorsements long before the primary started.  These superdelegates stubbornly refuse to change their endorsements, even when their states have gone for Sanders.  [Clinton has a vast donor network to which these superdelegates are all connected, and they are essentially ""locked in"" to support her.](http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/04/01/how-hillary-clinton-bought-the-loyalty-of-33-state-democratic-parties/)  There is also concern that [Clinton exerts pressure on these superdelegates through political coercion.](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/hillary-clinton-hit-list-102067)

Of these superdelegates, many [Senators](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-senate-democrats-218751) and [Representatives](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/268325-democratic-establishment-starts-to-gang-up-on-sanders) have either offered excessively flattering praise for Clinton or rebukes for Sanders, or both.  Notably, Harry Reid, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, Claire McCaskill, Nancy Pelosi.

The same Harry Reid [coordinated with a union in Nevada to let their workers out with pay so that they could caucus for Clinton.](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/270163-reid-powerful-union-come-to-clintons-aid)

Elizabeth Warren, who did not endorse either candidate, [is hounded constantly by her peers to endorse Clinton.](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/268161-female-senators-urge-warren-back-hillary)

The DNC is clearly supporting Clinton.

Gabbard had to leave the DNC to endorse Sanders.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz has also [attacked Elizabeth Warren's legislation to stop payday lenders, seemingly in retribution for Warren's refusal to endorse Clinton.](http://www.salon.com/2016/03/01/dnc_chair_debbie_wasserman_schultz_joins_hands_with_gop_in_assault_on_elizabeth_warrens_consumer_protection_agency/)

Clinton uses her husband and her daughter to hurt Sanders.  Bill has campaigned in front of voting places in [Boston](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2016/03/01/bill-clinton-massachusetts-voting-laws/) and [Chicago](http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/Bill-Clinton-Campaigns-for-Hillary-Clinton-in-Chicago-on-Election-Day-372124682.html) on their election days, which veers on illegal electioneering and kept people from making their votes that day.  [Chelsea has lied about Sanders' healthcare plans](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/chelsea-clinton/chelsea-clinton-mischaracterizes-bernie-sanders-he/), claiming that he will repeal the Affordable Care Act rather than use it as a backstop until implementing the superior Medicare for All that Sanders wants instead.

Hillary Clinton relies heavily on her husband Bill's appeal with black voters.  That is why people have referred to the South as her ""firewall"", because there are many black voters in the South who fondly remember Bill's presidency and will vote for a Clinton over any other candidate. The Southern states did vote overwhelmingly for Clinton, but recently Bill had a run-in with the black rights activist group Black Lives Matter bringing him to task for his crime reform that put so many black people in prison and his welfare reform that denied relief to the poorest black people.  Black Lives Matter also demanded that Bill answer for his wife's use of the racist code phrase [""remorseless superpredators""](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/270811-clinton-i-shouldnt-have-used-the-superpredator-remark) to justify the crime reform. [Bill handled himself very poorly, becoming defensive and trying to justify the bills he had signed into law even after he had apologized for the crime bill last year.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/08/opinions/bill-clinton-black-lives-matter-protesters-opinion-garza/) This has turned black voters against Bill Clinton.  However, with the predominantly black Southern states out of the way in the primary, Bill Clinton's appeal with those same black voters has already done its job for Hillary Clinton's campaign.

**Media favoritism**

Clinton has clout with every news source. She got endorsements from New York Times and Washington Post, and gets consistently favorable coverage from CNN, NBC, ABC, PBS, NPR, and Univision, while [those same networks either ignore Sanders](https://theintercept.com/2015/10/14/cable-news-edits-out-rousing-sanders-attack-on-vapid-media-coverage/), even when [he wins overwhelming victories](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/3/28/bernie_sanders_wins_landslides_in_washington), or belittle his campaign and his chances. [Many of those networks are contributors to the Clinton campaign.](https://theintercept.com/2015/10/29/media-fundraisers-presidential/)

When Clinton had a young black woman escorted out of her South Carolina fundraiser for demanding an explanation for the [""we have to bring them to heel""](https://theintercept.com/2016/02/25/activists-want-hillary-clinton-apologize-hyping-myth-superpredators-1996/) remark, [Clinton got an immediate audience with Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post to clear up her image with black voters.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/25/hillary-clinton-responds-to-activist-who-demanded-apology-for-superpredator-remarks/)

The same Jonathan Capehart of the Washington Post [lied to hurt Sanders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/11/stop-sending-around-this-photo-of-bernie-sanders/), by claiming that Sanders was not the subject of a civil rights photo, even when [the photographer himself verified it was Sanders.](http://www.snopes.com/sanders-civil-rights-photos/)

When Clinton was confronted by a Greenpeace activist over her fossil fuel donations, Clinton blew up in that activist's face, saying ""I am so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me"", and[ promptly got an article from Philip Bump of the Washington Post debunking her fossil fuel donations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/01/why-hillary-clinton-is-justifiably-annoyed-by-critiques-of-her-big-oil-fundraising/), which didn't sufficiently discuss Clinton's lobbyist donations from the fossil fuel industry and [failed to mention fossil fuel donations into her SuperPAC Priorities USA.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/apr/01/sorting-out-clintons-fossil-fuel-contributions/) And again, [Clinton *is* coordinating with her Super PACs,](http://www.ibtimes.com/political-capital/hillary-clinton-says-she-does-not-coordinate-super-pac-she-reportedly-raised-money) so she is responsible for donations into those Super PACs.

Clinton uses doublespeak to slander her opponents.  Recently, Clinton was asked on Morning Joe whether Sanders was unqualified for the Presidency.  She refused to answer this question multiple times, when she could have easily said ""Yes, but I am more qualified.""

**Contradictions to behavior in the 2008 election**

Clinton has made herself a very close friend to President Obama.  [At least, that's how she portrays herself in every debate](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/us/politics/hillary-clinton-obama-debate.html). However, Clinton was rather nasty to Obama in 2008, running [the infamous ""3 A.M."" political ad that had racist undertones](http://theweek.com/articles/567774/hillary-clinton-needs-address-racist-undertones-2008-campaign) and suggesting that she would stay in the race despite an insurmountable delegate gap [because Obama might be assassinated like Robert Kennedy.](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/23/hillaryclinton.barackobama) Clinton's sudden camaraderie with Obama and his policies [plays more like an appeal to black voters](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/270412-clyburn-defends-clinton-against-claims-of-pandering-to), considering that [the Clintons are rumored to be furious at Obama for winning the 2008 election.](http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/its-personal-bill-clinton-blasts-barack-obama-in-a-brutal-way/)

Clinton has changed course from 2008 to attack Sanders.  [She put herself on Obama's right regarding guns to appeal to rural voters, and now puts herself to Sanders' left regarding guns to appeal to urban voters.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/19/martin-omalley/fact-checking-omalleys-claim-hillary-clinton-flips/)  She told Obama that [Democrats should never disagree on universal healthcare](https://theintercept.com/2016/01/12/hillary-clinton-in-2008-since-when-do-other-democrats-attack-each-other-on-universal-healthcare/), and now tells Sanders that his Medicare for All concept [""will never, ever come to pass.""](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-single-payer-health-care-will-never-ever-happen/)

**GENERALLY AS A POLITICIAN AND A HUMAN BEING:**

Clinton is seen as a political opportunist, and her views have (outwardly) changed as the world has changed.  [She opposed gay marriage, now she supports it](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/17/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-change-position-same-sex-marriage/). She supported fracking, now she opposes it ([after making money from the fracking industry](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/09/hillary-clinton-wants-to-regulate-fracking-but-still-accepts-a-lot-of-fracking-money/)). [She supported the TPP, now she opposes it](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-now-opposes-trans-pacific-partners/) (while political officials feel comfortable that she will flip back to supporting the TPP if elected).  [She supported the crime bill that her husband signed into law, now she says it was a mistake.](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-tragic-politics-of-crime/392114/)  This kind of opportunism tells people that Clinton is a liar who will say anything to be elected.

Part of this political opportunism is that Clinton has used political revisionism to explain away her bad decisions from her time as First Lady.  For instance, [Clinton has claimed that DOMA was secretly intended to prevent a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, which is false.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/28/hillary-clintons-claim-that-doma-had-to-be-enacted-to-stop-an-anti-gay-marriage-amendment-to-the-u-s-constitution/)

Clinton is seen as wealthy, out of touch and arrogant.  She owns expansive New York properties, she flies in a private jet even as a private citizen, she hasn't driven herself since she became First Lady and she has been surrounded by Secret Service since the 90's.  She claimed that she and her husband were [""dead broke""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/) after leaving the White House, even on a more than $100K pension, and so [she and her husband gave paid speeches to become multimillionaires.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/politics/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-paid-speeches/)  She doesn't even seem to understand that these paid speeches constitute a conflict of interest for a President.  [Her daughter married a Goldman Sachs employee](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/business/dealbook/for-clintons-a-hedge-fund-in-the-family.html) and has never had to work a day in her life.  [Secret Service employees allegedly dislike her and say that she is rude and dismissive.](http://nypost.com/2015/10/02/secret-service-agents-hillary-is-a-nightmare-to-work-with/)

Clinton is seen as considering herself above the law.  Of course, there is the private server that she had set up as Secretary of State, seemingly so that she could either work from home or so that she could have communications withheld from the State Department with individuals like [Sidney Blumenthal](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/us/politics/emails-show-how-hillary-clinton-valued-input-from-sidney-blumenthal.html), who was not authorized to work for the Department and [was paid out of the Clinton Foundation as Clinton's private foreign affairs advisor.] (http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/243287-clinton-foundation-paid-blumenthal-10000-monthly-salary) There is [a history of scandal following her and her husband](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/tracking-the-clinton-controversies-from-whitewater-to-benghazi/396182/), some of which is compelling, most of which is conspiracy theory.

Clinton is seen as a liar even on unnecessary things.  She lied about [""being under sniper fire""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/mar/25/hillary-clinton/video-shows-tarmac-welcome-no-snipers/) when visiting Bosnia, [she lied about trying to sign up for the military](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/11/12/hillary-clintons-claim-that-she-tried-to-join-the-marines/) and [she lied about her name being given in honor of Mount Everest mountaineer Edmund Hillary.](http://www.snopes.com/politics/clintons/hillary.asp)  This tendency to lie even about insignificant things creates perpetual distrust of her.  Worse still, when Clinton was asked if she would always be honest with people, she responded [""I don't believe I ever have [lied].  I don't believe I ever will.""](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/270006-clinton-i-dont-believe-i-ever-have-lied)

personalfinance,Balance transfer: good idea for my situation?,"Hello /pf, I just received a new credit card and I need some advice on whether or not to use a balance transfer. Here's a little bit of background. 

I'm 25 years old and holding a steady job. I graduated college last year, and I'm on a decent track finance-wise (following budget, no spending on credit cards). However,  thanks to a bit of financial issues concerning paying for college, coupled with a very damaged view of handling money growing up, I still have a few residual credit card issues from when I was a student. 

My most prominent issue is a balance I'm carrying on an AmEx card that I've had for about 3 years. The balance is currently ~$1,750 with a limit of $2,000, with an interest rate of ~24% (yes, I know this is horrible, and I kick myself every day for having put myself in this situation). The reason it's so high is because I've spent time tackling my smaller credit cards, as that seemed to be the more achievable goal, so I chip away at this card here or there to try and make progress; I'm understanding now that with the numbers like this card has, I'd have to take bigger steps to eradicate it, which I don't know if I'm financially capable of handling at this moment. I now have three other cards that are completely paid off (with credit lines of $500, $500 and $390 for a total of $1,390). Up until a few days ago, my credit utilization ratio was ~51%. After doing some research and realizing a low number of credit lines isn't great for your credit score, and seeing that any addition of new credit cards would address this issue AND lower my utilization ratio, I applied for 2 cards (that I have zero plans to carry balances on). I was approved for both - the Chase Freedom Unlimited card ($2K limit, 0% Intro APR for 15 months on balance transfers, 5% balance transfer fee) and the Citi Double Cash ($1K limit, 0% Intro APR for 18 months on balance transfers, 5% balance transfer fee). 

So while I'm satisfied that this will give me two more credit lines (again, that I don't plan on using really at all) and bring my credit utilization ratio to under 30%, I researched a bit more on how to tackle my debt and ***I'm wondering if transferring the balance from my AmEx card to my Chase Freedom card would be in my best interest.***

I calculated that the balance transfer fee would be in the ballpark of $87, which makes more sense if I plan on having to take longer than 4 months to pay it off (which, in my situation, I would virtually have to). I plan on paying it off in 8-9 months at the latest, but since this is my only credit card debt at the moment, I know that if I had the opportunity to freeze the debt at its current amount, I feel like I could absolutely destroy it.

Obviously I've learned to not lean on my own understanding of credit, though, so I'm asking you guys: should I use the balance transfer in this situation?

TL,DR:

politics,The Myth of the Juvenile Superpredator and Why it Matters Today,"This is a short history of how a logical error by a criminologist and subsequent statements by other researchers and politicians (including Hillary and Bill Clinton) caused the reform of juvenile offender laws and the explosion in mass incarceration of juveniles that occurred in the 1990s. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Birth of the Superpredators**

&amp;nbsp;

Back in November of 1995, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton named John DiIulio created and spread the term ""superpredator"". He coined this term to describe what he referred to as a **""new breed""** of juvenile offenders taking over our country, “kids that have absolutely no respect for human life and no sense of the future. . . . These are stone-cold predators!” 

Elsewhere, DiIulio and co-authors have described these young people as “fatherless, Godless, and jobless” and as “radically impulsive, brutally remorseless youngsters, including ever more teenage boys, who murder, assault, rob, burglarize, deal deadly drugs, join gun-toting gangs, and create serious disorders.” Much of the imagery by DiIulio and other criminologists who picked up on his theory was very **racially coded.**

The criminologists didn't just coin terms and make implications. They used junk science and statistics conflated to show a correlation to make predictions of juvenile delinquency rates in our country. By the time other criminologists stepped up to call their conclusions into question, it was too late.

In 1995, James Q. Wilson asserted that “by the end of decade [i.e., by 2000] there will be a million more people between the ages of 14 and 17 than there are now. . . . Six percent of them will become high rate, repeat offenders—**thirty thousand more young muggers, killers and thieves than we have now. Get ready.**” 

A year later, DiIulio upped the ante on this forecast. He predicted “by the year 2010, there will be approximately **270,000 more juvenile super-predators** on the streets than there were in 1990.”  He claimed that soon, they would be “flooding the nation’s streets,” coming “at us in waves over the next 20 years. . . . **Time is running out.**”

He also used inflammatory language, warning, “We must therefore be prepared to contain the [‘crime bomb’] explosion’s force and limit its damage.” However, he expressed hopelessness, saying, “This crime bomb probably cannot be defused,” and asserting that the superpredators would be here within 5 years (i.e., by the year 2000). **They never arrived.**

The blame can't be completely heaped upon DiIulio. Other prominent figures and the mainstream media picked up on the dialogue quickly, spreading it and convincing the country we needed to be **scared of our children**.  

James A. Fox spoke at the American Association for the Advancement of Science and warned of  a “bloodbath” of teen violence. He also warned elsewhere of a juvenile “crime wave storm.” 

In a report to U.S. attorney general Janet Reno, Fox said, “Our nation faces a future juvenile violence problem that may make today’s epidemic pale in comparison” (p. 3). **He called attention in particular to the projected growth in the black teenage population** (ages 14–17), which would increase 26% by 2005. He also issued a warning: “There is, however, still time to stem the tide, and to avert the coming wave of teen violence. But time is of the essence.”

Even Alfred Blumstein, one of the most respected criminologists in the country, jumped on the bandwagon in 1996. His research analysis showed that the homicide rates among juveniles, the numbers of gun homicides, and the arrest rates of nonwhite juveniles for drug offenses all doubled in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He erroneously tied these three findings together around the “crack cocaine epidemic” of that era. 

Blumstein contended that youngsters who joined the illicit drug industry felt it necessary to carry guns for self-protection from other armed juvenile drug sellers, and that the spread of guns among adolescents and young adults led to violent crimes and growth in the homicide rate among these age groups. It is interesting to note that **in Canada, juvenile homicide rates increased sharply in the mid- to late 1980s without the presence of any crack cocaine epidemic** (Hagan &amp; Foster, 2000). Blumstein also feared that the youth violence epidemic would continue with the growth of the young population and warned that “children who are now younger (about ages 5 to 15) represent the future problem.”  

&amp;nbsp;
   
**The Reaction, or How We Let Junk Science Reshape our Criminal Justice System**

&amp;nbsp;


In characterizations by the press and our elected officials, these morally impoverished teenagers were different from teens of the past— they were **amoral, feral beings, stone-cold killers, willing to maim, rape and kill without a moment’s thought.** Juvenile super predators were characterized as ruthless sociopaths, youth with no moral conscience who see crime as a rite of passage, who are unconcerned about the consequences of their actions, and who are undeterred by the sanctions that could be leveled against them by the juvenile justice system. 

Some even argued that this new breed of offender **had different DNA than their predecessors**, changes caused by the alcohol and other drug abuse of **their young, unmarried mothers**. The argument went that violence juvenile crime was increasing and would continue to increase because this small group of juvenile super predators commits more vicious crimes with higher frequency than delinquents of past generations. 

The supporters of this argument concluded that the rehabilitative approach of the juvenile justice system was wasted on these youth because their natures were largely unchangeable. Deficiencies of earlier generations were attributed to factors that could be changed with appropriate interventions; but this new breed of juvenile super predator was **so disturbed that change was unlikely. As a result, rehabilitation would be ineffectual.** Protecting the public from these vicious juvenile criminals became the primary concern of juvenile justice policymakers.

Lawmakers began to call for stronger sentencing requirements for juveniles to stem the tide of superpredators about to take over our streets. **Perhaps most prominently, Hillary Clinton brought up the topic during a January 1996 stump speech ([video](http://www.c-span.org/video/?69606-1/mrs-clinton-campaign-speech)) for her husband at Keene College.** In it, she says 

&gt; But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs, just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called **superpredators, no conscience, no empathy,** we can talk about why they ended up that way but **first we have to bring them to heel** and the president has asked the FBI to launch a very concerted effort against gangs everywhere.

I wish to note that Hillary's comments and speech came **BEFORE** the report to Janet Reno, or Fox's speech to AAAS. It also came out before Blumstein issued his analysis of the situation. Her speech came **just two months after the term was first coined.**

It's my position and belief that **with this single speech** and the widespread media coverage that followed it, she did more to push this idea of **""bringing them to heel""** into the mindset of lawmakers and the public than anyone else since DiIulio first coined the term the previous year. 

In May 1996, Hillary's husband Bill announced new proposed youth offender legislation [\(video\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qMIyWHERDg).

&gt; Youth violence is on the rise as you have noted, not just in large cities, but in small towns. And whenever there has been a dramatic rise in youth crime it has a terrifying face. Organized gangs.  In my State of the Union address I challenged our country to focus on the problem of youth violence. And I pledged that the United States government would **take on gangs in the way we had taken on the mob** decades ago. We’re fighting with a strategy that is coordinated and unrelenting. That DOES rely upon national, state, and local prosecutors and police and above all, on citizens working with us.

For its proponents, the beauty of the “superpredator” concept was its **convenient adaptability**. Whether the report of the hour says crime is up or down, whether youth crime rates soar or plummet, the ""superpredator” threat warrants ever-tougher tough-on-crime measures. 

“Don’t be fooled by the rosy numbers in this week’s crime reports,” Susan Estrich warned in her USA Today column (5/9/96). “The tsunami is coming…. Juvenile crime is going up and getting worse.” If this language isn’t sufficiently evocative of doom, try Time‘s headline (1/15/96): “Now for the Bad News: A Teenage Timebomb.” The article that follows begins: “**They are just four, five and six years old now, but already they are making criminologists nervous.**”

Even if the threat is on a more distant horizon, it remains imminent (Tampa Tribune, 5/21/96): “They are called superpredators. They are not here yet, but they are predicted to be a plague upon the United States **in the next decade**. They are not some creature from outer space; **they are our own children**.” 

Some media accounts, meanwhile, ignore crime trends altogether and use a single incident of youth violence to frame the threat as an immediate reality. A murder committed by two 15-year-olds in Central Park, for instance, suggests (Christian Science Monitor, 6/2/97) that “America is being threatened by a growing cadre of **cold-blooded teens called ‘superpredators.**'”  The danger has even made international headlines: “The Invasion of the Superpredators,” declared the London Times (2/16/97), has burdened the United States with children capable of “remorseless brutality.”

While media inflation of the “superpredator” threat has helped legitimize the legislation, DiIulio himself publicly distanced himself from it the year after Hillary and Bill's speeches. (Wall Street Journal, 6/11/97): “My central argument about superpredators is that these more savage than salvageable young criminals **could not and should not be punished into submission.**” DiIulio favors a “small government” approach and believes that churches should intervene to try and save “godless” children before it’s too late. **However, his recanting was too little, too late.**

And so the rush to pass new legislation began. The predictions set off a panic, fueled by highly publicized heinous crimes committed by juvenile offenders, which led **nearly every state** to pass legislation between 1992 and 1999 that dramatically increased the treatment of juveniles as adults for purposes of sentencing and punishment. 

First, the age of judicial transfer was lowered in many states to allow the criminal prosecution of teens aged **fourteen and younger.** Some legislatures expanded the range of transferrable offenses to include a long laundry list of crimes. But perhaps the most dramatic changes came in the form of **automatic transfer statutes**, under which many youths are **categorically treated as adults** when they are charged with crimes. These legal reforms resulted in the wholesale transfer of youths into the adult criminal system—**more than 250,000 a year** by most estimates. 

The upshot of this reform movement is that the mantra ""adult time for adult crime"" has become a reality for many young offenders. Through a variety of initiatives, the boundary of childhood has shifted dramatically in a relatively short time, so that **youths who are legal minors for every other purpose are adults when it comes to their criminal conduct.** 

The importance of the super predator construct was that it focused the policy makers' attention on the offenders, and **away from external social factors** that could be causing violence by juveniles and adults to increase. If certain individuals were damaged beyond repair, the only solution was to incapacitate them to protect public safety. During this time period, the number of prison beds grew in the United States at unprecedented rates, while relatively few federal dollars were spent on delinquency prevention or rehabilitation programs. Children faced mandatory sentencing structures previously only applied to adults, including **several instances of life without parole or even death.**

&amp;nbsp;

**The Aftermath, and Why We're Still Talking about Superpredators Today**

&amp;nbsp;

The superpredators that our criminal justice system was preparing for never appeared. Instead, the new statutes were used to convict and sentence children to disproportionate sentences by the thousands. As DiIulio and Fox themselves later admitted, the prediction of a juvenile superpredator epidemic **turned out to be wrong**. In fact, violent **juvenile crime rates had already started to fall in the mid-1990's.** By 2000, the juvenile homicide rate **stabilized below the 1985 level.**

In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in Roper v. Simmons that death by execution is unconstitutional for juveniles. Before the ruling, 365 children had been **legally executed** in the United States, including **22 since 1985.**

To the credit of DiIulio and Fox, they **completely repudiated** teir wrong-headed statements in the 90s. In 2012, DiIulio and Fox were among the criminologists who submitted an [amicus brief](http://eji.org/files/10-9647,%2010-9646%20tsac%20Jeffrey%20Fagan,%20et%20al..pdf) to the Supreme Court in support of the petitioners in Miller v. Alabama. In Miller and its companion case, Jackson v. Hobbs, the Equal Justice Initiative argued that the mandatory life-without-parole sentences imposed on 14-year-olds Evan Miller and Kuntrell Jackson violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against **cruel and unusual punishment.**

The criminologists' amicus brief summarized extensive research data demonstrating that ""**the predictions by the proponents of the juvenile superpredator myth"" were wrong**. ""Yet,"" it concluded, ""the superpredator myth contributed to the dismantling of transfer restrictions, the lowering of the minimum age for adult prosecution of children, and it threw thousands of children into an ill-suited and excessive punishment regime. 

States facing the mounting costs of excessive sentences imposed on children have begun to reform laws enacted in response to the superpredator myth. But children **as young as ten** continue to be exposed to adult prosecution in the United States; 10,000 children are housed in adult jails and prisons on any given day in America; and **nearly 3000 American children have been sentenced to life in prison**.

The research shows **that these new laws ""had no material effect on the subsequent decrease in crime rates,**"" and yet almost all of these laws **remain on the books**. And while the Supreme Court in Miller struck down mandatory life-without-parole sentences for children, **thousands of kids remain sentenced to die in prison** as states fight retroactive application of the decision to sentences imposed during the height of the superpredator panic.

It will take much more than the United States Supreme Court to reverse the damage done as a result of the superpredator myth. While the word has all but vanished from our vocabulary, the **laws that it inspired have not**. If common sense is to make its way back into juvenile justice policy any time soon, the very same state legislatures and governors that passed these draconian laws are going to have to wipe them from the statute books. The longer they wait, **more children every day** are arrested, charged, convicted and incarcerated as adults.

**The Clintons and Personal Responsibility**

&amp;nbsp;


Recently, Hillary was confronted by a young female activist at a fundraiser, asking for her to account for not only her use of the term, but the policies that followed resulting in the **mass incarceration of  thousands of black children.**

In a written response to The Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart on the issue, Clinton said: “Looking back,**I shouldn’t have used those words, and I wouldn’t use them today.**""  She went on to say, ""My life’s work has been about lifting up children and young people who’ve been let down by the system or by society, kids who never got the chance they deserved, and unfortunately today, there are way too many of those kids, **especially in African-American communities**.  We haven’t done right by them.  We need to.  We need to **end the school to prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-college pipeline.**""

**Hillary apologized for her words, but not actions.**  She says the ""system"" let them down, failing to note the ""system"" was put in place as a result of her campaigning and her husband's policy-making.

Hillary’s comment holds more significance than simply referring to gang members. She was stumping on the topic to increase the **""tough on crime"" image of her husband.** It was used to justify mass incarceration for many crack addicts and small dose marijuana users, not dealers. The focus was not rehabilitation of the addicts, but punitive punishment. She claims to want to end the ""school to prison pipeline"", when her comments in 1996 can be attributed as a **source of the school to prison pipeline in the first place.**

When Bill Clinton went on to **defend** his wife's use of the term superpredators, defended it despite all the evidence that **superpredators never existed**, defended it despite the **repudiation of the professor who coined the term originally**, you have to wonder if the Clintons actually **regret** the mass incarceration of thousands of America's youth at all.

personalfinance,H&amp;R Block and their accountant made three severe mistakes while assisting me to apply for ITINs for my spouse and daughter,"I am a software engineer working in the USA under an H1-B visa. I am filing a tax return for first time this year and the tax return required me to obtain Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs) for my wife and daughter because they are not eligible for SSNs (US citizens do not need ITINs).  In order to receive ITINs,  one must file with the IRS a W-7 form (ITIN application form) along with original passports; ITIN processing takes approximately 5-6 weeks. 

I decided to solicit help from H&amp;R Block after seeing an advertisement – H&amp;R Block would assist applicants to file W-7 forms and certify copies of passports for free if applicants prepared a tax return with them.  An H&amp;R Block accountant provided me with filed federal and state tax return forms and W-7 forms and then asked that I make copies of my spouse and daughter’s passports.  The accountant stated that, as there was not a photocopier on the premises (???), I would need to make these copies elsewhere and then send the copies to the appropriate state and federal agencies using two mailer envelopes that they provided to me.  

 One month after following these instructions, I received the following IRS notifications in the mail:

•	The W-7 application for my wife was pending due to additional documentation requirements/incomplete documentation. 

•	The W-7 application for my daughter was rejected.  

•	My state tax return could not be processed as it was incomplete. 


I was dumbfounded that the H&amp;R Block accountant made so many mistakes in filing my tax returns and W-7 applications! I then decided to research, on my own, for what exactly it was that I paid $240 to H&amp;R Block. 

I uncovered the following errors:

1.	H&amp;R Block did not provide me with a Certificate of Accuracy, which is required when a Certified Acceptance Agent certifies a copy of a W-7 application (this is why the IRS requested additional information for the ITIN application of my wife).

2.	H&amp;R Block did not notify me that Certified Acceptance Agents cannot certify copies of documents of dependents - only IRS Tax Assistance Centers could (this is why W-7 for my daughter was rejected).

3.	H&amp;R Block did not warn me that a state tax return could not be filed without first obtaining ITINs. 

4.	H&amp;R Block did not advise me to extend my tax return period for 6 months in order to provide me with the time needed to ensure all necessary paperwork be processed.


Additionally, I spent half of a paid time-off day (and $40 for parking) at an IRS Tax Assistance Center, where an officer helped me, for free, to file W-7 forms and certify copies of passports (the officer also uncovered several other mistakes made by the H&amp;R Block accountant).  The officer expressed surprise that I had already filed a state tax return, as ITINs must be obtained prior to filling out tax returns (as mentioned above).  Indeed, some time later, I received a letter from the State Department of Revenue stating that it would be unable to process my return without first providing ITINs .  

It was this letter from the DOR that was the last straw for me, and that is why I decided to share my story. I advise any person thinking of using H&amp;R Block to assist with tax returns to pay heed to this cautionary tale. 

P.S. Several friends suggested that I contact H&amp;R Block regarding receiving a refund of not only the initial $240 fee, but also all monies I spent fixing the mistakes made by H&amp;R Block. I am skeptical about this, but if there is a lawyer near me (Massachusetts) who knows what would need to be done and is interested in a contingency fee – please feel free to send a message to me.",finance,1460828966

personalfinance,PSA Spending money is borrowing at your highest interest rate.,"Let's look at the following scenario.

You have $10k credit card debt with 30% interest and are just making minimum payments.

You get $5000 back from your tax return. You decide to use it to pay cash for a used car. This is equivalent to financing the car at a 30% interest rate. Why? Because the alternative is paying down the credit card. It's either $5000 of debt at 30% and no car or $10000 of debt at 30% and a car. Therefore, the car is $5000 of debt at 30%.

This applies to everything. Want to buy food? 30% interest. Go to a game? 30% interest.

Debt sucks, and buying food isn't optional. You will have to suck it up for some things and pay the interest. But please, if you have high interest debt make sure every purchase you make is absolutely necessary.",finance,1460829639

So I (the eternal procrastinator) am trying to file my taxes and I've run into a question that Google doesn't seem to know the answer to, or that I don't know what to Google in order to find the answer (more likely).  
I go to college in Connecticut, but my family lives in Oregon. My parents are claiming me as a dependent. I have a couple of on-campus jobs and made just shy of about 10k last year, all earned in CT. *I think* I am supposed to file as a resident of Oregon (because my parents are claiming me there even though I was barely there and didn't earn any money there) and as a non-resident of Connecticut. I used TaxAct because I had read good things about it on here and the Feds want to give me back $400 of the $680 withheld, CT want to give me back all $17 withheld, and Oregon *WANTS ME TO PAY THEM $400.*  
I really hope I'm doing something wrong. Apparently Oregon wants to tax *all* of my income *regardless* of where it was earned or what *other* taxes I've paid on it. This just doesn't seem fair to me. 
If all of this is real and I have to cut Oregon a check for $400, what can I do to prevent this from happening in the future? This summer I'll be working in California and will have a total income on the order of $25k ($20k in California and $5k in Connecticut). It's going to be a nightmare if Oregon tries to tax me on all of that. Can I have my employer withhold for a *different* state's taxes?

btc,How to make sense of Core's actions without conspiracy theories or assuming they're evil,"There are a lot of posts in this subreddit that suggest that Core is part of some evil conspiracy. This is both inaccurate and it hurts the big-block cause because it scares regular people away from Classic. 

You can understand Core's actions by understanding the following:

* All humans engage in ""[motivated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning)."" Core supporters, Classic supporters -- everyone. People differ in the degree to which they do this, but it's a basic feature of all humans that when you identify with a ""side"" of a debate, you will subconsciously rationalize why the evidence for your side is strong and the evidence for the other side is weak. Doing this doesn't mean we're evil, just that we're flawed.
* There is a certain type of security modeling used in cryptography that is psychologically satisfying to many Core devs. It manifests in a desire to come as close as possible to completely eliminating certain types of risks, even if they're very unlikely, at the expense of other factors which aren't included in a security model. This doesn't make these people evil, just biased against the kind of more practical engineering tradeoffs that Bitcoin needs.
* The current Core developers have been among the top dogs in the Bitcoin development world for a long time. Imagine what it's like to be Greg or Pieter. You've been hanging out in #bitcoin-wizards talking among your friends for years, coding up the ideas that you talk about there, and approving or rejecting the designs of others. The things you and your friends decide are what the Bitcoin ecosystem adopts. It must feel pretty sweet. Most people would try pretty hard to try to preserve this influence, especially if they also believe that their expert vision for Bitcoin will be best for it in the long run. It doesn't require someone to be unusually evil. 
* A lot of really smart people have big egos. Regardless of the merits of Gavin and Mike Hearn's initial push for bigger blocks, the way they went about it (especially Mike's tactics) pricked the egos of several core devs and turned the block size debate into an ego battle where ""winning"" felt extremely important, which just fed into the motivated reasoning described above. 
* People in academic computer science tend to think that they are smarter than people in other fields (I say this as a computer science person myself, who also thinks there is a bit of truth to this). They see themselves, physicists, and mathematicians at the top and economists as below them. They tend to think that they can jump into other fields like economics and easily figure things out for themselves. This leads them to overestimate their economic judgment. 
* In computer science circles, respect is heavily weighted by how good you are at computer science stuff. Someone like Greg Maxwell (who I believe is the smartest and most knowledgeable Core dev) has extremely high status among other Core devs, which can lead to group-think as other devs defer to and try to gain acceptance from Greg and the other top devs. This can lead to Core devs displaying a 'unified front' without explicit coordination but also based mostly on the judgment of the devs at the top of the Core group.
* Different people are drawn to Bitcoin for different reasons, and many Core supporters just think that digital gold / settlement is ""cooler"" than digital cash. 

IMO the ""evil"" things people are claiming that Core is doing can be explained by the non-evil factors above.",cryptocurrency,1460849799

&gt;Because **FISMA applies to both information and information systems used by the agency, contractors, and other organizations and sources, it has somewhat broader applicability than prior security law. That is, agency information security programs apply to all organizations (sources) which possess or use Federal information - or which operate, use, or have access to Federal information systems (whether automated or manual) - on behalf of a Federal agency.** Other organizations may include contractors, grantees, State and Local Governments, industry partners, providers of software subscription services, etc. FISMA, therefore, underscores longstanding OMB policy concerning sharing Government information and interconnecting systems.
“Are the security requirements outlined in the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (44 U.S.c. 3544) limited to information in electronic form?

If the IS controls audit is performed as part of a financial audit, as discussed in FAM 320 (Understand Information Systems) and other FAM sections, the auditor should obtain an understanding of the entity’s information systems (including methods and records) for processing and reporting accounting (including supplemental information), compliance, and operations data (including performance measures reported in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis). The auditor should document an understanding of the entity’s operations and key business processes, including the following items to the extent relevant to the audit objectives: 

&gt;1. **the significance and nature of the programs and functions supported by information systems;** 
&gt;2. **a general understanding of the entity’s and the IT function’s organizational structure;** 
&gt;3. **key business processes relevant to the audit objectives, including business rules, transaction flows, and application and software module interaction;** 
&gt;4. **significant general support systems and major applications that support each key business process;** 
&gt;5. background information checklist, if used; 
&gt;6. **significant internal and external factors that could affect the IS controls audit objectives;** 
&gt;7. **a detailed organization chart, particularly the IT and the IS components;** 
&gt;8. **significant changes in the IT environment or significant applications implemented within the recent past (e.g. 2 years) or planned within the near future (e.g., 2 years); and**

From the 2009 State Department FISMA Audit Report: https://oig.state.gov/system/files/213359.pdf

________________________________________


&gt; **In response to four FY 2008 FISMA report recommendations relating to inventory systems management and oversight of contractor systems, IRM/IA modified its procedures for collecting, analyzing, and managing inventory systems.** The review team found that IRM/IA had implemented several controls procedures that were reviewed and verified during the team’s analysis of 3rd and 4th quarter inventory records. Specifically, the following controls were implemented:

&gt;**Routine quarterly inventory data calls were made, and they reminded bureau and post systems owners to report new systems and significant changes to systems to ensure the accuracy of their FISMA-reportable inventory.**

&gt;**FISMA requires the Department to keep an inventory of information systems. OMB Circulars A-123, A-127 ( Financial Management Systems), and A-130 (Management of Federal &gt;Information Resources) require agencies to develop and maintain an information systems inventory, document the types of information systems required to be reported, and detail how and how often those reports must be submitted to OMB. FIPS Publication 199 requires that agencies categorize their information systems as low-, moderate-, or high-impact. Systems with privacy-related information automatically raise the systems to the level of “Major Information Systems,” thereby needing to be reported in the information system inventory.**

______________________________________________________________

&gt;The State Department remains committed to corporate governance. To that end, we continue to work to improve our financial management and internal controls. This Agency Financial Report (AFR) is our principal publication and report to the President, Congress, and the American people on our leadership in financial management and on our management and stewardship of the public funds to which we have been entrusted. We worked with our Independent Auditor to ensure that the financial and summary performance data included in this AFR are complete and reliable in accordance with guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. Through this publication and the February release of the Congressional Budget Justification, which includes the Agency Performance Report, we are providing an alternative to the Performance and Accountability Report.

2011 State Department Financial Management Report: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/177397.pdf

______________________________________________________________

&gt;To assess conformance with FFMIA, the Department uses FFMIA implementation guidance issued by OMB (January 2001 Memorandum to Executive Department Heads, Chief Financial Officers, and Inspectors General), results of OIG and GAO audit reports, annual financial statement audits, the Department’s annual Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Report, and other relevant information. The Department’s assessment also relies upon evaluations and assurances under the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA), including assessments performed to meet the requirements of OMB Circular A-123 Appendix A. Particular importance is given to any reported material weakness and material non-conformance identified during these internal control assessments. The Department has made it a priority to meet the objectives of the FFMIA. 

&gt;**In the FISMA report, the Office of Inspector General will cite weaknesses to enterprise-wide security they consider to be a significant deficiency in accordance with OMB M-11-33. The Department acknowledges the weaknesses identified by the OIG, but does not agree that any of the findings, either individually or collectively, rise to the level of a significant deficiency that would require treating the matter as an additional material weakness in accordance with OMB M-11-33 which states “a significant deficiency is defined as a weakness in an agency’s overall information systems security program... that significantly restricts the capability of the agency to carry out its mission or compromises the security of its information, information systems, personnel, or other resources, operations, or assets. In this context, the risk is great enough that the agency head and other agencies must be notified and immediate or near-immediate action must be taken.” Management has defined corrective actions for the applicable weaknesses cited by the OIG, and will address each in a prioritized manner based upon the risk and impact posed to the Department’s security posture.**

From PDF Page 13 of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) Evaluation of the Department of State’s FOIA process for Requests Involving the Office of the Secretary, January 2016: https://oig.state.gov/system/files/esp-16-01.pdf

______________________________________________________________

&gt;Although specific details of processes for handling FOIA requests vary among agencies, the major steps in processing a request are similar across the Federal Government. Recent assessments of the Department’s processes revealed poor practices. In 2012, OIG’s inspection of A/GIS found, among other deficiencies, that FOIA requests are prone to delay and that IPS lacked a sound process to develop its information systems. A 2015 report by the Center for Effective Government found that, among 15 Agencies that receive a large volume of public records requests, **the Department ranked last, in part because of increased processing times and outdated regulations. According to the report, the Department was the only agency whose rules do not require staff to notify requesters when processing is delayed, even though this is mandated by law. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the accuracy and completeness of responses to FOIA requests. The Department has not sent out a notice or memorandum reminding employees of their FOIA responsibilities since March 2009, when former Secretary Clinton sent a message commemorating Freedom of Information Day.**

&gt;**Although OIG focused on procedural weaknesses in the Office of the Secretary for this evaluation, the issues OIG identified have broader implications.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government stresses that the tone at the top —management’s philosophy and operating style—is fundamental to an effective internal control system.

TL;DR: Executives have direct responsibility over Risk Management, and (at least in public companies) have been held accountable for their failures. The fact that the other Agencies were not aware of how her server was being managed is all the evidence that you need. A core principle of the Risk Management function is to understand how a system supports the agency's mission, how it interconnects with other systems and agencies, and how the information flows through those systems, to ensure that information in, for example, a system categorized as High (Whitehouse Email) to something with little or no controls (Hillary's email) without going through some process to make sure the information is filtered, redacted, blocked from transmission, etc. 

This information is required to be documented and audited. The lack of documentation is itself evidence that it wasn't being done. The combination of operational importance, information types, role in business process and in supporting the Agency's mission, and classification levels all ultimately impact the IT security process (controls) that are required to be put in place. They apply to all systems that house Federal Information, classified or not. This is also for preserving the integrity and availability of public record, the communications that influence decision making, and other public records, and preventing malicious alteration of those records.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

EDIT: Also, I am not currently, nor have I in the past, been employed by, contracted with, or audited a Federal Agency. I'm just familiar with the underlying framework (NIST SP800), auditing standards in general, and evaluating deficiencies, significant deficiencies, and material weakness, as well as evaluating the reasonableness of management's response.

ELI5/Classroom analogy

Hillary had to protect information and follow instructions, she failed to follow the instructions, and didn't listen when the teacher's assistant checked her work and told her it was wrong. Eventually the teacher found out, and sent instructions back to her on how to do it right. She didn't listen, asserted that she was doing it right, and signed a legal document stating that she didn't agree with the teachers assistant.

1.    **Was she reimbursed for the cost of her email server and support services by the State Department?**
2.    **Was her server included in the Federal Information Systems Inventory (Required by OMB A-130, among others places.)?**
3.    **Was her server included in the State Department's annual audits and reviews for compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, and were there any findings relevant to her server?**
4.    **Did she withhold information about her server to prevent it from being included in these audits or discussions with auditors and the Inspector General?**
5.    **Is there a reasonable basis for the management assertion in response to recommendation #17 in the 2012 State Department FISMA Audit Report?**

politics,"My Open Letter to George Clooney, Matt Damon, and other Hollywood Elite supporting Hillary.","Hey everyone, content is as title says. Please feel free to share this if you feel similarly to I and my friends, and add your own sentiments in the comments. Thanks for reading. &lt;3

To any person out there who does not believe that Class Warfare is real, we have to look no farther than the George Clooney Mega Million Dollar Fundraiser for one of the leading Flag-Bearers for the 1%, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Like George Clooney, Hillary was born to privilege, not incidentally, both claim more humble starts. 

Strange affliction that many of the 1% have-- they love to claim that they are “like” the rest of us 99%, when the truth is that any clue they had what it is really like to live struggling paycheck to paycheck, either never was in their memories or has long ago faded away.

It is very similar to certain Hollywood Hawks who love to push war and claim that they served in war and surprise, they didn't. Like George Bush the 2nd and others, as a little research will reveal.

The truth is that George, like Hillary, is not like the rest of us. I hope you both will forgive my familarity as of one of the hoi poloi, one of the many peons who are running your personal errands, cleaning for you, cooking for you, driving you from here to there and doing your lawn work. 

The rest of the US Working Class, hell, WE do all that work for ourselves.

Here is where those who don't know What they are defending or Don't Care, are getting idignant and making the same tired arguments that basically boil down to; “the 1% are just like the 99% and as they have a lot more money than we 99%, which makes them more wise than us and know what is best for us.”

The truth of the matter is, it is doubtful that any of these supporters of Hillary, again, one the most Powerful Champions that the 1% ever had, know exactly what Hillary's Record is.

The truth can set all of us, Free. I suggest to Mr. Clooney and the rest of his Elite Class do a little research and read. Or do the peons also do this work for you and the rest of your Elite Class? 

Here is Hillary's Record; the really “funny” thing about the following, it is actually pared down, for the sake of brevity and sanity. Take the Republican Welfare Law, a part of Newt's Contract On America, both Hillary and Bill supported Newt via Kasich's bill. Let's be clear, Hillary personally help put together the votes to pass this mean-spirited bill. This is a FACT.

By the way, the “mean” description is Peter Edelman's, long time friend of Bill and Hillary, who is
married to Marian Wright, founder of the Childrens Defense Fund, where Hillary loves to brag she worked. Ironic &amp; sad as both Edelmans pleaded with Bill and Hillary NOT to support the Republicans.

Ted Kennedy called it “Legislative Child Abuse”. History shows that HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of Legal Immigrants were hurt by the Clinton Republican law. History shows that MILLIONS of Working Class Americans &amp; Children were moved into poverty by Clinton's law. See Edelmans, CBPP.org, et al.

Facts show the work that Hillary has done on SCHIP does NOT equal the damage she helped cause by helping pass this mean spirited bill. Again, the description is Peter Edelman's, Hillary's and Bill's friend. 

Let's be Honest and Blunt; what the HELL do Mr. Clooney and his friends care about US? Or Facts?

To the inevitable chorus of sheep that “Hindsight is... blah blah”, the TRUTH is that Bill Clinton was personally handed a report showing that MILLIONS of Americans, including CHILDREN would be moved into poverty by the Clinton backed Republican law, BEFORE Bill signed this evil.

But, the Clintons were more interested in getting Republican Votes to re-elect Bill! Pragmatism-- “wow”!
And this EXACTLY what is wrong with Hillary, she has hurt the Working Class on issue after issue.
Want to talk NAFTA? Millions of good jobs lost, but the 1%, not unlike the Clooneys and their friends, who gave Big $$$ to Bill before NAFTA and later, Hillary, all saw their profits go up because of NAFTA.

How about Glass-Stegall, which worked for decades to protect the Working Class from another Great Depression? Again, the 1%, who gave Big Money to Bill and later, Hillary, all saw their profits go up. 

Only the uniformed, partisan or those who just don't give a DAMN about FACTS, ignore these Facts.

How about the Bankruptcy Bill that Hillary was against before Big Money from the Finance Sector helped make her Senator of New York? Hillary's vote trapped many Americans in a cycle of debt!

Does any of you Hollywood Elite know that Hillary has been called the Senator of Wall Street?

How about the fact that Hillary supported Single Payer which failed because of the many millions that the Insurance Industry and Big Pharma spent? This is probably something you do know.

But, do any of you Psuedo-Intellectuals find it the least bit troublesome that Hillary is now echoing the attacks of the Insurance industry and Big Pharma against Bernie Sander's Single Payer?

How about the fact that these same Multi-Billion Dollar Corporations are now giving Hillary the many millions they once spent against her? WHY would these Billion Dollar Mega-Corps give her ANY $$$?

These are FACTS, not hyperbole. Read. Do some research. Or at least stop pretending you care about Every-Day Working Class Americans who live paycheck to paycheck because of Hillary's policies! 

Mr. Clooney, YOU do know you could pay one the Working Class to do the research FOR you, right?

Most of the Hollywood Elite, like the Clooneys, pretend that they care about Anti-LGBTQ Laws and are willing to use their celebrity to fight these Bigoted laws. 

Well, that is great, but I must ask how exactly can YOU Hollywood Elite support Hillary (and Bill) who supported some of the worst Anti-LGBTQ Policies and Laws that the USA has ever known?

The Anti-LGBTQ Don't Ask Don't Tell ruined the lives and military careers of uncounted thousands and thousands using Witch Hunt Style tactics. This is Bill and Hillary “I help with Bill's policies”
Clinton, the Candidates YOU are helping over someone who actually welcomed LGBTQs as Mayor.

Is the Anti-LGBTQ DOMA supported by Hillary “I help with Bill's policies” Clinton OK with YOU?

As Senator of Wall Street, sorry, New York, Hillary said she was againt Gay Marriage (Just like Bill).  Hillary used Republican Talking Points to defend this Bigotry; “marriage between man and woman”.

See the Tweet of Hillary Rosen, one of Hillary's Many Big Buck Lobbyists. She regrets it but it is True!

One last one, Racism. Am I saying the Clintons are Racist? Well, how about YOU look at the FACTS                          and judge for yourselves.

As Govenor of Arkansa, Bill Clinton was sued by the NAACP for violating the Civil Rights of Black Americans and intefering with their right to VOTE! (Case 90-394)

Instead of fixing these Racists Laws, Bill using taxpayer money, fought the NAACP!

IF Bill was/is such a good friend to Black Americans then WHY fight to KEEP such Racist Laws?
After Losing Bill, Appealed &amp; fought the NAACP some more. After fighting to the end, Bill Clinton lost.

This is FACT, not interpetation. Speaking to angry whites after the loss, Bill implied to them the loss was due to the Confederacy losing the Civil War. That is what another friend of Bill wrote, Lani Guinier. 

To prove his devotion to Black Americans each year Bill and Hillary celebrated Confederate Flag Day.

Hell, to show his solidarity with Black Americans, Bill signed Act 116 Honoring the Confederacy!

To those Hollywood Elite who don't get this, I'll break it down, the Confederacy was to support the Enslavement of people who looked like Don Cheadle and Kerry Washington.

Millions of Black Americans were kidnapped, tortured, beaten, raped and separated from their families!

To “Honor” the Confederacy as Bill Clinton did, is actually, EXACTLY like “Honoring” the Nazi!

And oh yeah, during Hillary's time as a Director, Wal-Mart profited off the sale of Confederate flags.

During Hillary's time as a Director of Wal-Mart for 6 years, Wal-Mart engaged in Union Busting.

Is that OK with you Hollywood SAG Members? Or the hell with Wal-Mart under-paid employees,                     YOU got yours, right, Mr. Clooney? Same question to the rest of you Elites supporting Hillary.

Wal-Mart paid Women less than Men. That still OK? IF it was your wife or mother, still OK??

Wal-Mart also paid Starvation Wages, advising employees to come to US, the taxpayers, to help feed their families, which Regular Americans could NOT do on Wal-Mart Pay. In fact, Wal-Mart has MORE workers on Welfare than any other employer in the USA! (See High Cost of Low Prices)

Is that OK with you, Mr. Clooney, Mr. Damon and the rest of you Multi-Millionaires?

Oh, let the Rationalizing and False Equivacations begin! It is so hard to admit when you are wrong!

Many Hollywood Elite, like the Clooneys, proudly join supporting Hillary with Wal-Mart, Monsanto, Tyson Foods, Verizon, GE, Bank of America and Wall Street's Goldman Sachs, to name a few.

Mega-Corps wrongdoings include Contaminating Drinking Supplies, Wrongful Evictions, Wage Theft, Unequal Pay for Women, Union Busting, Discrimantion, Fraud, Shipping jobs overseas-- hey, don't worry Mr. Clooney and the rest of you Hollywood Elite-- they are not sending YOUR jobs overseas! 

Mr. Damon, do you REALLY support this kind of Record? Does the Who really matter more than the What? WE would all love to see a Woman in the White House, but how about someone who has a Record that deserves the White House? Like Ms. Harris of California or any thousands of other women!

Do ANY of you Elite even care that Bernie Sanders opposed ALL of these? Two examples; as Hillary was supporting Anti-LGBTQ policies, there is video of Bernie defending Gays in Congress. As Hillary was campaigning for Goldwater, beloved for voting against Civil Rights for people who look like Bakari Sellers and Jason George, Bernie was being arrested in Hillary's hometown for Protesting Segregation. 

At the risk of stating the obvious, the differences in these examples is this is about CHARACTER of Bernie and Hillary rather than their Policy!



Mr. Clooney, with all respect, your beautiful wife seems to do good works, so WHY would the two of you want to support a candidate who takes Many Millions* from the leaders of countries that abuse their Women Citizens with Rape, Public Beatings, Child Marriage, Sexual Servitude and Death By Stoning?

(*Thru the Clinton Foundations)

In the name of all that is sacred, anyone defending this, please do NOT give the “Wall Street Defense”  that “only by taking their many millions can Hillary stop the abuses”!!

Dr. Martin Luther King Boycotts NOT doing business with!

WHY are you raising money for someone who is such a Powerful Champion of the 1%?!

$353,400.00 just to sit by the Senator of Wall Steet, $30k for  a picture with Hillary!

How about donating this money to the people who are being kicked off of SNAP everyday (NY and other States) DIRECTLY** because of the Clinton Welfare Law? (**According, again to cbpp.org)

Maybe our Brave Veterans and their families? Bernie stood by himself, against Hillary, 99 to 1.

Many times Principle is more valuable than Pragmatism, even in Politics.

To sum up; Hillary's policies have helped the 1% and have badly hurt the Working Class.

Mr. Clooney, YOUR support for Hillary, along with the other Hollywood Elite is uninformed and sad.

Once again, the 1% are on the wrong side of History. And the wrong side of the fight for our very souls!",finance,1460853467
politics,Why is nobody talking about agricultural subsidies in the primaries?,"The federal goverment [pays](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Agricultural_subsidy#/United_States)
 about $20 billion in agricultural subsidies annually


The premise of farm subsidies, as I understand it, is that they benefit small farmers and the American people:

- Small farmers benefit from an increase in financial security, given that farming is subject to inherent volatility due to weather and blight, among other things.

- The American people benefit broadly from the availability and abundance of diverse crops

Regarding the former, we've seen a significant trend of consolidation in the farming industry in the last few decades:

&gt; ERS calculations using data from the census of agriculture, which covers all U.S. farms and over a longer time interval than available in ARMS, show that the midpoint acreage for U.S. crop farms increased from 589 acres in 1982 to 1,105 acres in 2007 (the last year for which census data are currently available). **The 88-percent increase in the midpoint acreage during the period is evidence of a steady consolidation of cropland into larger farms, even as the mean farm size changed little.**

[sauce](http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2013-september/cropland-consolidation-and-the-future-of-family-farms.aspx#.VxLiX5MrJE4)


On the second goal of farm subsidies, it seems like current farm subsidy policies are falling short of their goal of creating diversity on crop production:

&gt; **In reality, this support is highly skewed toward the five major ""program"" commodities of corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and rice.** A handful of other commodities also qualify for government support, including peanuts, sorghum, and mohair, though subsidies for these products are far smaller. Dairy and sugar producers have separate price and market controls that are highly regulated and can be costly to the government.

I graduate at the end of this month, and during the summers of my first two years in school I've gotten two internships at two of the largest studios in my field, and was re hired back at one during the summer of my third year in school. I mention all of this to establish my experience, which is far greater than the average junior in my profession coming out of school. 

Anyway, for whatever reason I never needed to do an interview for those positions, so Friday was my first interview/salary negotiation ever.

Everything went well until the negotiation part. She asked what my salary expectations were, I said ""what do you think is a fair value for the position?"". Didn't work, she said I asked you. So I did my research and found that the job I was going for in this location can make anywhere from 45 to 95 a year given seniority. I said that, and said ""I think I fall closer to the top end, and that 75 would be fair.""

She scoffed and went off about how I'm a junior, yada yada and then mentioned something along the lines of ""we'd be hard pressed to offer you 60"". I foolishly got hung up on her referring to me as junior and tried to explain 'why' my value was that high instead of giving a counter. She must have seen that I was a poor negotiator, because we finished on, ""We can offer as high as 45. Think about it and let me know""

Anyway, the job is in Montreal and I plan on sending a follow up email on Monday to try and salvage this. Originally I told myself 60's or I walk, but either she's right about what I deserve to be paid, or she's really good at her job, and now I'm thinking that I'll settle for 50's. I mean the way I see it is that she either has a few candidates lined up and is seeing who she can get for the cheapest (in which case I have no leverage), or the studio actually wants me and she just thinks she can get me for cheap.

Any advice on what to do/how to proceed/negotiation tips would be very much appreciated!

In general, I understand that an index-tracking mutual fund (e.g., VTSMX) will have a higher expense ratio than its ETF counter-part (e.g., VTI).  However, what is unclear to me is when entering into the realm of Target Date Funds (TDFs) -- particularly the Vanguard 2050 TDF (VFIFX) -- how do I:

A) Calculate the ""True Costs"" of the VFIFX, which should be the Total Expense Ratio (TER) + the trading costs incurred by the fund itself (brokerage commissions + bid/ask spreads + market impacts).  Apparently, according to the research cited in the article, the trading costs of the fund managers do not get included in the TER.  This is confusing to me since VFIFX's underlying assets are four individual index funds themselves, so the math is beyond my current knowledge.

B) Make any meaningful comparison with what my expenses will be in VFIFX versus holding a similar allocation of ETF counter-parts over the course of, say 40 years, with such an unknown variable such as the fund manager's future trading behavior.",finance,1460908616
personalfinance,First Time Filing Taxes: A Sanity Check,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I am using TurboTax to do my taxes (haven't officially filed just yet) and could use your guys' help in determining if my amount owed is reasonable.  

I made a total of $24,000 last year between three jobs and am quoted to owe approximately $650 in federal taxes and $170 in California state taxes.  

Relevant tax information:  

1. Single
2. Filing independently
3. Student (LESS than half-time)  
4. Total Federal Income Tax Withheld: $870  
5. Total Social Security Tax Withheld: $1300  
6. Total Medicare Tax Withheld: $350  

I fear that there are infinite factors that affect my taxes however my situation seems relatively straight forward aside from being a less-than-half-time student.  

Bonus: I owe a boat load in student loans but I never reported that anywhere while filing taxes -- does this affect the numbers at all?  

Thanks again /r/personalfinance!

financialindependence,Do I pay off the house? Or the rentals?,"First of all let me say, that up until about ten days ago I had no idea the FI/RE community even existed.  Since then... I've been obsessed!  Here's my current question: my wife and I have several rental properties.  We are looking at steps for early retirement and have set our sites on Dec 31, 2017 (20 months from now).  We have eleven years left on a 15 year mortgage on our home at 3.325% interest.  The mortgages on our rentals range from 4-9%.  Yes, nine percent!  Three of the rentals have second mortgages and all are high.  9, 9, and 8.5%.  We have a little over $200,000 in cash just sitting around.  Our original plan was to pay off the house by the end of this year.  The home mortgage balance is $295k.  But thinking more strategic (ROI), now we're leaning towards knocking off some of the rental mortgages because of the interest rates.  And then putting away the extra cash flow with the idea of paying off the home by the end of 2017.  Would love to hear some input.",finance,1460909014
personalfinance,US Savings Bond - Advice needed for cashing in with maximum benefit,"Hello /r/personalfinance, I'm hoping I could get some (hopefully) simple advice regarding some US Savings Bonds I've saved over the past 26 years:    
    
Long story short, I've managed to save [35 US Savings Bonds](http://i.imgur.com/puWHQ0c.jpg) over the past 26 years from gifts, holidays etc. however now I'm in a bit of a pickle. As it is, I just manage to scrape by but have about ~$2000 owed in legal fees on May 1st that I have zero alternatives to paying (the deal I have worked out is contingent on paying the owed amount in full all at once).    
     
The sum of the 35 US Savings Bonds, as of today (4/17/2016) is **$5,188.10** with the first 10, earliest issued USSB accruing a 4.00% interest rate.    
    
**So, my question is:** What is the most financially responsible way for me to cash **$2,000** worth of [my USSB's](http://i.imgur.com/puWHQ0c.jpg), where I can maximize the return from the remaining uncashed USSB's?    
    
    
I could easily cash 4 of them with a total of **$2,060.14**, however I would be cashing 2 * $500 USSB's that are currently sitting at $850.60 and $867.60 with a fixed 4.00% interest rate, but I fear I would be missing out on more interest between those 2 USSB's alone (they've both earned $600 each in interest, $500 more than any other USSB I currently own) than the total of any of the remaining USSB's.
     
Any advice is greatly appreciated, thank you!",finance,1460910025

We bought through the marketplace and estimated what he’d be making via new home business (LLC) and she’d be making via job yet to be found which made the catastrophic plan cheaper than bronze/silver/gold plans. Did not qualify for Medicare or Medicaid. We went with the catastrophic plan and ended up earning just over $25k or 160% of federal poverty level.

And so they go about creating this nuclear war simulator sorta like *Threads*. And it goes like—

- ""**3 Days To WWIII**"": you're just minding your own business somewhere out in Seattle or somewhere. You're a happy little millennial.  Married to your soul mate, got a beautiful little baby girl, and a tiny little kitten— never mind those college loan payments, you'll, uh, deal with those another day. Yeah, you're lookin' for a job, watching the election coverage, supporting your candidate (70% chance it's that New England socialist, Ernie Anders, but that's how much of a millennial you are), when all of a sudden there's some breaking news— Russia invades Ukraine! Not even a 'vacation' anymore, like a legit invasion. Well that sucks.

- ""**Two Days To WWIII**"": Watching the news, changing your baby's diaper, not paying much heed to the world. You just wanna cuddle with your wife. And there's something on the news about NATO deliberating what to do about the Ukrainian crisis. 

- ""**One Day To WWIII**"": Now everyone's starting to shit their pants because NATO's moved military forces into Ukraine, and Russia's giving us a 24 hour ultimatum to withdraw. You're getting a bit worried there too, but not too much. These things always defuse themse—

- ""**Total Thermonuclear Annihilation**"": War were declared. WWIII starts, and you get to sit in your house watching the news while you hear about Ukraine getting decimated in the fighting. Tactical nukes falling and all. 

And then *poof*. No electricity. You've seen too many nuclear war movies to know where this is going. Everyone's walking outside to see what's going on, and ***boom***. Mushroom cloud! More mushroom clouds! Your whole neighborhood is destroyed.

- ""**Day One**"": So the world ended yesterday. No biggie. You're still alive. So is your wife, daughter, and kitten. The problem is that it seems no one else is. Oh sure, there are some survivors crawling through the rubble, but the whole place feels empty. You've got some food, but you have no idea how long it's gonna last you. There's looting going on already in the city, and people burglarizing others' houses. Breakdown of all law and order!

- ""**Day Ten**"": Alright, now things are officially going down the shitter. There's roving gangs everywhere shooting people for their food and water, there's hundreds of thousands of people disfigured by the blasts and radiation who are giving up on life, and your family is getting weaker.

- ""**Day Twenty**"": There is no hope and nothing you can do. Emergency services are gone, and your family's become violently ill. With no food, you may even have to come down to killing and eating your kitten just for nourishment.

Resources are wearing thin because of all the competition, and many are leaving the area to find more fertile grounds. Supermarkets are blown out. Any place that may have had food is empty. Even gumball machines have been smashed. And people are licking the rain-blackened ground for water. 

- ""**Day 365**"": If your wife is still alive, she's given birth to a new child. This child is a hideous, skinless mutant that almost certainly won't survive the week. Now comes news of an extremely virulent plague sweeping the remnants of America.

personalfinance,[debt] 24/student. My mother was sick and I had to support her for several months. emergency funds dried up and I took several loans from the bank.,"Up until 14 months ago, I was a university student in Israel (tuition is ~$2700/year, so as long as you live with your parents and don't spend too much, $12k/year is more than enough to live).  Then my mother suffered a spinal disc herniation, and I had to drop uni and take care of her (getting her to doctors, clinics, etc), as well as helping with the bills.  
And since I was no longer a student, I wasn't qualified for lower rate loans 8 months later, when our emergency fund finally dried up, and I had to take a $6.5k loan to cover rent, bills and medical expanses(at 10% interest over 4 years).

Emergency over, my mom went back to work 2 months ago, and along with that, I can now resume my studies.
once I sign up to the courses, I'm entitled to a loan with 0.5% interest.  
Along with that, I scored a student position for $28k/year (in my field, no less, so once I get my BSc, I already get years of experience to my CV).

I'm planning on refinancing the loan from the bank for the lower interest.
There's also an opportunity here, but I'm not exactly sure if it's gold or fool's gold:
I could, in theory, apply for a larger loan (like... $15k), to rebuild my emergency fund at practically no cost(less than $150 in interest over 4 years, even less over the 30 months I plan on taking it and doing an early payoff).


So boring wall of text later:
tl;dr: current debt is at 10% interest, 42 months left to finish paying it off.
As a freshly returning student, I can take a loan with a 20x reduced interest rate, and maybe rebuild my emergency fund.

personalfinance,How does /r/PF feel about raiding the e-fund to pay student debt?,"**TL;DR: How does PF feel about lowering a 6 month e-fund to a 3-month e-fund in order to pay off a large fraction of medium interest debt?**



Hello! Thank you for taking the time to read. I'm very grateful to the PF community. I have learned a lot about personal finance by reading this subreddit and taking the advice here to heart. I would not be where I am today without your knowledge. Thank you! 

I am a single mid 20s male with no kids living in a relatively high COL area (US west coast). I purchased YNAB 6 months ago and got serious about budgeting my money and saving up my 6 month e-fund. Now that the 6 month e-fund is fully funded and I'm living off of last month's income, I've set a goal to pay off my student loan debt early. However, I do want to enjoy my 20s and have budgeted accordingly to allow for fun. I'm trying to find a reasonable balance - that's what it's all about, right?


My 6 month e-fund is currently $14400 assuming $2400 to live off per month in the event of unemployment. It sits in a credit union account earning 1.5%.
 
 
Here's the breakdown:
 
 
My debt:

* No CC debt

* $6300 @ 6.55% (federal loan)

* $3400 @ 6.55% (federal loan)

* $4700 @ 6.55% (federal loan)

* $2700 @ 5.75% (federal loan)

* $2700 @ 3.4% variable (private education loan)

* $12200 @ 1.9% auto loan
  
 
My monthly budget:

* $750 rent

* $35 utilities (electricity only, water &amp; sewer are included in rent, I don't pay for cable)

* $275 minimum student loan payment for federal loans

* $50 minimum student loan payment for private loan

* $332 auto loan payment

* $100 car insurance ($1200 annually)

* $17 car registration ($196 annually)

* $120 gas

* $105 cell phone

* $150 groceries

* $90 lunches

* $110 restaurants

* $150 alcohol, bars, going out

* $170 personal upkeep (haircuts, clothing, health items, eyecare, contacts and solution, laundry) these are broken down further in my budget but lumped them together here for simplicity

* $30 household goods

* $20 gifts

* $65 entertainment

* $40 savings monthly for Christmas

* $75 car maintenance fund

* $50 allowance (guilt free spending)

* $50 travel/vacation fund

* $16 coffee shops
  
  
Total: $2800 budgeted per month, with any unbudgeted dollars given the job of extra student loan payments.
  

Base income is $1700 biweekly net takehome after deductions:

* 5% matched 401k contribution

* Health, dental, and eye insurance

* HSA contributions of $70/paycheck
  
  
10 months of the year my income is base $3400. Two months of the year it is $5100. I get a lot of overtime opportunities - enough to occasionally add another $200 to my net paycheck biweekly, but haven't included that figure above.
 
Bottom line: $3400-$2800=$600 to use for extra student loan payments monthly.

Card 1 : $135 (No interest as i'll pay this one off when i get a paycheck)
Card 2: $900 ($10 a month for purchases)
Card 3: 900 ($10 as well, for purchases)

Ended up spending like $40 which fed me for 4 days | $10 a days isn't bad

After 2 weeks It totals out to about $140 just to feed myself
Bills :
Rent : $250 (living with roommates)
Utility bills : (water, electricity) : $60-$80 - depending on usage
Car payment: $250 (Have about $3,000 left on it - paying to mom - no interest)
Insurance : $190 (full coverage and bad driving history)
Motorcycle payment : $140 (Have $3,600 left on it 5% interest [I have good credit] ) 

My question is : Which payment should i get rid of first? 
I'll be moving soon and my rent will be $175.
I'm in a long distance relationship so i don't plan on selling the motorcycle.

My income : $830 - $1000 every 2 weeks (Bi-Weekly) [$1,000 if i do overtime]

So I graduate from college in a month (USA), and will be starting a job overseas (East Asia) at the end of the July.  In the meantime I'll be working as a tutor trying to save every penny I can.  I'm in mountains of high interest debt (credit cards and student loans) and really don't know the best way to proceed.  So here are the details:

**Private Student Loans:   $15,000 (11% fixed rate interest)**

**Credit Card #1: $7,000 (23% interest)**

**Credit Card #2: $2,000 (19% interest)**

**Credit Card #3: $600 (19% interest)**

**Credit Card #4: $600 (19% interest)**

**Total: $60,200**


For the next few months (end of May until the end of July) I will be living at home with virtually no expenses, and earning $15 an hour working roughly 40 hours a week.  I will be able to save virtually all of this money, however the majority of it will probably go toward start up costs after the move.  I'm estimating start-up costs will be about $2,000 and I should be able to save around $3,000 and I should have the extra grand for any unexpected expenses along the way.

Once I have moved and being my new job, I will be netting **$39,000 per year, or $3,250 per month**.  My rent is partially subsidized as is transportation, and I estimate my essential monthly expenses to be around $1,000 if I live frugally.  (I plan on staying at this job for a few years; the money is not great but it is great experience for my resume.  I will get annually raises of around 5%, so no major increase in income any time soon).

**Expenses**

**Rent: $300**

**Transportation: $0**

**Gas/Electric: $150**

**Phone/Internet: $150**

**Food: $300**

**Misc: $100**

**Total: $1,000**


One of the biggest issues aside from the sheer amount of debt, is that lately I have been unable to make credit card payments.  I am three months behind on each card, and am worried that I may default (does this usually happen after 6 months?)

I'm not sure how I should approach this.  My credit cards are higher interest, but I get the sense that missing loan payments is more serious for student loans?  I will also be paying from overseas which will require a surcharge to either transfer to a bank account back in the states, which I could then use to pay my bills, or possiby multiple surcharges if I pay directly.  Do I have any options for consolidation?  Or is letting my cards default possibly even the better option?  Obviously credit scores are extremely important but at the time being I've kind of accepted the fact that my credit is screwed for a while.  My credit score was mid 700s until this year when my credit card bills went up and up and I was unable to pay.  I'm now sitting at around a 490.  There is also a part of me that thinks I will be okay without credit for a while.  My housing is arranged by my current job, and after I leave this position I will most likely be going back to school for an MBA (with a very high chance of major scholarship or full funding by my current company) so I don't see myself buying a house or anything major like that anytime soon.  Or should I focus on credit cards asap? I really don't know how to approach this, and am feeling rather overwhelmed.

I also know that this post screams financial irresponsibility, and now that I've put this in writing I can't believe I let myself get into this situation.  But alot of things in my life sort of fell apart halfway through college, and I had taken the maximum I was able to take out by myself on federal loans, had no parents to co-sign for a parent plus and was forced to turn to private loans.  Senior year these ran out and I was unable to attain more despite my good credit (due to my current debt load) and was forced to rely on credit cards.  Stupid thing to do, but with my degree almost completed and the fact that it was the only path I could currently see for higher earning potential (and given that I already have so many loans) it seemed like the only option.

So... how fucked am I?  I will be eternally grateful for any advice anyone can give.  Sorry if this is a bit of a ramble and poorly organized, and I can add any more information as needed.  I hope it wasn't too vague either;  I would just rather not disclose the name of the company, or anything too specific about it because it's a very small industry.

I can cut these loans in half and be able to pay the remainder off by middle of next year or I can just leverage the lower rate and take a little longer to pay off the loans, but invest the additional money.

personalfinance,[US] Taking out additional student loans for braces?,"Lengthy explanations of my circumstances/reasoning, skip to TL;DR if you want.


So in the fall I am going to be taking out around 20k in federal and private loans to finish my undergrad in Computer science. I'll only be paying be staying for 2 yrs since I did my first 2 years at a community college so in total it should be 40k give or take a bit. I could cut this in almost half If I was to commute from home during my jr and senior year but I honestly want to experience college without having to commute back and forth.


Now my question, I recently got the chance to meet with a project manager at a big 4 technology company and during our private talk we bought up jobs after graduation and one of the topics bought up was personal appearance. He complimented me on my fashion but suggest I get my teeth fixed before I graduate since some hiring managers (and humans in general) are bias'd against non attractive attributes such as bad teeth and alot of the times it affects their decisions. It made a lot of sense to me when I thought about it and it felt like a decent investment in my future.


So I scheduled stuff with my dentist and started the process of braces. It's going to cost approx 6400 of which I only have 2000. So my plan is to pay what I have towards it now and take out the other 4400 in additional student loans when I go to school in the fall. I asked my financial aid  counselor at my school about it and she said it was a good idea. She also mentioned while the school or government don't investigate how students spend their leftover aid money a medical investment such as braces would be perfectly fine even if they did find out.


So do yall think it's worth it to take out the extra 4400 for braces?


TL;DR: Is it worth taking out 4400 in private student loans in addition to the 44k I am taking out for school. The reason is for Braces.",finance,1460934798

personalfinance,Pension Contributions and limitations to Traditional IRA.,"I am a new Police Officer. About one year on the job. Part of my pay is deducted to make pension contributions.

personalfinance,Felt Confident with my First Car Purchase thanks to /r/personalfinance!,"Hey guys,

After living with a beater car since college, I was finally in a position to purchase my first new car from a dealership today (don't worry, I understand the implications of buying new vs. slightly used, that's a different topic altogether). The resources on /r/personalfinance allowed me to feel completely in control of my purchase and helped me avoid common pitfalls that some folks may run into. Here's just a brief overview of my car buying experience:

* I did a lot of research on the quality index and reliability of certain makes/models to help narrow down the specific car I wanted with help from the [Long Term Quality Index](http://longtermqualityindex.com/)

* I read up on two very helpful reddit posts: [Step by Step Guide on how to buy a car](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3898f1/step_by_step_guide_on_how_to_buy_a_car_my_friend/) and [3 Tricks Car Salesman Use to Take Your Money]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/36pnp0/3_tricks_car_salesmen_use_to_take_your_money/)

* After finding the exact car I wanted, I submitted my information through TrueCar (my employer has some sort of affiliation/deal with them). I submitted a Google Voice phone number an email address that I don't use for anything else so I wouldn't be constantly harassed by calls/emails. I also calculated the exact loan terms and out the door price that I wanted and looked up the auto loan rates at my local credit union.

* After receiving offers from the local dealership (3 of them in my case), I sent the lowest offer to the other dealerships and asked for their lowest out the door price (including taxes, title, and fees). This happened about 4-5 times.

* After receiving prices that were within ~$100 of each other, I scheduled an appointment at the dealership with the lowest OTD cost for a test drive of the car

* I printed out the emails from the dealership with the price I negotiated and went for a test drive. All went well so we sat down to talk about the price/options. I was then given a quote with an additional freight fee ($895) and some added paint-protecting clear-coat ($850). I said I wasn't interested and that the freight fee was included in the Truecar cost already (which was in the email correspondence). They removed both charges.

* I then went to the finance office. The finance manager initially gave me an interest rate of **4.65%** which was WAAAY too high. I advised her that my local credit union could do 1.79%, so I would go with them if they couldn't match it. I told her the exact loan term that I wanted and emphasized the total cost of the car over the monthly payments. She went over the warranty options multiple times, but I stayed firm with my choice of not wanting any additional coverage. They were able to go down to 1.8%. I went with their financing because I also got an additional $500 incentive through Honda for being a recent graduate.

In the end, I walked out with the car I wanted at a great price and felt completely in control. I just wanted to personally thank all the posters at /r/personalfinance for empowering me with the knowledge I needed!

If anyone has questions about my experience, feel free to ask.

personalfinance,"Fiance and I are getting married, where do we go after this?","As the title says, me and my fiance are getting married this fall. Collectively we bring in $105k a year. I will be getting a raise the end of next month of at least 3% so that will add about $1800 more to my salary. 

We currently budget quite well and are able to put away $800/month exclusively from her paychecks (I cover most of the bills with my paychecks) and most of the approx. $150/month that is left over from mine goes to our miscellaneous (spending money). 

We currently have $10k in checking and approx $6k in basic bank savings account. Our wedding is budgeted for $13k total and we are putting $7k towards that. 

We currently pay the following:
- $1300/month in student loans  
- $700/month in car payments  
- $1200/month in rent  
- $400/month in groceries  
- $116/month in Cable  
- $130/month in utilities (gas, electric, water)    
- $180/month in insurance (car and renters)  
- $130/month in cell phone bills (mine and what she pays her mother)  

As I said before we can put away $800/month from her paycheck and right now my extra goes into spending money but that is going to increase when I get a raise the end of the next month. After we get married we are trying to decide what we should do/can do afterwards, we both want to wait to have children until we have a house (neither of us want to raise children in an apartment) but our biggest concern is that our student loans are going to prevent us from being able to afford a house that would be suitable to raise a family in the area we live in. My biggest question is what can we do about our student loans, she has three totaling $21k that are at 10%, 10.25%, 13.25% interests rates. All of the other loans that we have are under 7% interest rate (approx 3.1% to 6.75%) totaling approx $50k to $65k (not sure about the total of the loans that I pay to my parents, parent plus loans). Is it reasonable to wait two years and buy a house and not worry a lot about the student loans or should we put off buying a house to pay off as much of the loans as we can in two years then start saving for a house? I just am not sure what I should be focusing on once we get married.

personalfinance,"Girlfriend is drowning in car debt, what are our options? Details inside.","Hey all.

My girlfriend has a 2014 Honda Civic that is killing her with debt.  Here are the numbers.

Original Amount: $21,497.16

Interest Rate:13.500% APR

Loan Term:72 Month

Monthly Payment: $439.53

Interest Paid YTD: $859.71

Interest Paid in 2015: $1,071.06

Total Interest Paid: $1,930.77

Total Principal Paid: $1,145.94

The bluebook value of the car with her mileage seems to be about 12.5k

She co-signed the loan with her father, and according to her ""The Salesman saw him coming"". The last time she checked her credit (about a year ago), it was 750, and her father was a little higher.

At the time, she had a job that could afford the payments easily, but life happened and she works at Subway now, and her take home average is 245.  She's actively looking for a new job, or a second job, but, well, you all know how it can be finding a job.

Either way,13.5 APR seems pretty high, and it's rough for her to make rent with this massive (relative to her income and the car) debt.

From my understanding, even if she sold the car for close to Bluebook, she'd still owe 8k to cover the gap between the amount owed and the amount the car was paid for, on top of the cost of any car she bought that would be cheaper.  Would it be cheaper?  Possibly, depending on the car (a nice used car for like 5k would mean she'd go from 20k to 13k) but would still likely require a large amount of cash upfront, not to mention the warranties that she still has for any work that needs to be done would no longer apply, so everything would end up being out of pocket.

This kind of situation can't be totally uncommon, so I'd like to know if you guys have any suggestions as to options.  Can we lower the APR somehow?  Refinance?

Now I'm trying to file my 2015 taxes, which amount to about $9k ($7k for the IRS and $2k for the state). But I don't even have $2k to my name.

The thing is, I do have a 2013 Chevy Sonic, which I think if I sell I can get $10-11k for, and I will have $2-3k in the start of July. So, in theory, if I sell my car I can pay off all these debts in a few months.

personalfinance,[Housing] A few questions about rent vs buy and federal loan program length for potential homebuyer.,"A little backdrop:

My wife (23) and I (25) have been living with my folks for a while now, rent free thankfully. I recently began a job that puts me at 30k a year gross with potential advancement within a few years. My wife works part-time while going to school, and will be there for at least two more years.

We are looking to move out this fall after building our savings, with most of the places being 1BR/1BA at roughlu $600/month. These places also quadruple my drive time to work from 15 mins to 1 hour one way.

A few days ago, we found a 1000 sqft house 2BR/1BA at $87k only 5 miles from work. We're having a walk through on Tuesday to see it. It was listed a week ago. We live in a rural area, and are fairly certain we will qualify for USDA Rural Home Loans, covering the down payments and closing costs and at a low rate. The next few things assume a good inspection and the aforementioned loan approval.

1. Would it be a prudent decision to pursue the house? I calculated roughly $600/month for payments including PMI and escrow, and ~$800/month after utilities. We have furnishments already covered in wedding gifts. We take home roughly $2400/month combined, and I receive quarterly bonuses while she receives excess scholarship money. We also live pretty meagerly already. If it is prudent:

2. How long can the process take? The house seems like a perfect match for what we want and need, and do not want to drag our feet and lose out on it. I have heard getting approved for federal housing loan programs can take longer than standard mortgages.

3. Is it stupid to purchase the house and sit on it for a few months before moving in? We were expecting to move this fall anyway. We can put away roughly $1000 a month even with the mortgage payments for a few months. Even then, guaranteeing a house for us to move into at the end of summer is a cost we are willing to shoulder, as long as it isn't detrimental.

Additional info: both credit scores are 690 and 700, and our total bills are ~$700 from a car loan, combined phone bill, credit card debt, and monthly travel and food costs.

Regardless, I'm $95k in debt with Navient, $13kish of which is federal at 6% (I'd like to keep these federal). $82k is private at astronomical rates (9-10.25%, yikes). For the past few years, they've had me on interest only payments as if I was still in school (I've taken a few classes online through a tuition assistance program through work, but not the whole time just a few terms).

Well, logging into my account tonight I saw they're upping my payment to the full $1200ish per month starting in May (it was originally supposed to go up in March 2017, guess they caught on to my non-enrolled status). I'm not debating the payment, I just need help managing it.

Pertinent details:

* Credit score: 680ish through various sources, will go up to 710ish after CC's are paid off in the next month or two.

* Income: $69k on my W2 for 2015

* No degree, I dropped out when Sallie Mae told me no more loans (blessing in disguise, though I didn't know it at the time. Wish they'd done it sooner).

I have some utilization on my credit cards, about 40% at 0% promotional rates which I've been knocking down over the past few months. I used my CC's at 0% to pay down an underwater car I stupidly purchased a few years back so I could rid myself of the payment and insurance, mostly in preparation for these loans jacking up in price.

I'll have the CC's down to less than 10% util. soon which will bring my score back up to the 710ish it was before the balance was put on them (possibly higher, but not by much I think).

I doubt I could get a cosigner, but from what I understand with my income and credit score I probably won't need one. My main issue is not having my degree, I understand Citizen's Bank doesn't require one, but other lenders like SoFi do. I'd like to know of other lenders that will refinance my private loans without a degree as requirement, so if I'm not approved through CB i can have other options.

I hear that checking accounts are what put people into debt (because of credit cards?), and I want to be as debt-free as possible. I'm told that I should open a checking account with no monthly fees, no minimum balance requirement, no limits on the number of transactions, and free atm access. That sounds like a lot to ask for.

I don't want a credit card. I'd like to have a debit card so I'm only spending my own money. I'll use this to open commissions as an artist and costume designer (adding money to the account), something I've been wanting to do for some years. I'll move the money that I earn into my savings account, when I get one.

As for savings accounts I only know to look for one with a higher interest rate, but that interest is almost worthless today.

I'm currently looking at five of the most common, widespread banks in the US:

* Chase
* Bank of America
* Citi
* Wells Fargo
* Capital One

From my own research:

* I can't get much info on Chase because it says all of my zip codes are invalid.
* Bank of America looks good, there's no fee for maintaining a checking account as long as I meet a few standards.
* Citibank also allows customers to avoid service fees, but I don't know what the terms are.
* Wells Fargo has unavoidable fees on checking accounts.
* Capital one has ""fee-free"" checking accounts with annual percentage yields. Is this interest to my advantage?

Which bank is the ""best"" for checking? Which is the ""best"" for saving? Why did you choose your bank? There are a lot of banks to choose from.

Also: will my bank give me a debit card, or will I have to get it from someone like Visa or MasterCard?

[EDIT] After doing some more research, I seem partial to Ally. There are no monthly maintenance fees and I can get reimbursed for using an out-of-network ATM. They also pay me interest, although that isn't worth much.

personalfinance,"Older, non-traditional med student looking at starting school this fall. My financial aid package spooked me and I have some serious questions.","Hi everyone. I'm a non-traditional student (35 yo) who, after several years in the workforce decided to complete a post-bacc program and apply for medical school. I was fortunate to be accepted at a top program in the US, but I just got my financial aid assessment and I'm honestly not sure what to do. I'm confident that medicine is what I want to do with my life, but am concerned that there might be no reasonable way for me to manage this kind of debt going forward. Conventional wisdom on med school debt seems to range from ""doctors are debt slaves"" to ""you're a doc, you'll pay it off in no time"", and from where I'm standing it's hard to get an accurate picture of what might be true for me.

They assessed my eligibility for loans to be ~41k in ""Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans"" and ~37k in ""Federal Direct Graduate PLUS/Alternative Loans"" per year. Tuition at the school runs about 55k per year, so they're offering somewhere around 23k as cost of living expenses if I take the full amount. The school is in a mid-sized city, with typical rent coming in between 700-1000 a month. No need-based aid was given (I assume this is because I have some savings, have been working for several years, and I have no dependents). I may be able to get 5k-8k a year in scholarships that I know of currently.

Geriatrics, palliative care, and pain management are the fields I'm looking at going into most strongly at this point. I have a minor physical disability, so I've largely ruled out fields like surgery that require you to stand for long hours at a time. I currently make about 37k a year, but will be leaving my job in August if I decide to attend medical school. I have about 12k currently available between my savings and checking accounts, and about another 40k that I've managed to save for retirement so far over my working life. My car is paid off, I have no student debt left from undergrad, and I currently have about 2k in credit card debt that I intend to clear before school. My parents are both relatively healthy, but retired and living off of moderate pension funds. I don't think it's reasonable to count on them for much help.

I'm aware of Income-Based Repayment (IBR) and definitely intend to take advantage of it when I get to my residency training. I also have looked at joining the National Service Corps, which offers complete loan forgiveness after a specified term of service, but I can't count on it being a definite option because it's very competitive. Military service is out because of my aforementioned disability.

Any advice at all would be appreciated. I'm sorry if this topic has been covered before. I figured the specifics of my situation might make it worth posting. Thanks in advance. 

Edit 1: I guess specific questions I have about this mainly focus around my age and how it relates to this kind of financial burden. I know it's not unusual for someone who's 23 and starting med school to be looking at this kind of situation, but I'm sure the landscape changes when you're 35 and I'd like to get a sense of how that is true before I dive in.",finance,1460993109
personalfinance,My house is about to go under foreclosure and I have no idea what to do.,"Okay, so I put this under ""debt,"" but this situation is really a lot more complex.  This goes into housing, budgeting, planning, and other.  By the way, I myself am not in debt.  My mother is and I am extremely worried about her.  She is very illogical (to put it lightly) and is still obsessed with my father.  I have been a long time reddit user and I figured that maybe somebody here could help me find something to say to her.  I am a 20 year old guy in college, and I'm currently commuting from my mother's house.

My mom got this house during her divorce and it's 11,000 square feet (I know).  She hasn't worked a day since she got it and has been selling off the rental properties that she got as well.  Now she is 18 months behind on mortgage payments and even if she sold off the rest of her properties we would barely be able to make the payments that she has missed (like 110 thousand)... but I don't think there is time to do that.  Also, we still have about $600,000 left on the house to pay off.  

Under the best conditions, I'd say that this house could sell for 1.9-2.5 million depending on how long we left it for sale and what condition that it is in.  Under our current circumstances:

- We are living in a massive house filled with furniture that we will not be able to move before selling.  Some of which we wish to keep.
- My mom signed for a ""Shark Loan"" to keep herself going until we sell.  The interest rate is 12 percent and she would have to be paying $7000 dollars a month for it (apparently).  This is money that we do not currently have.  (my mom often says that the reason she wants to stay in this place longer is to keep my brother going to his current school).
- We have about 60 thousand left in her account as spending money for food etc.  
- There are still things around the house such as the pool area that need to be maintenance.

What I have been advising my mom to do is to sell the house as quickly as possible to prevent a foreclosure and to stop the equity on the house from being eaten up.  After that, I have said that we should rent a place that is reasonably priced until we figure out the next move.  No long term investments right now. 

INSTEAD, my mom says that she will NOT lower her standards.  I use capitalization for emphasis because this is one of the most frustrating situations I have ever been in.  She wants to buy a town home for $700,000+ and still has no income.  Assuming that we can sell the house for an optimal price (we can't) of 1.9 million.. we still have to shave about $700,000 off of that for what we owe.  So, we walk away with $1.2 million and then have $4-500,000 for spending money.  This would be AMAZING if my mother didn't practically wipe her ass with money.  She spent $150,000 dollars on a three week vacation (just as an example).  My brother, sister, and I had no idea how much money she was spending because we were young.  Now I have been finding out how extravagantly she has been spending her money and it is destroying my view of her.

My father left her with enough to live the rest of her life on.  Easily.  Instead, she threw it all away.  Her justification for this is ""you should be able to live the same lifestyle that you had before your divorce.""  I assure you, my father didn't let spending get that out of control.  Oh, and guess what?  She claims that he owes her more than $300,000 on child support and other expenses, when he doesn't.  I visited him recently to add all of his checks up and her math is wrong.  She has spent the past two years plotting a way to take him to court and get this money from him, all the while everything has been crashing around her.

I have been responsible for taking care of my brother and my mind has been completely distracted by the fact that I may soon also be responsible for taking care of my mother.  She is not mentally stable and I am trying to get her into a place where she can afford a living so that I don't have to worry about her all the time.  BECAUSE I WANT TO LIVE.  She tells me not to worry, that she won't be a burden.  How am I to believe that when I look back on all of the terribly inept decisions she has made in the past?

I have $46,000 in the bank for college and living right now.  Plenty of money to start on.  I am blessed.  But guess what?  My mom sneers at $50k.  If I started spending some money to help support my mother it'd be gone within a month.  

Oh god.  I am sorry that this is so long.  Does anybody that managed to make it to the end of this incoherent mess have any advice?  

Thank you sincerely.


TL;DR:  We need to sell our house quickly and I have no idea where to start.  It is 11k square feet and under optimal conditions would sell for at least 1.9 but we don't have time to wait for it to sell because it could go under foreclosure.  Also, we are 18 months behind on the mortgage and have $700,000 owed on the house.  Currently 60k in spending money (we only have it because if we use it to pay off part of the house we will have zero money to live on).",finance,1460993285

personalfinance,Paying off loans while in deferment.,"I am graduating from professional school in May with a substantial amount of loans. I totally understand the avalanche method, however, I'm not 100% certain how I should pay my loans during the 6 months of deferment. For simplicity, let's say I have two loans: The first is $40,000 at 6.8% and the other is $7,500 at 7.9%. I guess I don't understanding why I wouldn't allocate all of my money to the 6.8% interest because that one is costing me $230 a month compared to $50. I have many more loans, but these are the two I'm interested in during deferment. Also, I'm looking to pay about $4,000 per month starting in August after I get my emergency fund finished; if that makes any difference in this equation. Thank you all for your help and I'm glad I started looking into this subreddit!

EDIT: I forgot to mention that these loans are unsubsidized.
 
EDIT 2: I will mention that right now my monthly payment is $0 and I have no minimum. The numbers i put up top were essentially interest only that I was looking at. 

Also, I'm going to break down my loans even more:

$33,000 principal with $7,800 interest at 6.8%

$5,865 principal with $1,600 interest at 7.9%

$33,000 principal with $4,400 interest at 5.41%

$5,500 principal with $875 interest at 6.41%

$33,000 principal with $3,000 interest at 6.21%

$33,000 principal with  $900 interest at 5.84%

I think what I'm hearing is to pay off all of the interest first before it gets tacked on to principal. Then, pay the higher interest rates off.",finance,1460998392

personalfinance,Student loan repayment vs. padding emergency fund?,"Hi again r/personalfinance.

I'm currently focused on debt repayment (I started in February) and am on track to have $13,600 of credit card debt paid off by October. I'm currently allocating $700 per paycheck towards debt, so about $1400 extra per month. This is the most I can plan to put in consistently while paying all the bills and leaving money for groceries, but I put extra in when I can (i.e., tax refund, any extra $$ left over the day before payday). It sucks but it's training me to live within my means. 

I also have $6200 in federal student loan debt at 6.55% interest. By November (which is when my credit cards are done), I'm estimating it to be at around $5745. The minimum monthly payment is $122. I'm one month ahead on payments, and if I continue on with the snowball, then I could have this out of my hair by February of next year. 

As the interest is tax deductible, the minimum payment isn't terrible, and I have repayment options in the event of a job loss, it hasn't been a huge priority to get rid of this debt. We only have about $3000 in emergency savings, so I'm thinking of just continuing to pay the minimum on the student loan and hoarding cash in savings until we have a proper 3 month emergency fund. Both my job and my husband's job are pretty stable, but you never really know what can happen and it's always given me anxiety that our savings fund is so low. Another option is to cut the snowball in half and take care of both at the same time.

personalfinance,Boss confused by base salary with my potential earnings with bonus. Frustration.,"Hey r/personal finance, not sure if this is the appropriate place for this, but here goes.  

A little background: I've been working my ass off the past year, gunning for a raise or a promotion, taking on new responsibilities, working odd/extra hours. A few weeks ago, I was informed by my boss that I was receiving a SUBSTANTIAL raise for my base salary (~18%). So I watched and waited for my bank account to reflect said raise, and it never did. I talked to my boss about this, and it turns out he got my base salary confused with my potential total earnings with bonuses. So it turns out it was more like a 3% raise.  

In retrospect, an 18% raise is probably ridiculous and unrealistic, but I couldn't help but feel completely deflated after asking my boss and being informed about this miscommunication, especially after putting forth a ton of effort which I feel warrants more than a 3% raise.  

I read some of u/drhorn 's writeups on salary negotiations and strategies for those, so I know I can make a plan on how to attack this situation in the future. I'm still feeling kind of miffed that I got my expectations up real high for 3 weeks, and now they're shot. Just needed to vent about this. Thanks

We received a letter in 2015 from Los Angeles's Tax Discovery Program AB63. They say we owe business taxes due to our 2014 filings.

In 2014, I was in graduate school. My wife was under-employed that specific year. We filed about $33k gross income for federal/state. I was paid via W2. My wife did work that year briefly as a temp. She worked at one law firm for several days, as their secretary was out for jury duty. They paid her in a 1099, rather than a W2. A few months later, she worked a few weeks as a legal temp at an associated law firm: one of their paralegals was out for maternity leave. They also paid my wife via 1099.  So she had a 1099-misc for $640, and a 1099-misc for $3014. 

The letter says that she failed to register as an independent business, and we owe specific/extra taxes. I originally called City Hall, and they told me I just needed to send in a letter response, that we didn't qualify under the program but that anyone with a 1099-misc got the original letter. I did, and **just** received their rejection asking me to refile and pay the taxes. I've been trying to get a hold of them. I can't find any straight answers online about this, though I'm finding a lot from freelancers/contractors complaining. Does being a ""office temp"" really mean that we need to pay business taxes?!

I sent my original letter response in November 2015. Their 'rejection letter' was dated March 30th. I just emailed City Hall asking why it was rejected and they responded with a generic stock email, telling me I needed to file for a 'small business exemption' by February, which I obviously missed since I didn't know they rejected me until long after that. I'm seeing online that they're adding late fees now to people too?

Thankfully we did not have any 1099-misc in 2013, and did not file any in 2015.

personalfinance,Looking for strategies to help manage about $10k/month in rent and utilities for a big house I do not own,"Hi PF!

Shortly I will become the sole leaseholder for a large house in NYC. I've lived here for a bit already, so I'm comfortable with the house, the tenants, the landlord, etc. 

My questions are these:

Because the landlord wants a single check for the rent, I'm obliged to combine rents from the individual tenants (and myself). 

Also, because it's a large house, there are multiple, sizable utility bills (electric and internet/tv, primarily). I have already developed a system to divvy those up that everyone agrees is fair. 

This all adds up to about $10k per month moving in and out of my hands.

My first thought was to create a separate checking account and keep all house business partitioned from my personal finances. For obvious reasons.

But does anyone have any advice about how I can do this ... smarter? Like credit cards with rewards, or bank (non-investment) accounts with some sort of interest rates for when my landlord inevitably takes three months to cash some checks? This shouldn't have tax implications for me, I assume ...

After the amended return the rep told me all I had to do was mail two more pieces of paperwork into the IRS to pay for the taxes I owed for the most recent W2. I wrote the checks for the corresponding new taxes and put them in the envelopes to take them to the dropbox later.

Well I stupidly forgot until today and the deadline is tonight. I put the letters in the mailbox earlier today. Do I have anything to worry about?

Sorry this is a bit noobish, I just know not to fuck with the IRS and I'm worried I'll get slammed in the future for this small mistake. For one piece of paperwork I didn't have to pay anything more to the state because it was less than $2 or $1 (according to the tax rep) and the other piece was for federal taxes and was around $52. How can I be sure I'm good?

personalfinance,PF! We want to buy a condo/townhome in the next 1.5-2 years but is this possible for us?,"Hey r/pf! Sorry in advance for the long post.

After quite a few years of fucking up financially, my spouse and I (I think) finally got our act together and are serious about digging ourselves out of debt, settling down and acting like grown ups. We are planning to move to Seattle sometime next summer and buy a house (ha) or a condo so we can finally plant roots. My hope is that we can find a suitable space for my husband and I, my elderly grandmother, two cats, a dog and a baby (a few years down the line). It’s a tall order in Seattle where houses of any decent (Read: 1000+ sq. ft) size price in the 450k and up, but my thinking is that we could get a 2,  maaaaybe 3 bedroom condo for the next five years and sell once we’re ready to have kids and need more space. 

We’d really like to stay under $250k on a house in Seattle given our current income/debt ratio. Yes, I know this is a tall order. We're willing to go up towards Lynnwood if need be.

Is this even remotely possible to accomplish in the next 12-18 months, or are we fooling ourselves? Here’s what we’ve got going on now in terms of finances; for what it’s worth, our plan is to simultaneously save for a down payment this year while also bringing down our credit card debt.

Our Debts:

$23,091 over several credit cards varying from 0% - 26.99% APR (yeah, it sucks…)

$8700 car lien @ 2.1%

$1700 personal loan @ 6.7%

$65,781 student loans (private and federal)

TOTAL: ~$100k in various debts between the two of us (more suck).

Our Income: 

Me: Registered Nurse with some specialty certifications. Trying to do 1 OT shift a week if census/staffing allows. Gross income is  ~$52,000/yr without OT. 

Him: Works for Apple retail. Gross is approx $32,000/yr. Isn’t able to pick up a second job but due for promotion soon which should increase to $35,000/yr. No degree but love what he does and is good at it.


Following Dave Ramsey’s advice, we stopped our 401k/ESPP temporarily to help pay down our credit cards and get more income flowing in. We have $1000 in savings for emergencies.

Grandma: Is on social security put when she moves in can contribute ~$2400/yr to expenses. Not great but I ain’t having her move in with us for the money, I want to take care of her.


TOTAL: $84,000/yr with the ability to gross more in Seattle due to COL adjustments, possibly up to $91,000/yr (based on the hospital I’m looking at moving to).

Our Monthly Budget/Expenses:

Rent/Utilities/Netflix/Cell Phones: $1510

Car/Renter's Insurance: $140

Savings/Memberships/Car Maintenance: $148

Groceries/Household Supplies: $525

Clothing: $25

Gas: $65

Pets: $75

Fun: $100

Credit card min’s: $525

Loan min’s: $900

Extras to credit cards and savings: ~$900/mo + any extra income/split into two between two accounts.
In 12 months, we will have ~5000k in savings for house, ~5000k down in credit cards.

gaming,An Open Letter to All of the Gaming Communities of Reddit,"Hi Reddit,

There have been a lot of things on my mind lately relating to some shit that's been going down in the gaming industry. Most of these things are fairly widespread behaviors, and I would like to start a large community-wide discussion about these things. Before that, though, I'm going to ask that you listen carefully to everything that I have to say before you pass judgement. Chances are you'll disagree with some of what I have to say, but that's okay. I don't need to be right. I just think that the gaming community needs to keep some things in mind, and being aware of certain things is a huge first step.

With that in mind, let's begin:

Bullying and Bayonetta
=====

Something that gamers have always done is flaunt where people's choices stand in a tier list. In a vaccum, this isn't an issue, and trash talk is almost an essential part of sports/esports, but, well, often times people go way too far. As a little bit of background, Bayonetta is a character who is currently considered as the top tier choice in Smash 4. It's debatable (or at the very least, I'm not aware for sure) whether or not she is as much stronger than her closest peers as Meta Knight was in Brawl, but recent comments by a top player named ZeRo have led to massive amounts of bullying of people who so much as pick her in a tournament. It has gotten to the point where people have publicly stated that they will not be playing Bayonetta, a character that some of them picked before even knowing how strong she would be, out of fear for their well-being.

(Please note that while the catalyst for this particular set of incidents was probably ZeRo, it was other members of the community that took his words too far. That is why I name him here while neglecting to name some other gamers in future dialogue.)

This isn't an isolated incident among the Smash 4 community either. Over the past weekend, in Clash Royale, a popular mobile game, someone running an unpopular card made it to the finals of the first official Clash Royale tournament. As he was being interviewed by the staff of the tournament, a popular youtuber proceeded to shoot him maliciously with confetti. This action was actually somewhat lauded amongst the community, with some comments along the lines of ""Serves him right for playing X card.""

I'd rather not get into a lecture on why bullying is wrong, as I think that much should be obvious, but I'll move into a discussion of the underlying cause of this sort of bullying instead.

There is a concept in gaming that Extra Credits refers to as [Perfect Imbalance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w), which, to paraphrase, says that sometimes strategy B should be better than strategy A, which is okay if strategy C loses to A, but beats B. That is, A&lt;B&lt;C&lt;A. This is good, and ends up promoting some amount of a healthy metagame. Now, rather than realizing that ""Hey, I'm running 'B' strategy because it does well against strategy 'A'. This is why I do poorly against 'C'."" players will often go ""C is overpowered, takes no skill, and needs to be nerfed."" If this happens, then players will start to hate the people who use 'C', and this is when problems arise.

What I would recommend as some amount of a course of action, aside from the obvious ""please help to stop bullying in any form because holy fucking shit is it harmful,"" is that you, as gamers, take a step back when you think something is OP and ask yourselves, ""Is this really OP, or is it just good against what I'm playing?"" If you do find that something is OP, take another look at what you found and ask yourself what the OP strategy's weaknesses are (as, with the exception of really terrible balance jobs, there WILL be some weaknesses in everything), and figure out what you can do to exploit those weaknesses. This will help you to improve as a player, and maybe as a person as well.

Programming and Gaming
=====

On to a brighter note, I'd like to talk about how I can sometimes see programming misrepresented in gaming communities. For starters, I'd like to start with a [relevant xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1425/) that more or less says that even tasks which seem similar in nature can be wildly different in how much effort it takes to solve.

Now, in the realm of Computer Science, everything is a trade-off. The most common trade-off is between memory and time. Thankfully, as technology has improved, memory no longer needs to be conserved as well, and so we can do some really cool things to save lots of time.

For example, let's say that I want to calculate if a number is prime or not. If I need to save memory, but time isn't an issue, I could check every number less than my number to see if my number is divisible by it. On the other hand, if I want to conserve time at the cost of memory, I can keep a table and only divide the number by prime numbers that are less than my number (and yes I know both solutions can be optimized a lot further). In making a game, companies will have to make a lot of choices of that nature, and eventually, games that seem very similar on the outside, such as DotA 2 and League of Legends, become very different on the inside. This is why, even without other external factors that I will get into shortly, it is not trivial to say that ""Company A solved this problem, why can't Company B?""

As previously mentioned, there are other factors as well. Some programs run really well with small numbers of users, but then fare poorly as the number of users climbs. Oftentimes, people will cite that a third-party solution or a competitor's solution could be used easily, when the competitor and third-party solution may fail if it were used ten times more often, and so a similar first party solution is not viable. In addition, third-party solutions are often held to much lower standards by way of security than first-party solutions, primarily because first-party solutions are used more, and are thus a more attractive target for a point of attack.

In addition, each individual programmer can only work on one thing at a time, having more programmers on an individual task can delay the task more than it speeds it up as the number of programmers gets larger, and it becomes increasingly difficult to keep code working well the more people you have working on the same area of code at once, even if those people are working on different things.

While I originally thought I would open up discussion on League and it's failure to provide a replay system here, as I have already alluded to in several of my examples, I think a more potent topic would be discussing some of the thought behind the shutting down of Nostalrius, which I will cover more in a later section.

I have heard suggested many times, ""Hey, why doesn't Blizzard just hire the people responsible for Nostalrius to make a Blizzard sanctioned Vanilla server."" and while there are somewhat more valid solutions that may satisfy everyone, this one is a bit more difficult to make work. For one, an assumption is made that every person who worked on Nostalrius would pass the typical background check performed by a company such as Blizzard. In addition, without seeing the source code, it is difficult to say for sure that Nostalrius lives up to current security standards. The amount of work that would go into verifying both of these things would be substantial, and even if the programmers of Nostalrius agreed to work for free, it would still cost Blizzard a substantial chunk of money that may or may not pay for itself.

Which leads us to our next topic:

Nostalrius and Legal Shit
=====

I would like to preface this by saying that I am not a lawyer, so take anything I say here with a grain of salt.

Now that that's established, let's talk about some of the other reasons why Blizzard was more or less forced to shut Nostalrius down. 

Hypothetically speaking, it is unlikely that Nostalrius was causing any significant amount of revenue loss. That being said, legally, if Blizzard does not shut them down, any future copyright claims that they make are now weaker. This means that if, say, someone were to make a private server of current content with maybe a more appealing version of garrisons that WOULD cause Blizzard to lose money, Blizzard would be much more likely to lose the lawsuit because they knowingly allowed Nostalrius to exist. It sucks, but it's something I would blame on the way the U.S. legal system works, rather than blaming Blizzard, and I know I'm not smart enough to suggest improvements to the current copyright system.

If they officially sanctioned it, then that alleviates some amount of the stress from this particular scenario, but I believe they would also have to provide a process by which private servers could become sanctioned in the future, and they would also bear some amount of legal responsibility for people that they hadn't even hired, both of which end up being pretty big deterrents to this idea.

Monetization and ""Cashgrabs""
=====

One more thing that I would like to cover is game monetization. Now, for starters, every U.S. based company has a legal obligation to make as much money as they can. However, that goal can be offset by things without monetary value. For instance, building brand loyalty through not screwing over all of their customers is a valid reason for not making horrendous ""cashgrabs"" all the time, but there are limits to these things. In the case of Nostalrius, yes, the game peaked at 150,000 active accounts, but that number is roughly 1% of the peak number of subscribers. When MMO's are about progression and as content stalls, players leave, it is difficult to see a future for a server that, by definition, cannot add too much more content. As a company, it is hard to justify spending resources to gain what, on an optimistic note may be a 5% larger player-base, when they could be spending resources on making a larger amount of their player-base happy and likely to stay playing the game by improving the core game.

Moving towards a more general discussion, I'd like to start on something a little bit unrelated. As a community, we need to learn to pick and choose our battles a little more carefully. Yes, we can complain about everything under the sun, but it helps more if we have more unified complaints about specific topics. For instance, voice comms. in League is something many players want. It is also something that a very substantial number of players don't want. While there are fairly decent arguments on either side, by this point Riot has more or less made up their minds on the topic. To that end, instead of spending energy rehashing the same old points in that end on something that isn't very likely to change, energy could better be spent on topics where Riot IS more likely to change their minds (such as including a sandbox mode, or perhaps using booths in their competitive scene). In addition, before suggesting features, it is often wise to check to see if they have been suggested before, or are in the process of being implemented by the company. For instance, I have seen several posts with ideas on how to supplement gold income in Clash Royale (mostly through providing some amount of gold from wins) even after Supercell announced that they would probably be adding a reward of bonus gold for wins in the patch that will hit next month. The inundation of repetitive ideas prevents other ideas which may be more valuable from showing their face.

On the topic of monetization in general, when suggesting ideas to a company, it is important to note the difference between an idea in which the company is merely taking a temporary hit to their potential income (often-times this will result in the company making more money in the future, so it can be win-win), or if an idea undermines the structure of a game's monetization scheme entirely.

The aforementioned idea about adding some amount of gold per win is a temporary hit. A small amount of people will spend less gems on buying gold, however, people will be more likely to play the game for longer, and will likely spend gems on other things. On the other hand, another commonly suggested idea of allowing players to discard chests that they do not wish to open would entirely undermine two of the three ways of actually spending the premium currency in Clash Royale. There would no longer be a point in buying chests, as you would just discard the less valuable chests and open the more valuable chests for a fraction of the cost, and there would no longer be a point in spending gems to open chests, as you could just discard the shitty silver and gold chests and spend all of your time opening giant chests, magical chests, and super magical chests.

On a similar vein to picking and choosing your battles, we as a community should be careful to avoid denouncing everything as a ""cashgrab"". While companies are certainly trying to make money (as they should), the phrase loses its meaning when we use it too often and in the wrong places. 

Again, falling back on League as an example, while the chromatic skins are the most egregious form of a cash-grab in recent history by Riot because they are in a bundle, the fact that their artists are continuing to work on more skins in general is good for everybody, despite the fact that you may think they should be spending their resources somewhere else. The majority of Riot's income comes from selling cosmetics, as far as I know. It is probably a fair assessment to say that, on average, each skin makes more than it costs to make. Let's say that I have $10. I can then either make a skin, which costs $10 and makes me $20, or I can make a replay system, which costs $10, makes me $0, but does make it more likely for people to buy more skins in the future. The obvious course of action is for me to first make the skin, then have $20 to make another skin and the replay system at the same time. This way I don't run out of money, and I provide people with what they want, albeit, a bit later.

As a reminder, for an online game, you NEED the company to continue making money. If they start losing money on a game, they may shut it down, and you don't get to play the game any more. So be careful as to what you're calling a company greedy for, as some of it is most likely a necessary evil.

Final Remarks
=====

In closing, I would have liked to discuss the difference between f2p, p2w, and p2c (pay to compete) models, as well as some other things, such as that just because a company makes a decision that you don't like doesn't mean it's a bad choice for the game in general, and that just because someone agrees with something a company did doesn't make them a shill, and by calling them such, you are committing a logical fallacy, but I'm getting tired so I think I'm going to leave this post as it is.

Penultimately, if you honestly need a tl;dr, bullying sucks, programming is hard, I believe shutting down Nostalrius was in Blizzard's best interest, and for the love of god, not everything is a cash grab. But seriously, the topics are a LOT more nuanced than just that, so please read what I have to say before you respond.

Lastly, I understand that some of my examples may be a little alienating. After all, not everybody plays Clash Royale or League of Legends. If anything is particularly confusing, let me know and I can try to find common ground in our gaming history to make an example from, or I'll just try to do my best to explain my position in a way that common ground isn't necessary.",technology,1461044751

For the past few months and the rest of 2016 I plan on holding EWZ (Long Brazil) especially with the governmental changes and the current commodity cycle that we are experiencing.

As a very diversified ETF in another deflationary environment, if interest rates were to follow inflation downwards there stands an interesting opportunity for the indian mid-cap market.

personalfinance,How to manage setting up reasonable payments for different kinds of debt?,"Hi, I have a question related to debt repayment. I've been reading posts on this subreddit for a while and it has been very helpful, yet I still feel like I'm not sure how exactly to manage my own personal debt without leaving myself nearly broke every payday. So any advice would be greatly appreciated.

A little background info: I'm 31 years old, army vet, I work for the government, and graduated from college last year (I borrowed from 2 different lenders) and have recently bought a 2011 vehicle last summer. I make 44k per year and I'm currently repaying one of my college loans, my vehicle loan, and trying to figure out a repayment plan for my most recent college loan. I'm living frugally and by myself in a small $500/month apartment and somehow still finding myself fairly swamped in monthly bills (phone $80/m, internet $70/m, car insurance $80/m, grocery 200-250/m, and 300-500/m payments on my 2k credit card debt).

Although this information depresses me...I finally got the nerve to add up all my debt last week and the total amount that I have financed altogether is just under 64K. I have 40k in student loans (from the two different lenders). The two more recent student loans I have are: two direct subsidized loans, and two direct unsubsidized loans. The older student loans I have are two subsidized federal stafford loans, and one unsubsidized federal stafford loan. I've managed to set-up an income based repayment plan ($66/month) with my older student loans but still need to set them up for my new student loans (which was trying to set me up for $500/month payments). The reason I set up income-based repayment is so that I could knock out my credit card debt as quickly as possible (both my credit cards were one-year promotional 0% apr for one year offers). Both offers end this summer. Which is when I'm trying to have them both paid off. 

I also pay about $360/month on my 21k in a vehicle loan, and about $80/month in car insurance. 

(Sorry that a lot of this information is just jumbled together... )

So recently I have been paying enormous payments on my credit cards $300-600/month. I have been trying really hard to erase this debt and free myself of it. My goal is to eventually pay this credit card debt off and then set up a repayment plan on my newer student loan that will allow me to develop a small savings (which would cover moving expenses when I apply to a newer, better paying position). 

My question is: Is this a good plan? Am I overlooking something that I should be paying more attention to? The different types of student loans that I have fairly confuses me in that I'm not sure which I should be trying to pay off first. Instinct tells me to pay off the older ones first. I would like to increase my monthly payments after my credit card debt is wiped out and develop a 2-3 year savings plan (for the moving expenses I mentioned) of about 2-3K. 

Thanks a lot for reading this and sorry if it's kind of confusing. I will try to clarify any information that I didn't mention.",finance,1461071712
personalfinance,Help analyzing loans,"Not sure if this is technically in the wrong subreddit, but r/studentloans seemed to be a bit lacking in responses and there's another variable thrown into the mix so I wanted to post here to see if anyone could offer some advice pertaining to some of my current debts.

The info:

Just started a job for 65k on 4/4. Monthly income is a few dollars over $3,600.

Have 6 student loans. Current payments on loans total to $585.  
  1) 2,148 @ 5.6%  
  2) 311 @ 4.5%  
  3) 11,094 @ 3.4%  
  4) 11,009@ 6.8%  
  5) 12158 @ 5.41%  
  6) 16,414 @ 6.21%  
Total $53,136.54

Have a 5 year car loan that initiated in late 2013. Remaining balance is $11,626 and monthly payments are about $415 a month. I realize this is a pretty high loan for a car but it's not something I'd like to get rid of due to the fact that my commute is about an hour to an hour and a half to get to work.

I've gotten pretty good at budgeting and my total expenses, including the payments listed above, total to 2,415, leaving me 1,185 in excess for savings, additional payments, etc.

Now onto my actual questions

I submitted an application for student loan refinancing and was approved for the entire amount at 4.52% variable or 5.71% fixed. This would reduce the loan to a 5 year term (want to pay it off as quickly as possible) and increase the payments to $785 per month. I am only planning to refinance loans 1, 4, 5, and 6 since those interest rates are the higher rated loans. With the refinancing, I would be reducing loans 1, 4, 5, and 6 to a 5 year term, but keep loans 2 and 3 at 10 year for now, which for 2 and 3 would be about $115 per month, totaling to $900 per month in student loan payments. In turn, my excess cash would drop to $875. 

Does there seem to be any risk in refinancing with these numbers? I'm not sure if, with the amount of my excess cash, it makes sense to start dumping money into specific loans through my current provider rather than refinance? What about refinancing (which from my understanding would consolidate the loan) and using my excess cash to pay off my car faster so that in a year or so I'd have an additional 415 to throw at the refinanced loans? Am I not thinking this through all the way?

I've been a lurker on this sub for quite a while and know everyone here can be extremely helpful. Looking for any advice, insight, or feedback you guys might be able to offer. Please let me know if you have any questions that might be able to better assess my situation. I'll try to respond as soon as possible but it might be tough given that I'm at work.

personalfinance,Moving to US from UK (to marry a USC) and slightly overwhelmed by the contrast in tax/finance systems. A few questions I would appreciate some general advice on...,"Hi /r/PersonalFinance,

I will soon be moving to the US to marry my Fiancee and start a new chapter in my life. I must say, that I am finding the tax/financial differences from the UK to be substantial. Perhaps I am worrying unnecessarily, but even as a well educated man the vast array of varying forms and nuances in your system seems complex and easy to get wrong.

I have, for the most part, spent my entire working life within the UK *PAYE* system: that is to say everything is automatically deducted and calculated from my employer provided income. This includes all taxes, national insurance contributions, pension and student loans. Virtually zero input has ever been required on my part. Not to say I can't manually deal with much of this, just that I will be jumping from an immensely simple setup to a complicated scenario with income and assets derived in two countries.

With that in mind, I'm aware the best solution may well be to hire a CPA in the beginning but if there is any general guidance you can offer as to how best to approach this so I launch off on the right foot, it would be greatly appreciated.

------------------

**Key points to note about living scenario:**

* I will be married and living in NJ.
* My soon to be wife and I will probably earn very similar amounts at the outset as I am purposefully choosing to reduce my income in favour of free time to pursue my own ventures.
* We have no immediate overheads regarding housing (no rent, utilites, taxes etc) as we have been gifted free use of a family property (yes, we are very very lucky).

**Key points to note about income:**

* I will be working remotely for my previous UK employer (Architect) from the US. The time will vary but I've set it at roughly 50% my normal weekly hours. This will amount to maybe $30,000 annual. Paid in GBP into my UK accounts.
* I now (from Apr 16) rent out two properties in the UK from which I will derive income (after all costs) of approx $1010 p.c.m. Paid in GBP into my UK accounts.
* I will be founding an LLC in the US with a niche clothing brand in the UK to expand their distribution. The market potential is excellent but obviously income will be minimal to begin with. All income/expense in USD from US accounts.
* My other half has full time employment in the US (which includes health insurance for me...woohoo!) for approx $36,000 annually.
* I have a tiny (and I mean tiny) private pension in a UK scheme that do not currently contribute to.
* I have personal savings in excess of $30,000 that is not doing anything.

**Obvious debts:**

* My fiancee has federal student loans amounting to approx: $65,000. these are consolidated to a single provider and she is currently on an income based repayment that is a meager $150 p.c.m 
* I have about $5k student loan left to pay in the UK but it's an entirely different system. The payments are minimal and automatically income based. You don't even pay them back with income below a certain threshold.
* Both properties in the UK I am renting out have large mortgages. These are interest only payment at the moment.
* Neither of us have any CC debt or other loans. We own our own cars etc.

------------------

**My questions as follows:**

* Would we likely be better off filing married joint taxes as opposed to married filing separately? (EDIT: rephrased to remove any suggestion of married or single when I mean joint or separate).
* How complex is it (using turbo-tax or similar) to include foreign income? I will have to file a self-assessment in the UK as well to confirm all income derived there and the applicable tax. I believe this is then rebated in the US due to the double taxation agreements between our countries. As any US citizens living abroad still have to file in the US I assume the software has this mechanism?
* Am I correct in thinking my new LLC will just be pass-through taxation that is a relatively simple additional form on my tax return?
* What income does the 15% self-employment tax apply? Just US derived or my UK as well? Is income form property rental treated differently to income from actively working?
* At what point do I have to file an FBAR to notify the IRS of accounts holding more than $10K cumulative abroad? Is this easy to do? As soon as I enter the country, when I have an SSN 10 days later, when I'm married or when I finally get my green card after filing my adjustment of status?
* Will I be better off hiring a CPA to undertake everything? If yes, how can I find one with experience of foreign income without it costing the earth?
* Are there any other obvious basic tax items I should be aware of that could affect me?

**Other minor thoughts:**

* Am I going to have to settle for a tiny secured credit card with my bank/credit union when I first move to the US? My primary CC (Barclays Amex) here is auto-paid off every month for the full amount and I have a limit exceeding $15k/month (which obviously I never hit). But from everything I've read I'll essentially be seen as the worst of the worst to any US financial provider.
* How difficult will obtaining a reasonable car lease/loan be? If I have a co-signer with a perfect US credit rating I assume this will help significantly.
* I am extremely perplexed by all your retirement/savings options. I haven't even had a chance to digest them yet but I'll clearly need to go through some basic financial re-education. Appreciate the sidebar will be a good footing.
* I have previously been using YNAB as my record/reporting software for personal banking (don't really use the budget features). They do not handle multiple currencies so I'm likely switching to MoneyWhiz. any other alternatives welcome.

Apologies if any of this seems confused and/or rudimentary.

personalfinance,Surgical resident in an unique financial situation looking to balance 230K in loans,"I am a fourth year medical student graduating this May. I will be starting residency in a 5 year surgical specialty at an academic hospital in California. 

I have no debt from college and am $230,000 in debt from medical school. 

A breakdown of that $230,000 debt profile is an unsubsidized Stafford loan ($173000, interest rate about 6.8%), GradPLUS loan ($18000, interest rate about 7.9%), and a School of Medicine subsidized loan ($24,000, interest rate 8%). 

My starting salary will be $52,000 and will go up to $61,000 during my last year of residency. I plan on doing a 1 year fellowship afterwards which should pay about the same. Afterwards, depending on the subspecialty of fellowship I do, my expected starting salary is between $250,000 and $400,000 depending on my subspecialty and location of living.

The residence that I will be living in during residency is owned by my parents and is close to the hospital; I will not be paying any rent/utilities/internet/car insurance/cell phone bills. I am single, live frugally, and want to do what I can to properly plan for the future. 

I am looking at using the Revised Pay as you Earn Repayment plan (REPAYE) but have looked at PAYE and IBR (income based repayment) plans as well. Essentially, these plans have you pay a certain percentage of your discretionary income (10%) and the remaining balance for the loan after 25 years is forgiven. I was initially going to try to pay as much as possible towards my loans, but after running the calculator with the PAYE/REPAYE plans, it looked as if I would be paying less money back by doing one of the income based repayment plans as opposed to a brute force 10 year standard repayment plan due to forgiveness after the 25 year repayment. 

As such, I am in an unique situation (of most of my medical school friends that took out loans) in that I have no real living expenses other than food/gas. I should be making about $3000 per month after taxes. Of this, about $500 will be going towards loan repayment, $400 will be going towards food/gas, and $100 for miscellaneous purchases. That allows me about $2000/month for some type of investment. 

I am planning on maxing a Roth IRA ($460/month). My employer will not match 401K contributions or start a 401K. 

What are your recommendations on what to do? Open a Roth 401K and try to contribute as much as possible to that? Invest outside of the 401K? Put aside some money ($500 or so/month) to invest in stocks/index funds?

(One thing that I am unsure about is whether the government will maintain the loan forgiveness after 25 years. To offset the risk of it potentially going away, I was thinking of putting the money that I would have put away into loan repayment—$1500/month or so as opposed to the $500/month I will be doing now towards loans—into some sort of investment…just unsure as to exactly what). 

Thank you so much and I look forward to reading and investigating each of your responses.",finance,1461075633

Is it deducted from differently because it's PTO only? Is it because on my W4, I've requested a flat additional amount be taken from each check, and that additional amount exceeds what would be deducted were no flat amount requested? The Federal Withholding seems to be about 1/5 of what's usually withheld from a paycheck that is normally 10 or 11 times the hours of this one, which would seem to be incorrect in terms of ratio, but may still be because my W4 says 'Take X from every check?'.

personalfinance,"Messed up credit BADLY in college, need some help making a plan. Lots of info inside","Hello everyone. Like a lot of college students (I'm at least told) I had a large impact on my credit score early on in college, except mine was in a hugely negative way.

Back story: Freshman year of college I got an new, really nice (at the time) job with a high salary and I thought I was going to have it all 4 years of college. The problem was that 1) This job was a temporary position (I knew this at the time.) and 2) I was dumb. So while having this job, I opened up multiple credit cards (3), on top of the ones I already had that my parents opened up, and my student loans. After I lost that job (about 6 months after opening all those cards). I began falling behind on the payments, and then eventually they ended up being charged off, all while NOT telling my parents because I didn't want them to know that I had fucked up this badly (the main reason), and two because I didn't want them to worry about me because my mom was sick and they had their own problems. 

So I currently now have a job again, that is not a temporary position, but I'm (probably obviously) more interested in fixing my credit/saving my money than I am spending it. 

Now that you have a backstory here where I am currently:

Current monthly income: ~$1200

I've moved back in with my parents, car is paid off, my only (current) monthly expenses other than whats below is Gas and Food. 

Current credit score(bad): Less than 550

Open accounts, but NOT negatively affect my credit (i think):

* Federal Loan through FedLoan: 1sub stafford loan 2 unsub, total of $10,00 currently all in Forbearance

* CitiCard Credit Card: balance of $1490, $1700 credit limit, paying ~$80 a month on it. (Parents opened/both paying.)

* Macy's Card: Balance ~$80, $900 credit limit. (Parents opened/paying)

* Lowes Card: Balance ~$500, $650 credit limit. (Parents opened/still paying.)

Now the bad stuff,that IS negativity affecting my me  that I opened freshman year of college.

* Barclays Credit Card: $2200 balance, $2400 limit. Charged Off.

* Chase Credit Card: $1200 balance, $1200 limit. Charged Off.

* Amazon Store Card: $1100 balance, $900 limit. Charged Off.

* Sallie Mae Loan: $9700 balance, currently paying on time, but had a 120 day period where I didn't pay.

All the information above is gathered from my credit report. 

Current plan: 

* Start paying the FedLoan (currently in Forberance) Loans.

* Stay on track with Sallie Mae Loan

* Bring the balance of the Lowes card down to ~$100, over the next 3 months..

* Bring balance of the CitiCard down to ~$700 over the next 3 months.

The main problem is, I don't know what to do about the cards that were Charged Off, and I need advice/help about dealing with them.

I understand that I can't make them magically disappear and have my score go up, but i would at least like to be able to reach a point where I feel comfortable enough moving out and not worry about how my credit is going to affect where I can live to the extreme. 

I also understand that I am in a incredibly lucky position where I can fix this, which is why I need help taking advantage of the situation.

Thank you! I would be more than happy to give more information if needed.",finance,1461087722

personalfinance,"Mother passed away, father is in bad shape financially. Need general advise on what to do next.","My mother (70) passed away three weeks ago leaving my father (71), three adult children (40-50), and eight grandchildren (12-20). There is a family owned business that my mother and father were both very active in. My older siblings were also active in the business. I had nothing to do with it. Through years and years of trying to keep the business running, my father (and to a lesser degree, my brother) made a lot of unsound financial decisions that leaves him with a mountain of tax debt (federal and state) and a long line of creditors and lien holders waiting to get their hands on any assets that may appear.

The house (and most of its contents) are off the table. There is already a lien on the house that could get called at any time. I don't understand the details of it at this point, but basically my father sold the house to a company to act as a shelter of some sort to prevent the IRS or the state from seizing it, allowing my parents to continue to live there (although they are paying for it). But that could go away at any time...so there is no equity to be had there.

So, he's in really bad shape financially. I'm looking for some general guidance on what we could do to more or less take over his finances (and living arrangements) in a way that wouldn't put any of us kids at risk of becoming a target for asset seizure. My brother may already be a target given his involvement with the business.

As far as I know, my father will continue to work (until he is physically unable), so he does have some money coming in. He also has social security coming in as well. We know he can't stay in the house, but none of us are ready to have him move in with us. We'd like to put him in an affordable apartment. But we also don't trust him to make rent payments on his own...and anything he keeps in a bank account could get snatched up.

So, it seems like we need to set up some sort of shelter or shield through something like an LLC that could basically manage all of his money coming in (and pay all of his expenses). Is this the right way to be thinking about this? I want to keep him out of trouble and make sure that he can live somewhat comfortably, but I also don't want to put myself (and my family) at risk or become liable for any of his debts. But as you can probably tell from my description, I'm pretty clueless when it comes to stuff like this. Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated.",finance,1461094444

personalfinance,"Fed Loans on IBR, minimum payment was $0, now up to $75 after new job. Was going to try for forgiveness, reconsidering.","Long story short, I have $51k private loans (that I'm making headway on) and for the last year and a half maybe I've been on IBR with my federal loans (totaling around $31k balance, ~$20k @ 6.8% unsubsidized, the rest between 5.3 and 3.1% subsidized) and they have accrued ~$2000 in interest. I didn't think my AGI (adjusted gross income) had gone up that much considering my private debt, but maybe I didn't fully understand the calculations and now with my new job it has indeed, gone up enough to warrant a $75 monthly payment on my Federal Loans.

I probably have 3.5 years worth of qualifying payments on my federal loans at this point, and luckily I have been stashing a little money aside as if I were paying them, but just... not paying them. I pay more than the minimum on my private loans, so they are in good standing, on track to be paid off in 10ish years. 

The crux of my problem is this, I'm sitting on about $1k that I could use to knock off an entire subsidized federal loan before they start asking for payments that would all go towards interest now that I have accrued more. Should I? Would that recalculate my monthly payment and possibly allow me to pay down another subsidized loan quicker? I feel like the answer is ""No"" since I've already committed to NOT paying off these loans and taking PSLF after 120 payments. Trying to pay off just over $80k in loans on a $45k salary is a Sisyphean task, but if I stay on IBR by the time I've paid off the $80k private loans my federal loans should basically drop off if all things go according to plan.

My employment is relatively stable, but there isn't going to be much rise in pay at all, which is why I'm in this situation in the first place.

financialindependence,My Family's Financial State-of-the-Union,"**Framing**

With tax season now behind us, I thought I'd share a snapshot of our household's current finances, as well as projections for the future. 


**Demographic Info**

* Age: 37M and 37F
* Marital Status: Married
* Kids: 2 Children (9 and 5 yo)
* Location: Mid-West US, relatively low cost of living
* Jobs: One industry, one academic.  Very stable.
* Income: ~$215k gross-income (doesn't include equity compensation)

**Goals**

* Him: Retire by 53 
* Her: Keep working as long as it stays enjoyable
* Pay for 100% of our children's college tuition + board (in-state university)
* FIRE Goal: Net Worth of $4M in 2016 dollars, zero debt, ~$150-200k income in 2016 dollars factoring in investments, pension, SS.
* Leave each of our children &gt;=$2M in inheritance (2016 dollars)

**Methodology** 

I use a custom built spreadsheet to track and project our current and future finances. It's overkill, but I enjoy it.

**Current Finances**

* Breakdown of Gross Income by Expenditures, Savings, Debt, and Income/Payroll Taxes: [link](http://i.imgur.com/DKGHbCS.png)
* Recurring Expenses and Discretionary Budget: [link](http://i.imgur.com/ovthLWu.png)
* Net Worth Summary:  [link](http://i.imgur.com/AJjDPYc.png)

* Historical and Projected Income Statement: [link](http://i.imgur.com/O48Ii6e.png)
* Historical and Projected Balance Sheet:[link](http://i.imgur.com/w8V0q7b.png)

**Self-Assessment: The Good**

* We've been able to achieve strong income growth, and the outlook is good for further increases.
* Our debt is financed at low interest rates, and we've paid down ~$40k in the last 24 months. By July 2019 we won't have any debt but our mortgage.
* We've steadily increased our investment contributions year after year, and plan to continue this trend: [link](http://i.imgur.com/6zxxSfn.png)
* We've chosen a target allocation (albeit an aggressive one) and have minimized expenses across our portfolio: [link](http://i.imgur.com/A3lA0eD.png)
* We'll be very well prepared for our children's college expenses: [link](http://i.imgur.com/W1CrIFe.png)

**Self Assessment: The Bad**

* Our Food-and-Dining expenses.  Here is a chart of our spending on Eating In and Eating Out by month for the last three years:  [link](http://i.imgur.com/Az2rYTN.png).  Not only is it bad, but it's getting worse.  Interestingly, you can see how our spending is cyclical.  we do well in the early months of every year but we can't keep it together.
* Lack of liquidity and small emergency fund: We need to increase our emergency fund balance to ~$45k.  We'll have some additional free cash flow (~$800/mo) starting in September, when our car loan is paid off and our younger child graduates to kindergarten (no more pre-school expenses). I plan to direct this to cash savings.
* Our Net Worth is relatively low for our age, given our income level. This is due to a career switch, which you can see on the income statement. ([link](http://i.imgur.com/O48Ii6e.png))
* We outsource a lot of household jobs (cleaning, lawn service). I know MMM wouldn't approve.  And we could probably retire earlier if we didn't. But for us it represents a dramatic improvement in QoL.

**Parting Thoughts**

There wasn't much of an objective to this post other than sharing our family's data and projections with the FI community.  Perhaps it will be useful to some of you in similar income brackets for comparison purposes.  Or maybe the way we look at our data will spark some ideas for others.

personalfinance,TurboTax Warning: TurboTax filed different return than the submitted version,"Basically, TurboTax submitted a different return to the IRS than the return that I approved TurboTax to submit. The return that TurboTax submitted to the IRS was incomplete and missing deductions. I am not sure how unique my case is, but for good measure I am posting it here as a warning. (I originally posted in /r/tax [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/4fjr11/turbotax_warning_turbotax_filed_different_return/).)  
  
Here is the situation (using the variable ""X"" instead of my actual tax payment due):
  
I completed my return yesterday. Right before submitting my return, I downloaded and reviewed all of the information. I made sure it was correct and then submitted it. This process included approving tax payment X to be withdrawn via direct deposit. X is the correct number. The final pdf I downloaded has the correct return along with the message: 

&gt; We just want to thank you for using TurboTax this year!. . .  
&gt; Here's the final wrap up for your 2015 taxes:  
&gt; . Your federal balance due is: $ X. . .

Today I logged in and downloaded all of the files associated with the return. I noticed all of the PDF preview returns showed Y, a different amount than X.  This post-submission PDF Y was several thousand dollars higher than X.  

I called TurboTax, they mentioned it could be due to cookies, but they were optimistic that the version filed was probably the original one that I had agreed to. Then I called the IRS, they confirmed seeing the Y number. I called TurboTax again, but they don't know what to say or do about it. They ended by saying they'd add my case to the research division or something.  

Now I imagine my recourse is filing an amendment in a couple weeks (I should owe less), but the problem here is that TurboTax is capable of sending something different than it shows.

On the potential ""browser cookie"" cause... I started my return on Chrome earlier in the day, but finished on FireFox.  My internet history (and the literal TurboTax pdf) shows that I finished on FireFox. The missing deductions and submission were completed on FireFox.

TLDR: The version I agreed to file was not filed. Not sure what caused this, but check to make sure you're post filing preview is what you think it is. Don't rely on the final pdf or numbers while filing.

personalfinance,Filling out paperwork for a 2nd job tomorrow. Need help thinking about the tax implications.,"I currently live in Seattle working at a company full-time making $16/hour. I've been with the company since December 2015. I claimed one allowance for myself on my W-4. I just started contributing to a health flexible spending account in March ($30/month), and do not currently contribute to the company 401k. 

Tomorrow I will be filling out paperwork for a pizza delivery driver position, and I'd like to try and make sure I don't owe anything or very minimally to the Feds come tax season in 2017. However, I also would like to maximize my income. If I again claim just one allowance on my W-4 with the new job, should I be in the clear in terms of owing the government money when filing my taxes in 2017? The position pays $10.50/hour, and I do believe they compensate for mileage on the car. Obviously I plan to make tips too. Probably between 15-25 hours a week. Will more or less matter if I only claim one allowance?

If I started contributing to my company's 401k at my primary job, that would only help my tax position, right? Less taxable income I would think. Would there be any reason to change my allowance to 0 at my primary job?

When I was first hired I was intimidated by all of the language in the 401k packet my employer handed me when I started my job and nervous about having any debt, so I spent the first year paying off my student loans, setting up an emergency fund, and saving the rest. Now I've read through the Wiki and feel like I need to be putting my money away for retirement in my 401k. Now, here's the deal. I'm not sure what type of account to set up (Roth vs Traditional Pretax vs After Tax).

The important factors are:

*All of my income is federal tax free under the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE).

*I will likely be leaving the company in a year or two and returning to the US.

Since I have the FEIE my first instinct is to open a Roth 401k since then I will essentially be paying *zero taxes* on any of the money. However, what happens when I move back to the States? My understanding is that if I transfer/rollover the account it has to be to another Roth (either 401k or IRA). Presumably at that time in the future I may be getting taxed at a higher rate that would make a pretax contribution better in the long haul....

Is there something besides a 401k to consider? My company matches up to 4% so I'd like to contribute at least that much, but if there are no better options I have the means to max out my 401k for the year.",finance,1461123157

personalfinance,General financial advice?,"Just looking for some general financial advice. What can I do differently, what can I do better, that sort of thing.
  
**Background**  
I'm a 23 year old female, single, no children. Planning on being single and childfree forever. I have a college degree (two of them, actually), finished school last year. Working full-time in a job that I enjoy in my field. Gross income is about $32k/year, bringing home about $1800/month, after taxes/health insurance/401k/etc. Currently living at home with my mother with limited housing expenses (see below).
  
**Important Details**  
* Above average credit score of 780.  
* Approximately 15 open credit cards - any that are used are paid off in full every month, mainly used for rewards points  
* No additional sources of income other than my wages from working.  
* Medical/dental/vision is completely employer paid. Life insurance, and short term disability is also employer paid. Maxing out my FSA contribution at $2550/year, also employer paid.  
* Contributing 5% to my 401k to obtain the 5% match from my employer. Just started contributing about 18 months ago when I acquired this job. So about $2k in 401k.  
* Student loan debt of approximately $40k, all federal loans, at 4.4% interest.  
* I have a vehicle loan that is currently financed at 0% APR. Have about 35 months remaining on a 48 month loan.  
* No other debt beyond student loans and vehicle loan  
* Three savings accounts:  
-Savings1 is my ""house down payment fund"" - $1300  
-Savings2 is my ""emergency fund"" - $1400  
-Savings3 is my ""rainy day fund"" - $400  
* Four ""fun"" investment accounts (Stash, Acorns, Robinhood, and WiseBanyan - each have between $100-200 balance)  
  
**Monthly Expenses**  
* $250 - car payment  
* $85 - car insurance  
* $115 - student loan payment (3x my required payment)  
* $100 - cell phone/internet (bundled)  
* $250 - rent/utilities (paid to my mom)  
  
**Savings Contributions**  
* $180/month - Savings1 (house fund)  
* $160/month - Savings2 (emergency fund)  
* $20/month - Savings3 (rainy day fund)  
* $100/month - Investments (4 accounts, $25 each)  
  
**Leftover Funds**  
So that gives me about $540 each month for gas, groceries, entertainment, pet supplies, veterinary bills, clothing, etc. I am fairly good at budgeting, and allot that money into categories - I never overspend.  
  
**Goals**  
* Build up emergency fund to $5k (six months expenses)  
* Purchase home in the next 3-5 years (ideally would like 20% down payment on a $80-100k home, so $16k-20k)  
* Pay off student loans (eventually)  
* Close my unused credit cards (would like to get down to 5 or 6) without tanking my credit score  
  
So...just looking for some general advice from you fine folk! Anything that I can be improving upon, or doing better?

personalfinance,Banking on Public Service Loan Forgiveness?,"Hello, I am a 25 year old grad student. I am currently on track to graduate with my Master's in Social Work next May with ~$95k in total student loan debt (all federal). I pay ~$300/mo in total for car expenses and $725/mo in rent and utilities. As of now, I have less than $500 in savings. 

HOWEVER: I recently accepted a summer position which pays $850/week for 10 weeks (starting late May). I will also be attending an online course.  Because I will be enrolled for the summer, I have also been offered ~$4,000 in federal student loans. I have not decided whether to accept this money or not. I could reasonably expect to be able to cover all of my expenses without it. However, I expect to be offered significantly less in financial aid next year due to cuts in my program and my new position. I am under the impression that having the cash on hand (especially after I graduate) will be more useful than being $4,000 less in debt.

Is it foolish to rely on PSLF (/bank on the fact that it will even be around next year)? Is the $4,000 that I have been offered this summer just a drop in the bucket to my almost $100k in student loan debt? I admit that I have taken out loans as a graduate student that I may have otherwise turned down because I was under the impression that most of the total would likely be forgiven after 10 years anyway. Social Work is a notoriously low-paying field and even when I was making payments, they were barely covering the interest payment on my undergrad loans.

TLDR: $95k (anticipated) in federal student loans, planning on taking advantage of PSLF. Is accepting $4,000 of more debt for summer classes a bad idea?",finance,1461156662

1) Inflation is based on a basket of goods, not just housing prices. Inflation can be high, and property values flat or dropping.
2) 4% (in addition to being a forecast) is an average. Any particular house, in a particular market is going to experience a particular change in value, maybe higher, maybe lower. The interest rate is locked-in.
3) On to the math (shudder), the simplest model of this situation would be comparing the principal, closing cost, and total interest paid over the life of the mortgage to the price of the home after 30 years of inflation (fraught with all the warnings of trying to predict the future).

personalfinance,I'm freelancing for the first time and my payment ($6500) is due in two weeks. How do I correctly file/pay taxes?,"So far I've gleaned the following. Feel free to address one or all of these concerns and I will love you forever:

a. I have a profit of more than $400, so I need to pay quarterly self-employment tax of 15.3% by June 15th (since I'm getting this income between April 1st and May 31st).

  - What form do I use to report these taxes (something about a Schedule C or ES)?

  - What portion of my income is self-employment taxable?


b. I have to pay income tax in addition to self-employment tax.

  - The correct form is 1040, yes?

  - What portion of my income is income taxable?

  - Do I pay income tax on income left over *after* withholding self-employment tax?

  - I read that half of what I pay in self-employment tax is deductible from my income, but I need a Schedule C or ES...?


c. I live in D.C. Am I correct in assuming they have some sort of self-employment/income tax that I'll have to file in addition to the federal tax?

  - If so, do I pay taxes on what's left over *after* federal, or pay them based on the entire income (as if I hadn't paid federal taxes at all yet)?


d. I can deduct expenses. However, I didn't have any as this was a coding / Raspberry Pi project and all equipment was provided to me by the client.

  - If I ever *do* have expenses, what form do I deduct them on? Do I just subtract the expense amount from my gross income? Do I subtract before or after self-employment tax is taken out?


e. My client has to send me a 1099. Somehow the IRS gets one. I don't necessarily trust my client to get this right.

  - Can I fill in a 1099 on *my own*, have him review/sign it, and *then* send the IRS a copy?

  - Would I be violating any procedures by doing that?


f. All this is due by June 15th, at which point I'll mail in some forms and stuff...

  - IRS gets Form 1040 (plus Schedule ES/C?) and 1099, then DC gets whatever they're asking for?

  - I include a check to each entity with the estimated tax amount?


g. I may overpay because I don't really know what I'm doing and air on the side of caution. I know I'm supposed to file all this stuff on my 2016 tax return next year. 

  - Will I get a refund on anything I overpay after I file my yearly tax return? Or would I just be SOL.

The 2016 Presidential election is shaping up to be one of the more interesting this country has seen in decades.  While the candidates and their supporters spend the coming months campaigning for the highest office in the land, we thought it would be fun to take a look at the Presidents throughout our history and how events during their administration impacted politics of their time as well as how they affect the politics of today.

Each week we will feature *at least* two presidents for you to discuss (if discussion goes stale we will move on to the next one early). We'll list a few common things about each one ; age, term, political affiliation, etc.  In addition we've chosen 4 things that happened during the presidents campaign or administration as starting points for your discussion.  In some cases we've chosen those things because they are significant events/firsts in US history.  In others we chose them because we thought those things would be of interest to you, the /r/politics subscriber.

We wanted to keep this simple and relatively easy to set up each week so we didn't write out a bunch of text on each president.  Instead we linked to primary sources (where available) or a wikipedia article in a crunch.  You're more than welcome and encouraged to discuss other events that we didn't list.  Please remember our [comment civility rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_comment_rules) are in effect.  Have fun!

personalfinance,Does minimum payment change when you pay off one of multiple loans?,"Hey everyone this seemed like the best place to ask. Currently I have 8 student loans all at different values and interest rates. I am trying to figure out how long it will take me to pay them off. I pay $300 a month in minimum payments 30-50$ goes to each of the loans. I plan on paying individual loans off all at once every several months when I have enough saved and cushion room. My question is when I pay off one loan that's say 50$ a month, will the $50 be subtracted from the $300 making it $250 or will the $50 be dispersed equally among the remaining 7? I would really like it to disperse it among them because $300 a month is not an issue for me and it will just mean I pay them that much quicker. Any insight would be great. My loans are through Navient if that helps.",finance,1461174596
personalfinance,Reduce credit card balance or completely pay off loan? Or neither?,"I get paid biweekly. This works out to mean that every ~6 months, there is a month with three paychecks coming in, instead of the usual two. One of those three-paycheck months is coming up for me in July and I've been thinking about what to do with the extra money. The amount of the extra paycheck is just under $1100.

My only credit card has an approximate balance of $2100 (of a $4,750 limit with about 24% interest rate). I also have a loan from the bank with about $1600 left to pay in total (11.99% interest rate, $109 monthly payment, final payment month approximately Sep 2017).

I have a tiny emergency fund of about $1000. I have three options, as I see it:

1. I could dump the extra $1100 into my emergency fund and continue with my regular payments on the loan and the CC.
2. I could drop all the money on paying down my credit card.
3. I could deplete my emergency fund by ~$500-600 and combine that with the $1100 to completely pay off the bank loan, immediately freeing up $109 each month to contribute to the emergency fund or CC payments.

I'm leaning towards option 3, but I thought I'd ask for advice here, first.

personalfinance,Roth 401k as savings/emergency fund??,"Dear PersonalFinance,

Sorry about the long post. I've researched this plan as much as possible, but I would appreciate some feedback from a knowledgeable set of eyes.
 
Is my plan for using my ROTH 401k as my savings account and emergency fund is a good idea or is there something that I'm missing?

I understand that under most circumstances retirement accounts are to be used for retirement, but please hear me out. 

Here is my financial situation:

* I'm 29 years old

* I make 95k/yr

* I owe 355k on house @ 3.625 (house bought 2 years ago for 460k with 20% down)

* No other debts.

* Wife currently staying at home with 1yr old child.

* my current marginal tax rate (incl. state+federal) is 22.5%

* Company 401k match is 50% of whatever I put in up to IRS max.


**I feel obligated to put as much as possible into my 401k to take advantage of the company match**, but I'm apprehensive of the 10% penalty and tax that I'll have to pay if I want to use that money in a few years.

This is where the ROTH comes in.. 

Say I put 18k/yr into the 401k ROTH account. The company would contribute 9k/yr into the traditional account 

The only need that I see for having a substantial savings/emergency fund involves getting laid-off from work, somehow disabled, or voluntarily moving to another company. All smaller emergencies (like 2k car repairs, or 10k for a new roof ect.) can either be absorbed into the monthly cash flow, or be taken care off with a 401k loan.

If I understand correctly, each of these events would allow me to roll the Roth 401k into a Roth IRA and I would be able to access all of my original roth contributions without any taxes or penalties.

The other benefit of the roth from my point of view is that currently my wife is staying at home. When she goes back to work, we'll be in a higher marginal tax bracket, so the tax benefit of the traditional 401k will be significantly grater than it is now, so I figure I might as well use the ROTH now while I'm in the 15% federal tax bracket.

Say in 5 years time I have contributed 90k to my Roth 401k. I leave my job and now I pull out the 90k and use that money to pay for a down-payment on a house near my new job. I would leave any earnings and the 45k of company matching funds in the 401k or roll to regular IRA.

Had the 90k been contributed into a traditional 401k I would have been required to pay taxes and 10% on the withdrawal. By my calculation, if I pulled out 90k in one tax year I would only get ~52k cash because the withdrawal would be taxed at the 25% federal and ~8% state marginal rate in addition to the 10% penalty. By choosing the traditional 401k I would have saved 20,250 on taxes over 5 years, but I would loose ~20,000 if I need to get all the money out in a single chunk at the 25% tax rate.

The other option would be to save the money in a normal savings account, but than I would miss out on the company match and I would be more tempted to spend the money on lifestyle inflation.",finance,1461175791

personalfinance,An exception to the rules for paying student loans?,"Hello PF! Throwaway, b/c money and personal stuff. Sorry.



Anyway, first the facts:

* 17,000 at 5.41% 

* 1,600 at 6.0% 

* 3,800 at 6.8% 

* 2,700 at 6.8% 

* 8,300 at 6.8% 

* 4,300 at 6.8% 

* 2,800 at 7.9% 

Interest accrues **daily**. Not currently in repayment.

*The first question is:*
Would it be better to address the $17,000 loan at 5.41% because it accrues more per month than any of the other loans?

**Initial Thoughts**: No, because the way the system is currently set up, you can ""add up"" all the higher individual interest rate loans to equal 23,200 --- which is a higher amount than your $17,000, and the higher total amount has a higher interest.  Is this logic sound?

*The second question is:*
If interest accrues **daily**, why would it matter to make monthly payments while not yet in repayment for all other loans aside from your highest priority?

**Initial Thoughts**: If interest accrues daily, there is no set ""pay before _(day)___"" date.  Why pay your smaller 6.0% loan monthly interest amount, if that amount can be put towards your 6.8% loan and knock it out quicker.  Again, you are not yet in repayment, so no ""minimum"" is required. The $25.00 payment for the 6.0% loan to cover monthly interest could go ""farther"" with a 6.8% loan (because a 6.8% loan would have higher monthly interest totals compared to the 6.0%, so you have a net win?)

Just some thoughts. Thanks for advice on which loan to attack next!",finance,1461180538
personalfinance,Gift Tax - Transferring car title to former spouse,"This is a really simple question.  I think I know the answer to it.

I probably should have done some research on this before I followed this path.  Ok...

Got divorced, we owned two cars.  My car was jointly-owned.  ""Her"" car was only in my name.

Divorce decree said I transfer ownership of the car to her.  I keep my car (and 100% of my pension!!!!).

I signed the title over to her, ""selling"" her the car for $1.

State Dept. of Taxation is now involved, saying she owes sales tax on the true market value of the car. (~$19,000).

The State seems to now understand the circumstances of the transfer of ownership and is backing down a little.

BUT, if I have to ""gift"" her the car at $19,000, what's the FEDERAL tax implications of that?  I know the gift deductible is $14,000... but would I owe taxes on the other $5k?

Or, would the $5k just count against my lifetime deductible?",finance,1461181629
personalfinance,Taking out Auto Loan to Subsidize MBA Loan,"Hello,

 I am going to pursue an MBA at an HSW school, which will require $200k+ in loans over the next two years. I'm planning on getting private loans since the terms (~6% interest rates with no origination fees) are better than the government loan terms (6.84% interest rates with 4.3% origination fee). I am going to buy a new car before starting and was wondering whether I should take out a $25k auto loan since the interest rates will likely be lower than the student loan rates. I'm not sure what the auto loan interest rate would be but I'm guessing that it would be between 2.5% - 5%. The benefit of an auto loan is that I could keep $25k in my bank account and reduce the amount that I borrow for school (although some of that $25k would be used to make monthly auto loan payments). 

 However, I have the following concerns:

 1. I will likely add a credit inquiry to my credit report with my first year MBA loan. If I get an auto loan then I will have two inquiries. I'm concerned that a bank will recheck my credit score before issuing second year MBA loans and see a lower credit score due to the two inquiries on my credit report. Would this give me a higher interest rate or reduce my chances of acquiring a second year MBA loan / additional loans after graduation? 
 2. Will the additional loan increase my DTI ratio and prevent me from getting second year student loans / additional loans after I graduate? I already have a mortgage and undergraduate / graduate student loans. 

Would you recommend taking out an auto loan or should I play it safe and buy the car with cash?",finance,1461183968

personalfinance,(Belgium)Non-US resident with a single-member LLC feeling a bit clue- and helpless...,"Hi guys,

I'm experiencing some pretty hectic days over here.

First off, my apologies for the incoming wall of text, but I'd like to explain it as clear as possible.

Here's the case: 
- Established a single member LLC in the US as a non-resident and started selling goods on Amazon, at the end of 2015.
- Had a lot of trouble finding an accountant with experience in international taxes etc.
- Did find a firm but as I am newbie with no profit up to this point, seemed they didn't have much interested in me and left me on the side for a few months (they postponed multiple 'meetings', didn't really answer emails or weren't available for calls,...)

Although our first meeting was months ago, it was only now that they could tell me with 100% certainty that I would had pay  federal income tax in the US and not Belgium. 

At this point I realize I had to take action and do some more research myself but I can't change the fact that because of all dead time that went by, I am now late with my filing and payment(if any as I not profitable as of yet) of the taxes. 

What I was wondering really, as I am a Belgian resident with an US LLC things get MUCH more complicated than it seemed at first hand.
The accounting firm just gave me a two possible outcomes/quotes that he still needs to figure out himself (sigh):

- If there is no permanent establishment and no state nexus then he’ll probably charge me $3000 for the Federal protective tax return and treaty based return disclosure in this first year, and $1500-$2000 each year thereafter.

- outcome 2: if there is no permanent establishment BUT a state nexus(which I'm guessing it is as I have physical products stored in Amazon's warehouses), then this would immediately means a fee of AT LEAST $8000.

Here was the full email that the collegue sent to my accountant in regard to getting my single member LLC's administration in check:

""I think that a short memo outlining the key US Federal income tax issues (including an introduction to State taxation) should cost approximately $3,500.  That assumes that the enterprise will undoubtedly constitute a permanent establishment. If this is not a clear case and we need to analyze whether or not the LLC constitutes a PE, the fee should increase by $2,500.  We should also review whether the LLC creates a taxable presence (“nexus”) in particular States (be it for State income tax or for sales &amp; use tax purposes).  The fee for an in-depth State nexus analysis would need to be discussed with our State &amp; local tax (SALT) team.
 
I don’t think that we can hand out an “off-the-shelf” memo for free.  But given the size of the operation, I can see how our fees are problematic for such a small business.  Perhaps we can have a phone call (including myself and a SALT person) to outline the issues and risks (in lieu of write-ups).
 
Going forward, I would anticipate tax compliance costs to be as follows:
 
Alternative 1: no PE in the US, no State nexus
 
1.    Federal protective tax return and treaty based return disclosure: $3,000 in year 1; $1,500-2,000 in subsequent years
 
Alternative 2: no PE in the US, but State tax nexus (incl sales/use and income tax)
 
1.    Federal protective tax return and treaty based return disclosure: $3,000 in year 1; $1,500-2,000 in subsequent years
2.    Pro-forma Federal tax return (as basis to determine Federal taxable income for State tax purposes: $3,000 - $4,000
3.    State income tax returns: $800 - $1,000 per State
4.    State sales &amp; use tax compliance: TBD
 
Alternative 3: PE in the US
 
1.    Federal tax return: $3,000 - $4,000
2.    State income tax returns: $800 - $1,000 per State
3.    State sales &amp; use tax compliance: TBD

Best regards""


For those who were in a similar case or those who have some knowledge on this matter, are these standard fees to pay?
Over the past few months I’ve spoken to a few LLC owners and none of them ever mentioned something of this scale.

personalfinance,"I just got rejected for my dream graduate assistant position.

I have been accepted to grad school for a degree in the business field (but not MBA). The program would come out to about 7 to 8k per semester (housing not included).

personalfinance,"Filled in multiple returns, threw money at the IRS, am I good?","Hey guys, kinda scared and would appreciate any help with this. This is the first time I've ever paid taxes, and had been hoping to do it easily enough online.

They pinged me back telling me that my returns were rejected because of incorrect IRS pin number. A couple days later I corrected and updated on Turbo Tax, and set my payment date, same checking acc info, to be on the 14th and 15th.

Those dates pass, and no charges go through to my account. Concerned, I try to do the direct pay on IRS's site and plug my checking account info there. The only available date they gave me was the 18th so okay, I set the payment to go through then.

On the evening of the 18th my account remains unhappily uncharged- I start shitting bricks. In a fit of panic I just fill out another return with FreeTaxUSA, give them my checking acc number, and wait for the money to pour out of my account.

financialindependence,Celebrating a Big Milestone Today......,"$1 Million net worth.  I am 38 years old.  Had hoped to reach this milestone by July, got there a few months early thanks to a recent uptick in the market (although tomorrow I may no longer have two commas if the market dips, LOL).  


I have not been much of a ""milestone"" guy in the past.  In fact I once posted a lengthy narrative about the fact that milestones were always kind of a letdown for me, and never felt as good as I had imagined when I was younger and flat broke.  Hitting $100K, $250K, $500K, I honestly couldn't tell you a thing about those milestone days and couldn't tell you within 3 months of when they happened this far after the fact.  I have never kept meticulous spreadsheets and I am not on mint.com.  I truly don't know.  The most memorable day on my pathway to getting here was when I had finally accumulated $70K, and eliminated CC debt, and I was very proud at the moment and then I realized that when you subtracted out my student loan debt my net worth was still a large negative number.  That was very deflating.  I was working my ass off, thought I had made big progress, than reality hit me in the face.  In retrospect I had done pretty well in a short time but it still stung when I realized my net worth was a big negative number despite what I had accumulated.  


This milestone feels very different.  I do not mean to minimize in any way hitting those other milestones, for anyone who is approaching them and wants it to be a celebratory moment by all means you have earned it and you should enjoy the moment.  But I have always hit those milestones and just thought to myself that I sacrificed a lot to get there and it was the expected outcome, and on to the next thing.  In fact I may feel that way a week from now about hitting two commas but for today it feels meaningful. 

Although some on here (and more so on bogleheads) would disagree I include my home equity in my net worth (minus the mortgage).  My rationale is, if I were to sell my home today I could move somewhere LCOL and sustain myself for a very long time in a cheap rental if I chose to, based strictly on what I would get from the sale.  And I believe it sort of fits in the equation ""assets minus liabilities"".  I have also chosen an arbitrary (and very low/conservative) estimated value for our home in calculating ""assets minus liabilities"".  If I had given our home a more lofty value, I could have claimed to be a millionaire six months ago but it would not have felt genuine/honest.  My personal belief is we are approaching another real estate bubble and I want to be realistic about where I am today.    


I am not going to give a detailed breakdown of assets but if anyone wants to know specifics I suppose I could provide them.  Roughly 1/4 in our home, a little over 1/2 in retirement accounts, the rest in brokerage accounts and a much smaller amount in a money market (roughly two months living expenses).  


Things that helped me get here:  

1)  I was fortunate to start investing when the markets were tanking in 2008.  Just getting my retirement accounts off the ground, investing heavily and going above and beyond with taxable investments every time I had available money.  


2)  Bought a lot less home than I could afford.  Home purchase price was roughly equal to what I earn in a year.  Was fortunate to buy when the market was down, for a really good deal and have seen my value appreciate significantly.  Still in a townhouse though and would like a single family home, which is not cheap in my area.  So if I cash out and buy in the best areas locally I will have a big mortgage.  In my younger years I probably would have imagined a big mortgage wouldn't matter much to me when I hit this milestone but today I see things different:)  If I stay put, I could pay it off tomorrow but it wouldn't be what we really want long term.  So I still consider this a good move, but offset by the gains I could have experienced if I had bought ""more house"" early on.  Ultimately though my decision allowed me to build up a brokerage account (and pay down student loans) aggressively which I would not have had the ability to do if my mortgage had been twice as much.  To me reducing fixed monthly expenses and building a big safety net mattered more and it still does today.  


3)  I work in a field where income increases significantly around the age of 30 and I did not really change my lifestyle all that much initially.  Stayed in a cheap apartment about six months longer than I had to, then moved to a nicer apartment but still extremely affordable, then finally to a townhouse that is still cheaper than my last apartment when you take out the equity I build with monthly payments.  Also drove extremely inexpensive cars for a number of years.  


Things that delayed my progress:  

1)  Between my wife and I we had $200K in student loans.  Most of which I have paid off, but I keep one loan around just because the interest rate is too low to be super aggressive (1.7%) and I am earning far more in dividends/capital gains in my taxable account than I pay in interest on that loan.  Still starting out at -$200K is a big hurdle to overcome. 


2)  Wife was briefly unemployed, then worked part time while she went back to school, then went to nursing school which I paid tuition as she went through the program.  She has also taken considerable time off due to #3....


3)  Expensive IVF treatments which I stopped keeping tabs on after a while but I can assure you if we spent $1 we spent $50K or more.  After a while it was just too painful to keep close tabs on what we were spending.  We did ultimately have a good outcome and now have a new baby at home, which is a huge blessing and it was worth every penny and all the struggles to get here.  


4)  Bought a car about 18 months ago which cost close to $100K.  I knew this would be a huge setback on our path to getting here.  I felt it was worth it and I love my car.  I've had a few moments I considered selling it when big expenses came up but today I am glad I did not do so.  It's a joy every day.  BTW I do not include my car's residual value in my net worth, although I do subtract out the remaining loan.  




So there it is.  I have perhaps delayed my own progress in some ways, which were calculated decisions on my part.  And in other ways I accelerated by being conservative.  In retrospect I am surprised to be here this quickly and have no regrets.",finance,1461197381

I am also a federal employee making roughly $80k between my dual income (fed gov and reserve military).

In regards to investing my money myself in the mean time what do other people do in a similar situation? Obviously max out 401K (TSP) first to account for employer match , then my roth ira, and then what? Keep the remainder in liquid cash savings or gamble it in a brokerage account?

I would consider going for a CD but interest rates are so terrible right now I might as well keep the money in a savings account and have easy access to it due to unforseen expenses that may arise...or to splurge on a few vacations while I continue to max out my tax-free investments. 

Any thoughts?",finance,1461203944
personalfinance,"Sudden layoffs, little savings, mediocre severance package and no prospects. Plan time!","My husband is the only one who was working (boom town completely dependent upon coal and oil jobs) bc I'm partially disabled but due to Bs circumstances I don't qualify for any assistance. His income was it, plus a very small amount of child support every week. After our daughters regular weekly costs (school lunch, etc) there's maybe $10 left. I also have a completely paid off cc with a $2.5k limit and mediocre interest rate that we originally got to pay expensive vet fees. My hubby borrowed a large chunk out of his retirement right before layoffs were announced and we got almost all our debt paid off (with the exception of some medical debt) before we stopped due to the loss of income. 

Ok. So our two biggest expenses are our mortgage (refi'd last year) and our car. Due to the quick recession of jobs many ppl are selling to look for work elsewhere. My husband is going to take several weeks to have a think about best move. So there is no exact date we have to stretch to.

He received roughly $10k (plus 3 months of free extended medical coverage which is a MUST for our family). Mortgage is roughly $1300 a month, car and insurance is about $530. And due to a major blunder by city government the ppl are sweeping up the pieces by seeing their govt operated power and water bills jump by well over 40%(!!). Now, even with major restrictions we've had on water and electricity for awhile now, our bill is insanity. 

He cannot file for unemployment until 10 weeks after the receipt of his 10wk severance. Now my daughter was born with a chronic illness that requires medication so I have no doubt that I can file and get her Medicaid fairly easily. I'm on many meds, most of which have horrible side effects (including possible death) when stopped suddenly so I'm hoping I can at least grab emergency medicaid. This info wasn't for nothing, I have a problem here. Literally HERE. I'm in WY, a State so red the Bloods told it to take it down a notch (in a liberal NY transplant living in a weird alternate universe). Thus, most healthcare providers in our small, rural area do not take ANY form of govt healthcare OR any AHA policies! Big signs. Everywhere. So how should we handle the need for healthcare coverage against the fact that it'll be a lot of money and no one around here will even take it?

Food isn't a real issue, at least not as soon as it typically would be. Businesses around here are being extremely generous and gave and will continue to give out free food to layoffs and their families over the next several months. It's a cluster bomb of epic proportions  in mining towns right now. 

Due to some tax break explained at the severance meeting the ex-employees who wished to cash out their retirement with as little blow to them should wait until after they received their severances. We are prepared to do that as well if the need arises but wish very hard it doesn't come to that. My daughter was also recently diagnosed with 2 conditions that also qualify her for disability. I plan on getting the ball rolling there so hopefully we can go forward with a pre-layoff plan that involved saving for college for her. At least the non-school expenses. We don't have a college savings, she will attend on scholarships and aide (if need be). We do however, want her to be able to dedicate herself to her studies and be comfy knowing she has money when she needs it to eat or just get around. 

All right. I think that's that for my yammering. Gotta hundred things flying thru the brain pan right now. So, with additional downgrades, cutoffs, trimming of fat, etc how long do we have before we find ourselves in super hot water. How to handle medical coverage?

personalfinance,1 million dollars in debt. Can you all help me put this into perspective???,"Hi,

Using my creepy lurker account for this post.

So, I was doing my financial spreadsheet and as it turns out I'm close to a million dollars in debt. Well that is what it looks like.

I own 2 condos and a 3 family house. Combine that with cc's and my school loans, the total is as I mentioned one million... insert Dr.Evil pinky laugh. This just seems so scary to me. I understand that I am making more money because they are investment properties but I'm having a bit of an existential crisis right now.

So here is how I break it down. Home (income): Debt Value Interest Rate (IR)

* home one(where I live) - Debt: 250,000 Value: 500,000 IR: 4.00

* home two ($1250) - Debt: 100,000 Value: 160,000 IR: 4.75

* home three ($7500) - Debt: 570,000 Value: 770,000 IR: 4.25

* school loan - 55,000 IR: 8%

* cc's - 10,000 IR - 25% I think (these get paid down all the time and then maxed out again at least twice a year)

This does not include the expenses for the houses or even my job income either. I don't plan on selling these places, in fact, I'd like to be able to acquire more but this is kinda tripping me up right now. The student loans are being paid slowly. I guess I never put much thought into focusing on paying them down to get rid of them first. I was more preoccupied with finding money generating outlets. My car and motorcycle are paid off so no loans there. I max out my retirement at work and add more when I can. 

I guess my question is, with such a large number, how can I begin to even wrap my head around this and realistically how long would it take to get rid of this debt. I mean is it debt? I'm kinda freaking out. 

edit: Ok so I make 90k/year at work. 

The mortgages are as follows: 1350, 500, 3750. (Home two is actually not a mortgage it is a home equity line that is interest only. Anything I add after that would be applied to my priciple.)

double edit: Ok so the key takeaways are the following

* Read personal finance books

* Put homes into LLC

* Start savings account for expenditures

* Get rid of CC debt

* Get rid of school loans

* Manage cash better 

* Assets - Liabilities = Net worth! (Don't just look at liabilities and freak the fuck out!)",finance,1461243665

personalfinance,Extended Fixed Repayment or PAYE?,"First post in this sub. Third year law student with ~$135k in student debt. Job next year (which is in NYC, btw, so extremely high COL area) pays $75k, pre-bonus [employer offers 3% 401k match]. No wife, no kids, no pets.

Yearly expenses are $15,300 for rent and utilities (living cheaply with roommate) and roughly $7,300 for food (I'm budgeting $20 a day). Metrocard and gym are covered by employer. Trying to keep expenses to a minimum. I am also trying to save a total of $10k in my first year, as I have little to no emergency fund, and would like to start putting money into a mutual fund. The $10k-per-year savings goal will continue in future years.

My firm offers salary raises yearly, which range from 10-25% of our salaries, depending on how well the firm is doing. The firm has ALWAYS offered at least a 10% raise (meaning that my disposable income will predictably increase should I remain with the firm).

According to the federal student loan website, an extended repayment plan (fixed over 25 years) would cost me $972 per month, and would cost me $291,510 total. The PAYE plan, though, would initially cost $478 per month (up to $1,350, assuming 5% salary increase each year), and only (only, of course, being a relative word) $203,710 total, with $125,753 forgiven at the end of 25 years. I'm aware that we currently have to pay taxes on the amount forgiven but my question is this...

is paying the extended repayment worth it in my case?

The total repaid under Extended Fixed is $291,510 vs. $203,710 on PAYE (not to mention the lower payments on PAYE in the meantime)...

I cannot afford the standard repayment plan on my current salary (that would be $1,611 per month, or close to $20k per year), and it'd be nice to put more money into savings and investment by choosing the PAYE plan over the extended fixed. Is it really worth it to pay the entirety of the loan off through extended fixed? Or does the loan forgiveness make PAYE the smarter decision, even assuming the tax-on-amount-forgiven policy remains intact? 

I'm not trying to free-ride by avoiding my obligation to pay this loan back. I'm simply trying to climb out of this hole as best I can.

Right now, I'm planning on putting $1,000 per month into the student loan (which would basically put me in the Extended Fixed Repayment plan).

financialindependence,Career planning with newly adopted FI mindset,"Hello all! Very happy to have found like-minded individuals. I'd like your 2 cents so a bit of background:

-daughter of 2 immigrant parents living in Vancouver (VERY high cost of living). Just turned 28 and realized that my financial mindset has been in ""poverty mode"" for many years due to our financial struggles growing up. Never been able to think too much long term about finances or the kind of life I want.

-Current debt ~$32K (17K student loan/15K car loan, interest rates ~2.1% for both), these should be paid off in less than 2 years (assuming my salary stays the same). Should also have a cushy emergency fund saved up at this point. 

I've been struggling for awhile and finally feel like I can breathe now that I've moved home and have this financial plan set up. My family had a lot of expectations for me, as a woman I was expected to be married a few years ago but I ended up leaving my fiance as he was not good to me. I can feel the pressure creeping up so I know I need to move out by the time I'm 30 or else I will emotionally suffer again. I am working on talking to my parents to understand me but it's a cultural thing; don't think it'll ever change.

I am not in a career that I love, I wanted to be a medical researcher. I did complete my MSc (never finished the PhD and didn't get into med school the one time I applied but then my dad got really sick and I left my fiance.) It's been near impossible to get a job as a researcher/scientist as those go to PhDs. I just got a job working for a company that is willing to help me out to do a PhD (not sure what the financial incentives are just yet, I start June 1.)

The advice I am looking for is it really worth it to go back to school to pursue that degree in Public Health that I desire? It is NOT a very high paying field (potential to make 6 figures but only up to $120-150K in your later years as a professor/senior scientist) but I find it extremely rewarding and it really is a passion of mine. I am having an internal struggle as to what to do. I am fully capable of finding work and can possibly move up working in management in the public sector as I've seen others with my credentials but it kills me inside a little knowing this is it. 

As passionate as I am about scientific research, I feel as being financially independent is the MOST important thing to me. I see on this forum many different sorts of people getting there at different stages. I don't mind if I get there later but I'm striving for 40's/early 50's.

personalfinance,Trying to choose the best online bank....,"I have been thinking of moving my finances to another bank. My current bank is only available in certain locations and when I moved the closest one is 200 miles away. So, I am trying to find the best online bank for my needs. I have narrowed my search done to three possibilities: Ally Bank, Charles Schwab, or if someone mentions here a better credit union that I have not heard or researched about, that anyone can join. 

The two I have narrowed down are known mostly by paid websites such as NerdWallet. So, most of the information I have been trying to get are most likely paid advertisement, but my personal research came down to those two online banks. However, I am interested if someone can mention another bank/credit union that may not have been mentioned by anyone, and anyone can join. Sometimes credit unions can only be accessed through a business or limited to job occupation. So, I would be interested in any banks that have better rates then the two mention above. 

Charles Schwab:

* Unlimited ATM reimbursement and can take out money around the world.
* Interest .06% of interest in checking.
* Platinum Visa Debit card
* No minimum banking and zero maintenance fees.
* Allow to use brokerage investor account, but may not need to use it

The con: 

* May need an hard inquiry pull from credit report, can decline because of credit.

Ally bank: (About the same but)

* Only has 0.10% interest rate, 0.60% (I believe) if you have $15,000 or more.
* Only reimbursement about $15 in ATM fees
* Does not do a credit pull
 
Between the two online banks, I am leaning more to Charles Schwab, mainly because if I travel, I can use any ATM bank in the world and they would reimburse the fees from that ATM, not matter what, or so I have read. It would be great in a pinch if I need cash. Ally, does about the same, but on their websites they would only reimburse about $15 per month, anything over that they will not cover. And, they do not cover overseas ATM expenses.

I'm going to put out semi-hypothetical numbers. I got into my first choice school with an assistantship, not full funding, but a fair bit. I'll still likely need to take $25k in loans to cover everything, but I should be making $65-$75k when I graduate.

My grandma is passed away now and my parents want to transfer the savings bonds to me, or collect on the bonds and give me the money for school and living expenses. My issue is that my dad has had issues with filing taxes in the past and his and my mom's income is garnished until he is able to file all his previous taxes and pay off whatever it is he owes. If they were to try to redeem the savings bonds, and from my understanding they can't transfer them to me, would the money from the bonds be considered income and subject to taxes or garnishing? I would be thankful for any information or help you could provide. Please let me know if you need more information. Thanks!",finance,1461266578
personalfinance,"Should I [23F] aim for my 3-6 months of E-fund, or go ahead and knock down loans?","I currently live at my mom's house. She's very supportive, and if I ever needed to cover emergency expenses she is more than willing to help out. I still like the idea of not needing her to do this, but the option is there. My emergency fund currently has about $2200 in it. For 3-6 months I should be contributing until the end of June (goal is $4200 right now). Then I was going to start applying that to my loans.


[My Loans Schedule](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=1000&amp;name_0=SPU&amp;balance_0=2432&amp;payment_0=50&amp;rate_0=5&amp;name_1=Unsubsidized%20Oct%202011&amp;balance_1=2567&amp;payment_1=0&amp;rate_1=6.8&amp;name_2=Subsidized%20Jan%202015&amp;balance_2=5500&amp;payment_2=0&amp;rate_2=0&amp;name_3=Subsidized%20Sep%202012&amp;balance_3=4500&amp;payment_3=0&amp;rate_3=0&amp;name_4=Subsidized%20Oct%202011&amp;balance_4=3500&amp;payment_4=0&amp;rate_4=0&amp;name_5=Unsubsidized%20Sept%202012&amp;balance_5=2435&amp;payment_5=0&amp;rate_5=6.8&amp;name_6=Unsubsidized%20Jan%202015&amp;balance_6=2099&amp;payment_6=0&amp;rate_6=4.7&amp;) I owe about 23k total.

I'm currently attending community college half-time, so I don't owe any payments on loans except for $50 minimum on a private loan. Also, only that and my unsubsidized ones earn interest right now. When I finish my school program in Spring 2018, I won't be student anymore unless I get into grad school for the following fall. Most of my undergrad loans should be paid off by then (if not all) so I'm not too worried about interest rates changing before I'm done with the payoff. That is if I start making payments soon.

Currently I putting $1000 of my income a month towards loan/savings. I was going to get my E-Fund to goal while paying my $50 minimum, and then start putting my $1000 towards loans exclusively. However, that would have me holding off on paying loans until July. It's only a couple months, so maybe it doesn't matter much. However, my current job is temporary and ends in February next year. I'm not sure I'll make as much as I do now after this job ends and will have to lower my loan payment. I'm wondering if I would be better off just letting my E-fund sit as I have it now and start tackling my loans while my income is higher than it might be later. 

Again the difference is only a couple months, but if come next year I can't afford $1000 a month on loans anymore and have to reduce my payment drastically, then I might wish I started on those with the higher payment instead of contributing to my E-fund when my mom could cover anything my E-fund can't.",finance,1461267016

personalfinance,Some PF advice from a 40-something who has been there and done that.,"I'm kind of new to Reddit and love this sub. Most of the people that post here seem to have genuinely good intentions and are looking to help others. I thought I'd pitch my 2 cents and hopefully someone will get something useful from it. I just wanted to share what I have learned and some of the ""tips and tricks"" I use personally with my own finances. 

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list and some of it may be repetitive, just wanted contribute. I apologize in advance if this is not the correct sub, or if it's redundant.

This is gonna be a long post and open discussion is welcomed. I'd love to hear any tricks you know, as well.

**1 - General Personal Finances (Budgeting stuff).**

Edited due to feedback.

**Learn to ~~balance a checkbook~~ reconcile your accounts -** Seriously, even if you are completely electronic, learn how to balance your account. I worked for almost 5 years in the banking industry. Your bank may seem to be made of magic and everything is available to you online at all times, the truth is an enormous amount of human work is done behind the scenes. You wouldn't believe some of the breath-taking mistakes I witnessed working in this industry. This is your money, keep track of it.

**Pay your bills, on-time, all the time -** This may seem like a no-brainer, but I know full grown adults who still play the ""I'll just pay such and such bill later so I can buy Witcher 12 right now."" game. Pay all of your bills by or before their due date, period. This will save you so much headache, especially when you find out your bank or utility company (always after they have already nailed you) has a fee buried 25 pages in from their terms and conditions. You agreed to the terms, you owe the fee.

**Keep track of how much you owe, to where -** Keep a record of every credit card, student loan, personal loan, everything you pay on a scheduled basis. Know the interest rates and all of your minimum payments. I keep a spreadsheet on my Google Drive. It doesn't have to have anything other than the credit limit, the amount owed and your payment information. **No account numbers, ever.**

**Banks and money based companies are NOT your friend -** They are institutions whose sole purpose is to make money, nothing more. I don't care how much lipstick the put on that pig, they are there for your money, be defensive of your money. And stay well away from those ""You've been pre-appoved for $5000.00 right now"" scams. They usually have interest rates well into the 100% range. Same goes for the paycheck advance businesses, you will always lose. Even if you can pay it back on-time, you pay way too much in interest.

**Bank with a local Credit Union -** If you can qualify for membership, do it. They almost always have better interest rates on just about every product they offer. The ones I have dealt with over the years also generally have fewer/lower fees and are more open to helping you if you run into trouble. I double-dog dare you to try and get Wells Fargo to reverse a fee, triple-dog even.

Edit from /u/AmoebaNot: With regards to interest rates. If you are going to shop for a large purchase (car or something along those lines) shop interest rates with your bank or credit union so you don't get stuck with a higher interest rate. Some vendors may have financing deals with certain lenders and you may not be getting the best rate. A pre-approval letter is also a bulletproof way to be sure you're getting the most bang for your buck on large purchases.

**Have and MAINTAIN an emergency fund -** Even if it's only $200. Anyone that has had a tire blowout between paychecks knows that if they just had that extra $50 bucks... Set a limit that is reasonable for you and keep it there. Only touch this money when you REALLY need it.

**Keep your creditors hands out of your pockets -** Setup and use your banks billpay service. You send the money to them, don't let them pull it from you. Take the time to set this up, trust me, it's one less thing you have to remember once it's done. I spend all of 5 minutes working on my bills a month. You will only have to change the amounts on bills that aren't the same amount from month-to-month if you do it right. By doing this, you have absolute control over where and when your money goes. It also means they can't continue to pull money from you when you have paid the bill off, which they can and will do.  

Edit from /u/koksnot (oh, reddit...): Make sure you check your billpay occasionally to be sure that payments are being sent and received as you expect them. 

Also, Federal Banking Regulation DD allows banking institutions to charge overdraft fees for any automatic recurring debit or credit card transactions. **Even if you have opted out of overdraft protection.**

**Change your damn banking password -** Use password1234 for Facebook and let it rot. If you have ANY stored financial information on ANY (yes, including Steam) site, you should be changing your password AT LEAST every 90 days. You would be very wise to also do this with any email account(s) associated with those sites. I have a dedicated gmail account that is used solely for my banking and money accounts, which keeps everything in one easy to access place. 

This is a MUCH smaller headache to deal with than if you ever get compromised. I don't care what claims the bank makes about identity theft protection and your accountability for fraudulent charges, they will fight and you will cry. Somewhere buried in the terms and conditions is a term or condition you didn't satisfy, their lawyers are smarter than you.

**EDIT:** This section is causing a lot of dissent, and I'm going to be a bit blunt here. **The main message being expressed here is to be diligent in protecting your financial information, pick and choose your method according to what makes you comfortable.** MFA, Two-Factor and password managers are great, no argument there. However, even Wells Fargo does not offer MFA, neither does BoFA (at least not on my CC with them). Telling people to only bank with a bank that offers this severely limits banking options. Banks that even claim to have MFA fail miserably by only offering two or three different screens with a picture or security question. 

Passwords are the defacto login method and have been since the dawn of the internet. Additionally, this wasn't ONLY meant to address banks, my Amazon account relies on simple username and password authentcation. Password security is a base tenet of IT (my professional field). **There is a lot of back and forth in this thread regarding this topic, proceed with caution.**

**Specifically regarding password managers -** Yes, they are great, and a very secure option. They can also be very confusing to use if you are not technically apt. Additionally, they can cost money if more than one person in your house accesses your accounts, say, your wife or girlfriend.

Overall, most of the people who will read this are your everyday guy and gal who still use good ole simple usernames and passwords to access their online accounts. Seriously.

**Know what your credit looks like -** Having bad credit puts the brakes on a lot of the things you can do in this world, including employment in some cases. No credit can be worse than bad credit, so you need to build at least some. 

Pull your credit reports at least once a year and make sure that the information on all three bureaus is 100% accurate. Annual Credit Report is a government sponsored/endorsed site that allows you one free pull a year from all three agencies without having to sign up for BS monitoring services. If you need someone else to keep an eye on your credit reports for you, you are too out of touch with your credit. Do not rely on sites like Credit Karma solely either, be interactive with your credit.

**Don't sign-up for BS monitoring services -** Seriously, they're a joke and reactive, not proactive. You should be keeping a close eye on your reports yourself. If you dispute a credit item, are turned down for credit or have a hard hit inquiry done (buying a car or applying for a credit card) you get a free report from all of the bureaus. This is a Federal reg, they are required to do this without the BS monitoring service.

**Collection agencies (long and fun) -** I rebuilt my credit from a mid 300 score to over 800, most of which was all my fault (collections, etc.). The following isn't just what I have read, I have done this. 

You are allowed to take exactly one single call from them, no more. In this call, you will repeat one single mantra only and then you will ignore them. Practice this in the mirror if you have to, ""You must send me verification of the debt."" Verification of the debt is the exact term you want to use. Even if you KNOW you owe the money, you ONLY say that. The burden of proof is on the collector, not you. Verification of the debt is NOT the letter that they will send you telling you that they have the account. They must provide a signed contract from the ORIGINAL creditor to prove the debt. This is federal law (the PDF and site linked above) and if they try to lie or fake it, they are in a world of shit.

They will ask you to provide your address, etc. This is a tactic to keep you on the phone and get you talking. They have your address, trust me.  They are trying to get you to say that you owe the money and/or want to pay it. Credit debt has statues of limitations and what is called ""Tolling"". If you admit to the debt or say that you want to repay it, you're done. If you are outside of the statute of limitation, you have just reset the counter and are on the hook for the debt. This is Tolling, they can then pester you and even sue you for the money.

Even if you know you owe the debt, they cannot proceed until they have provided you with the verification, which MUST be done in writing. You'd be surprised just how unorganized collection agencies are. 

If they can and do provide you with the verification, get a lawyer. I know, you can't afford one right? Wrong, most lawyers have a flat, usually reasonable, fee for dealing with collectors. I use a pre-paid legal service which costs me like $15 bucks a month. Seriously, get a lawyer. You really don't know what you don't know in this situation. A lawyer can usually also help to get you a much lower settlement if it comes to that. Get a lawyer.

Be aware, they can still report you, but you can dispute it siting lack of verification. 90% of the time it will be removed. I have played this game and know it very well. I was not the best with my money when I was younger and did some stupid, stupid things.

I was going to go into credit cards and auto loans, but this is probably long enough. I'm more than happy to post that if you all would like, as well. Hopefully, this will be helpful to some of you. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.

Cheers and thanks for the fish!",finance,1461271032

personalfinance,"24 years old, considering going back to school, but have other debts. Need advice and brutal honesty.","Hi, PF! Longtime lurker, first-time poster on a new account.

So, I'm 24, a high school graduate, and thinking of going back to school to get a certificate/degree/apprenticeship in a trade. Not quite sure which one yet—I have a meeting with a career counselor at my local community college next week.

I've been working since I was 16. From 16-18 years old, I worked at a restaurant. From 18-23, I worked in security, both as an officer and a communications center operator. From 23-present I have been working in customer support/sales. While the first two jobs were tolerable, this one is not, despite earning more than I have before. I simply am not a salesman and am tired of being tied to a desk.

The reason I want to go back to school and a learn a trade is threefold:

-I want to learn a trade that will keep me active. I am significantly overweight and would like to use this time during school to focus on my fitness and lose weight. I hope to learn a trade and later secure a job that will keep me moving. I am done with desks!

-I want to learn a trade because it seems to be the most reliable way to earn a living in my area outside of being a manager of some sort/working for the government. I have never worked in a management position and do not intend to, although I'm not opposed to government work!

-I want to go back to school in general to allow me some time to focus on my writing. I have freelanced on and off the past two years, earning an extra $700-$800 a month during my peak times. Since I've gotten the sales job, I have stopped writing for the most part, although I am picking things back up a bit.

My current financial situation:

-Income: $1700/mo. after taxes, 401k (up to 4% company match), and health/life insurance

-Rent: $350/mo.

-Car Payment: $165/mo., ~$5600 left on the loan at 2.75% APR

-Credit Card Payment: $280/mo., $14000 balance (combo of medical debt and expenses from a previous unemployment) at 8.25% APR

-Gas: $55/mo. (two fill-ups a month-ish)

-Cell Phone: $25/mo.

-Food: $125/mo.

-Entertainment: $100/mo.

-Total Expenses: $1100/mo.

-Savings: $600/mo. 

-Current Savings Account Balance: $5200

Ideally, I would like to start school Winter 2017 and be able to quit my job then. In all honesty, I am burnt out from working unfullfilling positions and would like to focus on getting healthy/freelancing again while learning a trade that will secure me  a good job and an active lifestyle.

I am also open to joining the military once I get in shape, either to pay for school or to pay back my loans.

Looking into programs online, a two-year trade certificate/degree/apprenticeship will most likely cost me about $15000. I am not sure if I qualify for FAFSA and/or federal student loans yet. Hopefully I will find that out soon and be able to iron out some numbers, but my main concern is how I should go about this with my current expenses.

Advice and brutal honesty appreciated. TL;DR Should I/can I go back to school without working or am I crazy?",finance,1461295968
personalfinance,How to go about refinancing an auto loan? What to expect? What to do?,"So I've had this car for about 6(?) months, and I am paying a fairly high car payment.

personalfinance,Credit Card Interest/APR Discrepancy?,"I understand the fundamentals of when and how interest takes effect on credit cards. But I've been reviewing my statements recently and noticed a discrepancy in how I thought interest was calculated versus how it appears on my statement. 

For example, under the ""Interest Charge Calculation"" section of one of my most recent credit card statements, it states that interest charged on purchases is $20.77 ($0.00 on cash advances / balance transfers). My APR for purchases is 18.24%. For this period, ""Balance Subject To Interest Rate"" is $1,340.89.

This is where the confusion arises: if my APR is 18.24%, and my balance subject to APR is $1,340.89, then it would seem that interest charged would be $244.58 ($1,340.89 x 0.1824); nevertheless, interest charged is $20.77. 

Other potentially relevant details include a previous balance of $1,494.78, a credit limit of $2,000, payments and credits of $517.75, and purchases of $236.51 for this period. I have a credit score of 650 and $75k annual income, with oldest credit line being 3 years.

In addition to an explanation of interest calculation, I'd really appreciate any other advise anyone has to give concerning this matter.

I got the loan when I had no credit history and it has helped with raising it to a 640 (I’m still working on getting it higher unsure what else I can do to raise it). However I want to buy a home in the next 2 years and want to get rid of the debt but I am unwilling to use my emergency fund. I can however get a loan from my retirement savings for $4200 at an interest rate of 3.5% the remaining balance I will just pay. The money to pay back the loan would be deducted from my twice a month paycheck at 108.17 for a term of 20 months. I have already considered refinancing but I haven't found anywhere that would refinance it due to the low amount owed and the miles on the car.  Getting rid of the loan will also help me lower my insurance coverage as I currently pay about $180 per month. So I am unsure if this is the right move in the long run. should I continue to just pay my monthly payment or should I do the loan from my 401k ?

 Any advice is appreciated

edit: I currently pay $217 per month for my monthly payment. I normally have about $300 surplus in my budget however I have been saving that ever month. My current emergency fund would only cover about 3 months worth of expenses so my goal is to double that in the next year. I plan on staying at my job for at least another 3 years as they have also paid for my schooling and if I leave I would owe for that also",finance,1461329204

personalfinance,(CAN) Time to renegotiate my mortgage for the first time! So many options... need some help!,"Hello r/personalfinance! I am up for my first renewal on my mortgage and would like some advice on how to proceed. I will lay out the facts first, then what I think are my best options.  Please let me know what you think.

Facts:

1. Bought house 4 years ago for $350,000 @2.99%, mortgage now at $250,000

2. Housing market in my area is pretty high right now.  My friend just sold a house he has had for 2 years for a profit of $130,000.  Market will most likely continue to climb long term, but might drop off in 6 months (after spring/summer)

3. I cannot afford two mortgages with my wife and myself's income, but we could with renters.  I have easily covered our current mortgage as well as putting an extra $23,000 over 4 years.

4. Current 5 year fixed terms are 2.69 at the bank I am currently at, and 2.59 if I get out of the bank system.  This would require some legal fees, and net profit over the term of 5 years would be only $700.

5. My RRSPs are almost topped up but they have not been doing well.  Cashed out TFSA for down payment on house.  Wife has neither.

Options:

1. Keep going on my plan to pay off my mortgage quickly as possible.  Rates are 2.69 if I played it safe, and I am on track to pay it off in less than 12 years.  This is an easy and safe option.

2. Re-amortize the house back up to 25 or 30 years.  This will drop my minimum payments to +- $1,000.  Use extra money to put into RRSPs and TFSAs for both of us.  Basically because the rates are so low, mortgage does not become a priority. 

3. Re-mortgage the house back up to $320,00 @ 2.69%.  This would give me $60-70,000 to immediately pay off wife's student loans ($15,000 @ 5.6%) and top up both our RRSPs, and contribute a little to TFSAs as well.  It's a little riskier as those investments would have to be making more than 2.69% over the 5 years, and when interest rates go up again, would have to continue to outperform.

4. Re-mortgage the house back up to $320,00 @ 2.69%.  This would give me $60-70,000 to purchase a second property for renting out. Would most likely pay off wife's student loan first, so more like $40,000 for a down payment (save some for immediate renovations).  This is the riskiest option but could have the highest yield.  Like I said before, it would HAVE to be rented at least 9 months of the year.  Rental market is pretty hot, but obviously location and house details would play a large part in this.  I am liking this option because I have been able to ""save"" much more money by owning a house than any other way over these last 4 years.  Is it really worth it to borrow my entire down payment to just borrow even more money?  Am I basically doubling up on the interest I would be paying?

Thank you very much for any and all replies, I will try and answer any questions as quickly as possible.",finance,1461335504
personalfinance,Peers are urging me to buy a home in the Central Texas area - what am I losing out on if I wait?,"I’m 28, currently working for a good company making a decent salary and I’m getting some pressure from friends and family to buy a house in the area asap. I feel like I’m not quite ready to buy yet, and what I’m looking for advice on is the idea that if I wait, I’m losing out on things (money, equity, home-for-the-price, etc).

For a little history, I graduated college in Dec of 2012, and I’ve been working for the company I’m currently with for about 3 years. We’re in Austin Texas. I got hired on at 40k salary, and have worked my way up to a current 59k salary. I’m putting 8.5% into a 401k, but have zero savings to speak of. I graduated with 36k in student debt and that’s down to 17k or so and it’s more or less what I’m working on. My take home, right now, is $3,194.00 every 2 weeks, so in July and Dec I get a 3rd paycheck. I’m doing well in my company, and the company is growing so I see staying where I am or going up over the next few years. I doubt I’ll get demoted or fired any time soon, but you never know with life.

For locals, the rent and buy prices in Austin stood very well over the housing crisis, and now in 2016 it’s on a pretty steep climb with rent in North Austin getting higher and higher. 1 year ago when pricing 2 bedroom apartments most places under $1100 a month where shitty, in bad neighborhoods, old, had bad layouts, etc. If your apartment was ‘nice, for student living’ it was $1100-1400 and ‘nice’ looking places were $1400-2000. I put in some hard work looking at places and found an awesome place for the money. Currently I’m paying $575 for rent + $100-150 for utilities depending on the time of year. I have a few sub $20 payments, like Netflix, rental insurance, and Amazon Prime. Phone is $55. No car payment, just maintenance. My biggest cost right now is food, I’m working on that.

On to the request for advice: 

I’m able to save say $500 – 1500 a month right now and in the last few months/years have gotten my loans down and also eliminated my credit card debt. I’m about to make a big repair on my car, estimated $3k so my ‘savings’ is about to be used. IF I end up buying a home soon, I’ll be very cash poor, and will more or less rely on the ability to rent 1-2 rooms to afford the mortgage. In my view, this means I’m not ready even though I think I could most likely work it out and have a very likely 1-2 room renter already. Here’s what friends and family are saying: 1) you make too much money not to own a home. And 2) you’re going to miss out if you wait.

One of the things people say to me is that the mortgage rates will increase at the election late this year, so now is the lowest interest rates I’ll see in a long time. The other thing is that there is a USDA loan available for a nearby area I’m looking at which requires zero down payment. I’ll have the normal PMI until 20% is paid, and there are a few caveats but the point is it’s an avenue through which I could get a house without a down payment saved up.
So, in realist terms can you folks help me determine what I’d miss out on and how much I’ll lose by waiting a year or two? If interest rates go up 1% - how much less home can I realistically afford? What about 2% increase? Does anybody have some secret-sauce insider info that the Central Texas area is going to continue to balloon?

I’m a little worried that I might price myself out of living in the area, I more or less cannot afford the Austin zip code as it is, with the shittiest / smallest homes going for $200k. Decent 20-30 year old homes are $200-300k and ‘moderately nice’ neighborhoods are $300-500k. ‘rich’ places are $600-1m in Austin. I’m approved for $220k by myself. So, Reddit, am I right to feel like I’m not ready yet? Are they right in that I’ll be missing out if I wait? If so, how much am I loosing for waiting? Thanks in advance for any helpful thoughts and advice.

personalfinance,[Debt] How to best approach paying off defaulted private student loan with a judgement against me?,"I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4fu8xj/debt_i_got_a_wild_hair_up_my_arse_to_become_debt/) yesterday talking about my plan to tackle my debt, when somehow I delved into a defaulted student loan with a commenter. I realized I needed some more advice on this issue.

I'll try to keep this from turning into a wall of text. (sorry, didn't happen.)

The **private student loan was taken out in 2005**, I hit hard times, **in 2011 I had a judgement filed against me** and my mother who was the co-signer. Since then, any further attempts to collect had pretty much stopped. about a year and a half or so ago, a new law firm / collection agency took up the debt and kept calling me/my mom to try to collect on the debt. I ignored the phone calls.

At the time of the judgement the **loan was about $9k, but since then it's gone over $11k**, according to the latest noticed I've recieved.

Being a new company trying to collect the debt, I thought MAYBE I could work with them. Plus I have a decent job now. The guy with the previous collection place was a real ass hat. I gave them a call one day and said I wanted to try to start making payments on this loan. I think I said I could start paying $100/month at the time. He came back saying they wanted like $500 immediately, and $250/month. That was just out of my budget at the time, I told him that wasn't going to work and haven't talked to him since.

After that we had some major car problems, we fixed the car, and then traded it in for a new (used) car and I (stupidly) got stuck with a really shitty car payment with a shitty interest rate. My current goal is to throw all the money I can at this car payment to get it paid off as quickly as possible. My math had me paying it off in 2 years and saving $5k on interest. After that time, my plan was to tackle the student loan debt. Mathematically, this plan seems sound to me.

At the end of February I received a letter stating, *""if payment is not made within 10 days of the date on this letter, we will begin collection efforts which may include garnishment of your wages, as well as the setting of a Debtor's Examination, which will require you to appear in Court and disclose your financials and assets. Please further note that failure to appear at a Debtor's Examination can subject you to being found in Contempt of Court.""*

I'm not sure if this is an empty threat or not... **I'm in California, they could garnish 25% of my wages** which would make life fairly tough until it was paid off. The judgement is good for another 5 years, I believe, at which time they can renew it. If for whatever reason they don't, then I could be free of any legal obligation to pay for it. I'm not necessarily counting on that, I would prefer to start making payments on the loan.

I've heard that if you just start sending payments and they accept them, they can't garnish your wages. I did some research on this last night, and it looks like that's incorrect. My current understanding is that unless you both agree to a repayment plan, with a judgement, they can garnish your wages at any time.

Part of me wants to try to fly under the radar for another 2 years and then try to attack the debt with what I was putting toward my car payment. I would be totally okay making a small payment on it for 2 years and then increase payments. But I'm afraid if I contact the collection agency and try to work out a deal, and we don't come to an agreement, I'll have a big target on my back and they'll be more likely to come after me.

If I could pay $100/month right now, in 2 years I could possibly start paying near $1k/month to get it knocked out quickstyle.

personalfinance,I save a lot of money each month. Is a separate savings account even worth it? Can I do better?,"A few months ago I went from making $65k to making $150k+ when I changed jobs. I now save roughly $5-6k monthly and am diligent about not spending that money. Even if I did run into an emergency, I am fortunate that my cashflow is large enough that I would not need to dip into my savings for most cases.

The advice I see on this sub over and over again is to put that extra money into a ""real"" savings account rather than just letting it sit in my bank's default savings account (Wells Fargo). But all the interest rates I'm able to find seem ridiculously low - even for fixed-time CD accounts! Is there something I'm missing about savings accounts that makes them worthwhile?

personalfinance,Employer Retroactively Changed 401k Vesting Terms 1.5 Years Into Employment (USA) (California),"Just checking into the legality of this, since I am pretty disappointed in it. 

Summary: 

Original 401k terms were 50% match, up to federal maximum, no vesting period. 

At the start of 2016, my employer retroactively changed all employees vesting terms to 50% fully vested immediately and the remainder 50% to be vested after three years of employment. 

I confirmed this when I received my first quarterly statement of this year, where my employers match changed from 100% vested since I entered the program to 50% vested. 

I do not plan on leaving my current employer, however I am a bit taken aback that they are able to transfer money to and from me without any signed forms, etc. 

For clarification, all employees were given an updated 401k pamphlet at the start of 2016, no company announcements were made to notify employees of the change. I happened to catch the change in verbiage within the pamphlet. 

I participated in the 401k program for one year before the terms were changed, the balance shifted from my ownership back to the companies is just under $4,000.

personalfinance,I used the IRS Witholding Calculator and now I'm confused with my Allowances for my W4,"Hi All,

So new $65k annual salary, I'm single, no dependents, have 1 job (I do some freelance work which I expect to make less than $500 this year)

* Expect a bonus of around $1,800 (pre-tax) 
* Contribute to a 401k ($1,820 expected this year) 
* Tax Withheld-to-date: $3,018 
* Last Fed Tax withdrawn from paycheck: $375

Due to my new salary I checked on my W4 Allowances and noticed that while it has me listed as single, my allowances were at ""0"".  **I assume that I should have ""1"" allowance since no one else can claim me as a dependent?** This is what the calculator has stated I should have...

Anyways, I ended up changing it to ""1"" and then used my last paycheck stub to go through the withholding calculator.  Based on my last paycheck, the withholding calculator says I'll be on the hook for $9,552 in taxes and based on my last paycheck data I will have a total of  $9,393 withheld.  It then recommends I use ""1"" allowance (which I just switched too) and should have checked the box for ""single"" (which I already had done) and by doing so  it's saying I should net about even (technically I overpaid in the first couple of paychecks since I was at ""0"" allowances).

Any thoughts?

EDIT: 

I also have student loans so while I deduct the interest I've paid on those in my tax return ($2,500 the max amount allowed) for the calculator I simply left that out.

EDIT 2: After adding in my projected student loan interest in the income Adjustments section ($2,500) my projected income tax is for $8,928 resulting in an overpayment of $465 (since I am projected to have $9,393 witheld), it's now saying I should use 2 allowances",finance,1461345493
personalfinance,Old finance company is demanding $65.91 because they got their payment a day after the payoff...shouldnt vystar be accountable?,"I refinanced my loan with Vystar recently.

Vystar is telling me they don't know why it got delayed, but there is nothing they can do unless they want to do yet another refinance for an additional $65.91. WTF. I'd still be paying the money...

My thing is, if I did everything I needed to on my end and signed the lean holder over to vystar on the 8th, shouldn't they be responcible for this charge? Seeing as how it has nothing to do with me? Can't a bank ya know, cut a check or make a payment when it fucks up?

personalfinance,Dad wants me to take over student loans that I didn't cosign for- suggestions?,"Backstory: about 8 years ago, I attended college. Dad made $100k a year and informed me I shouldn't bother looking into FAFSA or any other federal aid, because ""it's not worth the hassle"" and I wouldn't get anything anyway. He found a loan for me, and had me cosign onto two Sally Mae Tuition Answer loans. For the latter two years of my college attendance, without discussing it with me, he had mom cosign on a third, and the fourth and final he took out by himself. That ended up being about $75k in loans.

Seeing as I make only $14k a year versus his $100k, he ended up handling payments for me. Though I offered to help, he refused to accept any money until I could find my way into a higher income bracket--a struggle thanks to major health issues that started while in college, and that I've only in the past year gotten under control.

However, last month, I came out to him as transgender. His response to my coming out was that I should take over the student loans ASAP. Yet he told me I shouldn't touch the ones I'm cosigned to, as they'll be paid off within three years (or sooner) and he wants to finish them out himself. He instructed me to take over the other two, where I am only listed as the student and not the cosigner. 

**Loan one** has a principle of $18,900, interest rate 8.5%. My dad took this out in his name only.
**Loan two** has a principle of $18,720, interest rate 6.5%. My mother is cosigned to this one.

I offered to send him the monthly payment for those two and he refused. He said it wasn't about money, but about ""responsibility"" and he doesn't want his credit to get ruined if I ""screw up"" and go delinquent. Even though the payments would be a big chunk of my monthly income, I could handle it with some tighter budgeting- and there's no particular reason for him to think that I would cause problems, as I've never abused credit cards or made any major impulse purchases.

I already called Navient and asked about taking over the loans I'm not cosigned to, but they informed me it was only possible in the case of his death. However, dad told me that was a load of rubbish, and said I should consolidate the loans in my name.

I know absolutely nothing about loans--and I'm not sure I should trust him to know what's best since this situation has an emotional edge to it. But I'm floundering to figure this out under pressure. 

So, is what he described possible, and is it a good idea? And if so, how should I go about it? 

Or is there anything else I should look into or do to handle this situation?",finance,1461349168

I've got a handful of different creditors/debts that range from $1,100-4,500, a car that I owe $14,400 on, and $35,000 in student loans = $77,000ish. Even if I'm 100% dedicated to my new financial plan, it's intimidating to think of moving on to a new job/city/company with $50-60k still in debt.  

I guess I'm coming here partially for support, partially for advice, partially to put everything in perspective, and partially to find a way forward. Really, life out here is super cushy. The paycheck is steady, but 80% of my pay goes to bills every month (with the $1000 extra factored in). What can I do? Will I be in debt for the next 10 years? Is it wise to put the $1000 extra every month toward my smallest bill or one of the smaller bills? Or should I put $1000 on a larger bill with higher interest (like a credit card with $4500 on it or a CareCredit card with $3500)? There's always the chance that I can start applying for jobs next spring and I'll find something that pays really well and I can double or even triple my lump sum payment each month - I've got some prospects, and I haven't really looked much since the contract job is secure - but that debt just feels like a weight. I run out of money halfway through the month sometimes, I regret not being more disciplined in the past when I had money to spare, and I'm just hoping to find some solid advice or guidance to steer me in the right direction.",finance,1461359261

personalfinance,Making payments with credit card to build credit?,"(This post is from a question I asked in r/pcmasterace. I was told to post here for better anwsers)


Hello! I made a post a few days ago wondering if I should buy a Pc from maingear. Most, if not all the comments sadi teh same; build my own, but I wanted to go into more detail about why I wanted it to buy it like that.


First let me clarify; I have built my own PC's in the past. I love, love, LOVE building my own PC's. I know that feeling, after many hours of taking careful steps into building you beast, when you power it on for the first time. But, this time is a bit different.


Just joined the military and got my first credit card ever (U.S Navy Federal Credit Union). Got it just in case of emergency but also to build credit. I want / need a really good PC, and a way to reward myself for getting out of BMT and, in a few months, tech school. I would usually buy the parts and build it myself but I wanted to take advantage of the credit card without going crazy.


I plan on buying all the parts form one place. I plan on getting a $5-6000 PC. I actually want to make payments on it rather than paying for it all at once. I would use my credit card to make payments and pay off the credit card each month. I know the thing is to pay 150% more than the minimum, which is what I plan on doing. This way I can get the PC and make payments.
I choose Maingear mostly as an example, but also because I know they offer a plan to make payments. If there is a better place to buy a PC like this, please let me know and I'll take it into consideration.


Also, I want to get a water cooled system. I know people say build it yourself, but I say NOW WAY to that. If it was cheaper, yes, but not with a build this expensive. I'll leave it to the company.


Of course, I can try to buy all the parts from a single source (Newegg, Amazon, etc.) and make payments to them a month and pay someone else to build the system I want. But I don't know about that either.


So what should I do? Should I just wing it and build it, guy it pre-built from a company or buy the parts and let a computer store or someone build it?

personalfinance,Currently thinking about refinancing a mortgage. Is it worth it to get a .5% deduction in interest to change from a 30yr to a 15yr mortgage?,"So I've talked to a mortgage consultant at Wells Fargo to refinance my mortgage to hopefully get a lower interest rate but based on a 15 yr term instead of my 30yr term. They crunched some numbers and said I would save hundreds of thousands to refinance. Here are the terms:


**Current terms of mortgage:**
Initial loan: $430,000  
Rate: 4.25%    
Monthly: $2,750  
Real estate tax: .79%  
PMI: No pmi  
Initial date: Started 1/2015  
Remaining principal: 417237


**New Terms:**
Term: 15 year  
New interest: 3.75%  
New monthly payment: $3,000 and based on gigantic downpayment of $150,000



  
My question is do the real savings come mostly from the gigantic $150,000 down payment? If I were to keep my current terms and just paid the $150,000 into the principal now and continued to pay my current minimum, what would the real difference be based on my current minimum payment? I've tried a flurry of refinance calculators, but it doesn't seem like any of them compare putting a downpayment on a refinanced mortgage to just putting the money from the potential downpayment as a payment to your current loan as principal. If I just start with the new lower principal they calculate a much lower minimum payment and the numbers look off. The closest I've come is [this amortization calculator](http://bretwhissel.net/cgi-bin/amortize) which allows me to plug in my principal, interest rate and my current minimum payment. Based on that calculator, comparing the two loans, I get a difference in interest paid of about $48.4K for the new loan to $60.9K for the old one. With refinance fees, it is almost not worth it to me, but I'm wondering if the numbers are accurate? Any help is appreciated!",finance,1461379767

personalfinance,I'm afraid my parents will lose their home and I'm not sure if I can or should do anything about it.,"So my parents own a home. At the time I went to college they opened a HELOC and borrowed against that to pay the remaineder of what my federal student loans would not cover with the understanding that I'd pay it back. They've never given me a hard number but I estimate they loaned me ~$25k via the HELOC.

After undergrad I went to grad school. I covered the cost of my master's degree myself but was unable to make them payments during that time. Afterward, while I had stable employment I paid them roughly ~$20k. I took a job with a tech startup and lasted about a year before getting burned out and horribly depressed. I ended up being fired for not meeting performance expectations. At this point I was REALLY depressed and didn't seriously look for a job for 8 months during which time I stopped paying them. Now I'm back with a large Corp and not planning on changing jobs for a long time. I was thinking of buying a small condo closer to my work that would cut ~2hr off my commute every day.

So while I was in college my older sister met an active duty service member while still living with my parents. He left the service with pretty much no money and only a new car to his name. He claimed his mother had taken all his money from a joint account while he was deployed. So, my parents offered to let him stay in their home. They basically supported him and my sister for 5 years including paying for their wedding as neither him nor my sister ever earned more than $12/he during this time and they blew all there money as soon as they got it. When he got my sister pregnant he bailed back to his family on the east coast and asked for a divorce. And my sister was unemployed for about two year after refusing to work. Once again my parents supporting her and her child.

During this time my mother lost her job and everyone living at my parent home has been surviving off my Dad's seasonal work driving a truck for an excavation company (can't dig when the ground is frozen). They defaulted on credit cards and declared bankruptcy dropping all the debt not secured by their home (everything except the mortgage and HELOC).

So, background done and now to the point. The HELOC is due in 2017 not sure of the exact date as the parents haven't told me. A quick search on trulia estimates the value of the home at $160k, I have no clue what the bank estimated value is at. They have ~$70k on the mortgage and ~$72k on the HELOC.

I figure there are only two things I can do to help them keep the house at this point. Either, dump all of my savings (excluding emergency funds) into extra payments on their house and throw every bit of money I would otherwise save for the next year into it as well and hope it's enough for the bank to consider refinancing. Or, we do some of the extra payment enough that we can convince the bank to refinance with me as a cosigner.

I almost feel like I should just buy a new home in my name and ""rent"" it at cost to my parents rather than try to save their sinking ship. Or maybe just let them lose it and cosign a rental lease for them. However, there is the issue of my sister in the mix as well. Her and my nephew still live with them, she is working but obviously still gets support from my parents. I don't want her to lose her child but I don't want to take on the responsibility of supporting them by proxy through my parents.

No idea what to do.

Tl;Dr: My parents home is worth about $160k they have a $70k mortgage and a $72k HELOC. The HELOC is due some time in 2017. They have a recent bankruptcy and I doubt they be able to secure refinancing but I don't know much about this sort of thing. They've helped me out in the past but I've mostly paid them back. I feel obligated to help them but I'm unsure what I can or should do. Tons of sibling bagage complicates things.

personalfinance,"20 y.o. college student looking for the best way to pay for undergraduate degree, while planning for law school.","Hi Personal Finance, I am a 20 year old college student looking for the best way to proceed with paying for my undergraduate degree. 


A bit about myself for context-I have been fortunate enough to have almost the entirety of my Associate’s paid for via scholarships, however my two years of funding at my local community college have run out, and the time has come for me to move on to complete my Bachelor’s. My immediate family lives in South Carolina, and I live with family in Virginia, however for tax purposes I am still listed as a dependent. I will commute to my transfer college. I work as an attendant caregiver for an individual with special needs, and I would estimate my monthly income to be about $1,400 (however I am horrible at saving money and know I need to seriously clean up my act). My goal is to go to law school, and this is where the bulk of my confusion regarding money comes in.

 As of today, I have about 22.5k in my savings account, and my mother feels the best course of action in getting my undergraduate free of debt is to pay off the next two years, essentially depleting my savings to 0. The school which I am transferring to list its in-state, full time, full year tuition at $10,752, and estimates books to be $1,500. There will be various departmental fees, although those are not listed. I am wondering whether there is a better way to get through the next two years, and if loans for at least two semesters wouldn’t be such a bad idea. I know by taking out loans I could build my credit, which would be beneficial as I would like to move out in two years and get an apartment. I am a member of Navy Federal Credit Union if that makes any sort of difference in how to answer this question.

politics,An Open Letter To Republican Politicians Saying Raising The Minimum Wage Loses Jobs,"Dear Republican politicians saying that raising the minimum wage will kill jobs,

So here is the thing, the logic behind ""employment is a business expense, therefore increasing that expense will hurt business's"" sounds logical and I don't fault you on that, however in reality it is a little more complicated then that.

The economy works on the premise of supply and demand, now contrary to the standard republican politician's talking points, entrepreneur's aren't 'job creators' they are simply beneficiaries of circumstance, the real job creator's are consumer's without whom the employer wouldn't be able to provide said job. Now people would pose this hypothesis as a 'chicken &amp; the egg' metaphor, simply that you can't have one without the other and they would be wrong, the reason that employers arn't the primary catalyst for job creation is this absolute truth; 

If there is a demand for a service or good there will always be someone willing and able to step up and provide that service/good, no matter how rare, weird, depraved, tainted, awkward, embarrassing or inhumane that demand may be, there will always be a person willing to cash in, and there will always be someone willing to take there place.

For that reason when people like Trump state that they are a 'job creator' they are just furthering this political facade, because in a hypothetical where they themselves don't exist, that job still exists since the demand (the catalyst for the job) endures, it is the consumer who is the dominant factor in the supply and demand equation.

It is this revelation which is the great flaw to the Republican utopian economic plan, they work under the assumption that tax breaks are the only way to stimulate the economy. The premise behind this logic is simple, you inject money into the economy which people will spend and this will create demand which will in turn create jobs, the issue with this is tax breaks disproportionately benefit the wealthy and so tax breaks only help to further the [wealth inequality divide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPKKQnijnsM) within America. Because of this, the vast majority of the money won't be spent since the wealthy spend only a fraction of their money, I mean you only need so much stuff right?

At most the top 5% spend ~10% of their income, so any tax break will serve only to help their stock portfolio, and since a sizeable proportion of the US government's income would disapear, in the long run this would severely hurt the US economy and lead to the inevitable collapse of the US economy.

The only way to stimulate the economy and create jobs given the current climate of immense wealth inequality is to redistribute the wealth of America on a mass scale, in this way you create demand since the poorest among you have disposable income available, and they won't have to have their income suplemented by governmnet assistance.

[""According to the Economic Policy Institute’s State of Working America, a stunning 35 million Americans – 26 percent of our workforce – earn less than $10.55 an hour. ""](http://www.raisetheminimumwage.com/pages/demographics) Theoretically based on this figure, if the minimum wage was raised to $15 an hour as Bernie Sanders is suggesting or even $12 as Secretary Clinton is suggesting, it would give a significant financial raise to a minimum of 35 million Americans (obviously more including anyone between $10.55-$12/$15) with this in mind the immediate economic effects would be a boosted economy with 35+ million consumers with significantly more spending power, generating jobs and increasing the velocity money within the US economy. In addition these millions would move beyond poverty wages, which would decrease the strain on the US government as social assistance policies such as food stamps ($74 billion annual cost) and medicare would not be as neccesary as full time workers wouldn't fall under the poverty line. Considering that this applies to millions of American's that is a significant saving, and as an added bonus the US government would also get more tax revenue from this group.

Now onto small businesses, yes in the short term some may be affected, long term any expenses will be more then suplemented by the increased demand from a reinvigorated middle and lower class, so to protect small businesses it is entirely possible to launch a federal grant scheme to small businesses during this period which offer low interest lones, which can be more then paid for by the savings made from government assistance programs. One of the most astounding things about the current US minimum wage is how companies like Walmart whose family namesake has over $120 billion are allowed to pay their workers starvation wages, which the government has to inevitably suplement with taxpayer money generated from the middle class... The middle class is paying the bill for Wallmart employee's when the business is more then capable of paying their workers, and the Walton family has ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION FUCKING DOLLARS!

How does this not fucking enrage every American? I'm not even American and it pisses me off, I mean seriously this isn't a partisan issue, the minimum wage is meant as a standard to which is the minimum a person's time is worth, and no full time working adult's time is worth less then the minimum amount to survive. Republican or Democrat is irrelevant, let us all unite over our disgust of that slimy fuck Ted Cruz, and get the democracy to represent the people again.

Sincerely from a citizen of a nation whose current minimum wage ($15.58us) is the highest in the world, and our economy hasn't imploded on itself magically.

P.S Our effective employment rate is 61.2% (of working aged citizens) which is marginally higher then the US's 59.4%, so apparently it didn't kill all the jobs.

TL;DR - Increasing minimum wage creates jobs, helps the economy and even if it didn't it would still be the right thing to do. Also Ted Cruz is an oleaginous, slithering con artist.",finance,1461420631

I graduated last year, and I currently have a job that pays $78k a year (deduct $20k for taxes, and my take-home salary is around $58k). This amount will go up in a few months, but not by much. In another year, it should go up by 5-10k (because I will be promoted). I live in Los Angeles, so the cost of living is very high. In the last few months, I have paid about $14k towards my debt ($10k of which went towards credit cards). At this point, I have the following debts:

- Car: $5,250 (payoff quote) @ 3.24% interest rate
- 1 Credit Card: $870 @ 0% interest rate until November 2016 (at which point, I will stop making the minimum payment and pay the balance in full
- Various Federal Student Loans: $217,700 @ interest rates from 4%-7.7%

At one point, I was in so much debt, I was in denial and neglected to ever look at how much i really owed in total. Also, I kept thinking I would make a ton of money and will pay it all off eventually. That was obviously very wrong... :( Right now, I am very motivated to become debt-free! My current mostly expenses are $2k a month, but I plan to move to a cheaper apartment in 3 months, which will save me $300 every month.

Right now, the question is.. should i pay off my car loan early? My loan says the maturity date isn't until 2 years from now (making it a 6-year loan total, which by the way, i don't remember signing up for.. the car salesman was very intimidating, and it was basically the worst financial decision i ever made). Paying it off early will save me $3k in interest and another $600/year because I won't have to purchase collision and comprehensive auto insurance. Not having to make a car payment and purchase the more expensive auto policy will give me more money to attack my student loans.

By the way, I went to law school, and while I appreciate the value of my education, I'm not making the money I thought I would be making. Although my co-worker recently switched to another job and now makes just shy of $200k (also a lawyer), so perhaps there is hope after all.

personalfinance,"Graduating, Accepting my first job as a teacher- Help me make a budget!","Hello, so I am graduating next month (yesss!) and I have accepted a job offer with a local school district. I've lived with my parents for the past 5 years and I haven't needed to budget so I need some help. 

The starting salary for the school district is $40,949 and I have the following debts; student loans ($3,500) that I will be paying $40 a month for in 6 months, a cell phone that I pay $75 for (with service) and a car loan ($7,500 left to pay off, I pay $250 a month). 

I am not sure where to begin here. I live in Louisiana, in an area where rent can get relatively expensive (about 900-1100 or more a month for a nice/decent apartment). 

I do know I have a couple things that I really want. 

1) Travel abroad during the summers.
2) A nice apartment/house to live in... I thrive in a good environment. 

So, Personal Finance, can you guys help me out?

http://www.webofdebt.com/articles/basel.php

Here goes, my 2 satoshis worth, with my tinfoil hat firmly in place:

These people aren't interested in earning *millions* of dollars. 

They're interested in continuing to control the world using the *trillions* of dollars which they print up, (generally mis-)allocate, and then settle on *their* settlement network, controlled by their ""main hubs"" or ""master nodes"" which include the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the World Bank, the Fed (US central Bank), the ECB (European Central Bank), the BoE (central Bank of England), and the BoJ (central Bank of Japan) ...all subordinate to the ""the central bank of central banks"": **the BIS (Bank for International **Settlements**), based in Basel, Switzerland.**

http://www.bilderberg.org/bis.htm#Mendez

The head of the Bilderberg Group is already known to be one of the main investors behind Blockstream.

&gt; Blockstream is now controlled by the Bilderberg Group - seriously! AXA Strategic Ventures, co-lead investor for Blockstream's $55 million financing round, is the investment arm of French insurance giant AXA Group - whose CEO Henri de Castries has been *chairman* of the Bilderberg Group since 2012.

In order to keep ~~killing~~ controlling this planet, they desperately need to keep everyone locked into *their* Master Settlement Network.

**They'll stop at nothing to achieve this - including starting wars**

They have started multiple wars (while of course lying about the reasons), in order to keep us all obedient slaves exchanging meaningless tokens on their Master Settlement Network:

&gt; The owners of Blockstream are spending $75 million to do a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin by manipulating the Core devs &amp; the Chinese miners. This is cheap compared to the $ trillions spent on the wars on Iraq &amp; Libya - who also defied the Fed / PetroDollar / BIS private central banking cartel.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc+bitcoin_classic/search?q=author%3Aundergroundnews+wars&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

The little war which they started to split Bitcoin users into various factions is humming along nicely. 

The recipe: They took something totally obvious and necessary (Simple and Safe On-Chain Scaling via Bigger Blocks First) and turned it into a taboo. 

And then, after the inevitable, unending protests, now they're starting to [bitch about us bitching too much](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4g3ny4/jameson_lopp_on_twitterim_on_the_verge_of/).

Well, sorry we didn't shut up and let you quietly destroy our p2p network.

The people who *aren't* influenced by lies and propaganda have known all along that **bigger blocks now** are the simplest and safest scaling solution for Bitcoin - despite an intensive, years-long campaign of lies and propaganda to the contrary.

And we still know this, which is why we keep repeating it: because we're right and they're wrong.

**They're fighting dirty to keep control of the world's money.**

And they're using their usual grab bag of dirty tricks: 

- creating divisiveness where there was community,

- creating artificial scarcity where there was plentifulness, and 

- **creating yet another PAYMENT SETTLEMENT NETWORK which they can control.**

As more details on Blockstream's strategy for the Lightning Settlement Network continue to emerge, it just keeps getting uglier and uglier:

- We already know they want to impose artificial scarcity and ""fee markets"", in order to prevent people from transacting directing on the blockchain on the existing Bitcoin p2p network;

- There are now rumors that they hope to increase user fees 1000x and miner fees 100x (and pocket the 900x difference - but remember, that's not their main goal: they can *print* unlimited fiat anyways);

- Then they can change Bitcoin from ""P2P electronic cash"" to an expensive, exclusive settlement network.

We already have centralization of mining, centralization of development.

**Now they want to force us into centralization of ""transacting""** (instead of settlement-free ie direct p2p transacting).

Always trying to introduce a middleman and a toll-booth and a central chokepoint of control. That's the topology they know and love, because it's the one that lets them control the world.

**They hate everything P2P**

P2P sharing of music and movies was bad enough (for them) - and they fought it forever (and by the way: they *lost*).

Now along comes money on a P2P payment network which they can't control. Can you imagine how big their freak-out must be?

Think about it: If they *really* wanted Bitcoin to remain P2P, they'd be in favor of *all* scaling solutions - in particular, the *simplest* and most *direct* one: Bigger Blocks First.

Instead, they're paying lip service to ""bigger blocks someday - maybe"", while doing everything they can to implement the Lightning Settlement Network *first* - telling people whatever they want to hear in order to get us to support it:

- ""If you're a user, with LN you can buy coffee at Starbucks with your digital gold!""

- ""If you're a Chinese miner, with LN you can get 100x the fees for the same blocksize""""

But always remember: Their main goal is not to help users buy coffees, or miners get fees.

They're playing for something much, much bigger: **turning Bitcoin from a P2P network into another settlement network with ""main hubs"" that they hope they will be able to manipulate and control, just like they do with the current money system.**",cryptocurrency,1461436134

It has a septic system and the drain field needs to be replaced. It started to fail recently. The county won't permit any repair work, so it seems my only legitimate option is to connect to sewer. Total cost with fees and construction is looking close to $30k. I could come up with maybe $10k, but it would be a very hard hit. I'm not sure how to handle this financial burden.

My options right now seem to be:

* The county offers a low interest loan program through a local credit union. I'm not sure of the rates.
* I could refinance and cash out $20k to $30k. Original loan was $254,800 @ 4.125%, 30 yr fixed started in 08/2014. I also have a HELOC with $10k available. I have about $36k locked in last year at a fixed rate that we used to do some renovations early on.

personalfinance,Sell or rent?,"My wife and I live on the East coast and bought a house almost 4 years ago for 400k. We put 20% down and paid 10k in closing costs. We owe 290 and change on it. We also put 4.5k in work on it before we sold it.

My mother-in-law died and January and now my father-in-law is alone on 9 acres in Utah. We've decided to move in with him. This may be temporary but it might also might be long term. Whatever happens, we don't have any plans to come back to the house as we will likely outgrow it soon as we have two small kids.

Aside from being closer to my father-in-law, this move puts us in a situation to be more proactive in carving out careers that we'd much rather be in simply because we don't have to earn as much money. That said, my job wants to keep me on part time with an arrangement whereby I'll travel back once every month or two for a couple of days.

We've listed our house at 450k and have had some interest and one offer, but it was pretty low. It's possible we can't sell this above 435k. The problem is that once you pay the real estate commission, we wouldn't feel great about what we are walking away with in terms of cash.

We got a letter in our mailbox today from a woman that lives a few blocks away and saw our house during an open house. She wants to rent it, with maybe the option to buy it down the road.

We googled her and recognize her as someone that walks two dogs on our street all the time. She seems to be on the up and up but we'd check her credit and do a little background check on here just in case. I really hadn't considered renting but it's starting to sound really good.

Here are the pros I can thing of:

- We'd still get to write off the taxes and interest on owning a home
- We could even probably make a few hundred extra bucks a month
- I think our street is only going to get stronger in value over the next few years
- The cash from the sale of the house is less important to us now that my job has decided to keep me for halftime. I've also lined up other work that will help with this transition.
 
Also, being a landlord is work and I have no experience with it. But the house is in pretty good shape. It will probably need a new roof in like 5 years but the furnace and the hot water heater are in great shape.

Here are two things I'm concerned about:

- We are currently engaged with a listing agent. We can break out of the contract at any time. But we don't want to screw her over or create ill will. I'm sure this happens from time to time, does anyone know how to approach dealing with this if we do rent it instead?

- She is single with two dogs. It's a 1500 square foot house with a fenced in yard. Most of the downstairs is hard wood floors and the carpets are kind of old anyways. How should I be thinking about this?

- What other important factors have I not yet considered?

Edit: thought I show throw this in there. I'm not certain what we could rent it for but my estimation is that we'd get enough to have a monthly contribution to our equity of $500 (increasing over time of course) and like $300 cash. I'm thinking of this as a .88% monthly return on our 90k investment. Pretty good, right?

personalfinance,Help With Understanding My Paycheck Exceptions and Allowances,"Hi all,

I just started at a new company and I was hoping I could get some help understanding my exemptions and allowances on my paycheck. When I first started working I began in the middle of a 2 week pay cycle so my first paycheck was only for 1 week, 40 hours and the allowances for that paycheck was Federal:0 allowances and CA:1 allowance. I just looked at my most recent paycheck stub which was for 2 weeks, 80 hours Federal:1 allowance and CA:1 allowance and I noticed my deductions are quite different than my first paycheck. I thought that having more allowances means having less tax taken from each paycheck except I had more money taken out of my second paycheck than my first. 

So for example lets say my first paycheck for 1 week of work netpay is $1000 with Federal:0 and CA:1 and my second paycheck for 2 weeks of work netpay is $1800 with Federal:1 and CA:1. It was my understanding that in my second paycheck my netpay should be a little more than $2000 because I have more allowances now and because 0 allowances means the max amount of tax is withheld so 1 allowance means I should have less tax taken out.

However, everything listed under ""deductions"" is exactly double the amount in my second paycheck except for ""Federal Income Tax"" which was more than double the deductions and ""CA State Income Tax"" which was more than 3 times more. 

My question is, how come my second paycheck had more deductions taken out compared to my first paycheck even though I had more allowances in my second one?

Due to the fact that I'm really good at saving money, I've decided it would just be better for me to buy a house. I also have plans on marrying my girlfriend of 3 years. So a house seems like the better route to go. My question is about home loans and how they work exactly. If I get a home loan what interest rate should I be expecting to have? Also if I do a 30 year home loan am I able to pay it off before the 30 year timeframe?

My mom was telling me a story about her friend who recently bought a house for 325k with practically no down-payment. Her monthly payments are  2,100 before any utilities and HOA fees and her loan is a 30 year loan. So I thought 2,100 x 12 x 30 = 700k+. The cost of her home more than doubled simply due to interest. I don't know much about housing and loans but that kind of blew me away. I just want to make sure I could pay the house off sooner before the interest really starts adding up, or what is the best way to get low interest?

What to do?","I've been divorced now for 4 years.  3 years ago, I bought a newer car, which I'll admit probably wasn't the best idea.  I rolled other debt from my ex into it, immediately making me upside down on the car from the get-go.  Plus my credit wasn't the greatest, so I ended up getting the loan at a rate that wasn't ideal.

Fast forward to now, my credit has massively improved.  But I look at my car loan and can't help but think man, I'm not even making a dent!  I've paid more every single month (even if it was just $50 extra), but I'm still about $4k upside down on my car.  I want to refinance, but no one will finance the negative equity, and I don't have that much extra cash to put down.  I've toyed with the idea of purchasing a new car (I've since had a baby and the extra room would be nice) and hoping that there'd be incentives that could reduce my negative equity, even if just by $2k or so.

A bit of background, I am a 26 year old that has worked in the international non- profit scene for the last several years, and have recently returned to school.  I have been filing as an independent for several years but the income has always been negligible due to the type of work.  I traded expenses for volunteer work and they offset one another.  

So I returned to the states and moved to NC, and got a part time job where I made about 8,000, which I claimed on my taxes.  I qualified for substantial financial aide and was given about 21,000 to go to school by the fed and the state plus the school.  After being awarded that money my dad who is not claiming me as a dependent decided he wanted to pay for my education, which I can't believe and so pays my bills and tuition...  

I made a mistake and didn't claim the financial aide because having never received it and thinking now ""oh it's from the government they've already accounted for it"" (which is wrong I now know).  So I filed my taxes based on only what I made from my part time job...

My question is this,  should I :
A) amend my taxes and pay the difference on the financial aide (or will this bring into light that my dad is paying for school). Is this a conflict technically or considered an alternative form of income

Or 

B) do nothing and don't bring myself to the attention of the IRS over the discrepancy.  If I attempt to amend the filing will that pique their interest?

I am so overwhelmed by the school debt, working 40 hours a week barely making ends meet, going to school full time, and lack of direction in my financial life. I hate what I am studying, and struggling to even pass half my classes. If I buckled down and studied until my brain rotted, I'd be done with this degree in two more semesters about.

Am I going crazy about nothing? I feel like I am crashing and burning. I have no clue what I want as a career, and I hate blindly throwing money at a degree I don't even want. The only reason I chose this degree was because my parents said go to school, or move out. Being 18 and broke made going to school seem right, now I am second guessing my decision. 

My parents are of little to no help. They tell me to stick it out with school and I'll be fine. They refuse to understand that I don't want to be in IT, I only had to make a last minute decision to not get kicked out. Since I was born they fed me the idea that I'll be poor and living in a van down by the river if I didn't have a college degree. Guess what? Most my friends are making 50k a year being 21-24 without ever going to school. 

I just want someone to help me plan my future, at least give me some advice on where to start right now. Baby steps, right?",finance,1461468218
politics,"67% of Americans believe that states should set marijuana laws, not the federal government. The minority of Congress supports it, and only 1/5 remaining major party presidential candidates. Most politicians do not represent the interests of the public, so stop voting them back into office.","This post is not about marijuana legalization, but I want to use it as an example because of how relatively uncontroversial it is. The majority of U.S. citizens support it, and I think most people here believe the arguments in favor of it are much stronger than the arguments against it. So if you agree that it's reasonable (because popular opinion alone is not enough, otherwise you'd have tyranny of the majority), the question is, why don't most high-level politicians support it?

Of course the reasons vary from politician to politician. There are definitely districts where it is not favored by the majority, so there are some who are truly just representing their constituents. In some cases, there may be corruption from lobbying, either from the pharmaceutical industry (who might not want such an effective and cheap painkiller on the market), from the alcohol and tobacco industries (who might be afraid of people smoking weed instead of cigarettes or drinking), and from the private prison lobby.

But I think the bigger issue is actually the most obvious. What are politicians incentivized to do? A friend of mine put it this way: ""if you're a politician who might want to run for election again, your goal is not to solve problems. Your goal is to make it look like you're in the process of a solving a problem, so that people feel like they need to re-elect you to get it solved.""

One example he mentioned for this was DARE. Apparently, when DARE was started, it was accompanied by a study on its effectiveness. It was found to be, at best, not effective. But rather than discontinuing DARE, they discontinued *the study*. It is much more important and much easier for politicians to make it look like a problem is currently being addressed, than it is to actually address it.

I believe this is the root cause of our current incrementalism politics, and it's the root cause of wasteful government programs like DARE. This is why, at best, politicians tend to aim for somewhere between where we are now and what is actually best for the people. It should be very telling that both Hillary and Trump support moving marijuana from schedule I to schedule II, rather than descheduling it entirely. They don't want to fully solve the problem, because in the next election, they want to be able to tell people they *will* solve it.

There is only one way to fight this: stop voting for politicians who don't want to actually solve problems. That's how you incentivize politicians to actually try to do what's right.

This is particularly applicable to down-ballot primaries against an incumbent. Maybe the incumbent is more experienced than a rookie challenger, maybe they'll get more done in the next couple years, but by voting them back in, you're helping to maintain the unrepresentative system we have now.

EDIT: Sorry for butchering the title a bit. This would've been better, though it would've gone over the length limit: ""67% of Americans believe that states, not the federal government, should set marijuana laws. Yet the minority of Congress supports it, and only 1 of the 5 remaining presidential candidates. Most politicians do not represent the interests of the public, and if you want to fix that, stop voting them back into office.""",finance,1461469944

Hoping someone could help guide me as I'm attempting to make a financial plan for my wife and myself for the coming year. We're both starting new jobs in June and have to move to a more central location, but unfortunately, rent is extremely expensive in the area (San Francisco!).  

I'm trying to determine what our spending power will be on a monthly basis to help guide what kind of rent we can afford, but I'm having a hard time determining how to properly use the [IRS Withholding Calculator](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator).  

Beginning in June, I'll make approximately 57k and she'll make 85k. I'm doing this assuming it's June just prior to our first paycheck. Total wages from the previous job are hers alone. I'm finishing grad school and the $5k in grants are mine.

3. The results are a little confusing (assuming I entered the correct data). It's advising us to both write in Married/0 and then utilize line 6 of the W-4 to withhold additional funds. Seems like an interesting method, but I just don't think I did this right. Also, the total salary was calculated at $176,870. This isn't right.. It's assuming we made the new salaries for the entire year, but I've stated those salaries begin June 1. It doesn't seem to get that.

personalfinance,Should I take out a new loan with a lower interest rate to pay off my current personal loan?,"I have a personal loan that I've had for about 7 months. The interest rate is 12.99%. Based on a loan offered at a local bank, the rate will either be 6.5% or 8.5% on a new loan.

Hello fellow members of PF, this subreddit is in many ways life advice place about pragmatics things in life and I have a few questions, let me tell you my TL,DR super short bio to give you a context of how I ended up here…
Basically my father is a very difficult person, and I was frequently abused by him. When I finished HS and decided to pursue college, I thought couldn’t really get any help because my father was “wealthy” (or so I thought at the time), and I knew he wasn’t reliable. Many screams, insults and deliberations later, he told me to go to a very expensive Private University he told me he was going to pay for, and he did pay the first two semester, he didn’t pay the third….and I didn’t graduate.
All of this occurred during the 2007-08 financial crisis, where I struggled to find a job and a place to live.

**Private University debt, I haven’t seen it in ages...**

I decided to stop communicating with the debt collectors, finding a job and a place to sleep was more important. Several years later I was able to stabilize myself on a different state with the help of some very kind people. After finding a low paying but decent job, I deiced that I wanted to go back to college because I could probably get a much better job on a STEM filed I felt passionate about and pay any debts much more easier. After speaking to a Community College and disclosing my past, I was told I didn’t need the transcripts from the former Private University and I did a good job on the new STEM major I was pursuing.

My new problems began when I tried to transfer out of the Community College to a Public University, as they need the old transcripts from the Private University I attended during 2007-2008; thus I cannot transfer and finish my major.
 
**The important stuff**

The last time I check the debt it was on 2010, around 20k dollars. I don’t remember how much the interest rate was. I am scared of contacting the Private University because I don’t want collection agencies screaming at me like they did back then. I can probably work 11 hours a day, 6 days per week, for a total of 66 hours per week at 10.00 $ an hour (theoretically bringing 660$ per week), and if I am lucky maybe I can work a little more. I also have no credit card debt (I am responsible with money, I just had a really shitty father)

**The questions…**

What type of advice do you offer? How fast can I realistically pay this debt? Should I take a loan to pay part of this debt (something I really don’t wanna do? How can I minimize my tax contributions in order to have more money available to pay of this Private Debt? Should I even stop pursuing my major (maybe some one needs to slap the fantasies out of me)?

personalfinance,How to destroy your credit without ever having a late payment,"Hi all,
I offer this as a cautionary tale. I'm 35, and a mere 6 months ago I had really good credit (high 700's.) As of yesterday my credit score is 639, and I've never made a late payment. Let me tell you how:

1) An error with my old credit card. In October 2015, I decided to roll my (relatively small, a couple thousand dollars) credit card debt to a new credit card with a zero interest rate for the first 12 months. I didn't really know at the time that open credit line average length of time would be important to my credit, so I called and ""closed"" the account after the amount was paid off. Apparently when I called, the rep turned off my autopay, but did not close the account. I was set up for paperless billing, and also moved shortly thereafter. Since the account was closed, I never thought to update them of my change of billing address. Apparently, the rep never actually closed the account, so in December they billed me an annual fee which I did not pay (since autopay was now turned off.) I don't know if they ever tried to contact me via mail, but I wasn't checking the online statements, and I know they never called me to seek payment. Thus, unbeknownst to me, by April of 2016, the account was over 120 days past due and closed for nonpayment. This was a ding on my credit. I have since contacted them and they agreed that they showed that it should be closed as of October, so they agreed to waive the annual fee and submit a correction to the credit agencies. So that should help a bit I hope. But there is still #2.
#2 - in 2014 I separated with my ex. We shared a bank account, so I closed it and opened a new one. In 2015, I opened my new credit card account, took out a loan for a car, and took out a mortgage. Since I don't have any debt other than my car, my mortgage, and my new credit card, my average length of credit is less than 2 years old, leaving me in the position of your average early 20 something year old. Hopefully, having the error on my credit report from my old account will help some, but I still find myself in the place of being 35 years old, never missing a payment that I knew about and actually factually owed, and still having poor credit. So, a cautionary tale. Also, now that I have worked on getting the error on my credit report fixed, is there anything I can do but wait for it to go back up? That is literally the only ""negative mark"" on my credit right now, which astounds me that my credit is currently so bad.",finance,1461534445
personalfinance,How (and when) should we be thinking of buying a home? Newlyweds with different POVs on home-buying.,"Hi there,

I'll try to keep this succinct as possible! My husband [M33] and I [F27] got married last year and have been doing a lot of talking and thinking about our future. We both agree that kids are 3+ years away (if at all) but my husband wants to buy a place within the next couple of years, while I feel more comfortable waiting.

Main money factors in the situation:

* $160K combined HH income (pre-tax and retirement contributions), we bring in about $8K per month net as of this month. We are both up for promotion this year but obviously that is never a sure thing.
* We have about $75K in student debt (down from about $115K at its peak). The minimum payments total about $1K but on average, we've been paying that plus an extra $2.8K toward our highest interest loan per month.
* We live in a high COL area and pay $2.3K in rent per month for a one bedroom apartment. While we could find cheaper rent, it would take us farther away from public transit and require us to buy a car.
* We are eligible for a **VA home loan**, meaning we do not need a down payment, we can get a favorable interest rate, and no PMI.

*My POV:*

I feel apprehensive on taking on more debt (a mortgage) while we still have so much student loan debt left. Places in our neighborhood are super expensive (minimum $500K for a two bedroom condo) and I'm unsure about only buying a one bedroom if we want to have children someday. I also don't know if we are going to stick around the area that we live in for long. I've identified a career path I want to explore, and most of those jobs are in a different city.

*Husband's POV (I am getting this straight from him to not accidentally put bias on it):*

While we might move somewhere else, we haven't actually made any plans to. If we do buy, we can buy well below our means and move to a less expensive neighborhood. This might mean getting that car and longer commutes, but also could give us a chance to get into a starter home and build equity. If we continue at our current rate of repayment all of our higher interest student loans (+5%) will be paid off within the next 10 months. We could then divert to getting more equity in the home, so in case we do end up moving within the next few years, the transaction costs hopefully wouldn't make it a net loss.

personalfinance,My house has significantly increased in value. Does it make sense to sell and pay off my student loans? What are my other options?,"I bought my home in 2010 for $183K. I currently owe $144K on my mortgage with an interest rate of 3.5%. Housing in New Orleans has increased in value significantly and when I spoke to my realtor recently, she valued my home at $350K. A home similar to mine about a block away recently sold for $365K and went under contract on the first day it was listed. 


In mid May, I am graduating with a M.S. in computer science. I started a full time job in January making $64K annually. I took out loans of $15K each year for three years of school which I'll have to begin paying back in November (6 month grace period after graduation). Here is my loan information:

**Loan 1 (private):** $16,690 (principal is $15,000) with 4.9% interest rate

**Loan 2 (federal):** $17,341 (principal is $15,900) with 6.21% interest rate

**Loan 3 (federal):** $15,434 (principal is $15,030) with 5.84% interest rate

I have been considering upgrading to a larger home (currently live in a 1 bed, 1 bath) and it seems like a good idea to extract the value from my current home, pay off my loans, then use the remainder for a down payment on a new home. Assuming I could sell my home for about $350K, the income from that sale would be $200K. Assume 10% realtor fees (which would likely be lower), I'd have $180K. Take $50K to pay off my loans, I'd have a down payment of $130K to put towards a new home. 

Is this a good idea? What am I not thinking about? What are the tax implications of using income from a real estate sale to pay off student loans? Are there other options I am not considering? What would you do in this situation?

Edit: My home is just blocks from the French Quarter, thus its high price on the market. There are several neighborhoods that are more affordable and plenty of nice places on the market that are larger than mine and listed in the $250K to $350K range. 

Any idea how much of a mortgage I could get with a $120K down payment and a credit score in the mid 700s ..? Or how much of a mortgage I *should* get given income of $64K? I'd have zero debt.",finance,1461535290

personalfinance,"~$80,000 in student loan debt, what do I do?","I went to a school overseas for 2 years right out of high school and accumulated what is now $80,000 in student loan debt ($11,000 is subsidized, the rest is parent plus). At the end of my second year I had health issues and had to return home. None of the credits transferred, and I've been taking classes at the local community college to get my gen eds out of the way then I was hoping to transfer to the state school next year for the last two years of my degree. Basically the plan I ought to have done instead of running off.

I left the university overseas 2 years ago this summer. My parents pay for my community college out of pocket. The first year I didn't work due to health, just went to school part time. This past year I got a part-time job in addition to part-time school and I make $11 an hour working 20 hours a week. My total student loan debt is $78,000 at the moment, and by my estimate it's $350 added on every month. I'm in deferment now because I'm enrolled at the community college, and was hoping to stay in deferment (and take out the subsidized loan to cover state school costs for 2 years) until after I had my BS and would get a good paying job to pay down my loan, which by then would be well over $100,000 but I would hope that my job would be able to cover it.

Today my parents told me they're calling the fedloan services tomorrow and ending my deferment, and stopping their personal funding of my education in hopes that I'll get a full time job and live with them and pay off my loans. They did not go to college, their combined annual income is around $150,000 but they're in quite a bit of debt themselves, mostly mortgage/credit card debt. My dream is to eventually get my PhD, but as a 22 year old who's still without a bachelors and with health problems I doubt that will happen despite my love for education and academia. Also I don't know if I'm able to work full time, I did it during the holiday season (I work in retail) but it took a toll on my health and as a non-qualified person who lives in a fairly rural part of the country, my job options are almost only limited to retail. 

My expenses are mostly car-related, a bit of shopping, but I try to save as much as I can. My hours and pay were just recently raised from $9.50 an hour working 10 hours a week to $11 an hour working 20 hours a week, and my savings account has a whopping total of $800 in it, which I'm saving for a new computer as my current one should die by the end of the year, and a new car as mine is old and always needs work ($120 on tires last week).

Is this a wise choice? I don't trust half of what they say revolving money only because they managed to get $30,000 into CC debt themselves (mostly my dad, who is the big earner). Is it better to end my education and my deferment of loans to pay them off in hopes I can go back to school some day and get my degrees, or should I continue as I have been in deferment going to school part time and working part time and saving what little money I earn?",finance,1461537316
personalfinance,Young couple with 170k in school loans looking for advice about housing and paying off debt.,"Hello PF been creeping here a while,
So here is whats going on in my life. My wife has 65k in school loans interest rates average 5% and she currently makes 56k per year. I am finishing school with 105k in school loans, interest rates average around 6% and I can expect to make between 65k to 75k starting. All of our loans are government loans. My wife's company has an option to refinance her loans with an interest rate between 2-7%. We haven't really explored this option to much but will be looking into it after housing. 
 
So for housing we have 20k saved for a downpayment on a house. We plan on paying 5% on a house between 200k-300k ideally 250k. This would make the payments for the mortgage around 1600 which is cheaper than rent where we live. We were thinking to try and live only on my wife's income to pay for housing, auto expenses, food, and other expenses. Then we would use my income to pay off student loans as fast as possible. Does this sound like a good plan? Any advice on how to improve this plan? Should we refinance my wife's student loans?

personalfinance,Throw money at car loan or add more to emergency fund?,"Hey Folks! 

So, I've got a ""3 months down the road"" question, but I'll throw out my numbers quick:

I make 88k/year. I have a home I purchased about 8 months ago, 4.25% 234k left on the loan. I also have a car I purchased a year and a half ago that I pay 412.80/month (.9% interest) I have &lt;20k left on that. Last but not least, a CC with 3500 on it, obnoxious interest rate something like 22% or whatever.

Monthly budget:

Income: 4k/month - I actually make ~2100 every 2 weeks, which is after 5% 401k (employer matches that 100%) and $75/paycheck into a roth IRA. The other 200 a month goes towards building my ""month ahead"" buffer in YNAB - as do the 2 extra paychecks a year. 

I currently have $1000 sitting in a savings account as the short term ""emergency fund""

Outflows:

House payment: 1800/mo - I round up from ~1725 or so, I just autopay 900 per paycheck for ease of tracking.

Phone: $95 (Tmobile grandfathered unlimited everything plan - I use a ton of data). 

Internet: $69

Electric: $145 (averaged monthly billing)

Water $200 (again, averaged monthly bill - I have in-ground sprinklers for the summer). 

Natural Gas: $45

Groceries: $500

Gas (for car) $125

Car Insurance: $85

Car Payment: 425.00

""Misc"" which is things like my son's school lunches, household items, eating out once or twice a month etc: $120 (I call this ""pocket money"")

This leaves me with about 450 extra a month. Currently, I'm throwing that at the credit card and will have it paid off in the next few month (Going to use the upcoming July 3 paycheck month to dent it as well). 

MY QUESTIONS:

Once I get the CC paid off, the next question is do I start throwing that extra towards the car payment, or do I start sticking it my ""next month"" fund and just get my 3-6 month cushion built up?

Obviously, I'm way overspending on my house, which I purchased when I was still with my Fiance but that's since broken off so my household income dropped by 30% or so. I'm much happier without the income, but it's scary to not have that cushion. I only work 3 day weeks, on the weekends (12 hour shifts) so I'm off four days a week. During school year I have those 6-7 hours my little man is at school that's idle time. Suggestions for additional income? With my income what it is, any ""extra"" income has an effective 40% tax rate after state and federal and fica crap - Uber and the like I considered but it's a ~20 mile drive to their service area and another 20 to the ""busy downtown"" area...

Last but not least: My house appraised recently for ~30k more than what I paid for it (8 months ago...) as the neighborhood has had a ton of new construction (6 new houses sold for 275k+ within 5 blocks of me since I've moved in - lower sqft and fewer bedrooms). I'm considering the option of selling it once my 2 years is up to avoid capital gains, and spend a few months living with my parents (20 minutes from me, adds about 10-15 to commute time) to throw a bunch of money in the bank... I feel like a financial hoarder lately, is that normal?

personalfinance,(CAN) Bank account wiped due to being in a joint account with parents.,"Had to use my alternate account just to post this up. I'm mainly just putting this here to sort of vent about the situation since there's nothing much I can do aside from start over - but I'm definitely open to suggestions and whatnot.

I (M21) was out eating sushi with my sister (F19) one afternoon and we discussed how this summer was gonna be awesome since we've saved up quite a bit of money due to scholarships and work -- I've saved up over $5k and she saved just under $4.5k. I was planning on not using student loans next year as I expect to get a few more scholarships due to my GPA. I was also planning on working this summer in order to purchase a few things that I've been wanting for a while now: a drone mainly. But enough about that. When it came to the end of the meal, I brought out my debit card to pay and was greeted with a ""insufficient funds"" on the debit machine and was surprised. I asked my sister to pay and checked my bank account immediately and saw that there was an ""RFX Withdrawal"" of over $5k. I called my parents and asked them what's going on and they were just as shocked as I was to find out that all my money is gone. My sister's card was also declined due to insufficient funds. We scrambled as much cash as we could and paid for the meal and left. 

My mom (F52) and dad (M52) told us to go and talk to the bank and figure out what was going on. We explained the situation to one of the bank employees and she brought us into her office. She talked to us, left the room to go explain the situation to her manager and look for guidance then came back. She called collections, and they (collections) explained that my parents were 60 days behind their credit card payments so they took all the money in their account (even ours, since it's joint) to pay for the balance. Now, I always knew they were pretty bad with money, but I didn't think it was THAT bad. The bank employee tried to plea wit the collections officer saying that it **wasn't** my parents' money and that it was ours -- money that we've been saving since the beginning of September from scholarships, work, Christmas gifts, etc. The collections officer then explained that after reviewing the account, there was no indication that the money was being used for school purposes. Obviously there wouldn't be any indication since Student Loans Canada directly transfers part of the loan to the school as payment for tuition and the rest of the money gets deposited into my account for books, etc. There wouldn't be any debits for books either since I paid for the books through my credit card to get points - I paid for the balance right away too. 

I'm not too sure what to do now aside for splitting up our accounts, getting a job instead of enjoying this summer and not talking to my parents for a while. They were legitimately sorry for what had happened and made sure to let me know that it *will* be paid for, but honestly, I just want my money back. 

Any Canadians, especially ones from Alberta, have any suggestions with good banks? I'm currently with RBC and I'm fed up with what they've done to my sister and I. Looking forward to your replies.

I take home $3k a month after taxes, 100% health / prescription coverage, and putting away $250 biweekly for retirement (my employer also contributes $275 biweekly on my behalf) as well as $100 a month in additional retirement savings (RRSP) and $100 a month to kid's RESP.

My wife is currently a SAHM, but still brings in $1100 a month take home. She is currently planning on taking a job that would increase her take home to about $2600 a month. It would start in September, and run 10 months a year. This job would allow us to not need child care.

The alternative is that she could go make roughly $50 to $60k a year, but we would need childcare, which would cost between $1700 to $2k a month. Essentially it is a wash financially, and we would prefer to keep our kids out of daycare if possible. 

Also get $500 a month child benifit from the federal government.

$160 / month insurance (vehicle and tennants)

Currently only have $1k emergency fund. (Bad, I know) but working to replenish to at least 3 month level or about $9k.

No real savings besides retirement savings.

I know I should reduce housing expenses, but to do that I would need to increase my commute by 20 minutes or 35 km each way. I could also reduce my commute and gas bill, but would break even or spend a couple hundred more per month for housing.

I feel like I am at least headed in the right direction, but would like to be able to increase my liquid savings more rapidly.

The two easiest solutions I see are to reduce housing and transportation expenses. Unfortunately the money saved in one category seems to basically balance out in the other when I contemplate moving.

I've been lurking this sub for a little over 2 years and have learned quite a bit.  I've started tracking my expenses, built up my E-Fund, increased my 401k savings rate to max employer match, and have managed to pay off $55k in high interest student loan debt in 2 years!

I still have $20k in student loans with an interest rate of 3% (significantly lower than the 7% on some of my federal loans).  Now, I've recently married and the wife and I would like to someday own a house.  After a bit of research, it looks like we'll need to save up $30k-$50k for the down payment.  And this leads me to my question:

Should we start saving for a house or use that money to accelerate the speed at which I pay off student loans?

I've seen [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/fb7Dtmh.png) and it appears that savings comes AFTER maximum contributions to 401k and IRA! I feel I would not have enough money left over for a house if I followed these steps.  So that leads me to believe saving for a house needs to come at least before max 401k contributions.

personalfinance,Out of HS and confused,"So I graduated this time last year out of High School with a crappy GPA that ruined my full-ride scholarship. I instead went to my local community college and was part-time there but just couldn't make the commitment because I was taking the degree plan I didn't want to take. My Dad wants me to be a IT guy but I'm very interested in Politics. I failed the three courses because I didn't show up. I was doing really good in only one class because it interested me but was doing awful in the other two so much it demotivated me. Also it was expensive driving 30 minutes there because it was gas and hours I could've been working. Right now I'm employed at a easy job and only make $8/hour. I make about $400 every two weeks but pay about 160$ in bills and 100$ in gas. Currently just living and wasting my money. I'm awful at saving and always feel guilty and hate myself for it. I'm just not sure what to do. I have no debt. I used federal finical aid for college but I'm pretty sure since I failed I can no longer receive it. Two months ago I walked into a Navy Recruiters office and really considered joining to take advantage of the GI Bill as it seems like the only way to go to college without incurring debt. 

My plan right now is I have no plan right now.

I test high on general tests (especially in writing and reading) with the exception of math which I test average on. I want to go to IU Bloomington (my state) and study political science. But I just feel so far away from my goals.   Neither of my parents have graduated college and I was hoping to be the first. My current girlfriend has a full ride to IU Bloomington and will study psychiatry. She is so smart. Way smarter than me no matter what tests or other people think. I want to be successful but I just feel finically irresponsible, demotivated and unlikely to succeed.",finance,1461569565

personalfinance,(DE) Is limiting your selection of funds worth it to get an increased interest rate on a short-term saving?,"I am planning on investing some money but since I am at the start of my career I´m really not sure how long-term and how much I want to invest at this point.

My bank consultant recommended a combo product, where I invest half in a selection of their preferred funds and the other half is put in a 6-months savings account with an increased interest rate of 2%. After the 6-months I can decide whether to invest that money, spend it or save it another 6-months.

Now I like the idea of this concept but I´m not overly keen on choosing only from their selection of funds for the initial investment. I could always split the money myself, save some and invest the other part but I wouldn´t get the good interest rates.

Question:

Are the 2% interest on a 6-12 months savings worth selecting only from a limited range of funds (chosen by Deutsche Bank FYI). Or should I put more value on choosing the best fund and live with smaller to non-existent interest on whatever I chose to save?

Thank you very much.",finance,1461576102

personalfinance,Reducing 401(k) for student loan payoff,"Hello all. Long time reader on a throwaway here. I'll probably post a longer thread in the coming months for an overall plan check/etc but I wanted quicker affirmation on this. The quick and dirty:

Gross Income: $66,000

Monthly Net Income: ~$3,460

Bills: $1,900 'essentials' | $2,700 total

Monthly Surplus: ~$550

Student Loans: $6,000 @ (6.75%) | $3,000 @ (5%) | $31,000 @ (5.875%) [All will be in deferment until next year]

EFund: $4,700, just under 3mo of necessary bills

My fiancee and I just moved in together, so the above budget is pretty close but not exact. It should decrease slightly as we need to spend less on apartment furnishings, until my fiancee graduates and gets a job- then we're responsible for a few more bills (cell/car ins) her parents cover plus her car loan (&lt;$10k under 3%- good car, good purchase).

My employer contributes 4% to my 401(k) *and then* matches an additional 4% contribution. My matching is amount ~$220/mo, then I contribute another $500/mo (9% i think) additional. As an avid /r/personalfinance &amp; /r/financialindependence reader, I'd already like to up my 401(k) contributions from where they are. But with $40,000 in student debt at or over 5% interest, I think we're at a time to follow [our great little chart](https://i.imgur.com/fb7Dtmh.png) and rock out that debt. 

I know we could chug thru it in not too much time w/out reducing my contributions, but I hate debt (though I'm coming around to the idea of leveraged returns on secured loans). I will be getting a raise in ~3mo (hopefully ~$4k/yr) and with my fiancee hopefully getting employed in ~5mo, we *could* close out the year with $100k AGI. 

Having another $500/mo to throw at debt for a total of ~$1k/mo would really accelerate things and help us rocket into a great financial standing. I think this would let us be out of student debt by October 2017 while still purchasing (wedding bands/LASIK surgery/honeymoon) outright within that time.

I've typed a lot here, a lot more than I meant to. Hopefully yall have some opinions/insight for me, I'd appreciate it! (P.S. please don't start the 'wait til you're married to pay the loans' debate, I've made the decision and have been party to that /r/pf merry-go-round before.)

Edit: I should have included my plan for paying them down. The plan was:

* $6k 6.75% loan first target, also only one w/monthly payment right now ($50 interest only)

* $3k Perkins loans (5%) to be wiped clean with next year's bonus, before deferment ends

* target $31k fed loans (5.875%) right after the 6.75% loan dies this year.",finance,1461588261

personalfinance,Soon to be college graduate looking for financial lifelong help!,"Hey guys, long time lurker first time poster here! As the title says, I am going to be graduating on May 15 from Purdue University in Indiana, with a degree in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I start my new career in Indiana as a Quality Control Manager at a small plastics company. I will be making $57K my first year with a guaranteed 4% bump in pay every year, for 5 years. Which puts me at about $69K a year after my fifth year, with the possibility of more salary increase based on a performance review. I have $40K in student loans, which are about a 50/50 split of subsidized and unsubsidized, and a $3K private student loan at a high interest rate which I would like to pay off asap. All loans are 6 months deferred so payments start January 1st of 2017, but I would like to start paying on them before then. I currently have about $1,000 in savings, and have an apartment here at school that has a lease that runs until July, with no possibility of getting a sub-lease due to the apartment contract. So that's two months of paying $350/month on a place that I won't be living in. Kind of sucks but not much I can do. I also have $600 in debt on a credit card that was used for an emergency. My credit is quite good considering my debt/income ratio is poor, but I have never missed a payment and have a decent life on my credit lines.

So, now that I have some background out the way, what I would like to know from the community is where do I go from here to plan out my life for financial success? Apartments around where I am going to be working go for around $800/month (rent+utilities). The little rust bucket I've been driving around college for the last few years is on its last leg and is not a reliable source of transportation anymore, so I will need to invest in a new car in the very near future. Public transportation is not reliable either in the area I will be working. The company I will be working for does 401K matching; I believe it is 100% matching matching up to 4%.

This year, we are not expecting any profit at all (since our clients book at least a year in advance, and we get paid when the services are offered).

Outside of this venture, I recently started a new full-time job to provide income for me and my partner.  According to the W-4 form, I'm entitled to 3 allowances to reduce my tax burden, but I'm definitely going to be investing a good portion of my earnings back into the side business and thus the 3 allowances will have me withholding way too much.  For example, my 2015 return was about $9,000 between state and federal.




What is the correct way for me to reduce this return, so that I'm withholding less throughout the year?  Do I artificially inflate the number of allowances?  Is there a better way to ensure that my withholding is in-line with my tax burden?

My employer healthcare ended a few months ago when we moved to Oregon. We enrolled via healthcare.gov and, based on our income for 2016 (really low) when we applied, we qualified for a sizable tax credit and are using about 2/3 of it ($400/mo.) to keep our premiums low while we seek out new employment. My wife just got a pretty decent tipped position and I am guessing we are going to end up in the mid $40k range for the year (300% Federal Poverty Level (FPL)for tax credit reasons) - meaning we might have to pay some of the tax credits back at the end of the year. We would like to get back to the 200% level (less than $31,860 AGI) and are wondering what tax vehicles we might be missing in order to get there. 

When we enrolled, we made sure we enrolled in an HSA-eligible, high deductible plan so we could drop $6,750 pre-tax dollars into that account. I know we can also each contribute $5,500 into our traditional IRA's to lower our pre-tax basis.

personalfinance,"(CAN) Immigrant Savings/Extra Work Plan, Requesting a Second Opinion","Hello r/personalfinance, i am living in Canada and i am planning to stay here if everything aligns. So this is my plan with the pertinent info:


I make 15/h and for this year i can not change jobs (immigration requirement for permanent residence) and asking for a raise after 6 months of working with the employer seems unlikely at best, my expenses are as follow:

* 500 Rent (Small room on a mid sized town)


* 54.53 Cellphone bill (Can vary but normally i am on target)


* 100 Credit Card Payment (1500 left and steadily going down, i haven't miss a payment, but some emergency expenses went my way)


* 100 To my savings (I got loaned 3000 by my brother because of an exchange situation with my country, i expended some of that money, now i am back to 2700, after that i will leave it in that account to gather interest until my brother asks me to transfer him. My brother is not asking interests)


* And around 400 dollars for groceries in the month


This gives me a total of 1154.53 of a best of 2000 give or take monthly.


Also i send anywhere from 100 to 200 back home to help my family.


So that leaves me at max with 1254.53. Which leaves me with 745.47 and so my savings plans is this:


* **Own House/Bachellors Apartment or cave.** 100 Montly (If my tax return is correct i will deposit it there as soon as i get it so i will start with 900 + 100 so a thousand with an interest rate of 0.050% and no montly fees (Thank you scotia) and when it hits the 5k mark i will raise it to a power savings account that from 5k plus it will give me a tax rate of 0.750%.


* **Emergency Funds** 100 Montly, this is a fund for any emergencies, right now i don't have a health insurance (long story) but i am looking for one, either way this will be my any emergency fund. Again on a momentum savings account with an interest rate of 0.050%.


* **Personal Projects/Fun Times** 100 Monthly. This is for buying a computer (not work related) a console, saving for a concert or whatever that crosses my mind at the moment, this one will be a much more depleted and used account, again savings momentum which will give me 0.050%.


This leaves me with 445.47 to fool around and for any emergency that i have on the month and its also a nice cushion if i get sick and i have to miss work (which i sincerely hope not). If there is any extra from this money then i will divide it evenly between my 3 saving funds.


I had being weak sometimes so i have fucked up by overspending in things like pizza and other things, i am getting serious now, too may things depend on me.


Also right now i am sending my resume to temp agencies because i want to occupy my weekends and holidays doing whatever will bring me at least 11.25/h (Minimum Wage in Canada), because i need to pay a lawyer to help me get my Permanent Resident status, after that, that money will go towards things like First Aid certifications and other training that i want to formalize.


So at the end of this is: I want to know what other people think of this plan? is it viable? can i improve it? is it wishful thinking? please shoot me down i can't fail i have my family depending on my success. Extra details i am 28 not married or in a relationship and i don't won't have the time, i come from Venezuela, i have my mother, my father and one of my sisters that i need to get out of the country, i have an Information Engineering Degree from my country Venezuela (I haven't made the assessment here in Canada but looking to do it soon rather than later) its an engineering in computer sciences, including software maintenance and coding, hardware maintenance, design and deployment of networks and a bit of telecom.

The program I am going to now, I will be living off campus so I would need money for that as well as to pay my tuition. I just really don't understand loans...

How do they work??
Which is better for me in my situation? Private? or Federal?
Do I have to wait for the money to be given to me through the school? (I need to make a security deposit on my apartment.)
What's the most amount of money I am allowed to take out?

I have pretty good credit as I have been building it for the past 10 months. I think this has to do with how much they allow you to take out. 

Honestly, I am not even sure which questions to ask.


I want to get better at budgeting, and financing in general. 

I would save money to help but literally every cent I make goes to paying for bills, gas, food, or loans.

personalfinance,Huge Student Debt -- Where to start?,"Hi reddit!

I'm a 24 year old with crippling debt. Over 4 years of School I raked in about 100k of debt -- mostly Sallie Mae loans and some personal credit cards for books and living expenses.

75K is through Sallie Mae and ranges from 6.725-10.250 interest rate. The remaining is about 10k on credit cards from books, living costs, equipment etc. I also factored in the 7k remaining on my auto loan that I ""needed"" in order to commute to school.

I've decided to put my pride aside and move home with my parents. Turns out they needed help around the house as my father recovers from major surgery, anyway. My plan is to pay off as much debt as I can in ~2 years.

Right now my minimum payments (just for Sallie Mae) exceed $1,500 a month. This doesnt include my personal credit cards. I recently switched jobs and am making about 40k after tax. My employer and I expect this to raise to about 55-60 take home in 90 days, but we won't plan around this for now.

My predicted living expenses will be about $500/month leaving me about $2800 a month to apply towards my debt. 

I've read about the snowball method, and the start with the highest APR first method( my credit cards ). Is this the best course of action? 

Is re-financing (""consolidating"") my loans with another lender a good option? My credit score is NOT in good standing. Mid 600's.

But, this would be one of my lower interest rate debts.  Is there any reason I shouldn't take the longer term, and put more money towards my higher interest debts?  Seems like I'd save more. Should the shorter term come with a lower interest rate?

investing,Should we be worried about large daily fluctuations of bond prices of single companies?,"http://postimg.org/image/rsr815elz/

Not sure if this is a good place to post this question, but in the Chinese bond market, something stunned people on April 20. Information about this bond is not available in English, so I can translate it for information.

Amounts below are in Chinese Yuan (1 USD = 6.5 Yuan)

Bond ID: 018003

Issuer: China Development Bank (a state-owned financial institution with a total shareholders' equity of ￥６８０ billion and its shares are not traded on any public stock exchange as it is completely state-owned).

Total outstanding bond for this series: ￥2.5 billion

Par Value: ￥１００

Coupon: 5.85%

Issue date: 2014-04-17

Maturity date: 2029-04-17

This is where it gets interesting. At the time of the issuing of this bond, a 1 year CD (remember, this was 2014 and China) yielded 3.２５%, and a 5-year CD (longest possible term) yielded 5.1%. So, in this context, a 15 year bond, to the market, is only slightly riskier than a 5 year CD.

Because of economic slowdown, beginning in November 2014 to the end of 2015, CD interest rates were cut repeatedly until they hit 1.75%. Bond prices move inversely to yields and that sent the price of that bond up to ￥１３０, or trading at 30% premium to par.

This could be a fluke, but on April 20, without any changes in interest rates, all of a sudden, amidst low volume, the bond price plunged 20% and the exchange halted trading for this bond. It appears that on low volume, the price of the bond recovered to where it was trading prior to the crash.

What am I worried about? Well, I had not invested in bonds in China. But I know that a wide scale bond crash of this magnitude is far more serious than a stock market collapse. When stocks go to zero, it's just ""equity"" that is gone, but if debt goes to zero, then...the financial institutions really get hit. When this happens, we really could have a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Remember, a stock market crash on its own doesn't usually do a lot of damage (e.g. 1987, 2000). But if a bond market crash also happens, that is when the most damage is done and large recessions occur.",finance,1461613679

My current APR is 14.24%

The billing cycle was from December 06, 2015 to January 05, 2016. So that gives us a 30 Day billing cycle. The beginning balance was $474.92. I didn't make any payments till December 25th.

From my understanding, the bank uses the Average Daily Balance Method to figure out my finance charge.

personalfinance,"General investment plan for ""excess"" funds. Am I overlooking anything?","Hello PF! Long time reader, first time poster. I would appreciate a sanity check on this. After doing some number crunching I realized that my wife and I may want to shift some things around. Here is the situation.

Me (34): Federal Government employee. Have access to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) which I have been fully funding (all in Traditional TSP).
Spouse (34): Currently doing 1099 work and some W2 work. Not yet eligible for employer sponsored 401k yet. (graphic designer, working as a W2 for a temp agency).

Debts: 0

Special Factors: Currently renting just outside of Boston, MA. I have a nomadic job and move every 3-5 years. This keeps me from wanting to buy into the insane housing market here and keeps me from really locking myself into any property unless I think it has potential as an investment. My job security is good to great, her income is currently irregular but she works at a professional level with agency experience and it may lead to full time employment soon. A bit of an issue with my work having us move every 3-5 years.

All of our current living expenses are paid for out of my paycheck, with a little extra left over each month at our current lifestyle. Her income fluctuates and I am just treating like full extra until she gets a full time W2 position for me to better project out earnings, having it certainly helps but we are just at the line of good with just my income. We also fully own a condo in another city as a rented out investment property.

I continue to max out my TSP contribution (currently set to an even mix of C, S, I and L2040), and we have both fully funded our RothIRAs this year through Vanguard (both currently set to Target Retirement 2045).

Post number-crunching and deciding on the level that we want liquid for flexible money/emergency fund/and planned travel expenses for the year I realize that we may have the 1st world problem of having an excessive amount sitting in checking and savings accounts. I would like to shift this money to more proactively grow.

Based on having no major projected purchases, and always having the option of renting instead of buying in the next assignment city (could be US or overseas), we don’t have anything specific to “save for” with this extra money that would require us keep this excess in a savings account or in an ultra safe investment. So expected investment period is between 4 years and ????

My research has lead me to think that shifting this extra amount into a Vanguard joint brokerage account and putting it in the Moderate Growth VSMGX or Growth VASGX fund may be the best place to put excess, or do a combination of both. I would like something fairly hands off so I don’t agonize over individual stock prices on a daily basis or risk getting into the mindset where I start day trading with the account.

Other than researching which funds to pick and sitting down to triple check all the numbers and the rest of the plan with my spouse before shifting funds around is there anything I am missing?

Basically, my husband is in the military and the place that he is stationed gives us extra money for cost of living and housing. We are living somewhere that is half the price of the allowance so this has effectively tripled his income since last year and will remain like this for a min of 3 years. We don't know what to do with this new money. We are both in our early twenties.  
My income is anywhere from $1200-2800 (usually closer to the small end) a month because I work per diem. His income including the housing allowance is $5000 a month. All of our money is in shared accounts and we pay for everything together. My SO isn't very good with money so I handle the finances almost exclusively.  

Total monthly income: min. of $6200

**Monthly expenses**  
Rent $1550   
Utilities ~$250   
Cell phone $220   
Insurance for two cars $1222 for six months (This is already paid for, unsure if I should include it or not)  
First car payment: Min $183.67   
Second car payment: Min. $231.16  
Gas: $100  
Groceries: ~ $300   
Toiletries/other small necessities: $100  
Left over to save/spend: about $3,265

**Savings and debt**  
$5,000 in an emergency fund (Ally). This currently would cover about 3 months of the absolute necessities.   
$150 in a vacation fund (Ally)  
$5 in a savings account for a House (lol)  
$1,500 in a certificate with 3% return  
$1,200 in a credit union saving account  
$9,000 in (my) Roth IRA. He has a couple thousand in a TSP.   
-$9,500 for car # 2  
-$3,500 for car # 1  

So after paying for the bare minimum we need, we have $3,262 left over. We currently pay $500 on each car instead of the min. The interest rate on both of them is about 3.4%. No outstanding credit card debt because we pay it in full monthly. We have a joint Discover IT card, I'm an authorized user on his Chase Freedom card, and I have a Target Redcard.   

What do we do with this money?! We end up spending a fair amount on shopping for random things.  Should we pay off the cars as quickly as possible before saving like we currently are ($1,000 a month goes to cars)?

I want to save as much money as possible while we are here to buy a house but I don't know how to best go about it.

We're in our mid-20's and I always thought this would be a crucial time to start building a strong habit of 401k contribution. This financial coach, however, didn't have much positive to say about them.

These two pages in an informational packet caught my eye:

5. ""It's easy""    
6. ""Everybody's doing it""

2. Deferred TAX EXPLOSION - Federal, State, City
3. 100% in Government Control - *What Age You Access*

21. No Death Benefit - *Account Balance Fully Taxed When Passed to Surviving Spouse*
22. Other Outside Costs

I admit to not being familiar with all the implications of some of these listed disadvantages. I have a suspicion the financial coach is trying to scare her away from 401k’s because any money allocated there gives clients less to invest in their packages, which is how they make money—but she hasn't gone for the hard sell yet.

I'm 27 and I just started my dream job where my first year salary is $160,000.  I have no debt.  I will be contributing the max $18,000 into my 401(k) (even though I'm playing catch-up since I haven't made any income during the first four months of the year).  I have no major purchases in the near-term, so I don't want to carry a lot of highly liquid/low return investments (I already have an adequate emergency fund).  I have a moderately high risk-tolerance since I figure I'm young and have time to secure my retirement.

My company has a 401(k) with Charles Schwab.  Being a noob, I went in thinking I could invest in any of Schwab's funds, so I had my three-fund portfolio all mapped out.  Then I got confused when I saw a rather short list that included some Vanguard funds that I was eligible to invest in.

We also have about $50k in mortgage debt @6.5% and $6k 2nd mortgage @ 8.2%. No need to focus on those interest rates or anything else ancillary right now.

She thinks we should max out total contributions. I think we should contribute up to the employer matching limit and get busy knocking down that debt. 

EDIT: to clarify, my employer will match dollar-for-dollar up to $1000 and her's will match similar up to like $5,000.  She insists that the best thing is for both of us to contribute the full $18,000 annually.  I think she's right in that we need to put aside a shitton of money into a retirement account that works for us, but I say we should be getting the full employer match only right now and work down that debt.

I'm a German grad student and I'm moving to the SF Bay Area for an internship later this week. I'll stay until September, ~150 days and will be there on a temporary non-immigrant visa (J-1).

I already figured out how to get my SSN and have an apartment but I'm afraid I need some help with two things:

1. A bank account. I'll be paid bi-weekly and think I need a checking account for that? Where should I open one, though? Bank of America seems straight-forward, even without a SSN (I can't apply for one until I've been in the country for 10 days), and would be free for me, but are there other options I should consider? What about Credit Unions? I don't think I need any special features apart from online banking and a debit card (although SEPA support would be a plus and Apple Pay support would be nice as well). Should I apply for a credit card to build credit score? If so, are there any specific credit cards I should consider? Is there any equivalent to number26 in the US?

2. Taxes. As far as I'm aware I don't have to pay Medicare / social security taxes (FICA?) because I'm not eligible for those services, but how will my income be taxed? There's state tax and there's federal tax, right? Will the money be automatically deducted from my paycheck or do I need to do something first? Do I have to file taxes next year and do I also need to declare my income to my country's tax office? Will I be taxed in both countries? I might just end up hiring an accountant but it would be good to know if I have to do anything beforehand.

Is there anything else I should be aware of before moving to the US?

personalfinance,How to solicit an investment with professionalism and respect,"**Preface**  
I've read the rules and I'm not making a post to solicit investment of any form from any member of this subreddit.

My question is strictly regarding my own personal life with my acquaintances, and I simply hope for advice on how to handle a situation with the utmost respect and professionalism. If this is more appropriate for relationship advice please let me know.

**Background**  
I'm a first year graduate student in a professional/vocational field. My current tuition is roughly $40,000 a year, and with expenses total up to a conservative $50,000 estimate. My field does not offer any (or offers an extremely limited number) or scholarships. Most students pay with federal loans, and those who can afford to pay with cash. 

Coming from a low-income household, I was not given any special merit or need-based scholarships as they essentially do not exist. With the current projections of my finances, I will be in debt, which I'm perfectly prepared for, as salary in my profession will more than cover all debts within 10 to 15 years of graduation. So even with no assistance, I'm not under any financial distress.

However, I do hope to be able to secure some non-governmental aid, either through family friends or professional mentors I've become acquainted with. I'm confident in having a positive relationship with these individuals, enough so that I even dare to consider something as volatile as an investment/loan proposal. 

If I am able to obtain some help from willing individuals of means (a statement I'm very careful making and will be even more careful confirming), it will ease my short-term financial burden and interest accrual. This is, of course, at the expense of those I borrow from, and so my proposition will not be purely a business one, but rather one that also relies on the long-term relationship of trust and cooperation I've built with these individuals. Of course, I'm also open at any time to the idea that I should not do this, foreseeing the possibility of damaging a perfectly mutual relationship of trust and cooperation. 

**Question**  
What is the best way to ask personal and family acquaintances, people with whom you've built a long-term relationship, trust, and rapport, for financial aid in the most professional and respectful way, and also in a way that is completely open-ended as to allow the respondent to accept or decline any or all parts of your proposal? 

Some specific clarifications include:  
1) Should this be done at all?  
2) How do you initiate a request for an audience?  
2b) If you acquire an audience, should it be the first or last part of the conversation?  
3) Should you mention any of your own financial information: loans, debts, interest rates, income, etc...?  
4) Should you specify any dollar amount you wish to borrow? (This is likely a no given I hope to ask an open ended question, but I wish to do so purely from a perspective of respect. If it is more respectful and professional to have a dollar amount in mind, please let me know as well.)  
5) Should you specify any payment plan? (Same concern as above: open-ended for the respondent's benefit, or clearly defined to show them you are serious and have a plan in mind.)  
6) If there are any other details of the request I should include or consider?  

**Appendix**  
Assuming I'm successful in my career pursuits, I should encounter little difficulty paying off my loans in full within 10 to 15 years post graduation.
  
I'm asking the current question because I feel confident enough there are people who believe strongly in me, and who may wish to see me succeed, and who may also wish to ease my short-term financial burdens. I've also heard of similar arrangements from some anecdotes, but they are anecdotes and I'm not experienced with the real world yet to know if this is a good idea, that's why I'm here asking this question. Ultimately, if there are people who may be willing to do this, and I stand to benefit in the short-term, most likely through a reduction in interest accrual, then I hope to understand the best methods I should utilize to ask this question in the most professional and respectful manner. 

Thank you for your help.",finance,1461639042
personalfinance,Personal loan advice,"hi everyone. I'm new to this subreddit but looking for some advice. I am a 24 yr old working 2 jobs and not in school. I made some bad purchase and life decisions and the situation now is that I am living with a room mate who doesn't pay her half of the utilities and is now roughly $1600 in debt to me, and I have a credit card that even with putting all my money on it now stays right around maxed out at $5000 with a 16% interest rate. I'm finding it very difficult to build a savings account because of the room mate. 

Ever since my first job at 16, my parents have hounded me about my money. I originally saved up about $5000 in the bank, and was holding steady, spending what I made but not losing money. My parents kept berating me about saving so I began lying and just adding what should have been saved. Its been about 8 years of this now, and my parents now believe I have a little over $15,000 in savings. I actually have nothing in savings, because I helped the man I thought I would marry pay some bills, took us on a trip, then bought a car, and am now living paycheck to paycheck

My problem arose today. My father wants to set up an appointment with me at Scottrade with invest $5000. I don't have that money. But I cannot come clean with my parents that I've been lying. It is simply not an option for reasons I don't want to discuss.

I'm looking into getting a personal loan. While looking into information about it, it seems that if I can get a better rate with a personal loan, I was thinking about paying off my credit card with a loan, and also doing the investing. Paying off the card is not a necessity, but I would like to do so.

So my question is this. My credit score hovers between 615 and 640 depending on how much of my card I've gotten paid off when the report update on Credit Karma. If possible, I would like to get a $10,000 loan, and put half towards my card and half into investing to appease my father. I'm having trouble finding anyone to finance 10000, but am finding some for 5000 with a decent rate. Would getting 2 separate loans each at $5000 severely hurt my credit score?? I don't know much about credit and lending in general.

Any help would be wonderful, and I apologize for the length of this post.

Thank you all!",finance,1461639171

I'm considering refinancing my house. I currently have a 3.625 15 year mortgage with some 13 years and 216k left on it.

But he asked for $750 to lock it in, and said that this will be credited to the mortgage if the loan goes through, or refunded if the loan is denied. The company has a good BBB rating and website looks good. But I've never paid the lock in fee before.

personalfinance,Jump Ship or stay at mediocre position chasing upward promotion?,"First off, this is a college job. Not the beer and fun money kind, the rent and groceries kind unfortunately, but it's not crucial to my career choice.
 I work 32 to 40 hours a week as a non-tipped employee at a fine dining restaurant and attend a local JC working towards a Mechanical Engineering transfer at roughly 10units/semester. 

 I'm asking the collective mind of PF whether it is a reasonable decision to quit current job for offer of a tipped position elsewhere. Before anything else, I live in southern California and min wage is $10/hr. 
I've been with the restaurant for a year now and have been a rather dependable employee, hard to come by in the industry it seems. I've inquired twice now about promotion and during the most recent I took it all the way up the chain of command and got approval. 

Here starts the questionable tactics: 
1) as I am already full time and it is very hard to keep a staffed host podium, I was required to work 6 days a week at nearly 50hrs/wk. All on top of core mathematics classes that are currently kicking my ass. It soon became apparent that they aren't looking too hard to fill current position to facilitate my growth. I even promised to split weekly shifts at both positions.

2) upon my urging, they have agreed to postpone training till suitable host coverage is found, and as far as I can tell, all hiring efforts have halted. To the point where managers are leaving for 3 week vacations. 

3) 2 Server Assistants assumed the roles of barback (training position) on Friday and Saturday, as needed by restaurant. upon inquiry, manager blatantly explained that the Assistants have ""claimed"" those shifts. 

So, if they find coverage for me, I'll be limited to working crap shifts as a tipped employee, weekends as a host and still break full time while in school. Would it be a bad decision to search for and potentially accept a tipped position elsewhere? I feel slightly disrespected seeing that I also trained all current hosts and have been happy to not only cover emergency shifts, but also actually assume the roles of individuals who no show for the tipped positions I am reaching for, on multiple occasions... With no tip compensations. 

I apologize for the length, but I really need your help PF. Is this a case of ""bird in the hand, 2 in bush""? Or am I merely afraid to make an obvious decision?

personalfinance,Moved to the USA 6 months ago and have a credit score of 712. Is there a way to increase my score so I can purchase a home without spending money to make money?,"I want to build credit, but I can't justify credit building strategies that will cause me to waste money. For example taking out a personal loan where I'm charged interest when I don't need a loan. I do want to purchase property here within the next 6 - 18 months, and with a credit score below 750 I'm aware I could be losing thousands to a less than desirable interest rate each year. How can I increase my credit score?

PERSONAL LOANS  
I moved to the USA in October 2015 after winning the Green Card lottery. In February I started work in Los Angeles where my current salary is $94,000. I'm quite frugal so despite the costs associated with getting set up I have already saved $8,000. Also, in my savings account back home I also have more than enough money for the down payment on several properties. There is nothing I can say I need a personal loan for. 

CAR LOANS  
I purchased my $12,000 car outright because at the time I had not established a credit score. I understand I lost a valuable chance there to build credit, but I also think I gained a lot by purchasing my car through a private seller for a very good price and not wasting money on interest.  

CREDIT CARDS  
I was able to get a credit card when I first arrived because I had an Amex in Australia which I transferred. I've since opened up two more credit card accounts. The credit limits on all cards combined is $10,500. I don't allow any of the cards to ever have more than $500 on them and pay the bill in full each month.  

My expenses each month are:  
$1,050 Rent and Utilities  
$80 Gas  
$50 Phone  

For what its worth, I'm 28 and female with no dependants. 

TLDR: I want to increase my credit score so I can buy a home. I have been in the USA for 6 months and my FICO credit score is 712. I have 3 credit cards, but no need for a loan as I already have a car and plenty of savings. What strategies or account options would you suggest to increase my credit score that don't involve me spending money to make money? And if the solution is to spend money then can you please justify the return for me! Thank you",finance,1461655541

personalfinance,Should I co-sign mortgage or go it alone?,"SO and I both make a little over 50k. We live in an area with somewhat high cost-of-living and rent+utilities is currently around 750/mo for each of us. We want to buy a condo for around 80-90k, live in it while paying it off in 5-7 years (pretty doable if we keep paying 750/mo each which will be significantly overpaying the 30-year mortgage), and then either sell it (to recoup our money or even make a profit) or use it as our first rental property for passive income going forward. So we are somewhat undecided about which way we want to go with it, but regardless it seems better than pouring money down the drain by renting. 

My credit score is well over 720 and my SO's is around 700. As a resident physician, I am eligible for some preferred mortgage loans (only 5% down for condos, lower interest rate, etc.). We'd like to take advantage of this sort of program. However, the minimum credit score for the program we looked into is 720, so my SO cannot cosign the mortgage loan (maybe without shopping around for a different program--and we are in a time crunch before needing to move--or maybe no matter what). 

If I/we are buying a condo, we need this program since we dont have enough of a downpayment otherwise. I would be using my emergency fund for the downpayment. The reason I have no downpayment without using my emergency fund and the reason it will be hard for me to replete my emergency fund after using it for the downpayment is that half of my post-tax income goes towards my student loans and that is non-negotiable. Because of my student loans, money is very tight for me most months. 

Please help me think through the pros and cons of signing a mortgage alone vs signing together (after shopping around for a similar program that wont exclude my SO's credit score). I really know very little about this. Is there any benefit to signing together? In a worst-case scenario where my SO cannot pay their share, is there any difference from my perspective between being the only name on the mortgage vs both our names being on it? In a worst-case scenario I could stop overpaying the mortgage and still be able to keep my good credit, but that has it's own disadvantages since I would prefer to sell the condo when Im done living in it in 5-7 years and be done with it and I would make a lot more money back (I think) if I had paid it off fully, and if I rent it out I wouldnt be able to manage it and would lose a good chunk of the passive income to a rental management company.

**11th of September: Trading Halt**- ASIC and ASX have requested a copy of the purchase and sale agreement for review and Antares is pleased to provide this.


&amp;nbsp;


**15th of September: Suspension** - Share price soared from $0.09c to $0.50c while it was allowed to trade.

&amp;nbsp;

Antares Energy Limited (ASX:AZZ) has been advised by the ASX that it must disclose the identity of the Purchaser of the Northern Star &amp; Big Star Projects pre-market today. The ASX has advised that failure to identify the Purchaser will result in the suspension of the Company’s securities from trading, pursuant to Listing Rule 17.3. Antares Energy will not disclose the identity of the Purchaser as it believes this will be detrimental to Antares’ shareholders, note-holders and other stakeholders.

&amp;nbsp;



""The ASX argues that shareholders need to know the buyer to judge the likelihood of the deal’s completion. The company argues that the bid is all cash so the buyer’s identity is irrelevant. They also claim that disclosing the buyer now may imperil the deal.""

Antares Energy Limited (ASX:AZZ) advises that the proposed closing of both Purchase and Sale Agreements has not occurred today in Houston, Texas on the 30th November 2015 as contracted, due to Antares having received a request for an extension.

**March 2016** - Antares Energy releases a company update announcing ""Wade Energy Corporation"" was the POTENTIAL private equity buyer of their assets and the deal has fallen through


&amp;nbsp;

Antares has worked proactively with Wade Energy Corporation, a private equity purchaser, to complete the transaction for the purchase of its Northern Star and Big Star assets (the Permian Projects) which was originally announced on 7 September 2015. During the period over which the transaction with Wade Energy was originally negotiated and the relevant purchase and sale agreements executed, the oil price traded in an approximate price range of US$45 to US$50 a barrel. Since the extension to the reset date of the Convertible Notes from the 30 October 2015 to 31 March 2016, the oil price has traded down to less than US$27 a barrel in both January and February 2016. Subsequently, the oil price has traded up to greater than US$40 and is currently trading around the US$40 per barrel level.  

&amp;nbsp;

**The amended purchase and sale agreements with Wade Energy (executed on or around 4 December 2015) failed to complete on the extended completion date of 15 January 2016, however the agreements remain on foot.** 

&amp;nbsp;

Antares continues to engage with Wade Energy in relation to a potential transaction as the oil price approaches the level it was at the time of the original transaction.


&amp;nbsp;


**31st of March, 2016** - NOTEHOLDER MEETING


&amp;nbsp;

Notes reset date. Antares Energy are out of cash and noteholders are now eligible for the $25M AUD payment.  Antares Energy didn't sell their assets, and as a result, have little cash in the bank remaining - unable to pay noteholders until their assets in the Permian Basin are sold.

**Conclusion**


&amp;nbsp;


Antares Energy are STILL in suspension and cannot trade.  People over at the HotCopper forums have lost their life savings - people even in retirement. This suspension has caused people to emotionally break and people were  unable to see their families for Christmas, or have an eventful holiday due to what has happened here. People were fed lies from the first announcement - putting faith in the company and all of it's announcements, and put faith in the ASX for letting this trade post-purchase and sale agreement announcement (for up to two days).

This is such an unfortunate series of events, and I want to know what everyone's opinions are of this matter?

personalfinance,Amending taxes for a non resident alien in US,"I came to US for my grad school in Jan 2014 and I worked part time job in school for few weeks in 2014. I filed my taxes last year through turbo tax and I got refund of about 500 dollars. I started working full time from September 2015 and while filing taxes this year I found that people like me(non resident aliens) shouldn't file taxes through turbo tax and instead should send paper returns, which I did this year and filed properly and was accepted and got the refund. Also while filing taxes for 2014 year, turbo tax asked me for school tuition receipt and I uploaded that and it calculated some 150 dollars refund because of that. But now I found out that I am not eligible for that refund either. 

So now I know that I should amend my tax returns for 2014 year, but I am not sure what I should do with the refund. Should I give back all the refund I got? Should I give some interest for that and do I have to pay any penalties? It was a honest mistake at that time, I was new to the country and everyone told me that I should file taxes but no one told me how and I found turbotax online and filed it.. And IRS accepted my returns and gave the refund. I filed my taxes correctly this year through paper and it was accepted and got refund. So far IRS didnt point out any issue with my taxes but I am sure that if I dont amend my taxes for 2014 year I could get some trouble in future when I apply for resident or green card. 
So my question is what payment should I send while sending my amended returns through paper filing now?

personalfinance,"Debt giving constant anxiety, need a plan","Hey guys, on a throw away because I'm embarrassed to post this on my main. I currently have some debt and bills that are just kicking my ass that just seems to be growing and I have no idea what to do.

My debt isn't huge but considering my financial situation it's terrible. I have three credit cards with a total of $600 in debt:

* Capital One Journey - $392 **minimum payment $25**

* Barclays Apple Rewards card - **$139, minimum payment $30**

* Kohls Credit Card - **$50- minimum payment of $25**

That's just the credit cards. 

* I have a $1000 insurance bill due in a week (I pay every 6 months since I'm on my parents policy)

* a car payment ($196) 

* a phone bill ($85). 

* 40-60 on gas

So I owe about $1200 in a week (not counting the credit card payments) and I don't even have $300 in my bank account. I'm not counting in entertainment because I only spend maybe $30/mo. on dates with my girlfriend

My mom will help me with the insurance (she pays the bill and I pay her as much as I can at the time it's due and pay the rest back ASAP). 

I'm currently starting a new job and I get paid bi weekly, so I'm waiting on it to go into my account (which isn't a lot). I have one paycheck coming from my old job (also not a lot). I just have no idea where to even start. I feel like I'm just never going to pay off this debt. Here's a bit more info:

* I'll be making an estimated monthly income of $1300 pre tax after my training is complete which should take about a month. Currently I'll be making an estimated $1k since my wage is lower while I'm working.

* I pay no rent

* used to have second job but woman I worked for doesn't need me for a few months. Looking for a second job. I'm good at writing and good with children but I haven't found jobs that fit that criteria or my schedule. I'm also a runner who's been competing for 7 years.

I have thought about selling my car but my parents do not want me to sell it because they went through the trouble of taking a loan out in their name and helped me negotiate it so they see it as an insult that I want to sell it. I need a car to work because I do home visits for my job (ABA). 

I'm just at a loss with what to do and I don't want debt to make me miserable. **Do I take care of the CC's with minimum payments until I make more money?** I'm unsure of the interest rates but last I remember they are around the same for each card and aren't that high. I looked at the wiki but both options for paying the debt seemed out of my comfort zone.

personalfinance,"So, I am finally debt-free, but unsatisfied and ambitious. What now?","I'll try to keep this short, but I am a firm believer of details.

I've been in debt since highschool - as my father was going through financial issues, he opened a credit card in my name, racking it up to the maximum amount (although fortunately, this was only $1500). I was on-and-off during college, not entirely enjoying the first year, I dropped out and spent 3 years working overseas in Hong Kong. It was a great experience, but I ended up returning to NYC at the age of 24 to complete my associates degree.

I proceeded through several shitty-to-mediocre jobs that barely allowed me to afford the abominable NYC rents (with a roommate), while attending college in attempt to get my bachelors degree.

During this entire time, I was still paying back my credit debt - meeting only the minimums. While still in debt, this at least, allowed me to build up a decent credit score and open several more credit cards of higher limits. 

Unfortunately, school just never seemed to be for me - although I have about 100 credits now and could probably complete my BA degree in another 2 semesters or so. It's not that I was not good at school - I honestly believe it was simply too easy for me, and thus, boring. Meanwhile, I've put it on the backburner to be completed in the future.

Unfortunately, at this point of my life - at the age of 26, I was sitting on about $4000 in credit card debt and $3800 in outstanding college tuition. 

With that said, I have since - through the help of exceptional work experience and personality, landed a few decent jobs (considering I only have an associates degree.) The pay was still mediocre - at around $35,000 - but was enough to get by with minimum payments/rent/food.

Also, I have always been a businessman at heart. My family comes from an extensive line of businessmen, primarily in the optical/eye-wear field. A good portion of my credit card debt (after my father's portion) was investing in product I was selling online. Suffice to say I spent about 2 years importing and selling various products that just didn't seem to work out as planned - barely pulling even after all this time.

So at the age of 27, I was sitting on a good $7-8k in debt. To top this off, I got married last year - without an regrets, while I was happy, bringing somebody else into such a financial situation made me feel, to be blunt, like shit. We had to budget the wedding, but this still shot my debt up to about $10,000.

Fortunately since I had decent credit, I was able to take out a loan online for about $11,000 and pay off all my debts - consolidating the amount and paying roughly $300 a month (36 months). Lower interest rates were nice - but frankly, I was impatient and didn't want to be in debt for 3 years.

Reaching back to my business knowledge, I took another risk and took out another $2000 on a credit card to invest into importing more product. I corrected the mistakes I made in my first 2-year venture, changing up my products. Things were slow at first, but I am proud to say that as of a few months ago I now operate a small online business and net about $7000 per month (profit roughly $4000).

Now, at the age of 28, 1 year and 2 months after my wedding last year - I am completely debt-free. For the first time in my life, I actually have an ""emergency fund"" sitting in my savings account - although it is still small, at about $3000. 

However, I am still feeling slightly lost in life.
While it is great that my business provides me great extra income, there is no guarantee it is long-term or consistent (it's been a good 3 months, at 7k/net per month, but who knows in the future?)

Assuming I continue to profit $4k/month, this would equate to $48k annually - which is nothing to sneeze at. However, my current 9-5 desk job only pays me $35k, which is quite frankly, pathetic - my ""side business"" only takes up about an hour or two of my evenings, and provides me more in both satisfaction and income. There are definitely career possibilities - my employer told me it's quite possible to make $60-70k within 4-5 more years (FYI I work at a property management company in Manhattan.)

But I am wondering if slaving away at this unfulfilling desk job is really my best option. I often wonder if I should attempt to finish off my Bachelors degree - although at my current stage of life/career, having it hardly seems to affect anything (I was majoring in Physics, which wouldn't really open up any other job possibilities as I did this simply because I enjoy the field, I do not wish to teach.)

By the end of this year, I intend to continue investing in my current product, but also expand by developing my own brand. No guarantees i'll profit, but I've always enjoyed business more than anything else. I eventually want to get into real estate flipping/developing - I even went and got my NY Real Estate License - which hasn't really been useful as of yet, but I figured was nice to have.

He also told me to lower my contributions into my 401k to amount needed to buy into the policy per month. He was saying both federal and state taxes plus cost basis (which I'm not familiar with) would crush my total in the 401k if I cashed it all out in retirement.. who would do that anyway? and having less in my 401 I will pay less to taxes and cost basis and it would be at about the same after taxes (but again if I cashed out the total on both 401 with my current contributions and the amount he suggested, still with me?) and have a tax deferred option to take out of my policy.

He said if I pay $4,200 a yr till I'm 65 then I will have $350,000 of tax deferred income. I heard at my age I shouldn't pay as much and after a certain amount of yrs I wouldn't have to pay into the policy because of the dividends, they will pay off my premium for me.

personalfinance,Going to medical school but have a decent sum in investments. Should I take out Federal Student Loan?,"I am going to medical school in the US in August.  Tuition is $47,000/year and the school estimates a yearly expenditure (with living expenses) of $73,000.  Federal student loans are available with an interest rate of 6.84%.  On these loans, interest is accrued daily, meaning if I borrowed $70,000/year, my daily interest would be $13.00/day.  Additionally, there is capitalized interest on the loans, meaning since payments will be differed to later in life, an additional $340 will be tacked on every 6 months.  Finally, they have a loan fee of 1.068%, meaning that if I borrow $70,000 I will owe $747.60 in fees each year.

Now, I have an advantage in this game in that I received an inheritance a few years ago (insurance payout).  It's currently tied up in Vanguard mutual funds.  The original amount 4 years ago was $125,000.  It has only grown modestly since then, short of expectations.  I used a bit to pay for graduate school (but not much) and the current balance sits at $132,000.

My original thought was to let this continue to sit and grow more over the next 4 years, before using it to help pay for loan repayments.  However, after reading about all the interest rates and fees, I am wondering if it would be better to use it immediately to pay for 2 years of school and avoid all of the rates.  I am really unsure which is the better bet.  An additional thought is that it has really been disqualifying me from any advantageous grants/loans because FASFA reports these in my assets.

I keep one month of expenses in an immediately accessible brick-and-mortar savings account, with a negligible interest rate in favor of accessibility. A second month of expenses is in an Ally savings account, earning 1%, which I can access by the time I deplete my first month.

I'm planning on investing my other two months: one into Lending Club and the other into either an ETF of some sort, or taking the safer route by buying I Savings Bonds. In the case of the former I would be opting for safe-bets and low-risk funds.

What are the reasons I might not be aware of for choosing a paltry return with I-Bonds, or better-but-not-as-high-as-LC Vanguard ETF when I can--without very much risk at all--get 8% or more with Lending Club? From what I found it seems like I can liquidate my Lending Club investments within the two-months I have covered in my savings accounts. Not sure how easy it is to take back my investment with ETFs, but I-Bonds seem to not be too ideal for cashing-out on short notice.

I plan on re-investing my Lending Club returns into retirement savings. But right now it seems my few extra thousand dollars would go to better use in something with a higher return, low risk, and relatively accessible turn-around.

personalfinance,Can I Refinance an Auto Loan and get a Personal Loan at the same time?,"I'm looking at refinancing an Auto loan with my credit union (the loan has a payoff amount of about $7000).  I'm about half way through my 60 month term with the auto finance company and I'd like to lower the payment amount if possible. Btw my credit is pretty good (FICO was over 790 when i checked last month).

I am also looking at buying a high end DSLR camera and some lenses and would probably end up spending about $5000 (or maybe a bit more).  I could use my savings to buy the camera, but I'd rather not take that much money from my account all at once so I was thinking about getting a small loan instead.

I'm wondering, is it possible to refinance the auto loan for more than I owe in order to get the cash for buying a camera as well? Or is there another option with the credit union that would essentially accomplish the same thing?

What I'm looking to accomplish is to lower the interest rate I'm paying on my auto loan and essentially get the personal loan at the same rate.  For simplicity, I'd prefer one single payment for the two loans which is why i'd like to combine them.  I understand that depending on the loan term, the payment amount might be as much (or more) than I'm paying now, but before I decide on a term of the loan I first want to know if this is possible or if I have any other options.

Thoughts?

To clarify: I plan to refinance my auto loan regardless and because of the circumstances (which I prefer not to get into) even at the same rate for the same term my monthly payments will definitely go down probably by $100+. If I were to refinance the loan for longer than 30 months the payments would go down even further.

So, my thought is: If I can refinance for a slightly higher amount for a comparable term, I can probably get my payment to remain about the same but also get extra money to buy the camera.
I have been making the same car payment for about 3 years so I know I can afford it and I have planned out my budget around it. So in my mind this would be an easy way to get the camera, refinance my loan and not have to re-plan my budget.

With my current full time schedule, this would mean that I wouldn't have a day off... I'm not someone who shy's away from working hard. I've always loved working, but this is going to be a lot, which is why I'm considering dropping down to part time work (~30hrs/week) and then if I can handle it go up in hours.

My private loans are currently at $50/mo. but around this time next year they're going to be upwards towards $800/mo, because my graduation date was incorrect, and when I called the loan company they said to just pay the current one which had me graduating at the right time. 

and then food which averages about $150-175/mo.

Forex,Trade Ideas for AUD/USD,"Tomorrow at 2:00pm EST the Fed will announce their interest rate decision. It’s highly anticipated  that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged at 0.50%

Australia’s interest rate decision is happening on May 3rd at 12:30am EST and the RBA is expected to cut interest rates from 2.00% down to 1.75% which could add some selling pressure to the Aussie. Come next week, we might start to see some selling pressure in the Aussie as we get closer to the RBA interest rate decision.

Now, let’s take a look at some of the Australian economic indicators to get a better sense of whether we think the RBA will cut interest rates or leave them unchanged.

Overall Australia is doing fairly well. Their unemployment figures are declining on a monthly basis. GDP annual growth is improving. In January GDP came in at 3% while Oct 2015 the figure  was 2.7 and in July of 2015, it was only 2%.

On the other hand:

    Wage growth is slowing down on a monthly basis
    Retail Sales MoM is stagnant
    Retail Sales YoY is gradually declining
    Consumer Confidence declined in April to 95.1 from 99.1 in March and 101.3 in February
    New Home Sales dropped by 5.3% to 7332 in February from 7946 in January

I’m personally not in favor of trading prior to any major risk event like tomorrow’s FOMC but based on the fundamentals that I gathered here and analyzing the chart technically, I’m more bullish towards this particular pair and prefer to continue to trade with the trend.

personalfinance,Auto Loan: Pay off now or continue monthly payments?,"Hi all!  I just purchased a new car.  I had enough aside (plus a trade in) to make the down payment the majority of the payment, and only financing about $10k @ 2.49%.  This comes out to a very low $154/month.  I recently came into a bit of money and was wondering what to do.  I can increase my monthly payments and pay off the loan sooner, or I can even just pay it off in full now if I wanted to- and save myself the interest, while still having some savings left over.

personalfinance,What would you do?: The no-win mortgage,"Im NOT in seattle by the way.

So 10 years ago I bought a condo with my then GF, no down payment, 100% financing. We had a 7% interest rate and $145,000 mortgage. She left a year later, I was able to streamline refinance in 2009 to another 30 year mortgage, 5%, and got her off the loan/deed. I paid on that until 2015, $950 a month. In March 2015 I refinanced to 15 years because I was able to get 3% FRM and the payment only went up to $1100. So here I am, 14 years left at 3%, 128k balance, PMI will drop off at 114.5k (or early 2018 by standard amortization). That still leaves a monster monthly payment of $1050 a month for another decade plus.

What bugs me: 20% down on a house worth what mine is in this area yields a payment about half as high as mine. I know im on 15 years and i royally screwed up by getting a subprime loan in my youth, but it's just hard to swallow that payment for 15 years. I'm 30, so thats another half of the time ive lived paying that every month.

I take home ~4400 a month and keep total expenditures to around $2900 a month (thats bills, food, fun spending, EVERYthing). Outside of that 4400 take home im putting 6% into my 401k, maxing the legal HSA contribution limit, and putting some into an IRA. I'm aggressively paying down my small car loan. 

If I sold the home, after fees and the market being bad in my area i'd probably walk away with nothing. I like the home, nothing really wrong with it, but it's 10 years old so in the next few years will require some maintenance. 

So, am I ""ok?"" Should I try to aggressively get the PMI off? Should I just pay the payment and be glad i can afford it? Should I sell, walk away with nothing, get an apartment, and start over when I have 20%?",finance,1461704605

personalfinance,"I [19M] am starting an internship this summer. Should I pay off my student loans, invest, or do a mix of both?","First of all, I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. I read through some of the information in the wiki, starting with the ""READ THIS FIRST: How to handle $"" in the sidebar, but I'm still a little bit confused.

Let me start by giving all of the relevant information:

I just turned 19, and I'm nearing the end of my first year of college in a STEM major. A couple months ago I applied for, interviewed for, and was offered a summer internship half-way across the country from where I live/go to school. The internship pays $27/hour, full-time, for 12 weeks over the summer. The company pays for relocation both ways, and offers free corporate housing (with 3 roommates) for the duration of the internship. This means that beyond my phone bill, food, and maybe some transportation costs (I will minimize transportation costs, because the company has a shuttle service and a modest travel reimbursement program), all of my income is essentially discretionary.

I see this as an excellent opportunity to get a jump-start on my finances. I'm currently searching through the wiki for budgeting advice so I can make sure I don't spend too much, so I can maximize the amount of money I have for saving, investing, etc.

My question is, should I prioritize paying off student loans, or saving/investing? I currently have $3150 in student loan debt. All of the debt has a 4.290% interest rate, but since they're ""subsidized"" loans, they don't start accruing any interest until I've graduated.

investing,FedEx Line Haul contracting,"Hello everyone

Thanks in advance for your knowledge, help and insights on this investment situation.

First of all I would like to give a quick summarization and objective for this post.
Goal-receive insight on taking necessary steps to become a FedEx line haul contractor from the perspective of a new corporation.
Post- With all information considered what are the most appropriate and effective steps to take to become a contractor.

I am very interested in becoming a contractor for FedEx line haul and have extensively researched routes and FedEx. I have looked to acquire routes by purchasing established routes from current contractors and also looked at the FedEx website for new contractor opportunities. Which neither has brought forth any real opportunities for me to become a FedEx line haul contractor or provide more information on how to become a contractor. 

If someone may be interested in these opportunities there are many requirements and avenues to consider in pursuing this particular investment. Some things that an investor would need to consider are: 
-FedEx new ISP contracts and how that effects either purchasing or becoming a new contractor. All contractors must be on ISP contracts by 2020. How does that effect your strategy in becoming a contractor?
-FedEx requires being a corporation to be a contractor. If you were forming a new transportation corporation would a new corporation be seriously considered for a new contractor opportunity? Or if the new corporation were to purchase an existing route would FedEx approve the sale? 
-Financing. There are many avenues for financing and the two most popular resources are traditional and private. Both have their own positives and negatives. Is either preferred over another by FedEx? 

I had many other thoughts I wanted to express to receive insights about FedEx and becoming a contractor, in the most effective and efficient way possible. However, due to my inability to write and communicate I figured less will be more as my main point in this post is to hear ideas and insights on ways to become a FedEx contractor. 

Would you pursue incorporated and then financing? Would you secure financing and then pursue incorporated? Starting as a new corporation is it more advantageous to purchase an existing route or continue to apply to become a new contractor?",finance,1461716511
personalfinance,Sitting on $70k in Cash -- Am I doing this all wrong?,"I have a good job that pays about $185,000 a year and another $50,000 bonus.  Next year will see a significant raise and bonus.  Realistically, I could see switching jobs to one that pays low six figures. 

I have about $45,000 in student loan debt with interest rates from 2% - 3.4% (variable).  My wife makes $70,000 and has about $70,000 in loans, but hers go away through public interest forgiveness after 120 payments.

I have about $70,000 in the bank, and I put away about $4,000 a month in savings.  My instinct says to pay off my loans but that feels like the ultimate illiquid investment.  I can't use that money for anything!  But the $70,000 in the bank only returns 1% APY so I'm losing money as we speak. 

I feel very, very, very ignorant.  My instinct, given my predominant goals are buying a house and I don't have enough for 20% yet, is to invest about $20,000 in 50/50 bond/stocks fund, but that still feels like an inexcusable amount of cash.

personalfinance,"I'm about to have money in the bank for the first time in my life and I have no idea what to do with it. Please help, Reddit!","As the title states, I am about to have excess money for the first time in my life and I have *zero* idea how to allocate it. Here’s a bit of backstory for reference:


Me and my 3-year-old son are moving into my boyfriend’s house at the end of next month. We’ve been together for about 2 years and he’s been the only father my son has ever really known. We’ve discussed finances in great detail and have decided that moving forward, we want to tackle debts as a team. The move and the fact that I’ll have renters paying off my mortgage combined with my son’s deadbeat sperm donor *finally* having to pay court ordered child support means that I’ll have much more money in the bank than I’m used to. This has left me feeling a little overwhelmed and admittedly, I’m not great with money because I’ve honestly never had excess before. My boyfriend feels the same, and we’re hoping the finance gurus of Reddit can help us out. Here’s what our current take home income, debts and assets look like:


###**Income**
- Boyfriends Monthly Income (take home): **$3600-$4400** per month ($3600 being a fairly conservative estimate – his pay fluctuates throughout the year)
- My Monthly Income (take home - including child support): **$3800-$4200** per month (my pay varies as I miss a lot of work for my son’s numerous medical appointments, again $3800 is about the minimum of what I’ll be taking home. For those worried about my long-term job security because of the missed time at work – don’t be. This was discussed with my employer prior to signing my employment contract.)
- Rental Income: **$1600** monthly


###**Debt**
- Mortgage 1: **$1272** monthly. The balance is about $196,000 at a 3.59% fixed interest rate.
- Mortgage 2: **$1246** monthly. The balance is about $182,000 at a 2.69% fixed interest rate.
- Student Loans: **$0** monthly right now until the end of November, at which point the minimum payment $524 combined. I can make interest free payments on both loans until the end of November. The balance of my federal loan is $38,188 and the interest rate is 5.20% floating. The balance of my provincial loan is $21, 405 and the interest rate is 2.70% floating.
- Credit Cards: **$13,000 total balance** $3000 of that is mine and the interest rate is 20% (eeek, I know). The other $10k is from my boyfriend’s credit card at an interest rate of 12%.
- Utilities: **$700** monthly
- Food: **$500** monthly
- Gas: **$250** monthly
- Phone: **$110** monthly
- Insurance: **$315** monthly
- Day home: **$363** monthly
- Entertainment: **$500** per month - this includes money saved for vacations
- Savings: ??? We want to live by the advice of “spend after you save” which is why I want this added to our budget, I’m just not sure what makes sense to put away in savings right now.


###**Assets**
- Mortgage 1: **$83,000** in equity
- Mortgage 2: **$15,000** in equity
- Car: worth about **$10,000**
- RESP: I have about **$2000** in my son’s RESP, and would like to start adding to it as soon as we are able


So, where do we start? I know the general consensus is to establish 6 months of savings and then tackle debt starting with the highest interest rate, but I’m wondering if there’s anything we’re missing. I’m the kind of person who thrives when I have a set goal in front of me with an established timeline so this is what I need to do, there’s just a lot to consider here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Option 1- Suck it up &amp;amp; pull $600 out of my savings to bring credit card #1 closer to the 30% threshold instead of making monthly payments

Option 2- Open a balance transfer card with no interest &amp;amp; no transfer fees for the first 15 months &amp;amp; split card#1 balance in half to minimize interest paid &amp;amp; expand my line of credit. Continue to pay both monthly.

Each year, I have worked to pay this amount. I send money home for tuition and to help my family out and my mother submits the payments. Otherwise, I pay ALL my own living expenses (really, everything). I do not go home for breaks. I get no assistance from my family. I have told my financial aid adviser this and she has said ""have you asked for more money? Have you applied for scholarships? Have you looked into other loans?"" Yes, yes, yes.

I have let my (recently divorced) parents declare me as a dependent, as we thought it would help lower my brother's tuition. It does not and I have had to send home all my savings to help with his tuition. I have always indicated I'm a dependent on the FAFSA too.

I just found out that my father gambled away all my tuition money I had been sending home for this next year (not much, but still).

I recently filed my taxes as a dependent. I would like to change this. I would like to file taxes and FAFSA as an independent.

I took one class at my University last semester and I didn't have financial aid to cover it because I lost it due to not meeting the requirements to receive aid. I screwed up, I know. 

Long story short, My school account is now past due $2900, which I do not have. 

I have not started receiving calls from collections yet so I'm guessing they did not turn me over yet.

personalfinance,Wife just graduated med school with significant debt. Debating between PSLF and just simply paying it off.,"Wife just graduated and we together have 220k in student debt.  It's at approx a 6% interest rate, but the first four years (while she is in residency) will be at approx 3% due to our repayment option (which is income based with half forgiveness on interest).  We have the option to do PSLF if she works for a non-profit for 10 years, which includes the four in residency and do income-based repayment.  But we will eventually (hopefully) have an income approx 6 years down the road where we could pay it off.  

We are also selling our house and hoping to get a chunk of change out of it.  Do we throw it at the student loans, or invest it some other place and aim for PSLF?

When I get to the US I will buy a car and plan to finance about $9,000 at approx 2.9%. My husband is then going to meet me in the US (he's currently waiting for a visa), we will get an apartment together, but he will not be working immediately because he needs to wait about 90 days for a green card.

* How should I simultaneously be aggressive about my debt and plan for the possibility that my husband may take several months to find work?
* How should I utilize the $9k in savings from living with family? Some of it will need to be spent on moving, but let's say I am still left with $7k. Save all of it? Put some towards the debt?
* It appears to make the most sense to approach the debt from the highest interest downward, but is there a reason to pay off the car first? In the past I have prioritized auto debt because I felt like it was ""bad"" debt, but that doesn't seem to make sense anymore...

personalfinance,50k in Federal Student Loan Debt - Paid off over 30k in the last 4 years... talk some sense into me?,"tl;dr: Went to expensive private college, ended up taking out ~50k in combined federal and private loans. Already paid off the high interest private loans, but federal loans remain. Working in a public service job and in 9 years will be eligible for forgiveness - is it worth it to wait or should I get aggressive again?

Hi all! I graduated from undergraduate college in 2012, with three scary private loans (10-12% interest rates), and 11 small federal loans ranging from 2k-6k, with interest rates around 6.25%. Somehow, while living in a city and working part-time, I managed to live frugally and save enough to attack the private loans, and paid them off fully in 2-3 years (I don't know how I did it!).

I've been following an income-based repayment plan for the federal loans, initially hoping to get the teacher forgiveness, but when that career path didn't pan out, I looked into the public service one. Now I'm making ~40k (before taxes) and take home a little over 2k every month. My rent is $750, and on average I spend a total of about $1,300, give or take. I have about $12,000 in savings.

My federal loans are a sticking point for me. They're growing, slowly, and I could put a lot more towards them and pay them off. Or... I could wait around in my nonprofit job indefinitely, which is not a given. I know the tendency here is to advocate for immediately getting out of debt, which I totally understand, but I'm not sure if it's the best plan for me now, when there's uncertainty in my future. I might want to move to NYC in a few years, and the money would be important then. I'm happy to provide extra information as needed--any thoughts? Thanks!

edit: I think I was unclear - I STILL have 50k in Federal debt. It started as 35k but interest happened. The 30k I paid off was all private loans. Thanks for the responses, you all are helpful and kind!",finance,1461765553

When I first started working, I was working 28 days on/ 14 off. at the same rate ( alot more money )  
I have uprgraded my license and now hold a pretty high position. Due to a down turn in oil prices and the oil industry as a whole, I did not earn a raise in day rate as I would have if the industry was doing well. I could stand to make 700-900$ a day on the upturn of the industry.  
Here's my big problem.  
I owe over 100k in student loans. My first year working I grossed over 100k in income. I made alot of poor decisions ( i was young, making alot of money and living the life) I bought a truck (10k down payment), didnt budget. Partied, traveled, essentially spent A LOT of money. I got laid off and was out of work for several months. I put loans into forbearance, liquidated stocks and 401k.  
I basically have no savings now.  
I am paying off federal and personal loans that i took out for school, and federal loans that my parents took out for my education (they cant afford it)  
Ive got about 4k in cc debt.  
Heres my current budget.   -1500 in student loans per month.   -1500 in all other bills,subscriptions,credit cards etc.   so thats 3000 per month.   but i work only every other month so i have to budget per two months.  
INCOME per 2 months -$11,397  
Expenses per 2 months -$6,000  
essentially i have 5,400 dollars extra to spend/save for one month at home. I usually spend about 3k of that.

Thanks for reading.  I'm hoping you can help me properly weigh my choices.

I have a 2006 Mustang for trade-in that is worth, let's say, $8000.  We are trading it in because I have a standard cab pickup and she has the Mustang, and we want to start a family.  Need a more practical vehicle.

My pickup has a not-very-good loan (I used to have bad credit, not anymore) with a 6% rate and about $8000 left on it over the next two years.

Let's say I find the vehicle I want at about $25,000.  I see there are loans available online for 1.99% or 2.29%.  Probably would do 60 months.  Not sure how real those are, but let's assume they are.  I also have enough savings to probably cover the difference in cash, but this is our emergency fund/saving to buy land, so I would rather not dip into it.  Also with really low interest rates it seems worth taking the loan.  Should I:

1) Trade Mustang, acquire loan for remainder.  (~$200 payment + $330 for truck )

2) Trade Mustang, pay cash for remainder. ($330 truck payment)

3) Trade Mustang, acquire loan for remainder and combine the remainder of my pickup amount into this awesome rate?  (Not sure this is even possible?) (Like...$500 payment)

4) Trade Mustang, acquire loan for remainder.  Pay off truck balance with cash.  (Leaning towards this.)

5) Something I'm not considering?  I'd love a way to just convert the Mustang into a payoff for my truck.

Other details: clean credit history, 9% debt utilization (will be lower), score around 800, make just over $100k a year.  I have a mortgage that totals to around $1000/mo. with taxes and insurance.  No other debt.

Thanks everyone.

My dad is near 60 and divorced from my mom, so I'm mostly just concerned about his wellbeing should he survive this medical stuff.  The term life insurance policy was like 2-3k a year and ended at 65 I think, so I told my dad that it was likely a little overboard, and saving that money that will no longer be needed would protect me as well. I plan on doing grad school soon and my dad would be the one likely helping me with that, and if he were to pass (god forbid), I would have enough to finish grad school on that money .

I tried to console him that it wasn't a big deal that he goofed on not paying the policies, but he is still kind of upset. 


Addenum:also, he has a 100k life insurance policy automatically through work, which would also in theory help buffer things were he to pass .

I suggested it wouldn't be worth trying to get the life insurance or disability policy back considering like six months have passed, and he likely can't pass a physical without obfuscating the truth about his illness. 

I told him to contact the companies just to see if it would be possible to pay for the gap and keep the policy, just to know if it was an option, but I am pretty sure it would be impossible because of a new physicak they would need to do, as well as the legal snafu it would dredge up if he lied to get the policy back.

personalfinance,"Crazy to keep $84,000 in the bank when I have $180,000 in loans?","I am a final year medical student about to start a 5-year residency where my income will be ~$60K/year. After residency my income will be $300-400K/year (possibly up to 500-600K/year in 2-3 years) depending on where we live and what type of practice I join. I am married and my wife brings in about ~$90-95K/year. We are planning on starting a family in about 1-2 years, after which my wife may or may not go back to work. To give her the option of staying home with the kid if that's what she wants to do, I am trying to see whether it makes sense to save up a ""buffer"" that we can use to offset the costs of her not working.

We estimate we can save about $84,000 total before we have kids (1.5 years from now), which includes some money we have saved up now. I am wondering whether it is better to spend this additional money to pay back my $180,000 in med school loans (mostly at 6.8% interest, a small amount is at 5% interest), or whether it is better to save it and use it over the ~3.5 years when my wife may not be working and staying home with the kid. 

Here's some math for when only I will be working:

**Expenses per month:**

$3,000 rent + utilities (very expensive city, and we will require a 2 bedroom when there is a baby/infant) 

$2,000 living expenses (includes groceries, eating out, and a few trips to visit friends/parents)

$300 loans (rough minimum loan repayment if I use an income-based repayment plan)

$1000 conservative baby-related expenses, no daycare since wife will be at home

**Total:** $6,300/month

My take-home income (estimate given one child according to TurboTax) will be about **$4,400/month**, so our expenses will exceed our income by about $1,900/month. This is where our savings could come into play. The total estimated deficit over ~3.5 years of having a kid, being in residency, and my wife not working would be $1,900/month * 3.5 years = $79,800, so we could dip into our savings by $1,900 each month and be okay for the remainder of residency if we had around $80,000 saved up. 

The alternative would be aggressively paying back my loans during the next 1.5 years, at the end of which I would have only $60,000 in loans left (which is very nice), but then we would definitely be struggling more to pay the bills each month with my wife at home. The big advantage is that the net amount I have to pay would be lower since the total interest accrued would be lower. 

I know in this sub everyone always recommends paying loans back quickly, especially with a high interest rate like 6.8%, but I am wondering whether it is crazy for us to hold onto a large amount of savings to make our lives more livable during residency/young parenthood.

devops,Know Thy[self] Environment,"Originally from the [NopSec blog](https://www.nopsec.com/blog/know-thyself-environment/?utm_source=social&amp;utm_campaign=reddit)

Post by Nick Michalos

Securing an environment is a constant game of cat-and-mouse. Safety measures of all kinds can (and should) be put in place to protect against malicious actors, downtime, and other business impacting variables. A production stack can be an extremely complex system with dozens of applications, databases, networking security groups, user permissions, etc., so what are some of these safety measures and practices that can be used, and whose responsibility is it to make sure the stack is safe? The developers? Yes. Sys admins? Yep. DevOps? You bet. The point here is that everyone has a role in an organization’s security whether it’s obvious or not. Let’s take a look into the DevOps realm and see what these engineers can do to prevent, detect, and remediate potentially damaging issues.


Let’s first consider DevOps as the gatekeeper of Production - the Gandalf yelling “You shall not pass” at any engineer whose changes don’t meet some criteria. Typically one of these gatekeepers should be looking for a few things and asking some important questions:

Successful test results - Is that your final answer? A hard requirement of proof of correctness of changes will help ensure that bug fix updates will actually fix issues, prove that other components aren’t newly broken, and provide repeatable steps to test features further on down the line.

Supportability - How do we know this feature is working and how do we troubleshoot? Imagine being a Tier-1 support engineer when a customer calls you up complaining something isn’t working. It’s now your job to investigate and support the issue, and you start by digging into the logs. Hmm, no luck there... nothing relevant can be found. Now you happen to check the code repository for this feature and find that you’re flying totally blind. There’s no logging whatsoever! Now you’re stuck either jumping into a shell desperately trying to reproduce the issue or escalating up the chain just to try to get an idea of what could be going wrong. What a bottleneck. Relevant, concise logging is a must-have throughout all of the moving pieces of an application

What about documentation? Thorough documentation would be fantastic to be able to quickly reference and resolve. Imagine having a go-to handbook with “In the event of ‘X’ do ‘Y’.” That would certainly make things a bit easier.

Holding your own application code base to a high standard may be tedious sometimes, but the return on investment, even if it’s just peace of mind, is tremendous.


Now we’ll assume changes are in, approved, and ready to move up the environment chain destined for Production greatness and the DevOps engineer’s role is to usher them into the next environment. We could ‘scp’ a .tar.gz over to our host, or run a pull/checkout with our favorite source control tool directly on the host, but then we’ll realize it’s not 2006 anymore. The fundamental problems with these manual approaches are that they are not repeatable to scale, they’re very susceptible to user error (one of the many reasons ‘manual’ is a four-letter word in Ops), and they’re not guaranteed to yield the same results between executions. A better solution is to leverage an automation/orchestration framework such as Ansible, Puppet, or Chef that will give order to your deployments and eliminate the chaos. Chaos introduces uncertainty in an environment, and uncertainty means insecurity. These tools provide us with human-readable “playbooks”, “manifests”, “recipes” and other trendily named configuration mechanisms that will guarantee our deployment coverage for updates. These tools can not only deploy your own application, but keep all operating system packages up to date and effectively get your hosts to exact desired states.

Our updates are now in production with the latest and greatest features. The odds are pretty good that our production environment isn’t just a single host running a static website without any other services supporting it behind the scenes. There’s probably a database to hold some dynamic content, a session caching application to let users log in, maybe an ElasticSearch server for fast search functionalities, and some other auxiliary service applications. Now the job is to stand up and protect Production from the outside world. Someone new to setting up a Production environment may stand all of these applications up on separate hosts, see that everything’s working, and call it a successful day.

Where this falls short is the [implied] lack of consideration for putting services on internet-facing hosts. If your backend database that holds your customer data is accessible to the general internet, you’re going to have a bad time. Very careful knowledge of which applications communicate with which services will help an engineer set up correct private networks and firewall rules to make sure service exposure throughout the stack is safely deployed and configured. An additional environmental strategy that is often overlooked is the creation and use of ‘service users’ on a server to apply even more restrictions on sensitive applications.

Having to actively manage all of these moving parts can seem daunting, but as we discussed earlier, automation is your friend. All of these setups and configurations can be organized and implemented with the orchestration tools mentioned before, and if they are, future update needs can be almost seamless and completed on the order of minutes. Imagine having to update an environment of hundreds of Linux servers to patch Java (not hard, I know) manually. This could take forever, but if instead you use Ansible you can roll that update out automatically to all hosts, in batches, or however you’d like in a repeatable, predictable manner. Personally, I love these tools. They cut down massively on deployments to all environments (including development with Vagrant!), are very easy to use, and help work and iteration move quickly. Though I praise these tools for their power, it’s not to say that if used incorrectly they can’t wreak some irrevocable havoc. After all, there’s still the end-user element, and we mustn’t forget the PEBCAK phenomenon. A real-world scenario was recently reported but found to be a hoax on the serverfault.com forum, but the risk of what was alleged is not too farfetched. User bleemboy claimed to have “rm -rf”-ed his entire company away with Ansible automation. Because these tools are designed to run what you, the user, tell them to, this could happen under the right (or very, very wrong) conditions.

To wrap up, enforcing policies and procedures in an organization geared towards ensuring certainty of code, packages, and permissions, will help mitigate security risk tremendously.  Automation and orchestration of these policies will open up a world of heightened control and insight to an environment putting a maintainer in a fantastic spot to deploy and manage source code and packages to respond to security issues easily and efficiently. Now go… automate all the things and such…

I've done some researching on the matter but between here and FIRE, I've had conflicting information.  A few things that I'm looking at is the possibility of consolidating my loan to see if I can get a lower interest rate, however, some say it's a good idea and some say it isn't. 

As far as my budget is concerned,  I have about a years worth of rent saved up for a rainy day and can't decide if I should continue building that up in a readily available savings or invest it (investing is something I really just can't figure out that well),   Or, the other alternative is once I hit a certain savings amount, start pouring what I would otherwise put in savings into my loans.    The idea is to pay the loans off faster than the current plan which is currently set at 20 years.  I've done well in proper financial monthly planning, but for some reason I have trouble planning financially for the long term.  Which is why I've turned to PF to ask for some guidance or at least a good starting budget that I can alter as the years pass. 

tl;dr how would you financially plan for yourself in my position for the next 10 years.",finance,1461788132

personalfinance,"21/M, Should I pay off the remainder of my car loan in full?","Right before my first year of college three years ago, I was forced to look into getting my own car, as I was commuting to classes.  I bought a used 2012 Toyota Yaris from a dealership, with 198$ payments for just under six years, with a interest rate at just under 3%.  I finished classes last year, and have been working my ass off since, and I have enough to pay off my loan in full. After making my payment last month, I have $5,897 left to pay on the car.  I just called the bank (Fifth Third Bank), and they told me that my loan payoff amount if I was to pay it in full today was  actually $5,899, which was surprising to me.  I sort of figured I wouldn't have to pay the interest on the loan if I paid it in full, but maybe that just me being young and stupid.  Seeing as there is no real benefit to paying it off in full, at least saving money wise, should I just set aside the money I would use to pay the remainder of the loan and make my payments every month for the next few years, or pay it off in full anyway?  Would my credit score be negatively or positively effected if I did or did not pay it off in full or are there any other general positives or negatives? 

The main reason I wanted to pay it off was because within the next few months I plan on moving into the city of Buffalo, and I am currently in the suburbs living with my parents.  Rent in Buffalo is VERY cheap, and I have a place lined up at $275 a month plus utilities.  I wanted to pay off my car before moving out, but now I'm not sure if it will even make a difference.  Money is by no means tight for me, I currently have an excess income of about 400 dollars a month after my car payment and gas/insurance, and my school loan payments are low seeing as I went to a community college. I plan on picking up another part time job in the city once I move out. My credit score is currently in the low to mid 700's if that makes a difference with anything.

Sorry if this seems jumbled, I'm just a little confused about everything.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks!",finance,1461788847

personalfinance,Help! I am in a unique situation and I am first-time car buyer and I'm not sure if I am being taken advantage of at the dealership!,"Hi everyone! To keep things short I’ll just cut to the chase. I was born into a unique situation where I was able to save money very early, inherit money early, and invest early. I am currently sitting on $400,000 in investments at age 22 (male).

I went in yesterday and put down my offer for a custom built Volvo XC90. Out the door the car is $61,205. I had a recent string of luck that allowed me to acquire $27,000 and when I sell my current Honda I will be getting $8-10k for it. So I went in today and told them that I would put $37,000 DOWN and then finance the rest. So I'd be financing $24,205 @ 1.9%. 

Here's where I get confused because I'm not sure if the salesman is being genuine or is just trying to pull a quick deal on me.  He said: I should put $10,000 down. Let the rest of the $27,000 work for me in the market and just make monthly payments of $700. The only problem is, is that at my current job I do not make enough money ($3000 a month after tax, 52k gross per year) to justify this big of a car expense. And, let’s just say that I put the remaining $27,000 in an index fund, I would have $9.50 transactional costs per month when I would go to liquidate shares to pay off the loan. Therefore, my thought was to keep the payments low by paying a higher down payment up front. My interest rate through Volvo would be 1.9%. I really prefer having no loans and having as little payments per month as possible, but I also want to make sure that I am being as smart as possible about this.

Leasing is out of the question because I drive 20,000+ miles a year.

I'm heading out to med school this fall and I will be needing to take out a huge amount in private loans. The federal government gave me 20,500 and the base tuition is 23,226. The apartment i'm living in is 760 a month or 9,120 a year. Books and other fees are 1,200/yr. I figure I will need 3600 a year for food (probably less but the change would be insignificant).

Basically, I just don't know where to start. I know sallie mae offers deferred loans but unsure how much they can give me.

No significant debt.  (&lt;$500, mostly paid down every month, just a credit card I'm still using until I hit the next rewards point tier)

401(k) contribution at 16%, 8% pre-tax, 8% Roth. More than enough to get full company match (5%).  401(k) balance is about 2X my salary, I'm mid-30s.  So it's not like I have nothing invested.  Just asking about this emergency fund money.

Six-month living cost estimate:  About $19k.  This from just doing a lazy calculation based on paycheck after taxes, insurance, 401(k), etc.

I got all interested in the idea of a CD ladder...until I actually looked up current rates and maturity dates.  Yuck.  I had really hoped I'd find a place where I could ladder in 3-month or 6-month increments but it looks like rates are somewhere in between 0.5% and 1.5%, and those mostly for 2-yr CDs.

2.  The product, NuBits, is the most marketable decentralized crypto in existence because of its unprecedented price stability achieved without a central banking service.  
  
3.  NuShares are a governance tool.  Therefore, while they also represent a store of wealth and can be transacted as a commodity just like bitcoin, they also bestow power upon their holder.  NuShares grant the owner a say over the Nu network, from nuances like interest rates to grand arching motions that decide the future of the project.  
  
4.  The price and marketcap are very low.  The price is almost down to the IPO price and the marketcap is under $2mil.  This means that purchasing a significant portion of the network (like 0.1% for $2k) is practical for many investors.  
  
5.  The community is active.  There are upcoming developments, such as B&amp;C decentralized exchange that will use NBT as its fiat token, that will be a significant boon for the network.  The blockchain can pay developers directly and the community is constantly striving to evolve and achieve a better, more efficient and effective network.",cryptocurrency,1461846494

personalfinance,$200K in student debt and I need some guidance ASAP,"As of right now, I make $17.10/hr while in training for a job that will translate into a $50,000 salary in June. But to coincide with that, I have two student loans. One under my parents which (after speaking with Nelnet last night) I have learned has an outstanding balance of $186,000 paid over 25 years at $610.87/month. The interest rate for this loan is 8-9%. I then have another loan in my name, interest rate around 5%, for $25,000 that has monthly payments of $301.28. In total, I have $200K+ student debt after attending a public university for four years at $25K/year. #feelthebern? 

When I graduated in 2014, my loans under my parent’s name were under a Parent Plus loan. Along with this loan, my parents had Parent Plus loans for my sister and brother. These loans are divided into groups that all fall under our respective social security numbers, so I know which groups to pay. At the end of each month, my brother, sister and I give our dad our respective totals, and he pays down the amount in each group. Now, for whatever reason, you can only pay the balance all together. For example, if I have the money to pay my loan but my sister doesn’t, the loan can’t be paid until the total amount is ready to be paid. This is one of the reasons I am in this predicament. My sister did not work for many years, therefore my dad told me the loans were in permanent deferment and I could pay what I could during this deferment period. Being that I worked minimum wage along with extended periods of unemployment (studying journalism was a great idea!) until this past February, I did not pay down the debt on these loans while they were in deferment (my biggest mistake, I know). I was supposed to begin paying December 2014 and I made a few payments here and there but I didn’t start regularly paying on the Parent Plus until this past March (when the deferment expired). Now, my dad is telling me that because my loan was in deferment for 1 year and that I wasn’t making every required payment, my loan balance jumped from $100K to $186K. He says that’s the result of the interest compounding daily. 

As you can imagine, being 23-years-old, I am upset to shit that I am $200K in the hole. So after panicking all last night, I gathered my head this morning and decided that ideally, I would like to pay $1,000/mo. on my parent’s loan and $500/mo. on my own so I can make a dent in more than just interest and instead actual principal. I also, however, would like to experience my 20s and not live at home anymore for a plethora of reasons. Additionally, I have $0 in credit card debt, 1 line of credit, bought a car outright so I have no monthly payments, and $2,000 in savings (I had $5,000, but I just used $3,000 to buy that car). 

Can someone please explain to me how this whole $200K in debt is possible and if something sounds suspicious to you too because I genuinely feel like I’m being screwed? Is there any possible way I can get this loan transferred from my dad’s control under the Parent Plus to my own control? Last night for example, I gave him $1,000 to pay on my loan and he couldn’t because my sister didn’t have to money to put on her’s. It’s already a week late (I paid him a week ago btw… he just decided to pay now!).

I currently have $46,359 in student loans broken down in the following manner

44,184 in 5 separate private loans

I make a payment of 263 for the federal loans and the remaining gets pulled from my account in three payments totaling 400 dollars

personalfinance,Need plan to save $170K in the next 10 years,"Age 32, married w/ 2 kids.  Current income $109K/year.  Planning on retiring from current career in 10 years with expected pension of $4,227/mo ($50,276/annually).  I don't plan on exactly retiring, just need to find another career - I cannot keep doing what I am doing now.  The goal is to transition to a different career and for my wife to go to medical school.  I plan on pulling money out from the 401K/IRA to pay for her schooling costs; is this wise or should we start saving separately in certificates instead? (not 100% that she will do med school at this point)

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, this is one of the many suggested savings for retirement out there that I am trying to follow, granted these are calculated for people retiring at age 65: http://www.businessinsider.com/retirement-savings-guide-2015-3.

&amp;nbsp;

We keep about $20K in our emergency fund.  I have about $60K saved up between 401K/IRAs, but I am still far behind in terms of amount I should have saved according to the charts.  I should have hit 90% of income by age 30 (~$98K).  My lack of focus in saving more is that right now I feel like my finances are spread in so many places that I don't have a good focus on where to put my money to maximize it.  Also I am finding is that if I have money sitting around I end up spending it, my monthly credit card spending have ranged from $2.5K-4K.

&amp;nbsp;

Bottom-line: need suggestion on best place to put my money so I don't end up spending it.

&amp;nbsp;

I do own a house ($190-200K market value) ~ $128K left on loan.
I have up to 3 years total of tuition/living expenses paid for my kid's college education up to $143K depending on where they go (only covers 1.5 years of college per kid).

&amp;nbsp;

What is the best way to maximize my savings at this point?

- should I increase my emergency funds? (right now will cover 4-5 months w/o income)
- should I increase my 401K to $1,500/mo to max it out?
- should I contribute to IRA on a monthly basis vs. one-time at tax time
- invest in stocks at this point? (should my goal be high/medium/low risk stocks?)
- are mutual funds better option (same risk question)?
- pay off my car loan faster?  (keeping in mind interest rate is only .89%)
- pay more into my mortgage?
- increase the 529 savings amount (kids)?
- should start setting aside money in certificates instead of an 529 (wife)?

&amp;nbsp;

My end goal is by the time I hit 40 (8 years from now): I want to have saved $230K total by then.
At my current rate of only $1.2K/mo into my 401K, I expect to save an additional $115K in 8 years; bringing my cash assets to $165K which is still $65K shy of the goal.

I also need a place to stay nearby the school. This will need to be supported by additional loans considering my current financial inadequacy to pay rent on my own. At first i considered an unsibsidized type such as Sally. Then i realized, not only would sally's loan accrue interest the entire duration of my schooling, but i would be paying two loans after graduation at roughly 6%, no bueno. Then i stumbled upon direct PLUS loan, which technically acts as a subsidized loan ONLY if you're a grad/professional grad student. They supply financial aid up to the cost of tuition. In summary, I'm thinking about doing your standard federal student loan (subsidized), and direct PLUS loan (subsidized). Even though i will still have two loans out of school, the plus loan won't be nearly as substantial, won't accrue interest for the duration of the school, and can most likely be paid off within the grace period due to this fact (with the help of parents).",finance,1461861518

As we all know Japan was hit by earthquakes and the first thing on a forex trader's mind would be to short their national currency because the economy will be affected negatively. To dump a currency of a country in crisis and actually making it worse for their economy it is totally inappropriate and wrong from an ethical standpoint.

From a trader perspective for an asset to move up or down in price it makes no difference because any direction creates equal opportunity to make money. So instead of shorting YEN the market could long YEN and actually help their economy in the midst of crisis.

personalfinance,Multiple issues with US tax return; Not sure if 1040X will be sufficient?,"My tax return is pretty straightforward. I'm a single filer, and the only sort of deduction, credit, etc. I ever claim is my student loan interest. 

This year I received two 1098s from my loan servicer, one for federal (~$400) and one for private (~$1300). When filing my return, I accidentally only included the $1300. If I had included the $400 as well, it would have dropped me to a lower tax bracket and I should have gotten about sixty some dollars extra in my return. 

If that was the only issue, I would just file the 1040X amended return and be done with it. HOWEVER, I received a notice from the IRS on 4/11 that they had adjusted my filing and I had 60 days to appeal their adjustment or they would assume that I accepted their recalculations. Their reason for recalculating is that I claimed more than the allowed amount for educator expenses ($250)... However, I never claimed any educator expenses. Just the student loan interest. 

I mailed my filing in after completing the fillable .pdf, and I did print two copies so I know for a fact that I put the $1300 down on the line for student loan interest deductions. The only thing I can think hurt me is that I never mailed in my 1098s, but that's because the letter from my provider specifically states that they have furnished them directly to the IRS. That's never been an issue in previous filing years.

The notice does say that I can appeal by writing with documentation, so I guess my ultimate question is whether sending in a 1090X with both 1098s would be considered an appeal? I'd really like to fix both mistakes (mine and theirs) in one step, if possible. In the explanation section on the 1090X I would explain both issues with the first return. 

I did try and call the number on the notice to speak with someone about this... She just seemed a little slow and didn't seem to understand that there was a two part issue, and asked if she could put me on hold while she 'submitted a referral to their processing department,' but the call dropped while I was on hold. I never received a call back from them, even though I had provided my phone number seconds before she placed me on hold. The wait time to get a person was well over 40 minutes and my lunch break was almost over, so I didn't try calling back... I'd really rather not have to call again if I don't have to, so I thought I'd see what PF had to say on the matter.",finance,1461868611

Here's my situation and I'm quite clueless what to do about this:

I filed my state (CA) and federal taxes the other day, while owing about $2000 to the IRS from last year. After I filed my taxes, I was supposed to receive a refund of $3500 for my federal taxes (minus what I owed) and about $1200 for my state taxes. 

Today I saw in my bank account that I've received the refund of my federal taxes, which was $1500. Made sense, since the IRS deducted what I owed them ($2k) from my full refund ($3.5k).


HOWEVER, instead of receiving a refund for my state taxes, I received a ""Notice of Intercepted Funds"" letter from the California FTB instead. The letter says that the State of CA sent my entire state refund to the IRS. Now, as I mentioned before, the IRS took out already what I owed them from my federal return. 

Basically what I'm missing now is my full state return of $1200, which the IRS took out for the $2000 I owed them, even though they already took out $2000 from my federal refund.

I see a depression coming, one by one things are stacking up, most of the good news is artificial. What worries me is that this is common knowledge. 
Many people are talking about it and being on the side of the majority is not usually the most profitable side to be on. I'm saving really well right now but in about five years I won't be so I'm positioning myself to try to take advantage of this turmoil and then let it ride more or less into the next ten years. I have only been investing for about six months. I'd really like to know how aware the average trader/investor was of the conditions that led to the previous two recessions. Was there a similar imbalance of arguments on the negative side then or was it more nuanced? 
I follow market news on seekingalpha, maybe I'm a victim of confirmation bias, or maybe the site is biased. Any thoughts? As far as I can tell, in the previous two recessions the opportunity cost of getting out early and missing more upsides was maybe something that kept people in the market, or was it ignorance.",finance,1461889151
litecoin,The UK Gov's interest in digital money,"The Government has responded to the petition you signed – [“Guarantee British savers and investors that cash will not be abolished”.](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/109727)



Government responded:

&gt; There are no plans to abolish cash from use in the UK.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no plans to abolish cash in the UK. This petition makes reference to Andrew Haldane’s (Bank of England Chief Economist) comments about the possibility of negative interest rates. The decision on where to set the base rate of interest (monetary policy) is the responsibility of the independent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England. The MPC has the primary objective, set out in law, of maintaining price stability for UK goods and services. This objective is defined in the MPC remit, which is reaffirmed by the Chancellor each year, as an inflation target of 2 per cent as measured by the twelve month increase in the Consumer Prices Index.
&gt; 
&gt; Setting the Bank of England’s base rate of interest is the MPC’s primary macroeconomic policy tool, designed to affect the economy as a whole in order to meet the inflation target over the medium term. Andrew Haldane’s comments were focused on medium term questions for the future of central banks such as the Bank of England and not on an immediate policy decision. He made no mention of the desire or intention to “abolish the use of cash”, but did consider, hypothetically, the case for the central bank issuing digital cash, either alongside or instead of physical cash.

personalfinance,Starting to take out student loans to cover tuition for 2 years of school. Totally financially illiterate.,"Just kidding. I'm not completely financially illiterate. But I do have questions....and I'm not sure if this question is even allowed in this subreddit. Please point me in the right direction if I'm in the wrong spot.

I'm a pharmacy student in a 7-year program who has 2 years left. I've covered my 4 years of undergrad by myself using grants and scholarships, and my mother started paying when I couldn't pay anymore which was last fall.  

She had initially planned on paying for all of my pharmacy school years, but
just today she decided that I should start taking out loans to cover the next 2 years of school in order to help build my credit. Which is fine and all except I'm not exactly sure where to start. 

I've been doing my own research and have looked into things like Federal Student Loans and private loan companies like SallieMae, but I wanna hear from the experts in the Reddit community.

personalfinance,2 Banks 1 Auto Loan,"Hi Reddit, making a throwaway, but I need an honest answer for a problem I am having. Please bear with me, thanks.

Right now I have 2 Banks, Bank A and Bank B. Bank A has my current use car auto loan with a payoff balance of 5500. Right now I am not happy with my current car I have had since 2012. It's highly inconvenient for my family now (no kids), and I want to get a newer used car that I have found and would love to purchase it.

Here's some numbers.

14 day Pay off Amt from Bank A: $5500

New Used Car price: $8,475

Current car trade in value: $3,500

Cash Down payment: $500

The problem is i do not want to be associated with Bank A anymore and I only want to conduct business with Bank B. However, Bank B does not finance negative equity. The reason I am upset with Bank A is because They have screwed me over multiple times all with this current loan with a car I now loathe. My interest rate (for a first time buyer) was 14.99% which is excessive but doable. When I first signed with the loan with them, they told me that in one year with on-time payments, they can refinance me for a much lower interest rate. I thought it was a solid deal and took it. A year later, they told me they do not refinance their own loans, despite them telling me they do. so I kept on making on-time payments until 2015 where I just could not physically keep making their high payments (at that time). So they refinanced me after a hassle but they gave me 16.29% interest rate. But i just needed lower payments to save me.

Now that i am well-off to get a better car with a slightly higher monthly payment (if all goes well), I want to get a certain car much newer than my current car at a good price. But of course with the previous issue, I must ask, is it worth getting another loan with the same bank that continuously screws me over? Since Bank B just told me they do not finance negative equity, how do i go about getting this car that i really want? 
Will be updating info and answering questions if more info is needed, thank you PF.

Tl;dr: Want new car, don't like Bank A, want to switch current loan to Bank B to get new used car loan under Bank B.",finance,1461892914

personalfinance,Picking the correct mortgage for buying a new home,"I currently own a home and am looking to buy a new home (work move related) and sell my current home.

I have two mortgage options from two different banks and am having trouble grasping which one is better for me.

**Option 1:**

Jumbo loan with 15% down and no PMI. 

*Benefits:*

* 1 loan

* No PMI

*Downfall:*

* I would need to take a loan out against my 401k to get to 15% (which I would pay back right away after my current house sells, no early termination fee).

* Even with the 401k loan cash would be pretty tight for a few months, which scares me when thinking about possible moving costs that might come up.

**Option 2:**

2 loans to cover the cost of the new house with a total of 10% down. The first loan would be as high as possible without requiring a jumbo loan. The second loan would be an interest only loan and would cover the remainder of the house price.

I would use the proceeds from selling my current house to pay on the 2nd loan right away, but there would still be a fairly substantial amount left. I could aggressively pay the remainder off in 5-6 years, but more realistically 9-12 years.

*Benefits:*

* Only 10% down so I wouldn't have to take a loan against my 401k, and cash wouldn't be tight for those few months like with Option 1.

*Downfall:*

* 2nd loan has an adjustable rate (based off Prime Rate), and I can only assume rates will go up (especially over the range I would pay it back).

* 2nd loan obviously has a higher interest rate

Both options seem to have their positives and negatives. Any help understanding how to figure out what the right option for me would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"Tip: Refinance your mortgage when interest rates drop, but keep paying the same monthly payment.","**Edit: THIS DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SAVINGS FROM TAX DEDUCTIONS, OR GROWTH FROM INVESTING THE MONEY YOU SAVE. IGNORE THE EXAMPLES IN THIS POST. I'LL POST SEPARATELY WHEN I FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT.**


If the interest rates drop, then you might think that refinancing your mortgage will save you money, right? Well, not always! You do pay a lower interest rate, **but you pay it for longer** if you just pay the new required monthly payments. In some cases, you might end up **paying more in interest**, not counting extra fees. However, if you refinance and then keep paying the same amount each month, then you'll certainly save a lot on interest.

I just refinanced my current mortgage. If I pay the new minimum payment, I save about $3,835.05 over 15 years which barely covers the fees. If I keep paying my old monthly payment (with the new lower interest rate), I will pay off the loan sooner and save $14,758.96.

Here's a concrete example using actual 15 year mortgage rates from [here](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms15.htm).

* Five years ago (March, 2011) you take a 15 year loan for $100,000 with an interest rate of 4.08%. Your monthly payments are $743.70 per month. You will pay off your loan in 2026, and pay a grand total of $33,866.60 in interest.

* Today (March, 2016), you have $73,180.58 remaining to repay. The interest rates have dropped to 2.97%, so you refinance the balance into a new 15 year mortgage. Your required monthly payments are now $504.32. Your loan will now be paid off in 2031, and you pay a grand total of $35,399.15 in interest (you've already paid $17,802.77 in interest to your old mortgage, and you pay $17,596.38 in interest to the new mortgage over the course of 15 years). **This is $1,532.55 more in interest alone than what you would have paid if you hadn't refinanced.** Of course, your new monthly payment is $239.39 *lower*, so decide if this convenience is worth it to pay $1,532.55 (plus finance charges) in the long run.

* If instead you refinance at the new lower rate, and keep paying $743.70 per month (instead of the required $504.32), then you will pay off your loan in 9 years and 5 months (Aug 2025). You pay a grand total of $28,593.55 in interest which is a net **savings** of $5,273.05 over the course of the loan. (Plus, if you ever fall on hard times you can pay the lower $504.32 monthly payment and have $239.39 to spare every month.)

personalfinance,Credit Score and Refinancing Vehicle,"So a little back ground,  I bought my first car roughly 2 years ago and when my credit was checked I was at around 750. Primarily I established this with 2 cc's and renting a house through college. I bought the car and because I was a first time buyer I got a 5.99% interest rate on the financing.  I am now looking to refinance.  I did an online refinance calculation with Bank of America and they offered to refinance me at a 3.77 interest rate.  While this is better (i'd like to be below 3%), the thing that bothered me is that they ran my credit and I am now at 682.  

I have NEVER missed a car payment, a credit card payment nor have any large debt.  The only thing I can think of is during my move I had some hospital bills I was unaware of that went to a bill collector.  Once I found out I took care of the bill with one of my credit cards (only 1,000 dollar) and have the amount still on my cc.  I use this cc almost as a debit card, use it to purchase then make much more than the minimum payment each month, but for the better part of a year I have had a base amount of 1,000 dollars owed on it.   

I recently opened an amazon credit card ( a few months ago) and essentially use it as a debit card, at time I may have 100$ debt on it.

As of now I live with my father so have no rent, I have 3 credit cards, and my car payment.

Here's my one year update for ya'll! Please see my original post for budget and loan details.      
      

I'm excited to say I'll be making the final payment on the private student loan (Navient) with the highest interest rate TODAY! **I DON'T HAVE THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE MY EXCITEMENT** In fact, I'm so close to crying (happy tears!) while writing this...     



The principal amount in 2008 was $7,350.00. At 8.5 interest it ballooned to just under $9000 last year (despite having made payments since 2012). At the recommendation of you fine Redditors, I started the avalanche method to all my private loans last year. This method allowed me to make more than double the minimum payment on the Navient loan. The last three months I've put more than 4x the payment towards it plus my tax refund. Literally--every penny I could! And with the help of my super-super supportive partner, we're paying it off entirely TODAY!!! 



Additionally, my partner and I decided to move out of our expensive apartment and move in with SO's parents to REALLY tackle my private student loan debt. Our goal is to pay off the remainder of my private loans in the next two years, which will be roughly $60k. It's a lofty goal, but we're motivated!! We will essentially live off one income and the other income will be applied to the private loans. Our first focus will be the Chase loan at $35k with an 8.25% interest rate. My parents have also offered to help which will hopefully speed up that two years :)     



Thank you SO MUCH r/personalfinance for your guidance and support. Despite the amount of debt, I truly feel IN CONTROL. I also think it's important to emphasize that I'm not doing this alone. Without my partner I would not be able to make this much progress. I am very aware that my situation is not the norm and know that many out there are not as lucky.

I sent a monthly payment to MMI and they distributed payments (on time) to all of my creditors. I kept this up, on time, no late payments, no problems until I finally paid the last accounts off in May of 2015. As part of the agreement, accounts were closed and my credit took a big hit (originally, when the debt plan was set up not when the accounts were paid in full).

When all accounts had been paid, I requested ""zero balance"" letters from Money Management to confirm that all debts had been paid in full. I think I was supposed to use these somehow to get the accounts' status changed from ""Adverse."" I don't think I sent these, but I do remember calling the different companies and some of them assured me that the status would change after the next cycle.

personalfinance,"How should I manage my monthly finances? Enormous debt ($275K), but healthy income ($250K/yr)","Title states the situation -- My wife and I have a combined $275K in student debt (no other debt) from 13 years of total school (both did a masters). Fortunately, I just graduated and our combined income will be $250K. **Here's my ask: Critique by monthly financial plan. Are there considerations I'm not thinking through?**

First, some background information:

* Weighted average interest on student loans is 5.7%. Small range (5-6%). 60% private, 40% federal. I believe I can refinance most of my loans and get an average weighted rate of 4.5%. That's the assumption I'm using for my plan, though I don't think that changes my plan.
* ~$13,000 in take home pay after taxes/deductions. Expected to grow ~10% per year (both are in stable professions)
* $5,500/mo in expenses. We live in one of the most expensive cities in the US. We live nicely, but definitely nothing extravagant. Over the last year, we've been able to stick to this budget. We feel comfortable with what we're spending each month, so don't want the discussion to be around reducing expenses. 
* $80K in retirement accts, $5K in investment accounts, $20K in emergency fund
* My personal disposition/goals: I'm irrational about debt. My natural inclination is to put every penny we have towards it (even empty out our retirement accounts to pay it off). However, I'm optimizing around building long-term wealth, and I know putting every cent towards the debt isn’t the way to go.

**So, how should I manage the $7,500 in disposable income remaining? Here are my thoughts, let me know yours**

* **1. Pay $3,000/mo for loan minimums.** Not sure what the actual amount will be since the loan payments haven’t started yet, but this is probably ballpark. 
* **2. Pay $900/mo in 401k contributions to get company matches.** Our companies match up to 6%. The actual contribution will be higher, but since 401k is pre-tax, our take home pay will be reduced by $900. 
* **2a. Put remaining $3,600/mo into emergency fund, until it goes from $20k to $30k.** This is 3.5 months of expenses + minimum loan payments. **Placing money into emergency fund will be only for 3 months, which is how long it’ll take us to put in the extra $10k.**

Then, after the emergency fund is fully funded, and we have $3,600/mo remaining:

* **3. Put $900/mo in Roth IRA (via backdoor approach) to get to $11K combined cap.**
* **4. Place $1,500/mo aside in high yield savings account for investment opportunities.** Many in my network are savvy (and wealthy) investors who would be willing to let me invest with them, even with relatively small amounts (say $20K). The question of course, is if I believe they can beat a 5% return (Rate on my loans). I’m comfortable betting that they can, but not sure if I want to invest more than $1,500/mo given our high debt balance
* **5. Use remaining $1,200/mo to pay down highest interest student loan**

personalfinance,Seeking advice on how to approach upcoming student loans (unsubsidized stafford),"Seeking recommendation for student loans.

Hi everyone,

- I am seeking your recommendations for student loans.

For example, does anyone recommend an online student loan calculator? Doe someone know of a good spreadsheet that is set up for modeling loan repayment?

Does anyone recommend any online resources for learning about student loans besides the federal government's site (i.e. cliff notes? a good guide written by someone who has been through the process recently? I've never taken any on before.)




- The basic course/semesterly structure:

I'll be attending a university for 10 graduate classes and a community college for 4 undergraduate classes.

The cost of the 10 graduate courses will be $12,500.  
The cost of the undergraduate classes will be about $2,500.

Total costs of courses: $14,900 (let's round up to $15,000)

My course plan is something like this:


Summer 2016:		1 grad course  ($1250)	= $1250

Fall 2016: 			1 grad course  ($1250)	= $1250

Spring 2017: 		3 grad courses ($3750) + 1 undergrad course ($600)	= $4350


Summer 2017: Full time internship, no classes


Fall 2017: 			3 grad courses ($3750) + 1 undergrad course ($600)	= $4350

Spring 2018: 		2 grad courses ($2500) + 2 undergrad courses ($1200) = $3700



- The costs:

First half (before internship)

Courses: Summer 2016 - Spring 2017: $6850

Rent $600/mo: July 2016 - May 2017 = 11 months: $6600

Food $300/mo: $3300

Gas $150/mo: $1650

= $18400


Second half (after internship)

Courses: Fall 2017 - Spring 2018: $8050

Rent $600/mo: June 2017 - May 2018 = 12 months: $7200

Food $300/mo: $3600

Gas $150/mo: $1800

= $20050


All costs:
$38450


- The loans:

I would be going with an unsubsidized stafford loan.  Looks like I will need to take out the maximum allowable of $20,000 per year.  The interest rate is 6.8%

Does anyone know if loan deferment is a possibility? 

I thought it read it was not, for unsubsidized (graduate) stafford loans.


How often does such a loan compound?

Any advice for taking on the loan, or paying them off?

* In conjunction - good security/communication if an account is compromised.
* A good **Android** app/website, with mobile deposit.
* A good number of branches and no ATM fee (I have access to a good number of no-fee ATMs but want to avoid bank fees)
* Compatibility with Android Pay is a huge bonus - I have my credit card linked to it but prefer to use it as little as possible.

personalfinance,Refinancing only unsubsidized stafford loans,"Hi PF,

I have 4 separate student loans (through mygreatlakes, in case this makes a difference). Two are subsidized stafford loans and two are unsubsidized. I'm currently enrolled in a Ph.D. program, so my status is payment deferred, however, I have a very good paying job and am starting to make payments. I will probably be in school for 1 more year, maybe 2.

I am considering refinancing my loans, but since half of my loans (comprising about 1/3rd of the loan balance) are subsidized, and therefore not accruing any interest while I am still in school, I don't want to refinance that portion. My question is, is it possible to refinance only the unsubsidized portion of my loans? My current interest rate is 6.55% and I think I can get somewhere between 3.5-4%, so it would be a very nice reduction, but I don't think it would be enough to offset the interest that will accrue to my subsidized loans, if I were forced to refinance those as well. Can this be done?

personalfinance,21 years old and graduating in a week with excessive student debt. Need advice.,"Hi Reddit!  So, after a mental breakdown and at the request of my boyfriend, I’ve decided to make this post seeking advice on how to approach repaying my student loan debt.  I’m 21 and will be graduating in one week (YAY!)  While I’m beyond excited to be graduating, I recently completed my exit loan counseling and didn’t realize the severity of my situation.  

Although my school gives enormous amounts of scholarships and financial aid to its students, tuition has increased 5% each year while I’ve been enrolled.  Transferring schools was never an option for me.  In order to subsidize the cost of what wasn’t covered by scholarship/financial aid, my only option was to take out 3 private loans from Sallie Mae.  When initially taking out my first loan 3 years ago I was assured that I would have *SO* many options in order to make my debt more manageable, including income-based repayments.  However, after speaking with a Sallie Mae representative today in order to figure out where I stand with my loans, I’ve discovered that this is not an option, and there are essentially no options for consolidating my 3 loans – so managing my debt will not be as promised.  My 3 loans are as follows: 8.5% at $9,765, 9.25% at 19,932, and 11.75% at 15,090.  The representative said that I will be making monthly payments of ~$740 per month.
    
In addition to these private loans, my school also calculates federal government loans into our tuition.  Because of this I have $2,500 in Perkins loans at 5%, $13,500 in subsidized loans at 4.29%, and $19,000 in subsidized loans at 4.29%.  However, I’m not as concerned with these loans because I have income-based repayment and consolidation options, as well as the potential of loan-forgiveness by working in a public hospital.  
   
After graduating I'll have a job for a year before applying to grad school, and I’ll make $12 per hour averaging about $24,000 per year.  This boils down to $1,920 per month, (not including taxes), for me to split between rent, gas, and food in addition to my loans.  I’m at a loss as to what to do because I wasn’t expecting these ludicrous payments, or lack of options to help make the payments more manageable.  Does anyone know what my best options would be?  Is there a company that I should consolidate my private loans through?  How do I even start tackling this issue when my loan provider isn’t providing feasible options?  Graduation isn’t even exciting now because of this situation.  **ANY** help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1461960707

personalfinance,$130k in student loan debt after college. Should I consider refinancing?,"After graduating about a year and a half ago, I started paying as much as I could into my highest interest loan (10%!) until my grace period ended.

My loan company was Sallie Mae and I feel like I got royally screwed with these interest rates. The highest is 10% but there are a couple more that are around 9%. It feels like I'm going to be paying on this forever if I keep down this path.

I have good credit for being so young and right out of college, so I started researching refinancing. My reservation is that I won't be accepted for such a big loan.

Is there maybe another path that I should consider? Any advice would be much appreciated.",finance,1461967267
personalfinance,Taxes on catering AND tips.,"Hello /r/personalfinance 


I am a waiter for a restaurant which also does caterings on the side occasionally. Normally, we tip-share 50/50 because we only have two wait staff (it's a small restaurant) and we tip 1% sales to dishwasher. As such, we split the claimed tips. Without a catering, I rarely see a check that isn't voided. 


However, recently, my co-server quit and we have had some caterings this bi-weekly pay period. Since my server quit, I receive all the tips **however** I also claim **all of the tips**.


This means i'm suuuuper not getting a check, right? Well here's the thing...


Caterings also get put into the same bi-weekly pay period as my tip deductions. This means that I recieve some taxes on my caterings as well and the tips cut in to the caterings.


Firstly, **Is this the way it is by law?** This is my first job as a waiter and I enjoy it a lot but my boss tends to be very vague when it comes to economics and payments. So I am unsure if anyone else has experience with this type of set-up, but do tips really cut in to your catering payments?


Here's an example of my financial setup currently at this job.


Let's say I make **$2,000** in tips for the bi-weekly pay period.

My hourly rate of **$2.13 for 50 hours** of service is **$106.50**

Additionally, I get a second rate of $10 an hour for staying past my shift's scheduled time. Let's say I get **10 extra hours in at rate 2 for $100** even.


Lastly, I receive **$400** in catering payments.


In total I have **$2,606.50** listed as my gross pay for the bi-weekly period.

When my check comes:

- The **$2,000** dollars is non-applicable to my check, as I have already received it.
- This leaves **$606.50** to be taxed and paid out to me.
- In the end, I am taxed FICA, medicare **and federal**
- Therefore, I should owe over **$650** alone simply from federal tax of 25% over **$2,606.50**
- My check is now **VOID**


NOTE: These are not actual numbers, but fairly close to what I am putting in. 



Is this correct? I've been discussing it with other waiters but it's a very rare scenario because not a lot of waiters are also caterers and vice versa.


I talked to my boss about this once and she said I would get it back at the end of the year after I file. Is that true? Or am I being played?

personalfinance,My debit card number was stolen and I have a couple questions.,"I got a call this afternoon that I first thought was a scam, but unfortunately, it wasn't. The individual on the line was calling from my bank to let me know that were were some suspicious things going on with my debit card (he didn't use that exact language). To tell you the truth, I was pretty shocked so I remember some things that he said but some of it just blew right by me. He asked me about a few of the charges and none of them were mine, except for one of them.

So, I didn't decide to be smart and just stop using my debit card until January. The last time I actually swiped my debit card at a merchant was in January at Chipotle. Since then, I've been using that checking account to pay off my small credit card bill each month, and I also have it connected to my Apple iTunes account. So when I purchase a song, it comes directly out of my checking account.

1. The guy on the phone said that all of the charges had been declined when the person tried to make them. However, these purchases are still showing in my pending transactions. Did I misunderstand him, or are these just going to take a few days to fall off my pending transactions list and go away?

2. My only reasonable guess as to how this happened is from a little over a month ago when I visited an ATM. You think you're safe cause you're in a really nice part of town, but why WOULDN'T somebody go put a skimmer in the nice part of town where the people using this ATM probably have money? (Poor criminal didn't realize I'm not of the caliber of the others around here.) Anyway, I totally goofed and accidentally put my credit card into the ATM when I meant to put my debit card in. So then I put my debit card in and now, my debit card is the one compromised. I'm guessing I should be majorly keeping an eye on my credit card now. This is freaking me out a little bit because I have to go out of town this week and if that credit card needs to be cancelled as well, I will only have one credit card to use. If anything happens to that one, well... I don't know how I'm going to be able to buy gas and get home. This isn't really a question, but I just wanted to express my fears.

3. Are there any additional steps I need to take at this point? Never use my debit card again (which I wasn't going to anyway since I stopped using it in January, but now I'm definitely going to never use it) and be careful at ATMs. What about my PIN?

But now I don't owe anything to a bank, thanks to my boyfriend.  So this is my situation now, and I am wondering if it's a problem in any way for my credit score to have this much credit available?

* $10,000 limit on credit card #2

* $22,000 limit on LOC #1 

* $10,500 limit on LOC #2 (the one I just opened)

Everything has a zero balance.  Barring the unforeseen, I won't get into bad debt again.  I'm just wondering if all these accounts will negatively impact my credit, and should I be closing down some of these?  Thank you.",finance,1461997342
personalfinance,"NSLS contacted me about potentially changing my loans to Income based repayment, need advice please!","National Student Loan Solutions have contacted me about trying to help me get into income based repayment, as I've been paying my loans off for years and I'm not getting anywhere. I'm nervous though, because when I went through all this loan stuff in the first place at age 18-21 it was way over my head and I don't want to make poor choices again.

I was never adept at finance, and between student loans and lack of credit card knowledge I hurt myself and I'm trying to pick up the pieces years later. (about 8k in CC debt that I pay -300ish- monthly on top of regular bills and student loans)

My current Navient ( sallie mae) balance: 

[Loanchart](http://imgur.com/jUrKahX)

I also have a direct Department of Education loan at about 7-9,000.  I've been paying on these since about 2008 ish, give or take a semester. they originally sat somewhere around 70-80,000. My interest rates range from 3.5% to 6.8% for each loan. I currently pay about $630/mo.

I work in fine dining as a server, which is clearly not what I went to school for. I'm in no way ungrateful for my job, but I'm in a position now where I'm stuck because leaving for a job I want with lower income isn't an option due to bills and student loans, yet I'm doing incredible stress damage to my shoulder and heel that isn't healing due to continuous use. 

They gave me a rough outline of Income Based Repayment, going off my gross income, loan status and a plan of 300 months (this seems like a lot to me, but if I can pay extra on it that doesn't bother me so much).  The rough figures were that I'd be paying 91.95 a month, which would be an incredibly helpful thing to get me on track to paying off other things and building a savings account for emergencies.  They will be contacting me again soon for confirmed numbers of things like my gross income, paycheck stubs, and giving me information from there.

Does anyone have any advice on situations like this? Do I worry more about keeping my low interest rates and just push through the high payments, or is this new student debt program worth pursuing?

TL;DR : I'm looking for advice on keeping my loans as they are or changing to income based repayment through newer forgiveness programs from National Student Loan Solutions.",finance,1461999952

politics,"If national food policy isn't guided by science, but by federal cronies and entrenched special interests and it is causing harm, who should be held accountable?","Ever since 1933, every five to seven years the US Congress passes a set of legislative acts commonly referred to as ""the Farm Bill,"" which includes agricultural subsidies to growers of certain types of food.

These subsidies are in large part responsible for promoting and worsening the US obesity epidemic—a fact highlighted in a 2013 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.1 According to the authors, the root of the problem is that:

""Government-issued payments have skewed agricultural markets toward the overproduction of commodities that are the basic ingredients of processed, energy-dense foods.""

This includes corn, soybeans, wheat and rice, which are the top four most heavily subsidized foods.

By subsidizing these, particularly corn and soy, the people in the US government are actively supporting a diet that consists of these processed grains, namely high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), soybean oil, and grain-fed cattle – all of which are now well-known contributors to obesity and chronic disease.

The Farm Bill essentially creates a negative feedback loop that perpetuates the highly profitable but health-harming processed food diet that the United States has become infamous for.

The people in the US government are actively promoting obesity and chronic disease through these subsidies, while simultaneously creating flawed and ineffective anti-obesity campaigns and programs to combat the very problems rooted in its agricultural policies!

Who will be held accountable for the immeasurable economic harm and countless deaths caused by these flawed policies?",technology,1462015794
personalfinance,I need help in choosing between mortgage financing options.,"*Context:*

*Joint monthly income after tax is around 3000EUR*

*Loan takeout is 120k*

*We aim to pay it off in less than 12 years.*


The options are;

* offset account at **3.5%**

OR

* classic loan at **2%** first year and **3.1%** variable thereafter


I ran the numbers on my spreadsheets multiple times and the difference between them after 10 years is about 3k.

That is the offset account with higher interest rate costs 3k more after 10 years and that would be the cost of flexibility and availability of withdrawing your extra payments.

Then again I assumed equal payments on both options when on the offset account it is likely that you can have money in your current account going towards repayment.",finance,1462017171

I just looked at my ""payment summary,"" and only $22.15 of the minimum $846.73 went to the principal.  It makes me feel like the biggest turd in the world and I have no idea how it can possibly get better.  


I'm on a mix of standard and graduated repayment plans.  In 2020ish I'm going to be paying $2400 a month, which seems impossible.

* Emergency Savings: $200 (Have just over $1000)

* Transport: $75ish (I spend $20 on a ""cycle to work"" scheme, the rest is going in and out of the city, buses on rainy days)

* Food and socializing: $300 (make own lunch at work, don't buy coffee, etc)

* Long distance relationship: $150 (London to Cork flights monthly-- non-negotiable)

ethereum,Ethereum vs. Rootstock- the future,"Let's imagine a year from now - rootstock in some form is now fully functional running smart contracts on its ethereum fork.  What will happen? 

1) Anyone who owns bitcoin and wants to interact with a DAPP will have to send their bitcoin to a bitcoin address (regular smart contract (BTC relay) with ethereum vs federated trust deposit for rootstock) and then wait for the pegged coins to be active on ethereum or rootstock.  Basically, its the same process. Not easier to use bitcoin on Rootstock vs Ethereum.  

2) The question is where are the best DAPPs going to be.  Ethereum is already way out ahead in this regard with a much stronger network effect.  What incentive will there be to port their DAPPs over to rootstock when it it is not any easier for bitcoin holders to interact with them there? 

3) If POS is successful, the speed and scalability will far surpass rootstock.  Developers will have no incentive to develop new DAPPS for rootstock.

When I did my taxes this year I was told adding to my traditional 401k would reduce the amount I owe at the end of the year.

personalfinance,"Help me understand my student loans please! (PAYE - unsubsidized loans), does it capitalize the interest??","hi everyone, I have tried to wrap my head around this by searching online through so many resources but I am still confused. Here's my situation. 

I'm currently under a Pay-As-You-Earn repayment plan. My loans are as follows: 

Federal Subsidized 
Original Balance: $25,905
Unpaid Interest: $114
Current Balance: $25,878
Interest: 6% 


Federal Unsubsidized
Original Balance: $107,290
Unpaid Interest: $4,743
Current Balance: $107,290
Interest: 6%

My monthly payments on those are $4 and $17 respectively which doesn't even touch the interest being generated. 

I read in multiple places that subsidized loans under PAYE get unpaid interest paid basically thrown out. 

I cannot find any information on what happens to the unpaid interest for the UNsubsidized loan. Does anyone know if this is being capitalized on to the prinicple? The fact that my ""current balance"" is still the same as the original loan makes me hopeful that it is not. 

What I do know is that the unpaid interest WILL be capitalized in the event that I change payment plan or something else financially significant happens. Assuming that I cannot currently afford to make payments to affect the principle, should I still be trying to make payments that at least cover the interest? My thinking is that if the interest is only being charged on the ""current balance"", then I can put away the money I'd be paying towards the interest and then pay it all at once. That way I would have gained around 1% by having the money sit in a CD or savings account....",finance,1462036054

personalfinance,19yo Kicked out of parents house seeking advice,"Hey Pf,

Want to preface by saying I'm a big fan of the sub... been reading posts for the past year or so. Short background on me... was kicked out of my parent's house a year ago, and with no direction / savings / knowledge of finance, panicked and took out a large loan to go to state school (private and federal).  I dropped out of school this past spring semester for a number of reasons, and would love any advice you guys could give me moving forward.

Right now, my plan is to enroll again in nursing school (2 year associates program, then work as I get my BSN) in fall 2017. I plan on taking a couple of short certificate programs (800 dollars all in all) in the next 6 months in order to land a night job that would pay a salary of 25k a year plus pay my full tuition for nursing school. I would be able to work full time (3 nights a week, 36 hours) while not interfering with my school schedule. 

Current situation:

* Monthly Take Home Pay: 1400-1800 dollars (depends on how many hours i can pick up per week)
* Savings: 700
* Debts: 4500 at 5%, 13700 at 12%, 1400 to my former university

My rent is paid through July, and my lease for my new apartment begins Aug 1. Living at home / with relatives isn't an option. I own a car worth about 2000, but am not going to be using it, as i live in the city and take the bus. Don't want to sell it just yet. My grace period for my loans ends in August, and i will then have to begin making payments (minimum comes out to about 275 i think). My Total expenses beginning in August are as follows:

* Rent plus utilities: 650
* Groceries: 100
* Student Loan Payments: 275
* Insurance: 20
* Phone: 60
* Total: 1200 (rounded up for unexpected expenses)

I plan on building my current emergency fund of 700 up to 2000 over the next three months, as well as save 800 dollars for my certificate programs I'm looking to take. My current take home pay of 1400-1800 will leave me 200-600 dollars after my expenses come august. Things will be pretty tight.

I'd just like your guys' thoughts, opinions, suggestions, etc. I'd love some advice on building credit, as I have no credit history besides my two loan accounts and have no idea how to get started. Becoming an authorized user on anothers' card or getting a cosigner isn't an option. I don't know what type of accounts to put my money in (Besides my standard savings and checking account at PNC).

personalfinance,"Plan to eliminate short term debt and moving forward past that - looking for advice, validation, suggestions.","Overview - the wife and I are doing relatively well financially and we have managed to rack up a decent amount of debt (mainly car loans).  I have been putting a plan together to eliminate the worst of it this year, as we would like to build our forever home in in 2019 and then save for the child(ren)'s college.  We both come from poverty level families and have not had a lot of experience handling a decent amount of money and dealing with debt.  Several months ago I started reading personalfianance postings and finally decided to cut down on monthly expenses and killing debt to build the future my wife and I want.  

Phase one:
Our combined gross income is roughly $212K a year.  We're both salary and the potential for any significant income boost is fairly low.  I do get a yearly bonus in late summer and expect that to be about $3000 after tax.  She can occasionally pick up overtime but would rather not.  We do not have any other incomes (Dividends, interest, etc).  I'm not calculating tax refunds in here - as long as we don't have to pay in, I can live with that.

We have $800 a month in car debt (I know its ugly) and one car we own outright - 2012 VW passat, which we paid off earlier this year (big win!).  The vehicles are relatively new with low miles and we do not plan on another purchase for at least 5 years:  2011 Kia sportage - 90K miles, 2011 F150 40K miles, 2012 VW passat - 48K miles.  The wife does get a company car for her job so MOST of our vehicles do not get driven much, the Kia is my daily driver.  I know that seems like a lot of cars - I need a daily driver, we need a truck for our lifestyle (hauling ATV's, hunting, home improvement projects, snow travel, etc).  The wife's company provided car could be gone at any time - she is a floating pharmacist and if she takes a permanent position she'll be driving the VW, so we need that as backup).

We do not have credit card debt but the wife does have roughly $10K in a personal loan - unsure of the interest rate (fallout of from the cabin we build and finished last year - if there's questions about that we invested roughly $115K and have roughly $250K in equity - long story).

NOTE:  I see our biggest liabilities as the cars - depreciating assets, with the personal loan as our second biggest liability.

I have roughly $15K in student loan debt and pay $180 a month for that.  She has graduate loans (pharmacy graduate school) that are roughly $250K and run her about $1800 a month for payments.  We have considered refinancing with a private bank but not taken action on it yet (suggestions? - I personally think she should stay with her current government loans, not sure of the interest rate, maybe 6%?)

We are contributing to our retirements - I am at 6% with a 3% match - so roughly 10% of my gross going to my 401K.  She is at roughly 6% with a profit sharing plan (do not know how much that payout will be, once a year usually August).  For the time being I think we're sitting pretty good there (maybe?).

We have roughly $9K in a savings account right now - had $25K earlier this year but paid off the VW and spent some on fallout from the cabin build.

We have a our primary residence mortgage that runs $1500 a month right now and are in good standing with the bank.  We also have a mortgage on our cabin with runs about $550 a month.

So, with all that being said, we are putting $2400 a month towards the low interest (1.9%) Kia loan and plan to have that paid off in June.  We're going to reallocate that $2400 (plus the normal $500 truck payment) in July towards the last car loan (truck, roughly $18K by July left on it, roughly 4.9% interest) and with our extra July paychecks (bi-weekly pay for both of us) and my bonus we plan to pay the truck off by October 2016.  Finally, we plan to pay off her personal loan by December - reallocate the $2900 monthly car payments (plus $285 normal personal loan payments) to that loan and use the extra December paychecks to clear that up.  Once that is done we're going to dump any extra in savings.  I'm hoping this will be in the neighborhood of $5K - we should have between $12-15K in savings that will be the emergency fund until a later date.

NOTE:  I know we're not tackling the highest interest rate debt first but given I think we could have it cleared up by the end of the year, I don't think (not sure) it makes that much of a difference. 

After cars and personal loan are paid off:
Combined net income monthly - $10,000 
Subtracting out known debts:  $10,000 - $180 (my student loan) - $1800 (her student loan) - $1500 (mortgage) - $500 (cabin mortgage) - $300 (her life insurance) = $5700 (roughly)
There a lot of other monthly expenses we have but those fluctuate - driving gas money, heating propane, food, child care, etc. and come out of the left over $5700.

We plan to move $2900 a month into savings over the course of 2017 and 2018 - this works out to roughly $69000 + $20000 (extra paychecks) + $6000 (my bonuses) = $95000 (roughly).  We are planning on using this towards the down payment for building a house in Phase two.

* NOTE: my wife is putting $200 a month into a savings account for our first child's college fund - I am against this at the moment, we do need some extra living money and should be able to save a lot MORE at a later date.

Phase two:
I'm planning on leaving the student loan debt alone (obviously making monthly payments) for the time being and start saving in Jan 2017 to build in spring 2019 - as mentioned above.  I'm thinking we'll have roughly $80K by mid 2018 and can start talking to contractors at that point (will have roughly $130K when the loan starts and construction time begins, assuming continued monthly savings contributions from mid-2018 to spring 2019).  The reason I say $80K is that is minimum for a 20% deposit on a $400K mortgage loan.  I would like to actually spend less than that but that's about our max.  If possible, I'd like to put $100K down to bring the overall loan amount (and payment) down on the construction loan (not sure if one-time or two-time closing is the best - advice?).  Also, I do not know if the $100K should be paid out up-front or at the final closing time (advice?).  As of right now, we have the land promised to us (nothing on paper yet) that will give us about $250K to $300K in equity and a build site.  Also, we're going to use the 20% down to avoid a PMI (never doing THAT again).

We are planning on selling our current house in the spring of 2019 (again, assuming the market doesn't get all screwy).  I would like to see $20-30K out of our current house - similar houses in our neighborhood are fetching that much - I am calculating what we owe now vs. what will be left of the mortgage in 3 years against current house values.  This money would then become our ""emergency fund"" - 2-3 month of bills if one of us can't work.  After that, we have the potential to live with the in-laws during construction - the land we want to build on is her mother's family farm.  If this is not do-able we'll rent for roughly what our current mortgage cost is - if we live with them, the $1500 a month will be allocated to savings, otherwise that's our rent money - so a wash on that part of the income.

NOTE:  at this time, I do not think we should refinance our current mortgage, we're at 5.375% on the current mortgage and have been paying for 8 years on a 30 year loan - if we plan on moving in 3 years, I don't think it makes sense to refinance (maybe I'm wrong).

Phase three:
I'm thinking a new mortgage will be at roughly 3.75% (assuming the market doesn't get all wonky) and taking a 20 year (the interest paid appears to be MUCH lower than a 30 year) - in running preliminary numbers the payments would be $600-$700 more than we're paying now, which we could afford (will only have student loan debt and cabin mortgage at that time - assuming our current house is sold and that mortgage is gone).  Another reason I want a 20 year is because the wife and I are both mid-30's now and do not want a mortgage past our late 50's.

NOTE:  we could probably qualify for a much larger loan but I'm not willing to take a $3K-4K a month mortgage payment - we're going to do something that's affordable and relatively low risk. 

If we can swing that, after construction is complete I think we can put roughly $2000 a month into savings for the offspring's college fund.  I'm thinking $60K for each child (only have one now but planning on more) to goto college.  Once we have that in place, we can keep saving and start different investments to make our money generate more revenue for retirement.

NOTE:  about the above mentioned cabin - we secured a 0 down loan and handled the general contractor role ourselves with my in-laws (carpenters by trade) performing the construction, so we didn't pay labor costs for the most part.  We did start with bare ground and had to handle everything - well, septic, excavation, concrete work, etc - ourselves.  It is a 30 year mortgage but at $550 a month, it equates to a medium sized car payment - maybe have enough to pay it off early, before age 50.  I do not see this debt going anywhere in the near future.  We did learn A LOT about the construction process and do not wish to act as the GC again - long story short, we've been though a major construction project but were not in a position of power financially (which I'm hoping to be for the next project). 

I know that is quite a long winded post but I wanted to get everything on the table.  

Is this a sound course of action?

As for INCOME

1. 2016-2017 clerkship - ~$50,000 / year
Expenses are MINIMAL, living at home (no rent), car paid off, only have to pay gas and some food each month

2. 2017-2018 clerkship 2 - ~$65,000 / year 
Expenses would also be minimal, still living at home. This is a job I am interviewing for, I'd say 50/50 chance of getting it.

3. Following clerkship, returning to biglaw as a 2nd or 3rd year associate. Salary (NYC) would be $170,000 - $180,000 PLUS a clerkship signing bonus of $50,000 (1 year clerkship) or $70,000 (2 year clerkship). I intend on putting 100% of the signing bonus towards these loans. 

4. In addition, I have about $1,500 in passive income each month (this is a 12-month average figure, I expect starting August 2016 the number to be $2,000 / month dividend income).

personalfinance,The true cost of a mortgage refinance,"Hi All,

I was just refinancing my house, and had trouble getting accurate numbers.
It's not a simple ""lower interest rate = better deal"". Or even ""lower monthly payment = better deal"". This is often true, but when you factor in tax deductions, and adjusting cash you save with the inflation rate, it turns out that a lower interest rate (or lower monthly payments) don't always mean you get a better deal.

I tried a few online calculators, but didn't know what exactly they were doing (deducting taxes, etc.) The formulae are pretty simple, and I wrote a quick Python script for myself. Get it [here](https://gitlab.com/gi1242/python-loan) if you want it.

Heres an example:

&gt; In 2010, You take a 15 year loan for $100,000 with a 5% interest rate. In 2015 the rates drop to 4%, and refinancing costs $3000 in fees, which are rolled into the loan. Your monthly payments will drop by $217.11 (from $790.79 to $573.68).

Sound like a better deal?

**Not always!** Here's why:

* Even though your interest rate is lower, you are paying it for longer. Your old loan would be paid off by 2035. Your new loan will take till 2040.

    Ignoring taxes and inflation, you save $2,388.25 per year for the first 10 years (because your monthly payments are lower).
    However between 2035 and 2040 pay $6,310.48 per year to your new loan (and you would have paid nothing to your old loan, since it would have been paid off).
    This works out to you paying $8,367.24 **EXTRA** over the course of the loan!

* But we haven't factored in inflation! Let's do that next. Suppose you bought a nice bicycle with the $2,388.25 you saved in the first year. The next year, because prices rise, your bicycle would cost a little bit more (let's say $2,459.90). Thus to make an accurate count, we need to adjust your savings for inflation. If we assume that inflation is 3% a year, then you only end up paying $1,834.44 EXTRA over the whole course of the loan. So it's still a bad deal.

    If however, you are a reasonably savvy investor decide to invest your $2,388.25 annual savings, and think you might earn a 5% return. Then refinancing is a good deal, and you will end up saving $4,253.18 over the course of the loan!

* Now let's also adjust for taxes. (I couldn't find an online calculator that did this transparently, which is why I wrote my python script.)
  If you itemize deductions, then interest you pay on your mortgage is tax deductible.
  With your new loan, you pay $3,032.17 in interest.
  If you're in the 15% tax bracket, then your federal tax refund will be $454.83 higher.
  With your old loan you would have paid $3,593.97 and your federal refund would have been $539.09 higher.
  Thus you would have $84.26 *less* in tax refunds at the end of the first year  if you refinanced your loan.
  
    Factoring this in (with an inflation rate of 3%) your new loan costs you $970.53 MORE over the course of the loan.
    If you're in a higher tax bracket (or can also deduct it on your state taxes) it adds up. For instance, if your marginal tax rate (for federal and state combined) is 33%, then the new loan ends up **saving** you $76.96 total, over the course of the loan.
    If your tax rate is 33%, and you can get a 5% return on your savings, then the new loan saves you $6,254.57 over the course of the loan, making it a good deal!

Bottom line: There's more to life than lower interest and a lower monthly payment. Double check before you refinance.

personalfinance,Auto loan question,"I have a 2014 Toyota Corolla with $19,500 left on the loan. I bought it new a little less than two years ago. I have probably $4500 in negative equity in it.

It's nice having a newer car, but I really hate having a car payment. I don't struggle to make the payment, but after all bills, rent, etc is paid, I don't have much money left over to save for the future.

Here's what I'm thinking I might do: Pay down the loan to eliminate the negative equity, sell it, then buy a 10yr old Toyota or Honda (super reliable) with around 100,000mi for $5000-6000 and pay cash. I'm pretty mechanical, so I could fix anything minor that might crop up. If I couldn't, I'm sure a mechanic's bill will be a lot less than $375 per month for the next 4 years.

I would use some of my savings, but I would also be able to rebuild it fairly quickly by saving the $375 every month.

Even if I added an extra $100 per month on my payment, it would only shave off a year of payments.

politics,"No, the Clinton e-mail controversy is not a ""nothingburger"".","First off, there hasn't been a single specific development in this entire case that would lead one to believe that it is, in fact, a ""nothingburger"", [as some disingenuously like to suggest.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1epocGurnCo) This post is nothing more than a response to this absolutely absurd claim.

Now, with respect to the confirmed details of the case, none of them on their own necessarily point to this investigation being game over for Clinton. It's wrong to say that any one detail *proves* anything with respect to guilt. There is, however, an undeniable totality here that screams that this investigation is not good for Clinton, and as [another post today](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4h4l82/clintons_fbi_woes_tie_back_to_bill_clinton_and/) has pointed out, potentially several others as well. And here it is:

- The investigation has been going on for about a year. That's a long time any way you cut it, especially for something that isn't supposed to be serious or that could be cleared up easily.

- Hundreds of Clinton's *work* emails were classified. Some to the highest degree.

- [Clinton went to great lengths to delete 30,000 ""personal"" emails:](http://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-says-she-let-lawyers-decide-whether-emails-were-work-or-personal-1443370390)

&gt; Asked on NBC whether it was possible that work-related emails were wrongly deleted from her personal server, she replied that the process was “exhaustive” but that she didn’t personally participate.

&gt; “I didn’t look at them,” she said. “I wanted them to be as clear in their process as possible. I didn’t want to be looking over their shoulder. If they thought it was work-related, it would go to the State Department. If not, then it would not.”

 Not only is 50% of your total emails being personal a very large amount but her reasoning as to why they were personal has been shakey, especially when she says on one hand that they were personal and another, as stated above, that she didn't even look at them in determining which to delete. Despite Clinton's assurance that they were personal, [the FBI saw fit to retrieve them from a source that was unbeknownst to Clinton and her lawyers \(the Datto backup:\)](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article37968711.html)

&gt; Datto and Platte River seemed at odds, however, over how Clinton’s emails wound up on Datto’s cloud storage, **which may have resulted from a misunderstanding.**

&gt; Platte River spokesman Andy Boian said the firm bought a device from Datto that constantly snaps images of a server’s contents and connected it to the Clinton server at a New Jersey data storage facility. Platte River never asked Datto to beam the images to an off-site cloud storage node and never was billed for that service, he said. Company officials were bewildered when they learned of the cloud storage, he said.

&gt; **“We said, ‘You have a cloud? You were told not to have a cloud.’ We never received an invoice for any cloud for the Clintons.’”**

- Clinton has been flat out lying to the public about the scope and purpose of the investigation, [as well as the appropriateness] (http://www.businessinsider.com/jorge-ramos-hillary-clinton-emails-indictment-debate-2016-3) of her email arrangement:

&gt; ""It wasn't the best choice, I made a mistake,"" Clinton said. ""It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed and, as I've said and as now has come out, my predecessors did the same thing and many other people in the government.""

[This assertion has been given weight by the ruling of a judge](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-clinton-idUSKCN0WV2EI) (this link is not about the FBI investigation but it is *directly* related). Not unusual for a political candidate to lie but it's quite blatant and easily refuted:

&gt; The language in Judge Royce Lamberth's order undercut the Democratic presidential contender's assertion she was allowed to set up a private email server in her home for her work as the country's top diplomat and that the arrangement was not particularly unusual.

&gt; He described Clinton's email arrangement as ""extraordinary"" in his order filed on Tuesday in federal district court in Washington.

&gt; Referring to the State Department, Clinton and Clinton's aides, he said there had been ""constantly shifting admissions by the Government and the former government officials.""

Clinton's email setup has literally *never* been done before in government, nor has anyone used private email *exclusively* at such a high level.

- The investigation is criminal in nature. There is no doubt about that. [The FBI does not investigate non-criminal matters aside from doing counterintelligence work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation), which this clearly is not:

&gt; The FBI's main goal is to protect and defend the United States, to uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United States, and to provide leadership and criminal justice services to federal, state, municipal, and international agencies and partners.

This is a year long *criminal* invesigation.

- [Guccifer was extradicted.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-guccifer-idUSKCN0WY5MK)

- [The FBI made a secret filing](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/04/protest-lodged-over-secrecy-in-clinton-email-case-222207) to avoid having to show cause as to why they were denying Jason Leopold's FOIA request with respect to Clinton's ""personal"" emails. The reason cited was that it would jeopradize the ongoing investigation or, as the FBI put it: [“reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.”](http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/breaking-does-this-justice-department-filing-prove-hillary-will-be-indicted/#ixzz47LjCoAg5). Argue that doing this in secret is typical if you'd like but that claim is completely without supporting evidence (as far as I've seen so far).

- [Clinton has not yet been contacted by the FBI](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/04/03/hillary_clinton_fbi_has_not_contacted_me_for_an_interview.html) but [her aides have in relation to giving interviews to investigators.](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/274440-report-fbi-scheduling-email-interviews-with-clinton-aides) This does not speak favourably for Clinton with respect to who the target of the investigation might be.

- The State Department [actively suppressed information](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/04/26/state-dept-held-back-clinton-email-that-would-have-exposed-private-server-group-claims.html) that would have brought the server to light much sooner than it was. As SoS Clinton was the State Department's *boss*.

- Despite what some may argue, the State Department never ""cleared"" Clinton of wrongdoing. [They simply deferred their investigation to the FBI and were in fact told by the FBI specifically not to resume it.](http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/274930-state-dept-puts-hold-on-review-of-clinton-emails-deferring-to-fbi)

- [Clinton never ""asked that her emails be released"":](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-asks-state-dept-to-review-emails-for-public-release.html?ref=politics&amp;_r=2)

&gt; Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman and the State Department have cast her decision to hand over her emails as motivated by efforts to update the department’s record management system. “When the department asked former secretaries last year for help ensuring their emails were in fact retained, we immediately said yes,” Nick Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, said on Sunday.

&gt; **But it was the review of Benghazi-related documents last summer that, within the State Department, set off the chain of events leading to the public disclosure this week of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email account, according to the current and former department officials.**

&gt; **The decision to ask Mrs. Clinton for her emails** went all the way to Secretary of State John Kerry’s chief of staff, who, along with officials working on the response to the Benghazi requests, signed off on it.

- Why would the DNC/Obama act in such an outrageously reckless manner with respect to allowing Clinton to become their nominee?

The DNC may have very well relied too heavily on Clinton's word. You have to imagine that as Democrats they are just as heavily swayed by the ""right-wing smear"" lie as anyone. The FBI can't be penetrated by an independent party, and all the lawyers and resources in the world will not make the DNC privy to anything outside of what the FBI has allowed to be disclosed publicly. There's no reason to believe that Clinton wouldn't play them the same way she's been playing the American public on this. They may also be blinded to a certain extent by the huge potential political payoff from being the first party to elect a woman president. There's a certain progressive identity at stake here, not to mention Clinton's insane corporate fundraising abilities. In other words, they already have a tremendous amount of skin in this game. A Clinton indictment would be a crushing blow to them no doubt but you have to remember that when they first put their money on Clinton in this race there was no Trump around to make a victory seemingly inevitable, there was no Sanders around as a second viable option, and there was no divided Democratic base.

**TL;DR** In order for anyone to argue that this investigation is going nowhere they need to rely on the assumption that everything stated above is coincidental. I'm sorry but that is simply unreasonable.",technology,1462056501
politics,"Until we can get money out of politics, less is more and local is better.","I've always been a far left liberal, but I've turned into a libertarian over the last few years because I simply don't trust the puppets. And the puppets on the left have shown their strings since taking power in 08. But I've always seen the strings on the right. So I have come around to believing in a minimal federal government and strong local autonomy.

*1. Whatever tax revenue you can manage to shake down will inevitably be used to further the interests of the lobbying parties. Sometimes this means war and mass incarceration.

*2. Many regulations either intentionally or unintentionally lock out small start up competition that could disrupt and reform naturally corrupt market standards.

*3. New social spending programs create a very corrupt cronyistic marketplace where wasting money is too often rewarded. 

*4. The successful scandanavian model works because there is a good representation to citizen ratio. So I think we need to learn from that fundamental structural benefit before imitating their social programs. So I think the best approach to achieving those goals is through state and local government.

*5. I don't like it when the right forces policies on the federal level, so it's not fair to do so from the left. 

*6. Lastly, the expansions of public goods will require allot of trial and error to get it right. They all require a trade off and will certainly have a steep learning curve, especially with a handicapped gene pool of bought politicians. That's why I believe we should implement these policies on a decentralized basis.",finance,1462057544
