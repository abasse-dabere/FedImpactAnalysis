personalfinance,Need help. Snowball or Avalanche?,"Hi PF, I'm a 22 year old novice when it comes to finance and I owe about $4,000 in CC debt.

personalfinance,Car + Paying Off Loans Vs. Minivan?,"My wife and I are having a mild argument (no- we won't be divorcing and we don't need relationship advice, thanks): she wants to buy a 3rd row minivan and I want to make do with a sedan with a wider backseat but less cost and better gas mileage. We want to see what r/personalfinance has to say about the numbers. 
&amp;nbsp;

The backstory: We currently share a Corolla that belongs to a family member (costs us nothing except maintenance) but is a pain since I have a 1 hour commute to work and the carseat forces the front seat so far forward it causes back pain for the adult rider. My wife wants a 3rd row so she can carry her disabled parents (back injury and cancer with mobility restrictions) and the baby comfortably for medical appointments and trips. 
&amp;nbsp;

My point of view is we should get a cheaper car because of our financial situation. We are paying off $53,000 of student loan debt (9k at 9.25%, 11k at 8%, rest are federal loans averaging 5-6%). We're paying $700 a month for the loans, which is about the minimum (we stopped paying extra to build up our emergency fund which is at 10k right now). I have a good paying job but my wife stays home with our child (monthly income is just over $4,000 after taxes/healthcare/all that jazz). Our rent is $875 and we pay about $50 for electricity, $60 for internet and about $50 for phones. We don't have tv, we've pretty much stopped gaming for the time being but we have various ongoing medical expenses. My wife wants to get a ~2012 Honda Odyssey which should be valued at $18-20,000. I think buying a cheaper car and paying off the student loans will be worth the sacrifice. 
&amp;nbsp;

Wife's Point of View: Realistically, we are going to require another car in order to transport the baby, take trips (we like to do weekend/day trips), bring family to appointments, etc. I know r/personalfinance members recommend living a stripped-down lifestyle, but if I can make the many visits to the hospital easier on my family, then I'm going to. I want to just get a minivan now instead of when we have our second kid because we can use the extra space now and we'd be buying one in a few years for kid #2 anyway. I do NOT want to get a used car off Craigslist for $3000 because in our area they're mostly rust buckets and my baby's safety isn't worth gambling on the honesty of some internet rando.  
&amp;nbsp;

So, in the considered opinion of r/personalfinance, will $500/mo car payments destroy our financial stability?",finance,1462065867
personalfinance,Debating whether or not to buy a home.,"Okay, so here's the deal.  My husband and I have been renting since we were 20.  We're now 28, with a baby due pretty soon.  I want to get a house, but I dont know.  

He is about to accept a job that pays 47.5k a year.  I get 38.5k a year.  So we're looking at 86k gross income.

Our total debts are:
Our combined student loans: 750 a month total (Different interest rates over 10 different loans)  About 60k.


My car Payment:  280 a month 0% interest.  I owe 10,700 on it at the moment.  I'm really not in a rush to pay this off, obviously because of no interest.... so whatever.


Future Hospital Bill:  I'm kind of planning for this.  I dont know what to expect when I deliver my baby but I'm going to assume that there is some sort of debt involved with the hospital.  I have BCBS, and I've paid off my OB already for delivery, but I think the hospital is going to charge me an arm or a leg.



His Health Insurance is free for himself, but for me and the baby, it looks like it'll be 550 a month out of my check.  He pays 50 dollars a month for medication.  He needs this medication and this cant be cut out.

We spend right now:

Rent: 900

Electricity: 80

Internet: 65

Water: 64

Food: 350

Car Payment: 280

Student Loans: 750

Gas for both cars: 75

Medicine/Home stuff: 100 

If we were to go up to a decent two bedroom apartment, we can expect to spend 1000-1350 a month.

I will also expect to spend 750 on child care.

Rent is expensive in this area.  Its exhausting to think that I'm throwing my money away.  My husband aren't sold on staying here the rest of our lives, but if we stay for 2-3 years would it be worth it to buy a home?

I wouldn't desire to spend more than 160,000 on a home.  Quite honestly, if we could keep it to 130k, that'd be better.

I have about 5500 in savings at the moment.

personalfinance,5+ years unfiled tax returns. Don't even know where to start.,"Some background:  About 15 years ago I received a reasonably large inheritance (a condo and ~$400K in investments at Schwab and Vangaurd).  I tried to get things into a kind of ""set and forget"" mode (the house is being rented with a property management company (rental income is $2500/mo before fees, mortgage is $1600), investment accounts are primarily in index funds), but I forgot it a bit too much.

I didn't file income tax (either CA or federal) one year, probably 2009.  I haven't filed since then either, because it felt insurmountable and just gets worse with time.

I don't even know how much I owe, or how (if it's even possible) to negotiate that down.

personalfinance,Should I factor in whether a loan is forgivable or not when paying off student loans?,"I would just like to start by saying pleaseeeeeee don't get me shit about how much I have in student loans.

I just started a new job and in making my budget found that I (conservatively) have about $600 left over at the end of the month. This includes the minimum payment on my student loans and putting $360/month in savings/emergency fund (10% of my income). In case it becomes relevant, my income after taxes and benefits is $2,576, fixed expenses are $1,619, I am already contributing 4% to my 401k which is the max amount my employer will match and I have a Health FSA with $260 in it. I currently work at a non-profit which qualifies for loan forgiveness after 10 years. It is likely, in my field of work, that I will continue working for non-profits.


First, should I be putting more towards saving than the amount I'm putting in? I currently have about 2k in savings.


Second, I want to start putting in $100 extra to my loans per month then see how things go and potentially increase it. It is my understanding that the best idea is to put all the extra money toward 1 loan with the highest interest rate and lowest balance to knock out the easy ones first.

My loans are as follows:

Private non-forgivable loans

* 1721        $36,545.69    3.25%

* 3838	    $3,303.26	 5.00%

* 3846	    $6,041.65	 5.00%

* 5145	    $3,522.31     6.00%

Federal loans (forgivable)

* A	$4,557.29	   5.60%

* B	$1,012.10	  5.60%

* C	$4,448.93	  5.60%

* D	$5,388.50	  6.80%

* E	$3,079.13	 6.80%

* F	$2,982.28	 6.80%

* G	$3,176.43	6.80%

* H	$1,265.87	6.80%

* I	$9,883.34	6.80%

* J	$23,300.33     5.41%

* K	$39,268.10     7.21%

* L	$22,419.32     6.21%


Loan H seems like a good option to start paying off because it's a low balance with a high interest rate however, it is one of the loans that is forgivable. My question is, should I put the money towards loan H or would it be better spent on loan 5145 because that one is also fairly small, higher interest, and is not forgivable? Should I be ignoring the forgivability factor?

Any advice appreciated.",finance,1462074505
personalfinance,"(CAN) Going into university soon, will need a student loan.","Parents say that they will pay for my loans after graduating as loans have 0% interest up to end of studies, which means that in terms of money value, we will be paying less at the end. But I don't want to count on my parents just in case.

-A bit of context. Contrary to what I said above, I will be taking the provincial loan and also the federal loan, Federal loan has no interest up to end of studies, while provincial has no interest up to 6 month after studies.
-For Federal loans, Floating rate is prime + 2.5, While fixed is prime +5
-For Provincial loans, Floating rate is prime, while fixed is prime +2
-Currently prime is 2.7%, Were on the low end right now, oil hit us HARD. Recovering also, I also believe that were moving into fiscal policy instead of being so dependent on monetary policy, so that might have a impact (don't know for sure)
-Economy is in a shithole, so chances are its going to get better later on, which means that prime will increase
-As for my personal situation, I have around 10 grand saved up, which I will use to invest in hopes of making a bit more money. I am also enrolling in Co-Op program (internship) which means that in the middle of my studies I will be taking a year for paid work experience. I will probably save up more then too.
-I also do not know if my Co-Op program requires me to pay back at the time, so lets think of the worst circumstance in which I will have to pay for the loans.

Now the provincial loans seems like the better option by far, but chances are I will have to tap into both Provincial and Government. In terms of that, should I choose fixed or floating? And should I invest in GICs or stocks with that 10k in savings?",finance,1462074689

Maybe my understanding is incorrect, but I do not understand why I should be doing anything other than YOLO stocks in my retirement account.

My time frame is like 30 yrs give or take. It seem to little upside and much downside to low yield bond funds, as interest rates have more room up than down compared to historic interest rate levels. What am I missing?

And even if they stay where they are ~1% is this small reward really worth the risk of interest rate rising?

Edit: I must clarify, I am referring to bond funds, i.e. Total market bond fund vanguard. Otherwise the bonds won't come near beating inflation.

personalfinance,PSA - How to *really* obtain a copy of your credit report after applying for a credit card (instructions for Experian),"I recently applied for a credit card, and as part of this process, the consumer (me) has, ""under federal law, the right to obtain a copy of your credit report without charge for 60 days after you receive this notice.""


That's what a helpful *cough* page said along with my new credit card. It then proceeds to give you instructions how to do this.

 Option 1: Call. Well, I called, got a machine, and it directed me to pay $1 online for my report (and subscribe to something). Got another number, this time I got a person, and they also proceeded to sign me up for something --- to which I politely declined.

Option 2: Mail. I didn't mail, like, what am I supposed to write? Plus, there's option 3!

Option 3: ""Visit www.experian.com"". Awesome, internet ftw. But, visiting experian.com all points to me signing up for something and paying $1!!


After some exploring of www.experian.com, I figured out how to get this free-law-given credit report. So there are the REAL instructions:


1) Go to www.experian.com


2) Click ""Consumer Assistance"" on top ribbon (www.experian.com/help)


3) Under ""Common Questions"", click ""How do I view my report again?"" (http://www.experian.com/help/credit-access.html)


4) Check ""I have accessed my Experian credit report before, but do not have a username and password"", and click ""Continue""


5) Fill out the form for ""Access by personal information"" and ""Submit""


6) View your credit report, for free as the law states.


I don't want to speculate why it would be so hidden how to do this... but I hope this helps people getting their free report after their credit card application.


TLDR: If you're entitled for a free Experian credit report following a credit card application, follow the ""Real Instructions"" above and save some time figuring it out (and/or $1).

She is currently in the last semester of her Doctorate of Physical Therapy Program. She finishes her last clinical in July and will take her boards in October. She has a job offer from a great hospital and will most likely start immediately after passing her boards and will start off at a salary of ~85k. I also took a new job in January in the medical industry and am expecting to take home (before taxes) ~110k this year.

My wife currently has student loans totaling 18k. She has 3 unsubsidized stafford loans of around 4k each with rates between 5.8 and 6.2%).

We have come to a financial point where we no longer need to take loans to pay for her graduate degree and are starting to preemptively pay off her loans.  She did qualify for another Perkins Loan this semester (4k).

My question is: Should she take out the 4k Perkins loan and use this money to pay off the unsubsidized Stafford Loan that has a higher interest rate and is already accruing interest?

personalfinance,To what extent can I use 529 distributions to pay for rent while I'm in graduate school?,"I'll be starting a PhD program soon; I have no tuition or health insurance premiums, and my student fees will be minimal?

I looked at [IRS Pub 970](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf), specifically page 59, point #3, and it's not entirely clear to me if this is the case. Pub 970 says

&gt; 3: Expenses for room and board must be incurred by students who are enrolled at least half-time. The expense for room and board qualifies only to the extent that it isn't more than the greater of the following two amounts.

&gt;    a. The allowance for room and board, as determined by the eligible educational institution, that was included in the cost of attendance (for federal financial aid purposes) for a particular academic period and living arrangement of the student.

&gt;    b. The actual amount charged if the student is residing in housing owned or operated by the eligible educational institution.

Is this as simple as looking at my program's Cost of Attendance page ([for example](http://gsas.columbia.edu/content/tuition-fees#expenses)), or emailing my school to ask for the number they report to the Department of Education, at which point I can distribute that much to my personal checking account, and then paying for rent?

personalfinance,Is it possible to obtain a small loan in my situation?,"I got out of the military (Honorable Discharge) about 7 years ago.  I never used my GI Bill after getting out, partially because I wanted to make sure I was 100% positive about the field I wanted to study for my career, and partially because of some serious financial problems my parents had (long story short, they've drained two fair-sized inheritances, falling into all the obvious pitfalls).  I wanted to make sure they weren't leeching off the money that my GI Bill will provide me, as I intend for that to be put towards my business.

For those unfamiliar, the way the new GI Bill works, it basically provides two payments: one to the college for the full tuition cost, and monthly payments to the veteran while enrolled for BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing).

Currently, I don't have any major expenses (I don't pay rent [house is owned outright by the people I'm living with], and no bills are in my name).  Since I've been out of the military, I've lived barebones pretty much.  I've never had a credit card in my life, and the only small loan (something in the range of $2,000-$5,000) I've ever taken out was back when I was in the military.

The other night, I tried to get my free credit reports from the official website, only to find that the system was unable to verify my identity.  However, I remembered I'd signed up for one of those free credit monitoring sites just after leaving the military (about 6 or so years ago), so I was able to recover my password and login using that.  It showed my TransUnion credit report information, and it turns out the only thing on file is something that went to collections for $150.00 in 2014.  That's it.  No other negative or positive records on my credit report.

So, after some research, it seems that I have basically ""thin or no credit history"" - and is likely what was causing the problems with verifying my identity.  My license was suspended several years back while taxi'ing my parents back and forth to their jobs (their car got repossessed) on opposite sides of town every day, due to lack of car insurance (without being able to focus on my own job, my car insurance lapsed).

Once my parents were in a better financial position and purchased a vehicle again, I decided what I wanted my career to be and sold my car (this was several years ago) to fund the computer equipment I needed.  I've been using my bike for transportation ever since.

I did a lot of learning over the past few years (I've been largely self-taught when it comes to computer-stuff) for my chosen field, to get myself up to speed before enrolling back in college.  And I've absolutely made a ton of progress there.

So over the past couple of weeks I finished all the paperwork necessary for enrollment to start college for summer classes.  I've done this with the help of the two guidance counselor's from the college, one of them being the VA representative on campus.  So I'm pretty confident this is basically finally happening.  Assuming nothing comes out of left field to mess it all up, my start date in college should be June 15th.

I know there's likely some fluctuation as to when I'll be receiving my first BAH payment from the GI Bill.  I've heard it can be delayed by up to a month or two sometimes due to potential backlogs or whatever.

Yesterday, I just started my first ""real"" job since getting out of the military 7 years ago.  I basically just did random odds and ends to get by in the interim, just enough so that I could continue to focus my efforts on learning my field (yeah, I know, it wasn't an ideal situation).

My schedule for this week is roughly 43-47 hours of work.  I'll be able to find out tomorrow whether we get paid bi-weekly or weekly, and on which dates.  I'm confident this work will continue reliably, as it's a privately owned French/Italian restaurant that's been operating for over 25 years.

I understand that part of starting to build my credit will be to start implementing small changes to my financial structure like having and maintaining a credit card, making sure I have a few bills in my name, etc.

Since my chosen field is internet-related, my plan was to use my first GI Bill BAH payment to have a new internet line installed at the house I'm living at.  This would simultaneously give me the reliable connection speed I need (without interference when someone boots up Netflix, etc), and give me a monthly bill with my name on it.

I have some further computer equipment purchases that I would like to make as soon as possible.  It's realistic to say, if I can get this equipment purchased and set up sooner rather than later, I'll be in a much better position.

The bare minimum I'd need for this specific computer equipment is roughly $1,500.  At most, I think $2,000.

I have practically no experience with credit and loans.  The one loan I've ever had was when I was in the military, and that was a breeze to get done because they knew for certain we would be getting paid every month, and was done through Navy Federal Credit Union (I don't have an account with them anymore).  I only took out that loan to afford my plane ticket home for pre-deployment leave (stationed in Hawaii, a round-trip ticket at the last minute to Florida is expensive).

(sorry it's long, I tried to provide as much info as possible)

TLDR:

Since I haven't yet gotten my first paycheck from my new job, and I don't have a car to put up for collateral, and my GI Bill benefits won't pay out until June 5th at the earliest, is it even possible for me to get a loan in the range of $2,000-$5,000 within the next week or two?  *I* know that I'll be able to pay it back, between the roughly $60k I'll get from BAH over the next 3-4 years, plus my job, but I have no idea what the proper channels would be to apply for said loan, since I have ""thin credit"".  I understand just enough to know that I don't want to have a million ""hard pulls"" while applying for loans/credit cards.",finance,1462142163

personalfinance,"Graduated from school last year, $200k in pharmacy school debt, and I'm having problems finding work as a pharmacist in my area. How do I handle this?","Hi personalfinance! This is my first time posting here, so please excuse any formatting rules I might be breaking. 

So here's what's up: I graduated from pharmacy school last year and I got $200k (all federal loans) in debt along with my diploma. I took the board exams, got fully licenced to practice in my state, and applied for positions. After the grace period, I still didn't have work, so I applied for forbearance. I figured that I only needed a few months to get on my feet and start getting paychecks. Well, oops. Still don't have a pharmacy job. I'm getting even more nervous now that this year's class is graduating soon. I'm lucky enough to have parents who are willing to spot me in times of dire need, but I don't want to delay their retirement. 

In the meantime, I've found work as a substitute teacher at a public high school, but it's not steady enough to pay off the loans (in addition to paying rent/utilities/food). Recently, I was offered a temporary position as a pharmacist a few hours away for less than a month, but I think the experience and connections I'll make might allow me to find work soon after this assignment is done. (The temp job starts late this month.)

Eventually, I'd like to go back to school part-time to get my master's degree in public health, but only when my debt is under control and when it makes sense in my professional career.

Non financial details: My mental health has been pretty bad, and it's really hard to stay positive. I'm going to start to apply to under-served areas that might have less competitive openings, but I'm hesitant to leave my social support network because of my history of anxiety and depression. I'm really grateful to everyone who took the time to read this! It means a lot to me! 

Here are my questions:
-Should I apply for another forbearance? Can I do this? What are the pros/cons of doing so?
-Should I look into the payment plans that are adjusted to my income? 

TL;DR: $200k in debt, can't find work, forbearance ending. I'd like to know my options and what suggestions you might have for me. Thanks so much for taking the time to read this! :)


EDIT: Woah guys. I was expecting a few responses, but this kind of blew up overnight. Thanks so much to everyone who has responded. Here's my plan: I'll move the loans over to an IBR plan today. I'm going to take the temp job and make connections and ask about openings around home. At the same time, I'll be pumping out applications to under-served areas. That way, I'll be keeping both routes of relocating and not relocating both open. I have a much better understanding of what I need to do. Some of you guys were wondering how I managed to get this much debt, but honestly, this is on the lower end for my graduating class. (One of my best friends has $500k.) I did a 2+4 year doctorate program. I did the 2 years of undergrad for almost nothing at a public state school, but I did the 4 years at a private school (wasn't mentally ready to move out of state, and my state didn't have a pharmacy program). Looking back, I probably should have just bit the bullet and moved out of state.

My advice to current and future pharmacy students:
(1)Public schools. Do it. Seriously.
(2)Get an intern job in addition to your school internships. I turned down an intern job because I wasn't sure I wanted to go into retail and waste their resources. Biggest mistake of my life. If you're concerned about limiting your study time, your employer will work with you. My classmate did 2 hours/week when school got busy. The connections are invaluable. 
(3)Residencies are awesome, but realize they are extremely competitive. Apply if you want, but don't bank on it. Have a back up plan. This might change if more residency programs become available.",finance,1462151215

personalfinance,Finally getting around to creating a budget -- need sanity check and advice,"Hi,

I've been out of school for a few years now (currently 24) and am finally making some pretty decent money but I never really got things fully sorted on the budget front.  I've been poking around this subreddit and learning how to get my 401k/IRA/savings goals settled, and now I'm looking for some feedback.

Here's my current situation:

**Monthly expenses:** ~$2400 (includes rent, student loans, food, misc, etc.).

**Income:** $120k annual, ~$5000 each month after taxes &amp; 401k

**Savings:** Currently I have $20k cash in the bank (only just got this job, otherwise I'd have greater savings).  $7500 is designated as my emergency fund.

**Investments:** ~$8k in my old employer's 401k (Fidelity; allocated as 70% in Spartan 500 Index Fund (.07% expense ratio, basically matches S&amp;P 500) and 30% in Fidelity Freedom 2055 Fund which is a target date fund with an expense ratio of .75%).  I've also got ~$1800 with Ubiquity (current employer's 401k provider) in a Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Inv with an expense ratio of .16%.  I don't have an IRA, and I have no employer match on the 401k.  Currently I'm contributing 10% to my 401k.

**Debt:** I have ~$16.8k in student loans (started out with ~$30k upon graduating a little less than 3 years ago.  Paid off one of them in full semi-recently).  They have various interest rates from 3.15%-6.55%, which can be viewed here: http://i.imgur.com/xwxQypt.png .

Here's what I'm wondering re: my next steps:

1. Should I open an IRA?  If so, should be it a Roth IRA or traditional IRA?  I've tried looking into it but am still a bit confused if my income is too large to make it worth it relative to other investment options.

2. Should I be maxing out my 401k?  Or put my money into a separate index fund?  Either way, I'm pretty happy to stock it money away according to the Boglehead philosophy.

3.  Should I roll over my previous 401k into my current 401k?

4. Before doing any of that, should I be paying off my higher interest rate student loans?  I'm 3 years into paying them off, is it still worth it (estimated payoff date of 12/13/23 for all of them)?

I only have a single bigger savings goal, which is to save for a down payment on an apartment (around $100k; I live in NYC).  Hoping to get to that within 5 years.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on the best way to ensure my future financial security and achieve my savings goal?  How am I doing?  And what can I be doing differently?

-A bit of context. Contrary to what I said above, I will be taking the provincial loan and also the federal loan, Federal loan has no interest up to end of studies, while provincial has no interest up to 6 month after studies. -For Federal loans, Floating rate is prime + 2.5, While fixed is prime +5 -For Provincial loans, Floating rate is prime, while fixed is prime +2 -Currently prime is 2.7%, Were on the low end right now, oil hit us HARD. Recovering also, I also believe that were moving into fiscal policy instead of being so dependent on monetary policy, so that might have a impact (don't know for sure) -Economy is in a shithole, so chances are its going to get better later on, which means that prime will increase -As for my personal situation, I have around 10 grand saved up, which I will use to invest in hopes of making a bit more money. I am also enrolling in Co-Op program (internship) which means that in the middle of my studies I will be taking a year for paid work experience. I will probably save up more then too. -I also do not know if my Co-Op program requires me to pay back at the time, so lets think of the worst circumstance in which I will have to pay for the loans.

investing,"Do you believe that if insider trading is legal and shorting is impossible, then a market is by definition inefficient?","I don't generally do x-posts of this nature in this sub, but I believe it is worthwhile for me to [show you a case where a tribunal ruled that insider trading is somewhat illegal](http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/treb-housing-data-competition-bureau-1.3557504).

For starters (who are non-Canadians), realtors here have access to confidential information about houses (such as price history at each historical sale of every property that exists, how many times it has been listed before finally being sold, etc...). Those who break the rules the ""mafia"" (Toronto Real Estate Board) had created would be kicked out of the mob. Now, just imagine if there is a stock market where the price history of every stock is confidential except to the stockbroker--yes, that means the buyer and seller would privately negotiate a price, and these prices are not available to anyone else except the broker. I think the market would collapse and millions would be jailed and given multimillion dollar fines. 

A few days ago, the government came in and said that the mafia's actions amount to anti-competition and therefore illegal. The fact that insiders have an advantage and are legally allowed to use it is very unfair to me.

The other pitfall of the housing market is that if someone, anyone, thinks it's going down, no one can find a good way to short it. The most direct way I know is to short mortgage bonds--but you only profit when either interest rates spike and/or mass default occurs. A severe housing crash need not to be caused by any of these things. You can have house prices crash 30% in 10 years without interest rates going up or a meaningful spike in the default rate of mortgages. Without the ability to bet against a market, that means everyone who participates is long and there is no force to correct imbalances--even if those forces want to act upon these imbalances by betting against them.

By what I mean ""inefficient"", I mean that when information appears (e.g. oil crash), it takes months to minimally affect the prices of homes. Whereas during the oil panic of January-February, stocks everywhere collapsed, home prices were only down minimally.",finance,1462157177

I figured it was time to buy a decent car and use the $2,000 as a down payment. After some stress I finally got into a car loan at ~18% interest.

I was seen as a risk because I couldn't prove good income (half of my money was tips), I had only been at my job for 3 months, and my credit score was ~620.

I have looked into trading in my car and getting into a new finance option, but that doesn't seem possible given the amount I still owe and the trade-in value. 2 dealerships told me as much on Saturday.

WAR: The VORTEX Invasion

2023, 6th of September

War never changes, as once said by a great man, but its just no true. War changes, its just that you can not see it, because war changes in a way, that it gets more and more brutal. More people die in more ways, and this includes soldiers, children, fathers, mothers, everyone. I am Commander Martinez and I am currently fighing on US Soil againts an evil corporation, VORTEX, led by Martin Hendricks, a man who promised to end all wars, but just started an another one againts the United States, with the reason, that we made all wars. Now, he is killing people in California, Los Angeles and every major US City with a special toxic gas, that has DNA code, so Hendricks' soldiers are immune to the gas, and this is why I was sent here to New Orleans. Because I was fighting on Martin's side a while ago, and I looked up to him, but then I saw what he plans. Currently, I am alone in the city with the objective to kill everyone who works for VORTEX, but I am just failing again and again. My best friend, Mitchell died, who came with me here and now I am seeking for revenge, and I will NOT stop 'till I find and kill Hendricks! I am writing this to have people know what happened to the USA actually, because in stories and History books it will be all lies. I'm walking the streets in a Ghost City, and I constantly see dead people, and sadly this includes children too, and I can not stop thinking about seeing my son amongts them, because He used to live here with my ex-wife. The city is now mainly clear of hostiles, but there are still a few patrols coming two times a month, because Hendricks knows that I am coming for him, but as of now, all patrols died, by me. The latest patrol however was different, they were two times more, they had special weapons, none of us ever have seen at Helghast, and they had two Vtols with them too, and sadly I could not take out the Vtols, so I am forced to find clues about Hendricks' location indoors, to avoid any contact with the Vtols. 
-Commander Martinez

2023, 3rd of October

A lot have happened since the first letter I wrote. The Helghast found a way to counter the DNA lock in the toxic gas with a special armor, so they could sent me a Special DELTA Squad to help me, but they were taken out by the Vtols, but Delta Squad left me a gift: a nice pack of weapons, ammo, fresh armor and food. With the new weaponry of mine, I managed to take out one of the Vtols, but the second one got away, most likely to tell Hendricks, that I am more powerful. And the new weaponry gift wasn't the only good thing to happen to me, I also found clues on Martin's location, so as of now I am on route to New York, where there is an abandoned base, that sounds like its not abandoned, but is the HQ of VORTEX, and the place where Hendricks is located. I already got out of New Orleans, but Hendricks knew too much, because when I got to the border of New Orleans, I found the dead body of my son, John, with his damn legs and arms cut off from his body. This was the biggest mistake Hendricks ever made. I never felt as angry, as now, and Martin knows that. I am already trough Knoxville, and I am feeling more angrier the closer I am to New York...

2023, 5th of October

I've got to New York, but only to the borders of it, because as it seems like, the clues in New Orleans were right. Hole New York is under lockdown and Hendricks is hiding in the city. I managed to grab and torture one of the VORTEX soldiers, and he was happy to tell me a lot about VORTEX and the location of Hendricks. I know now that Hendricks got his base in the Central Park, so that is where I am going, if I manage to get into the city. There are lot of soldiers around the city, patroling, but there is one gate, where only a few soldiers patrol, but they got a special tank there, so I gotta find a way to destroy it, before I can get in to New York. In the meantime, I lost all communications with Helghast, so I have to think, that they are no more. On the happier side, I saw graffities and posters of a Resistance, so if I find them, I could get thek from them, but I know nothing about them, except that they are called the Resistance...

2023, 17th of October

I finally made it into New York. I found new rocket launcher prototype wich I gladly used to destroy that fucking tank on that gate. And I also managed to find a small Resistance base, and after spending 2 days at them, they gave a map to underground travel routes, and one of them leads straight to the Central Park. The only problem is that the route is defended by VORTEX soldiers, so I suspect its an escape route for Hendricks, in case something goes wrong. I gone back to the resistance with this information and asked them to help me blow some important shit up, so Hendricks will be forced to escape trough that route, but they didn't want to help me, so I gotta find a way to defeat those soldiers at Hendricks' escape route to get to him and kill him. Sadly, I barely got any ammo and my armor is really weak now. I need to find a supply base to gear up to take my revenge. I already found one near the underground escape route, but its also heavily guarded, but its only soldiers, no vehicles, and bullshit like that, so I am planning to infiltrate the base silently. First I gotta take out the five snipers, then the others, but while watching the base, I saw some type of chip on the armor of the snipers, so I can not risk killing them, because who knows what those chips are meant for, they might just blow me the fuck up, or who knows. So, for know, I need to take them out from far, but I need a sniper rifle for it, and the before helpful Resistance does not help me to get one.

2023, 20th of October

He is dead, I managed to torture and kill that motherfucker Hendricks. It was hard, but after deciding to just fucking grenade the guards at the underground route, I managed to get to that motherfucking Hendricks. I tought I would die the personal security of Martin's, but as turned out, they hated Hendricks, so they just walked out from Hendricks' room, leaving the two us alone. I tortured that bastard. I cut down his fucking legs, then I knifed his left eye. Hearing his girly scream was great feeling, and that was the point where I knew, that I've gone insane. Back to the torture: After knifing his left eye, I forced him to eat it, with the promise that I'll let him live if he eats it, but of course, it wasn't like that. The fucker ate his left eyeball, and then I started punching his head till he died. After that, I walked out on his door, knowing what will happen to me.
Commander Martinez out, this was my last letter...

2040, 10th of July - Manhattan

""He was a soldier, he was a father, he was a man who got a lot of hits from life. He had to survive in the Ghost City of New Orleans, now Martinez City, then he had to see his tortured and dead son to find the man that cause all that bad to him.

She also has a Home Equity Loan under her name that is due next year and was hoping to refinance with the reduced debt load. However, I was hoping on continuing my Debt Snowball which would pay off my NJClass loan completely, allowing me to roll the monthly payment into my other loans. This is causing tension in the family as my mom is saying that if I don't pay off the Parent Plus loan she cannot refinance which would result in her losing the house. I am at a crossroads and this is seriously bothering me and I am having trouble sleeping and eating over this. Not sure what to do....

personalfinance,[Housing] Does it make sense to open a separate checking account for my mortgage and other housing expenses?,"I will be settling on a house this week and would like to know if, for reasons related to bookkeeping, it makes sense to open a separate checking account for my mortgage and other housing-related finances.  Here are the particulars:

1. I've bought at a time where interest rates are low, so all things considered I won't be paying a ton towards interest (relatively speaking).  However, I live in an area with high property taxes, so a large amount of money will be put into mortgage escrow to cover that.  I know I will be able to claim a sizable fraction on my annual tax return based on my income.

2. The house will require a good amount of repairs/minor construction/improvements following settlement. I know I cannot claim these items on my taxes until the house is sold.

3. My girlfriend will be moving in and I will be charging her rent (very small amount relative to the market rate, mostly to cover expenses like utilities).  Even though the amount is small, I think this still qualifies as rental income.

My objective is to maximize my tax benefit while making the bookkeeping as organizationally painless as possible.  For that reason I would like to know whether it'd be advantageous to open a separate checking account into which I keep enough money (from payroll deposit) to cover my mortgage + escrow, other housing-related expenses, and collect rent from my girlfriend.

personalfinance,How best to plan for financing education/paying off debt?,"Hello, PF

As the title says I'm looking for some input on how best to prepare, financially, throughout the next year/year and a quarter so I can transition from a full-time employee/part-time student to a full-time student/part-time employee.

Recently I started a new job where work full-time, making ~$15/hour with benefits (5% match 401k) and have returned to school (after 4 years off) as a part time student. I have the opportunity to live with my family for the remaining time it takes me to finish school, so that saves me a decent chunk of money. I'm attending a community college right now and the cost of my degree will roughly be $8,500. Financial aid isn't an option (not to say I'm looking to utilize it) until next year (poor grades first year=no financial aid until GPA returns to normal). My income is currently going towards savings for school, general savings and paying off existing debt. 

**DEBT:** Vehicle payoff is $145/mo. @ $5,342 @6.750 interest rate. Credit card #1: $3300 @ 26.99% Credit card #2:$800 @ 7.5% Credit line (not a credit card): $1300 @27.99%. Each month I'm paying ~2x towards each credit card, though I'm looking to follow more of the pyramid route and pay them off according to rate/amount. My income before bills in $1680 which leaves me with $1080 after bills/groceries/etc. 


With that, I'm hoping for some advice to point me in the right direction. Should I focus my finances on paying off existing debt and look towards utilizing grants/loans (beginning next year) for the remaining years in college, or should I save to pay for college outright? Perhaps you've other ideas that would be more ideal.

personalfinance,Paying off ultra low interest mortgage on underwater home vs investing - what are your thoughts?,"Hi there r/PF!

I recently bought an appartment in Utrecht, The Netherlands and did not put all my cash in the down payment, but instead chose to get the highest mortgage I would qualify for and keep the cash in my pocket until I'm done moving, then I was going to pay off the mortgage a bit with my spare cash.

My house is worth 162.500 EUR. I have two mortgages, the primary one being 158.600 EUR at 1.9% interest (before tax benefits), which is of course extremely low. It is a standard 30-year mortgage with a 10-year fixed interest so I really got a good deal. I also have a secondary mortgage of only 8.800 EUR at 3.4%. This mortgage only becomes effective in three years from now. The first three years you pay nothing (no principle nor interest) and the interest rate in these three years is 0% so the loan doesn't accumulate. The details on this is a bit too much for this post, but it is a form of government regulations here in the Netherlands.

Now comes the part: after moving and all costs and such I have around 4.000 EUR sitting around in my budget doing nothing (still in my ""Moving"" category in YNAB).

I do have a well funded emergy fund (three full monthly salaries), and I budget through YNAB for every Euro I spend so apart from the high mortgage to home ratio I consider myself financially healthy. Apart from my savings (consisting of the e-fund and some other budgeted savings for yearly expenses and vacations and such) I own a stock brokerage account holding a few hundred Euro's split 50/50 between VEUR (Vanguard Developed Euro ETF) and VUSA (Vanguard SP500 ETF).

The question is what should I do with my left over investable cash. Make a big payment to my mortgage or invest it in VEUR/VUSA? My long term plan is to be financially indepent, and I'm thinking of doing so through rentals as the rental market in my city is crazy (my apartment would go for 1200 euro easily, with my net mortgage payments being ~520). So over time I want to be able to move onto a bigger house for settling and starting a family, and keeping this apartment as a rental. In that case it would be wise to pay off the mortgage asap, but on the other hand the interest rate is super low, so mathematically it makes more sense to invest.

What are your thoughts FI?

I'm a current upcoming junior in an American university. I'm halfway through a neuroscience degree, and my parents have just permanently suspended their financial support. My current college is extremely expensive, and remaining there is no longer an option. However, there is another university in my state that is far more affordable, and I think I can put myself through the next two years if I can transfer there. 

My questions are mainly pertinent to the FAFSA and student/federal loans. Do I need to edit the FAFSA to indicate a change in school? What is the process for transferring the federal loans I've already been granted from one school to another, if that is possible? Are there private educational loans available without a co-signer that aren't a terrible idea, and if so, what are they? 

Any advice is appreciated! Let me know if there are steps in the process that I haven't accounted for. I've never handled anything of this magnitude on my own before, and I don't even know where to begin. I've been in touch with both colleges, and plan to meet with the financial advisors to establish a plan. 

Additionally, I must note that my parents are opposed to me continuing college further in any capacity, and that I am seeking to transfer without their knowledge, as I am determined to finish my degree. Any direct help from them will not be an option.

personalfinance,Rental Property - 30 Year Fixed or 15 Year Fixed?,"I currently have a rental property and am thinking about refinancing. Bought at a great time (great interest rate and its worth more than is owed). I'm currently in a 30 year mortgage with 25 years remaining. I'm considering refinancing to a 15 year fixed rate. 

I'll probably keep the condo for at least 2 years and maybe much longer. Depends on if I need the equity for my next down payment (moved to CA and am renting until I know its a long-term move).

Here are the details:

Estimated home value: $550K
Loan amount: $285K
Interest Rate: 3.5% - 30 Year 
Monthly Mortgage: $1,367
20% down payment (on a $300K loan)
Assessments: $300/month
Taxes: $800/month
Insurance: $85/Month

So my monthly all in is about $2,500
Rent is $3,000

Current Annual breakdown:
Rental Cash Flow: $6,000 ($500/month X 12 months)
Principal Paydown: $6,000 (approximately $500/month X 12 months)
$12,000 total


With current 15 year fixed rates around 3.125% on a $285K loan my monthly payment for just the loan goes to $1,900. Adding in other items take is to $3,100/month. So I go from a $500 cash flow to minus $100. I have access to a no-cost refinance close so thats not an additional cost.

15 Year Fixed Annual Breakdown:
Rental Cash Flow: -$1,200 (-100/month X 12)
Principal Paydown: $15,600 ($1,300 X 12)

So the annual cash flow and equity with my current 30 year loan is about $12,000. The 15 year loan is $14,400. The problem is that its all equity and not cash flow - so in the event of repairs or a vacant month - it would be all out of pocket.

personalfinance,Choosing student loans-- not sure which loan type is best?,"Hello everybody! This is my first post so I apologize if I am breaking any rules. I looked through the student loans wiki, but it only offered advice on paying back the loans, so I thought my situation might warrant its own post.

I am currently a student, about to go from my 3rd year of undergrad to my last year. Due to some complicated circumstances last semester, I had to drop my physics class that is necessary for me to graduate on my pre-med track. I don't think I will be able to balance my remaining course work with the other classes I need to take for my track/ major during my last academic year. As a result, I have to take it over the summer at my university. The problem is, my financial aid does not cover tuition costs for summer, and I am not taking enough credits to qualify for any federal loans. Therefore, I have to look for a private loan. The amount I need a loan for is relatively small, about $4,500.

The thing is, I’ve never had a loan before because of my school being generous with my financial aid grant during the academic year, and I’m not sure what loan choice is best. My university has a page where I can explore all the different loan options, and they have interest rates that go from 2.5% to 11% depending on the loan. Some are fixed, and some are variable. Some have a grace period, and some do not. My question is, which factors should I consider most important when choosing my loan? This loan will be on my own (credit score of 740s) and not my parents.

Another thing I guess would be important to know is my career prospects. The school I go to is a top 15 school, and I am majoring in public health and minoring in chemistry. I am not really planning to pursue a career in those fields right now, I just find them interesting and thought they would be a good back up in case my actual career plans do not work out. I am a pre-med, and I am planning on taking a gap year between undergrad and medical school. I think my career prospects are quite nice, as I am on track to graduate with honors, going to publish a paper in a scientific journal as second author before I graduate, am invested in many campus organizations, and have a job off campus. My gap year is a bit uncertain, as I am applying for several competitive programs abroad, which have different levels of income. At most, I would be paid about $22,000 dollars a year, which would be enough for me to live on, but not necessarily save.

I also thought about the option of taking another class in order to qualify for the better loan option (4.29% interest and 6 month grace period), but that would increase the loan amount from 4,500 to nearly 9,000. That seems like a bad idea considering I can take that class basically for free during the academic year, but maybe I am missing something so I wanted to include this as maybe an option.

Finally, I think my parents would be able to help me out a bit on repaying the loan. They simply don’t have the money saved up to help me pay it right now because of other temporary financial burdens. And also, I do not have the option to take the class at a cheaper school as I passed the deadline to apply for that process. Any advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated!

I'm not trying to figure out how to get rid of the debt, cause that is already being taken care of (by my parents).

Type | Amount | Rate
---|---|----
Auto | $4,400 | 2.85%
Student Loan | $6,400 | 6.8%

Student Loan | $4,200 | 5.6%
Student Loan | $4,900 | 4.5%

An ideal situation would be to have some type of line of credit that charges interest on an average daily balance.  This way I could deposit my income into the account, let it sit and keep the average balance low, and then pay off bills when I need to.  Extra money left over at the end of the month can go towards paying down the line of credit.  
From a bit of research I've done, it looks like a secured line of credit could accomplish this and get me the lowest rates, although from what I've seen, the rates are in the 7%+ range.  Is there a way to set up the loan so that the rates are lower?

Another idea that I would love to work would be opening an American Express Blue Cash Preferred card which has 0% introductory APR, and using that to pay down some of the balances.  I want to get the card for its cash back benefits anyways, but it would be icing on the cake if I could finagle a way to pay off some of my loans with it.  However, my student loans are through Dept of Ed (Nelnet), and I've read they won't accept credit card payments.  This may be a better question for /r/churning, but is anyone aware of a reliable way to use a credit card to pay off student loans?

Are there any other ideas that would make sense to pursue?

My income is about $6,000 a month, expenses are around $4,000 (sometimes more due to travel, concert tickets, other fun stuff), and I have very good credit.  I have enough in my emergency fund, but I haven't maxed out 401K/Roth IRA/HSA stuff.  Right now I put 6% of my paycheck towards my 401K because that's how much my employer will match.

Now... future job would cover it, but basically I've been trying to stay liquid ""just in case"".

Anyway, I'm not sure I see a good reason anymore.  I have ~15k in cash.  11k is in a savings account and the rest is in checking for bills and a recent surgery.

I want to pay off my car because its a big payment that I can tackle, but its the lowest interest rate loan I have, so it doesn't make mathematical sense.  It would save me some peace of mind, though.

- Car loan - 2.9% (300/mo)
- Mortgage - 4% (1225/mo)

Obviously extra cash should go toward student loan.  I put an extra 1k into it every once in a while to the principal.  I'm working on getting onto a more structured budget so I can consistently pay into it more.

personalfinance,Don't Buy Expensive Cars,"Hey all, first post and long time lurker here. I have spoken to several people about how buying expensive cars is one of the surest ways to erode personal wealth (net worth) and nobody ever really listens. So I made a tool that basically helps show how purchasing expensive cars has a lasting impact. 

The most frustrating thing is many people think they should purchase an expensive car just because they have the cash flow to make the payments. The reality is that the financial impact is much more than it seems from the difference in sticker price.

Anyways, here's a link to my tool. It uses tableau public. You can adjust sliders on the left to select different inputs that give different results, such as purchase price, interest rate, etc.

personalfinance,Should I rent an apartment or buy a condo (Denver)? Somewhat specific shared equity financing agreement complicating factor.,"My wife and I are moving to the Denver metro area for her grad school. She's going for a PhD, so we anticipate staying in the area for 5 years. 

Income: She has a yearly stipend of around $20,000, and I am looking for a job. I'm reasonably confident I will be able to find something--all of the following assumes that I will have an income. We both have college degrees and no debt. We have no car payment currently, but will probably need to take out a loan at some point for that. We have around ~20,000 in savings and easily liquid assets.

Housing: Right now, it would cost us around $1,200 a month to rent a 1-2br place that is reasonably close to school for her, and public transit for me. Over the course of 5 years, that would be $72,000 in money spent on rent.

If we were to buy a condo, something that meets our needs would cost around $150,000. Here is my complicating factor: I don't want to clean out my savings on a down payment, but my family (whom I trust) is willing sign a mortgage with us and put up the down payment, with the expectation that they will get a reasonable rate of return on the investment. We would live in the condo and pay the monthly costs associated with owning it. We would sign an ancillary agreement laying out the details of what would happen at the time of sale. 

Does co-signing with my family seem like it will save me money over a period of 5 years? 

To keep things simple I am using whole numbers here. If they put 20% down, that would be $30,000, leaving a loan amount of $120,000. Assuming a 4% interest rate, I would pay 572.90 monthly, but lets just call that $800 after taxes, insurance, HOA fees, utilities etc. Over the course of 5 years I would pay $48,000 total. In that time period I would have paid off $23,000 in interest and $11,500 in principal on the loan itself. 

Here's where I am a bit confused. How should I structure the additional agreement about what happens when we sell?

On the face of things, it seems like I should be saving $24,000 if I sign on to the mortgage. However, I can't figure out how to think through all the different selling conditions. Say we can sell the condo for $150,000 in 5 years (after closing costs etc. we just break even). They will want some return on the $30,000 they put into the down payment. A 5% return would be $7,500. If I covered that cost, I would still only be paying $55,000 over the 5 years, which would be a good deal for me.

On the other hand, what if the condo sold for $175,000 in 5 years? We would have essentially contributed to the purchase 3:1, so I assume we would split any proceeds 3:1. Such a sale would net $25,000 in profit, less $7,500 for interest, so $17,500 to be divided between us--which seems like it would result in a profit of $4,375 for me.

I could do the back of the envelope math to estimate what would happen if the property lost value, but you see how it all breaks down. 

I don't really understand how this kind of shared equity financing agreement tends to work, and am generally a novice at mortgages in general. The above represents how I think it works. What am I missing or not understanding? Assuming that another huge housing crash doesn't happen in the next 5 year, does it make sense for me to co-sign the mortgage or should I rent?",finance,1462228720

I have never missed a federal filing, but I believe the last time I filed my state taxes may have been in 2011 (I'm actually embarrassed that I don't know for sure).  I was a student for 2012 and 2013 and I earned less than 20k a year working part time.  2014 and 2015 I was working full time and definitely making more, slightly more than 30k.  I have never owed taxes on the federal level and usually get at least $500 back.

My state is offering tax amnesty through the end of the month and I was wondering if it something I should consider given the situation.  I've never been contacted for not filing.  I don't believe that I owe the state any money, but I should add that since 2011 (the last time I think I filed state) my returns have been in a tax intercept program to pay for a $1200 student loan I defaulted on.

I'm trying to be more financially responsible and get my life together (I fell behind for a lot of different reasons) and I would like to straighten this situation out if it needs to be.

This is the first car I've bought from a dealer and the first loan I've ever taken out. The interest rate on it is 16.9% which seems ridiculously high. Is this typical? 
First they told me it was because I'm a first time buyer so I asked about having my parents cosign and they said it wouldn't change the rate. I haven't put any money down yet so I'm hoping they'll go lower.

Who owns America’s Student Debt?
Student debt is mostly (~80%) federally guaranteed loans. This is nearly, if not completely impossible to discharge, even with bankruptcy. Basically the former students are still on the hook and there will be some value to the loan. Even students in default begin to have wages garnished.


First off, there are 3 types of student loans to consider: (1) Federal direct loans, (2) PLUS loans (loans to the parent, not the students, and (3) private loans.
The first two are federal loans, and the money for them orginates from the US Treasury. PLUS loans aren't typical student debt because they're to the parents (the students are never responsible for repayment), though they are for education expenses. The third (private loans) originate from private investors (i.e. banks or other financial institutions). Prior to 2010 there were federal guaranteed loans, in which the money originated from private investors but the loans were backed by the federal government. All federal loans today are direct.
Federal direct loans are still guaranteed by the US government. Private loans are not.
The largest holders of private student loan debt are Sallie Mae (now Navient) and Nelnet. Prior to 2010 they originated federal guaranteed loans in addition to private loans, and they're still large holders of ferderal student loan debt. These companies also work as servicers (collectors) of the debt. These companies also hold significant amounts of federally guaranteed student loan debt.
My understanding is that it can be difficult to find out who is the holder of a specific loan. Nolo has a website to help with such a thing. You should also be able to find your loan holder through theNational Student Loan Data System.
As to what happens to the loan (and who owns it) after is it disbursed to the student I can't answer, though I'm very curoius myself. Do financial institutions monetize and sell the private loans the way they have with mortgage debt? How are the federal direct loans accounted for, and who owns them? How much of student loan debt is guaranteed by the US government, and how much isn't? I'm hoping others can answer some of these related questions.
A good amount of the loans are securitized. Meaning sold off to bond investors via bond structuring, where each investor earns a percentage of the P&amp;I cashflow generated from a pool student loans. So one securitization could have thousands of loans gathered together, and the bond holders get a percentage of that aggregate cash flow based on what class/tranche they hold within the capital structure of the securitization. The point is the final investor could be any one with the money and usually requires qualified investor status.
The thing to remember is the originator is rarely the long-term owner of, well, most debt. Its is expected originators sell the loan off for a discounted net present value versus if they waited the full term of the loan, but that recapturing of capital allows the originator to make another loan and continue the process, making the discount worth it. Do you wait 30 years to make a $1million in interest profit? Or sell today for a smaller profit (and less risk) to make a new loan? Its a clear choice for an originator.
I mostly deal with mortgage securitizatio0n, but the same idea is behind student loan securitizations.
And as DrTreeMan pointed out, when the an entity guarantees the debt, that protects the lender (secondary or originator), meaning the government doesn't own the debt, just there to help protect the lender from losses if the loan defaults. It does mean the loan terms are dictated by the guarantor though.
I don't know general proportions of who owns what or market size, as I observe the market rather than participate.
Do not quote me. Opinions are my own.









Credit Assessment Model



Level of Assessment for Student 
Value of skill major provides: 
Question to ask: What major(s) do you intend on studying?
Ability of student
 Question to ask: What is your GPA, SAT, ACT?
Value of degree from school:
Question to ask: What schools were you admitted to? ( this will be assessed based on the school’s rank) 
Location of school 
There is no need for a question because Vergo will be able to automatically detect where the school is based on a Google maps API. The value of this feature is to determine whether or not there is a need for the skill within a 50 mile radius of the school’s location, causing a greater chance that a student will get hired. 
A good question to research is how many college students live within 50 to 100 miles of the college they attended and how long do they live there.
US labor market need of the skill 
 Another answer that will be generated based on Vergo’s communication with data from the US department of labor statistics research reports on whether or not a job is needed. We will also be analyzing trends and employment needs in corporate America as well as jobs overseas.
Automation risk 
		This is calculated based on research from Oxford and Cambridge University.
Personal network
		At the end of the day it’s not what you know it’s who you know, based on degree of separations from employers and people who work in the field you are studying we can see if you will get hired.

personalfinance,How should I tackle my debt?,"23 y/o living in NYC about to finish college and move back home.

I have several federal student loans that total up to 29k.  Interest rates for these loans range from 3.8% to 6.5%.

I also just bought a new car for 31k.  I put 10k down on it, and now have 21k in debt.  Interest rate 4.64%.  I know this isn't the most ideal APR but I made the mistake in signing for it as I didn't know I could negotiate the APR with the bank.  Credit score was 740, went to 700 with the new loan.

I currently make 22.50/hr, and can work how many hours I want whether its 40-80 hrs an hour.  An 80 hr paycheck after taxes comes out to about 1.2k.

Since I'm moving back home, I have certain expenses taken care of already such as rent and food.  

I currently have 23k in the bank.

I'm just wondering what is the best way to tackle my loan.

My thoughts, NYS offers a get on your feet loan forgiveness program where I may be eligible for up to 24 months of debt relief as long as I make under 50k/year and enrolled in income based repayment program.  My payments under the IBRP is 250 a month, where as if I'm not it's 311/month.

My car payment comes out to 349/month.  I took out a 72 month loan to keep payments low.  I wanted to keep it low in case any emergency arises, I still have cash on hand and my monthly expenses are kept low.  

Should I aggressively tackle my car loan or pay off my student loans first, as it has a higher interest rate.  I personally feel more secure paying off my car loan first, as that is how I travel to work.  Student loans are more flexible in a sense that there is the IBRP and I still have 2.5 years left on forbearance if I need it.  If I pay off my student loans first, I will save more in the long run due to the loans having a higher interest rate.",finance,1462282313

personalfinance,Could use some advice on if we should refinance our home with a lower interest rate / 15 years loan...,"Bought our house 2.5 years ago for $130,500 at a rate of 4.625 for 30 years - just outside of Minneapolis, Minnesota. We've been adding a little bit more to the principle each month as we can, typically around $100. Our payments currently are $1,006/month, and currently we owe around $118,000. 

Our house was built in 1941, so there are some areas that could use some improvement: updated kitchen, new garage &amp; concrete pad (this garage is one shade away from being dilapitated), new concrete steps and walkways, new roof, added bathroom, drain tile in an unfinished basement...


I'm trying to work with my SO to prioritize what we should do to best benefit ourselves. We were recently pre-approved for a 15 year 2.75% loan, but we have some options to assess. 

Should we:

1.) Take a 15 year mortgage loan for approx $122K (after taxes and fees) on our home at this much lower interest rate, we can get rid of the PMI, and payments would increase approx. $150/month. No improvements. 

2.) Consider 15 year mortgage loan at 2.75%, but take out $135K for making improvements. In that add'l $10k (after added taxes and fees) repairing the roof, other small improvements? Payments would increase to approx. $1,180/month. Would also rid of the PMI fee.

3.) Consider refinancing to a 30 year loan at a lower interest rate than we are paying now (likely around 3.6% conservatively), take out $175,000 to make improvements like new garage, concrete, roof, draintile - waiting on kitchen. Payments would be approx $1,100/month. 


Adulting is so hard sometimes! ;)

Other factors:

Ideally, we'll stay in this home for 10 years - we live right on a parkway, with beautiful views less and stationed less than 5 miles from downtown Minneapolis. A light rail train station is going in a half mile from us, it will increase property taxes, but hoping that it also increases property value as well. 

After living there, we have a great opportunity for our 3BM, 1BA to be a rental - most rentals in our area are going for $1,500/month - but those rentals have a usable garage of some sort. Ours just houses the lawnmower :(

Comparable houses in our neighborhood are currently selling for between $180K-$220K. We lucked out and got a steal on a house in a very desirable area three years ago, just took forever for the paperwork to go through.

I am from the UK but I will be studying in the US this August (MA psychology). I will be in $56,000 debt after 2 years. I do want to complete a PhD/PsyD as well.

Now, the question is what interest rate type and repayment length should I opt for? I haven't fully thought this through, but I think I want to repay the entire debt before starting my PhD/PsyD. 

Now, the variable interest rate is 2.5% to 8.8%. The fixed is 4.8% to 10.5%. This is for the 5 year repayment length (Citizen's bank)

What are your advice/opinions? Going for the doctorate level of study immediately after my Master's seems scary as I will be facing a monstrous level of debt, especially for an international student.

personalfinance,Help focusing on efforts,"Hi all. Lost my job last year and burned through my emergency fund and just finished paying my parents off for the money they gave me. That was my priority and now I'm onto my next: vanishing the other debts. I just need some advice. 

About me: 28, graduated college 6 years ago, no plans to attend again. Single, no children. Live with partner and their child, age 7. Credit score of 732.

Income: $2110 after taxes and 401K contribution 

Bills
Rent and Utilities: $400. This will not change.

Chase Visa: $200. Balance is $10,583, 9.5% APR. Never charge anything to this, made many dumb mistakes before in college. Minimum payment is $189.

Store AMEX: $100. Balance is $1650. 22.24% APR. This just got away from me during a depressive time and I spent my feelings. Minimum payment is $42.

Car: $259, balance is $7,811 1.5% APR Payoff in November 2018

Insurance: $73/ month 

Private student loan: $189/ month. Balance of $18,366.11. Interest is around 6% I believe.

Federal student loan: $119/ month. Balance of $10,735, interest is 6.55%

Cell: Google Fi so varies but most will be $55 which I budget for (usually around $35/month though)

Emergency fund balance is $487

I spend about $70-$90 a week on gas and household groceries and supplies. This hasn't changed in 6 months. This leaves at least $300 a month that was going to paying off family. Now that I'm done with that, what is the best way to direct my focus.

personalfinance,[Other] Am I able to ask which is a smart financial move when it comes to financing an engagement ring?,"Hello all,

Like the title says, not sure if I can ask this here. 

Looking for some second opinions and advice.

Looking to get engaged but obviously I'm a little short on the $7k-ish price point. I was wondering what would be a better option... Financing through the jeweler and paying it off through them (usually have something like 12 months no interest deal). Or do I get a loan from my bank and pay off the ring on the spot (but then pay the loan off, hopefully at a longer finance period). Or I was thinking, Finance through the jeweler...pay out of pocket for the no interest year...then take out a loan from the bank (for an obvious smaller amount) and then pay off the remainder with the bank loan...then pay off the bank loan. 

I don't mind paying the debt because I have a set steady income but I don't want to get wrecked with interest. I know I'd have to find out APRs and interest rates as well.

Any advice is much appreciated and if this isn't the correct place, I'd love to be directed to the correct subreddit.

Thanks!!",finance,1462290894
personalfinance,What should I tackle next? Can I remodel?,"Ok, so here's the stats you guys are going to ask for: 

- $8,000/month income

- $10K in emergency fund.

- $17K in retirement fund that I contribute to regularly



Debt:

- Owe $117K on a mortgage @ 4.25% interest rate

- Owe $10K on a car loan @ 1.8% interest rate

- No other debt. No student loans or CC debt.



Two years ago we bought an older home that we've been aggressively paying down to get rid of PMI which we just finally accomplished last month (yay!) 

Wife really wants to remodel the kitchen and we want to eventually set aside $20K for that, in cash. 

In the past year, we've:

- Paid of a car loan

- Paid off $10K on our mortgage

- Saved up our emergency fund

- Funded our retirement accounts 



We are 28 years old....We don't have kids.

I am tempted to say we should pay off that last car loan but the interest rate is so damn low and the payments are very small ($235/month. We currently pay $350/month just to put extra towards it). I think we'd only be saving about $50/year to pay it off now which doesn't seem worth it. We've hit a lot of financial milestones in the last two years and I am thinking it's time to do something we both want to do that will add equity to our home too. We really need a new oven. 

Edit: Regardless of what we choose, we still be putting at least $10K into our retirement this year in addition to the following choices:


Options:

- Pay off that $10K car loan at 1.8% interest rate (Could be done in less than 6 months but does it really matter?)

- Save up the $20K for the remodel (Could be done in a year)

- Continue paying off the house first for some reason? (Would take several years)

- Do something else? 



What should we do? We can throw at least $2,000/month at the goal, whatever we choose. Am I missing something?


Edit: We've only had that huge monthly income for the past year, in case you were wondering why we hadn't done more.",finance,1462292851
personalfinance,"24 today, baby on the way, single income household of 2 (soon to be 3), in debt with plans to return to school. I need some guidance.","Hello PF. I've been a lurker, and have read alot of the FAQs around here and a few topics similar to mine. I am going to give you some info about me, with goal being to make a concise plan of action for the next 2-5 years. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

I went to college from 2010 to 2012. In that time i incurred quite a bit of debt.

The school was 51,000 a year. And while i got about 36,000 in grants and scholarships i had to put about 5000 in with federal sub/unsub loans and 10,000 with parent plus loans. Now, legally these are my father's (parent plus) loans, but in principle they are mine, so i have to pay them.

At the end of 2012, after my fall semester, something went wrong and my aunt could no longer endorse my loans. I could not go back. Because of this, i also could not pay the semester i had just attended because my father not wanting me to be buried in debt insisted i not finish there, and so he refused to sign the papers and all that early in the fall. So i literally only got to do them at the end of the winter break when it was clear i was adamant about going back to Scranton. Too late. My aunt ran into a credit speed bump and could not endorse. (what i now realize was a ploy to strong arm me to stay local and go to city college or something). But because i couldnt pay Scranton they now hold my transcript. (Begnning of 2013)

I begin to work to ""save"" for my transcript. I get a decent job as a cook making around 15/hr and i enjoy having money so i spend it willy nilly. Fast forward to 2015 I have only saved about 2500 out of the 4500 i owed them.
Now lets be clear here, sure i spent my money a bit irresponsibly, but it was hardly *all* of my fault. My father thought since i was working i had to pitch in for groceries or buy my own food, pay my own phone (understandably) supply my own transportation (in nyc thats about 130 a month), and pitch in more for household things. Furthermore, hours were not always certain at my job so i could make anywhere from 200 to 400 per week. 
But my father was sure i made 1600 a month ""enough to pay every bill in this house"". 
**TLDR: Can't afford to go back to college because i defaulted on loans and i owe the school before i get my transcript and I didn't really get to save because i had to spend what i was earning just to eat,commute, pay my essential expenses, and ""pitch in"" as well as pay the parent plus loan (and his personal loan, which he was lying to me saying was *all* for my loan).**

Now fast forward to 2016. I managed to get a job in a hospital as a registrar and even joined the local 1199 Union. 
Still havent saved much and i defaulted on my loans (but not on the parent plus loan, ive since been only paying my portion which is $180 per month). I also started the Loan Rehabilitation process, to get back into good standing on the loans that i defaulted on and so that i can keep paying it and hopefully get back into school and hopefully defer it.

My partner is pregnant and due in 9 weeks. Does not work anymore. Will start working maybe in 21 weeks. I only make 2000/month, and pay my father 500/month to shack up in the spare rooms. However we had about $1800 saved and mostly everything went towards the baby shower (sadly i let my sister plan the event). It was the most infuriating and sad moment knowing that we would throw such an expensive baby shower, and not even receive $800 worth of gifts in return. I wish i never put my sister in charge, and i wish i was more involved. So now the next couple checks will go straight into my expenses and nothing more. Im pretty much in the red zone for a month.

**2000-take home + 190** monthly federal benefits since she's pregnant and unemployed 
500- rent

269- phone (mine and hers, paying off her new phone)

300- food (sometimes more sometimes less(

180- Parent Plus Loan

10-   netflix

10-   spotify

69-   gym (will be switching to blink most likely which is 20/month)

5-     Loan Rehabilitation monthly amount for 9 months

164- Commute expenses

20-   Monthly haircut

**Debt**
33,000- federal sub and unsub

4500-    last semester studied at University **Need to pay to get transcript**

18,000- Parent plus loan

**$$Saved**

2500- towards my transcript


As you can see, i have a tough situation ahead. It is not insurmountable, but it will take lots of effort, responsibility and self restraint .
I am also looking for a place to move to when my SO can work again because, we just need to have our own place. My father deserves his privacy and place of peace. Lastly, we still need to purchase a few baby essentials (crib set, stroller, car seat for big items, and lots and lots of diapers).

I hope somebody can give me some guidance as to which situations to tackle first and such. Anything is appreciated, even if you just want to say hi. That's cool too.

personalfinance,Interesting situation with the mother in law,"So, this is an odd situation that came up today regarding my mother in law.  
  
My mother in law owns her home in FL free and clear.  She has been dating her boyfriend seriously for some time now and there is a good chance they will get married.  
  
The boyfriend does not currently own a home, but the idea was floated that he purchase 50% of the mother in law's home.  The majority of this money would go to my wife in order to pay down some of her law school loans.  I have a couple questions regarding this.  
  
-Is this a good idea or not a good idea, both from the mother in law and boyfriend's view as well as my wife and I's view?
  
-We are debt free except for the wife's law $200k+ school loan which is federal and already on ibr.    That being said, when wife's grandparents pass away the loan will be paid off.  We would also like to buy a house within 5 years.  If we DO receive a windfall, does it make sense to use it to pay down the loan that will be paid off anyway or invest it/use it for a home purchase?  We both save pretty aggressively for retirement already.
  
-Is there anything that needs to be done in a legal sense to protect any kind of inheritance that is due to my wife now that my mother in law might get married?

personalfinance,What should I be thinking about if I want to buy a house in a potentially tumultuous housing market?,"I am extremely motivated to buy a house in the next 1-3 years. My fiance (we’re getting married before the purchase for sure) is graduating in December, and already has job offers. I recently got a great job and am re-building my emergency fund and maxing my Roth IRA before starting to save for a house. We have a very clear goal in mind and we will have a (thank god) reasonable income to be making this goal happen.

**What I need from Reddit is a solid critique of my plan/thoughts to see what I’m missing and what I should be thinking about, since I value any information/experience others have had.**

First, starter homes (3 bed, 2 bath, 1400-1800 sqft) in our area (city/town in CO that’s not Denver) have gone up from about $200k (in 2013) to now between $290-330k and are in incredibly short supply--lots of investors paying $10k+ over asking with cash. In the price range of $350-$390k, you can get a pretty significant upgrade in terms of quality, location, and a bit more room, and you have less intense pressure when buying. Part of the current trend may be the Denver housing shortage. Part of this is probably the draw of the quality of life in our city (we have had a huge increase in population over the past 4-8 years). The extreme popularity of those slightly smaller homes may be explained by the lack of affordable housing, so people are stretching just to make a $300k price tag work. I have heard estimates that the housing market may calm down over the next couple years, and I have heard estimates that housing prices will double in the next 10 years. There is obviously no way to predict the future.

Our combined income will be ~$110k, we have great credit scores (high 700s), and plan to aggressively pay off our combined $20k in car/student loan debt (estimated debt-free date: late summer 2017). With this plan (including a $15k e-fund we don’t touch), we’re looking at about $10k toward a down payment by May 2017 and probably closer to a $50k down payment by May 2018. I’m guessing we could qualify for a mortgage somewhere between 300k-350k, but we can’t get pre-approved until my fiance is working (I am assuming, since job offers aren’t concrete enough to base a loan off of).

So here are some of my thoughts/questions:

* $10k down is a joke, but I’ve known people who make that work and just pay more PMI (our $50k wouldn’t even be 20% down…). We plan to pay our initial mortgage very aggressively until we can drop PMI, then potentially refi into a 15-year (for the interest rate).

* Our rent is increasing at 6% every year and it’s really starting to put a dent in our budgets. Moving is completely out of the question because, quite literally, the only places in our city right now that are below our current rent are studios and 1-bedroom apartments. We’re in a 3-bed 2-bath townhome right now, and paying at least $300/month under what this would be normally renting for. We’re also hoping to use our history as renters in our current place as a little bit of bargaining power if we need any flexibility on our lease when we do buy.

* I can’t decide if it would be worth pushing for a nicer, slightly more expensive house and just throwing gobs of money at our mortgage for 2-3 years until PMI is gone, or pretty much overpaying for a cheaper house that is $30-$60k less expensive and technically more reasonable to budget for. Ideally, we’d like a house in the slightly bigger range (no bigger than about 2100 sqft) with the better location, since we’re planning on staying for a long time.

* If we push to buy asap, there is a risk this is an inflated bubble and we might go underwater damn quick. But if we can afford the mortgage and we’re planning to live there 10+years, history has shown real estate generally eventually recovers its value, so is that really such a huge risk?

* If we wait until we have a solid down payment and housing prices keep their steep increase, we may get priced out of the nicer homes and get stuck paying way too much for a bottom-rung house.

* Is it worth just getting approved and ready for the 2017 buying season, just in case we actually find something worth going for? I know it takes many, many, MANY offers on many houses before actually snagging one, and we can at least start the learning process that year, even with our paltry down payment. Or is this a waste of time in such an intense market?

* What can I be doing right now to prepare for all this? I’ve been doing some reading and visiting some open houses, but I am the kind of person who likes to be as prepared as possible before beginning such a huge process.

Any feedback would be extremely appreciated, as I’m feeling like I don’t quite have a good grasp on the nuances of this situation. Thank you!",finance,1462294183

personalfinance,Self-employed and want to reduce taxes - Can you explain retirement plan options please?,"Hey all,

Myself and my wife are both self-employed in the US, with no debt and a six-month emergency budget. We'd like to invest some of our disposable income into retirement planning, and after the tax bill last year, we'd like to do it in the most tax-efficient way possible, and reduce our modified adjusted gross income for the Affordable Care Act, if it makes sense to do so, although our profits have increased this year, so we may not get below threshold.

Essentially, what I would like to do is reduce both the self-employment (medicare, social security) and federal income tax that we need to pay by putting money into retirement funds. These are the retirement fund types that I know of, and my (possibly incorrect) understanding of each:

- Traditional IRA - You don't pay tax now and can reduce your declared income by that amount, which reduces federal taxes owed. It has no impact on self-employment tax. We already have these setup.

- ROTH - You pay tax on it now, but not when you withdraw in retirement. No impact now on federal or self-employment tax. We already have these setup.

- Other options - This is where I get confused - As far as I know, there are three main options - Simple IRA, SEP, and solo 401K - I don't know if any of these are better than the traditional IRA plan or why, so I'd be grateful for any advice.

Other information: We're a small business just employing my wife and I - Expected takings this year will be c. $70 - 80K, with around $55 - 60K profit and we expect to be able to put around $10K into retirement plan(s). 

If someone can explain what our options are (especially with SEP, Simple and solo 401k) we'd really appreciate it.

Thanks so much.

Secular stagnation due to declining birthrates and economic models built by consumption growth. Everyone I talk to talks about not enough resources, too many people, the world is overpopulated and takes a Malthusian view.

This means less people buying cars, buying houses, buying refrigerators, grocery shopping, it means less profits for companies selling those things, it means less employment as companies seek to make themselves more efficient rather than ramp up their sales force, R&amp;D and production.
The whole world is turning Japanese, it means innovation will stagnate, it means cyclical commodities are in a permanent decline, it means we are stuck permanently in a world of low interest rates, it means there will be very few good investments in developed markets, it means emerging markets are the only place to look for growth in the next 50 years.",finance,1462295577

I try to keep a little buffer. My savings gets built through checking purchases at small increments so it seems like I'm not even doing any work to build it. Not quite the 2 months of expenses but I prefer to put the money at the loans when available.  

&amp;nbsp;


I have an excel spreadsheet I update showing all loans and bills and interest accrued so I can track progress, see what I owe in total and what interest I'm eliminating. I accrue $347.78 in interest each month right now which is horrendous to look at, but that number used to be over $400 last summer so yay! Progress!  

&amp;nbsp;


After paying off all of my bills I attempt to put an extra $1000 toward my highest interest loan (sallie mae), but I find myself occasionally not being able to reach that when doing something like buying tires or going on vacation. Since starting my career last June I have managed to eliminate around 7K in student loan debt, and around 9.5K total debt. I currently have a roommate, but he doesn't clean and his stuff is all over the living room. His cat is also terribly annoying (perpetual ""yowling"", probably needs to be fixed and he won't do it, cat is super cute though). I told him I'd re-lease with him again because I think it saves me around 300-350 a month, but I also can afford my own place which seems more appealing. Would this be a bad move? I'm out of my apt. and with my SO a lot, but we've only been together since January and as much as I'd love living there and saving super money, my gut says, ""whoa there, too early"". 

&amp;nbsp;

 
Should I just stick it out and live with roommate again instead of opting for my own place? I have no qualms other than the aforementioned annoyances.  

&amp;nbsp;


Did I make a huge mistake with the car? I love it. I really do and I plan on driving it long after it's paid off.  
Should I focus paying my car off to free up the $375 a month I'm spending on it? Shifting focus to that tells me I can pay it off within the next two years and the total interest accrual difference won't be that much anyway with that aggressive of payments.  

&amp;nbsp;


Eating out, drinking and going to concerts/events seems like my biggest flexible expense. I don't really want to live frugally because that's not for me. I've been trying to purchase groceries and eat at home lately because it's healthier and I save a lot, but it just seems so time consuming sometimes. I like to workout by running/biking/rock climbing/skateboarding so not going to a gym helps out a bit, and I love playing videogames which can both be cheap and expensive at times. I should have my next sallie mae loan paid off hopefully mid June. I have my year review coming up and think work has gone really well. I've gotten credentials though my company (LEED AP BD+C) and hope that with my work will translate into a raise. I'll be able to start a 401K after this year review as well which I guess I should contribute to according to what I've heard 'round these parts.

personalfinance,Credit score is poor. Need to have a personalized way to fix it while building credit.,"Hi r/personalfinance. If you dig through my previous posts, youll see I was in a bit of a conundrum. I have since moved out of my father's house and am living in San Francisco. I make roughly 54K. My rent is 1000, utilities equal to 100. My student loans are 28K. 

Further detail on my credit past: 
-$200 on a 4 year old comcast bill -paid off (went to collections) 
-$465 on a BoA secure credit card- paid off (went to collections)
-$600 tickets - paid off
-$700 traffic infraction, reduced down to $200 - need to pay off 
-$1100- student account (newly went into collections, 500 was taken from the IRS 1500-1100) 
-$305 student loan payments (established 5/21/16) 

All of this was paid off using my federal tax return on 4/16/2016. 

You're wondering why I have so many things that went into collections. It's because at the time, my mom was going through terminal end-stage cancer and passed away. I was trying to graduate as fast as I could to be with my mother. Once I graduated, I helped my mother as much as emotionally possible until she passed away. The last thing on my mind was taking care of my finances. I had a babysitting job that I had to leave and couldn't afford to keep up the bills. Finances were tight for everyone in my family. My father was supporting 4 people including running the household, the last thing I wanted to do was ask him for money. I ended up getting an internship lasting for about a year (unpaid) and incurred parking violations during my time. I'm now taking a much more accountable approach to managing my finances and need to build the credit score. 

What can I do? I have been told to get a car loan, there is the secured credit card. My then secured credit card was closed so I don't know if I can re-establish it. Any advice would be appreciated. I don't want to try to open credit cards if it it will only hurt my credit score.",finance,1462307796

personalfinance,Can I start putting money into a Thrift Savings Plan I opened as part of an internship?,"During the fall of 2010, I got a full-time internship with the United State Dept. of Defense. As a part of this internship, they opened a Thrift Savings Plan for me and deposited some of my paycheck there for the three months I was with them. By the end of the semester there was $600 in the account. The next semester I did not return there.

I am now currently working full-time as an adult, with a 401K plan through Empower Retirement. I have about $15k simmering in there right now. I continue to receive statements from the Thrift Savings Plan telling me how much interest is growing on my original $600, so I assume my account is still open there. I've heard from others that the Thrift Savings Plan is quite an attractive option in terms of retirement plans, and that it might be worth transferring my money in there. My question is, am I allowed to transfer my money there (and continue to deposit my 401k contributions there) in lieu of my Empower 401k if I no longer work for the federal government?

As a side note, does anyone have any insight on how the Thrift Savings Plan compares with other retirement plans? All of the things I have heard about it so far are from secondary sources, and I would love to get a second opinion on its effectiveness from more experienced sources.",finance,1462309149

First things first--my take home pay is around $2500 per month. I pay $600 for rent, $600 for student loans, Utilities/Gas/Insurance run me $200 a month, about $240 for groceries (for two people). Minimum monthly payments on all of my credit cards (3 total) are usually $400 or so per month (that's with an extra $25-$50 tacked on). Leftover is about $115 per week. 

I own my car outright, and per Kelly Blue Book, it's worth about $8,000.00. My credit card debt is $12,300 between three credit cards (Interest rates between 21%-23% for all three), and  I was recently advised to use my car as equity and take out a low interest loan to pay off the credit card debt. I initially tried to get capital one to lower my interest rate on my cards (they said I didn't qualify for a lower rate), then tried to apply for a P2P loan through lending tree or prosper (prosper said I didn't qualify, lending tree offered loans with interest rates starting at 31%). 

I pulled my credit score from credit karma and it is an abysmal 604. The main problem seems to be that I'm utilizing 55% of my available credit (as well as the recent inquiries from capital one, and my history of sketchy student loan payments, which I finally seem to have under control). 

My questions are (1) is borrowing against my car a bad idea? I hardly drive it, and the equity loan comes with free gap insurance in case it is totaled while I still owe money on the loan. (2) Am I missing a saving/debt payment opportunity black hole in this budget?",finance,1462311221
personalfinance,25 yr old here with massive debt. Feeling completely lost. It would be wonderful to get some guidance.,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

Here is my current situation. 
----private loan debt 130k (payments are roughly 500 a month)
----federal loan debt 30k(payments are 200 a month)
I only recently got onto a repayment plan I could afford. I have been making $1,700 dollar payments from the day college ended because I had to take a 6-month hiatus from completing my degree which voided the grace period. This has destroyed me I feel.

I got to a point where I absolutely could not afford those payments and decided to get on a repayment plan. I was worried about the automatic deductions from my account because I felt like I had no control over the situation( and what happens if I hit a rough patch?) And so I took longer then I should have to get on a plan. I have so many things going on like trying to feed myself and get clothes. 

My credit score has already been reduced to almost nothing because of my failure to make payments on time for a few months. I submitted some paperwork and my payments have been reduced for 2 years.

My Aunt is a co-signer for 2 of these private loans. Defaulting is not an option because they would go after my Aunts income. There is an insane amount of pressure to not fail. I have been driving myself insane trying to work as hard as I can every possible second of everyday. I have to feed myself, I have to eat healthy, I have to make consistent loan payments. God it all feels so hopeless.

I have bad teeth and it causes a lot of anxiety issues. I overthink a lot of situations and this has caused my undue stress as well. My living situation is very strange. I don't have a kitchen I can use so I make slow-cooker meals and use a George foreman to grill stuff.

I am working roughly 50 hours a week and getting $18/hour. Even with that wage I am not able to save anything aka no hope for a car. I can never own a home because of my credit. I can never have a family. 

Welcoming any and all advice, thank you for your time! &lt;3",finance,1462311965

US producers call for suspension of federal inventory transfers

^(26 April 2016)

&gt;An organization representing US uranium producers has called on the Department of Energy to cease transfers of excess uranium from federal inventory until the uranium market recovers from its current oversupplied state.

**VIEWPOINT:**

Russian proposal for nuclear fuel leasing and recycling

At the recent World Nuclear Fuel Cycle conference in Abu Dhabi, a new concept of nuclear fuel leasing was publicly proposed, writes Ian Hore-Lacy.

The leasing concept has been nebulous, but essentially means that the uranium supplier retains ownership right through to accepting back the high-level wastes, relieving the utility of any responsibility for those wastes. For several years the Khlopin Institute in Russia has been developing for Tenex a new fuel recycling model. REMIX (from Regenerated Mixture) fuel is produced directly from a non-separated mix of recycled uranium and plutonium from reprocessing used fuel, with a low-enriched uranium (LEU, up to 17% U-235) make-up comprising about 20% of the mix. This gives fuel initially with about 1% Pu-239 and 4% U-235 which can sustain burn-up of 50 GWd/t over four years.

The used REMIX fuel is then reprocessed and recycled again, after low-enriched uranium top up. The wastes (fission products and minor actinides) are vitrified, as today from reprocessing for MOX, and stored for geological disposal. REMIX-fuel can be repeatedly recycled with 100% core load in current VVER-1000 reactors, and correspondingly reprocessed many times - up to five times according to Tenex, so that with less than three fuel loads in circulation a reactor could run for 60 years using the same fuel, with LEU recharge and waste removal on each cycle. As with MOX, the use of REMIX fuel reduces consumption of natural uranium in reactors by about 20% at each recycle as compared with open fuel cycle. REMIX can serve as a replacement for existing reactor fuel, though fuel fabrication will be more costly due to high activity levels.

btc,The Bitcoin community is lost,"# **Gavin Andresen, co-creator of Bitcoin**

The most important person to Bitcoin was Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.

The second most important person is Gavin Andresen who was Satoshi's direct successor.

In 2010, Gavin became the core maintainer, the chief developer. Andresen’s years of full-time work on the Bitcoin code has brought us, users and developers, to where we are today. He has always been a great man with good intentions. Good intentions, which lead him to give away his powerful position because he believed it was the Good thing to do for the community. 

This great man - who took Bitcoin from its baby stage through the toddler stage into today's teenage stage - has been betrayed by the community.

# **Gavin's commit access revoked**

Capitalistic company Blockstream has revoked the commit access of Bitcoin's father, with no intent of restoring it. ^[1](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hky3n/gavin_andresens_core_commit_access_unlikely_to_be/)

The community should be **outraged**. But the Bitcoin community doesn't bat an eye. ^^[2](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoin)

# **Blockstream hijacked a currency way faster and easier than the FED**

The FED called itself the ""Federal"" Reserve to make it sound as it was controlled by the government, while in reality it's a private bank with private shareholders with profit motivation.

Bitcoin was originally created to be a currency not controlled by something like the FED. It was a smart answer, built by smart people like Satoshi and Gavin.

But today, in 2016, it's openly being controlled by Blockstream. Blockstream, an entity that doesn't even hide its true identity: A private company with profit motivation, which can openly outcast its creator. 

The Bitcoin community is hating on the FED (a private bank) while allowing its coin to now be controlled by a private company with private shareholders with profit motivation.

While the US population has been deceived by the carefully and well-constructed tricks of the Federal Reserve, 

the Bitcoin community on the other hand has given away Bitcoin to an entity that didn't even need to go as far as deceiving or hiding its form nor its intentions. 

The smart people (Satoshi, Gavin, and their early adopters) who invented Bitcoin as a reaction to the FED, 

have now been effectively outnumbered by the dumber crowd who brainlessly follow the loudest voices (Theymos, Adam Back, Luke Jr and their followers)

personalfinance,(CAN) Pay off variable mortgage early?,"Hi r/PF,

I currently have a variable mortgage (15 years left) at prime minus 0.6% which means the current interest I pay is 2.1%. I have the ability to make extra payments to the principal of my mortgage, and the yearly allowable amount is more than I could ever feasibly contribute, so let's assume that all of my savings can be put towards the mortgage pre-payment.

I already have a healthy emergency fund, and my only other debt is my car loan (2.5% for another 4 years, $300/month).

If I wanted to save $500/month, should I pay down the principal of my mortgage, or invest that money in index stocks in a tax-free savings account (I believe this would be equivalent to a Roth IRA in the US)?

I know the traditional view is that I should invest the money (earning on average 5%+ in the stock market long term) instead of paying down my mortgage early (which only saves me 2.1%).

But how does this change since I am on a variable mortgage? 

If I make a pre-payment now, and in 7 years interest rates jump up to 5-10%, will I have made any additional savings because I paid off the mortgage early, and would owe interest on a lesser balance if rates should rise?


If rates rise, are all my previous pre-payments ""worth more,"" because even though I made them when rates were low, I now have a smaller amount that the new higher interest rate is calculated on?",finance,1462326374
personalfinance,Valuing PMI paydown,"I have a mortgage with PMI, and have recently started to think I've been undervaluing paying it down in comparison to investing. One root problem is that it doesn't act like normal loan interest, so a straight ""I can make *x*% investing or save *y*% prepaying"" doesn't really quite work. (The effective APR of PMI also rises as you get closer to the removal mark, and I haven't thought about this in enough detail for quite some time apparently.)

Suppose I scale prices and payments so that the purchase price of my home was $100K. Then:

* My interest rate is 4.125% (not scaled, obviously)
* With no pre-payments, I would reach $80,000 in about 58 months (and be able to request PMI removal at that point; for purposes of this question, assume the house does not change in value)
* My current balance is around $89,600
* My monthly P+I payment is $460
* My monthly PMI payment is about $43

I can imagine a couple of ways to figure an ""effective APR"" of the PMI, and I'm not sure which one makes more sense. Both figure PMI as a rate based on just the $9,600 portion of the loan until the PMI-removal mark.

1. The first way is to say that $43/month in PMI is 0.44% of the overall balance, times 12 months gives about 5.4%. Add 4.125% and that means I'm paying about 9.5% effectively.

2. The second way is more complicated. Pretend I'm paying only interest on the $80K loan; that means $275 month. The other $185/month, including its entire principal amount, is paying down a 58-month loan on $9,600. (That loan at 4.125% would have monthly payments of $183, so there's only a small amount of approximation error.) However, while PMI is active I actually have a payment of *$228* on that $9,600 loan, because of PMI. What interest rate gives a $228/mo payment with those terms? About [13.9%](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/auto/auto-loan-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=9600&amp;years=4.833&amp;terms=58&amp;interestRate=13.900&amp;loanStartDate=02+May+2016&amp;show=false&amp;showRt=true&amp;monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&amp;yearlyPaymentMonth=+May+&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&amp;oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Jun+2016&amp;ic_id=auto_loan_calc_calculate_btn).

Anyway, I have the following questions:

1. Either way, it looks like paying down PMI should be a priority; and it'll only become moreso as the removal date approaches. Anyone see a reason to disagree with that?
2. I am intuitively surprised that these two methods don't produce the same results. Anyone see why not?
3. Can anyone give a compelling reason to prefer one of the valuations? Is there something else to use instead? 

(Assuming the answer to #1 is ""no reason to disagree"" then #2 and #3 are somewhat academic, but interesting nevertheless I tihnk.)",finance,1462327178

I've had great luck with building mine up after a few years of letting my credit cards lapse/close due to non-use. So, I'm now a solid user with a Discover IT and Capital One Quicksilver. I'm extremely happy with these, and could go without another card in my life, at this point.

My wife has two older cards. She is a 100% perfect user, never any late payments, a decent amount of money through the cards, like for gas, groceries, going out, shopping, etc. She uses credit instead of debit everywhere, and just pays it back at the end of the month, never carrying a balance from month to month. The first card is a BankAmericard Rewards Platinum card. She earns points, and then trades them in for gift cards. She had it since high school, and they've never increased the limit for her, in addition to the mediocre rewards. She tried to call and ask them to do so, since she has seen Discover and Capital One both increase my limits without asking, no hard pull required. And just for fun, I've clicked the button on those two cards' sites when logged in, to increase credit limit, and the companies just did it for me, again no hard pull, no fuss. So she calls Bank of America, and they give her some runaround about it being ""federal law that they perform a hard pull to do that."" Obvious BS, unless they're held to some standard that no other lender is. Her second card is the American Express Macy's card, which has been converted to a Plenti card. Compared to my Quicksilver, and my Discover, it's pretty piss-poor with regards to rewards. We opened it years ago because the 3% back at Macy's and 1% everywhere else was decent, we just made Macy's our go-to store.

So, she doesn't want any hard pulls. If she is going to take the hard pull on her report, she's going to go to a real top-tier card, one of the ones that the MyFico people drool over, like Citi Double Cash. We don't care about APR. We feel like the travel rewards cards are decent, but kind of lock you in to a particular vendor. So, PF, help me out personally here. If she can convince either, or both Bank of America and American Express to roll over her cards to one of their others, which should she push for? Which would be best if she's building up a stable of cards alone, and which would be best to complement my cards if we factor in my ""membership,"" as I could just add her to mine if she needed the bonuses? What ""premium"" cards, preferably without annual fees (although we're open to it, if it ends up more than paying for itself) with tons of bonuses are for her? Her credit score is higher than mine. She's incredibly responsible with credit. There's no reason that I should have a Quicksilver Visa Signature with all of the awesome capabilities like no foreign transaction fee, high cash back, extended warranty, etc etc, considering my relatively recent reintroduction to credit, and she's stuck with these Mickey Mouse accounts.

**The Basics:** 22 years old, recent college grad (December), first real job (starting Monday). 

**Annual Salary: $72,500**

**Total Debt: -$173,871** 

**Monthly Income (After taxes): $4,021.38**

Monthly Expenses: 

Car Insurance - $100 

Food - $100-150 (Guestimate) 

Gym - (Uncertain of the cost but will be a minimal expense)

(No rent or anything etc because I will be living at home until I pay down this obnoxious amount of debt :o)

So basically, my plan of attack is thus: Next week when I start work I'll receive a signing bonus of $5,500.00 less applicable withholdings (living in NJ, not sure what the tax rate is on an employee bonus?). I plan to use that bonus to immediately pay off both balances on my credit cards. The remainder as well as my salary for the month of May will be used to pay the auto loan in it's completion.

Starting in June I will begin making payments on my college loans. Thus far my plan of attack has been to snowball going from Loan A-&gt;B-&gt;C. However while typing up this post it seems it may make more sense to avalanche down from Loan C given the interest rates on those loans and how much interest has already accrued?   

Here was my original plan: 

**Loan C has a minimum payment of $1,438/m**

**Loan B has a minimum payment of $348/m** 

I would make both of those payments each month bringing my cash down to $2,235.38. I plan to subtract $500 a month for personal expenses (car insurance, food etc) bringing me to $1,735.38. 

My dad will be assisting me in the repayment of my loans with anywhere from $500.00 - $1,000.00/m. Assuming It's $1,000.00 I will take the remainder of my income + Dad's money totaling: $2,735.38/m and put it towards first Loan A (about 4 months) until it's complete, then Loan B (about 10 months), then finally Loan C (about 1.8 yrs). 


My question after all that is is this a viable plan/my best option or do you wonderful people have any ideas/suggestions that may help me out?

Also -- my employer offers a 401k plan with 6% matching which I would love to contribute to however my thinking is that the prospect of being debt free in the immediate future is more important to me than the contributions I could be making over the next 3 years. I know with compounding interest the return on money contributed would make it well worth it but I kinda think the freedom to say quit my job or something in a few years time outweighs that for me? If that makes sense..

We are US Nationals living abroad. Mind if I throw some numbers your way? I just don't know if we are missing anything, don't have enough, etc. 

Who we are:

M/F 28. Two kids, aged 4 and 2. Married 4 years. 

Base Salary:

**$46,632**

Monthly Income: **$4400** (We get an additional monthly stipend that goes straight to our car loan)


ASSETS:

- **$19,500 in the State Retirement System** for 4 years of service (My husband is a teacher). As he is no longer working for the state, the account will not accrue interest until/unless he comes back to work for the state in the future. 

- **$15,121 in an online traditional savings account** earning 1% APY (1 year old)

- **$5600** in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares (3 months old)

- **$5600** in Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund Investor Shares (3 months old)

- **$1900 in a Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 Fund Traditional IRA** (1 year old)

- Approximately **$6,000 in liquid cash** in our primary checking/ savings account with the foreign bank where we live. ^This ^money ^is ^actually ^held ^in ^the ^local ^currency, ^and ^not ^in ^USD. 

DEBTS

Credit Card Debts- **NONE!** Recently paid it all off. Poor credit in the meantime (650?) and hoping to improve with time. 

Car Loan: Equivalent to **$8,000 at a 1.5% interest** rate with the local bank here, held and paid in foreign currency. We are on track to have this paid off in 12 months. 

Mortgage/Housing Debts or Payments: None

Student Loan Debt: **$19,500 at 6.8% Interest** 

My husbands Student Loan Forgiveness application was recently accepted. If the bank actually follows through, they will forgive $17k and we can easily wipe the rest clean in one fell swoop. We are hoping to have this resolved in a matter of weeks, but the bank has been a nightmare to deal with so we aren't holding our breath. 

My husband has never paid on this loan, and it's past due by like 90 days. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED. Whatever, we're trying to get it taken care of now. 

* What should our next steps be? How much should we have saved for retirement by now? In 5 years? 

* Can my husband's credit ever recover from having the negative marks from that student loan there?

* I'm stressed out that we will never get ahead. We came here with the goal of saving 50% of his income, but so far we've only managed to save $6,000 in 9 months. Please tell me there's some good news in all of this.",finance,1462347609

&gt; **Priceline Group** — The travel services website operator reported adjusted quarterly profit of $10.54 per share, outdistancing estimates of $9.65 a share.

personalfinance,Husband is about to be unemployed as of May 27th. Can we do this?,"Hello!
I recently posted our budget, but as it turns out, my husband is going to be unemployed as of May 27th. He's in nursing school (ASN program) and his current employer had been accommodating his schedule; sadly, they will no longer be able to do this for the next semester.

He is actively looking for jobs and was recently offered a job as a tech at the hospital I work at. Unfortunately, they require a mandatory two-week orientation, and he can't miss two weeks of classes. He's trying to see if there will be an orientation during his summer break in August, but then the job probably won't be open that far into the future.

He has lab and clinicals, so it's going to be tough to find a job that will work around his schedule. If for some reason, he can't get a job for the year that he'll be in school (he graduates next May), I'm wondering if it's possible for us to live ""ok"" on just my income. 

I am putting 20% into retirement (I'm 28 and have about $16k in there). I am wondering if I should reduce this to maybe 10 or 15% so we have extra money left over each month.

We have $25k in savings, $15k in sinking funds, and the only debt is $13k in student loans with a 4.75% interest rate (minimum payment is $124 per month). 

At my hospital job, I make $3400 per month, after 20% to retirement, medical, taxes, etc. I have been able to pick up extra shifts, which gets me closer to $4000 per month, but that is dependent on the census, which has been low. I have a part-time job making $32.50 per hour, but work has been pretty scarce; I'd say I average about 10-15 hours per week lately. So, that probably brings in another $1000-$1200 per month, on a bad month. So total is about $4400, on average. Back when DH was working full time and I was working both jobs, our monthly income was at least $7k :(

We live in a VHCOL area (DC suburbs in Northern Virginia - hate it) and we're looking to jump ship as soon as DH graduates.

Rent: $1475 - just went up from $1435... this starts next month; includes trash, water
Cell phones: $140 - my contract ends in August. We'd like to switch to a cheaper plan.
Internet: $76 - we got rid of cable last year.
Insurance (car, renter's, personal property) - $160
Electric: ~$100 - most it has been was $150, though I guess we'll be using the AC more now that it's warmer.
Hulu/Netflix: $11

We spend a ton on groceries/eating out. I'd say ~$700 per month.

Cars are paid off. DH just put about $1800 worth of work into his car. I drive a Prius, so probably only fill up twice per month (both of us only commute about 15 miles each way).

Does this seem doable? 

Thanks.",finance,1462373330
personalfinance,Mortgage Advice: Down payment versus liquid assets,"Hi all,

I've been doing a great deal of research before my first home purchase. I understand most of the basics surrounding mortgages and have run through calculator after calculator, but I'm in a fairly unique position and am looking for some various perspectives on my situation. (all currency US$, South East USA location)

I'm looking to purchase a house for 175K, and I have about 110K in liquid assets to play with. I also have a steady income stream of about 10K per month, and I'm 25% owner of a business LLC. I obviously don't want to put all of my savings into a down payment since there are plenty of costs coming my way (extra furniture, repairs, etc.) including potential job loss and business expenses, but I'm curious what you folks would do given the same situation.

My current idea is to put down around 70-90K on a 15-year fixed rate to minimize the interest rate and eliminate PMI, then make two monthly payments: one for the standard payment including interest and a second larger payment straight to principal to pay the mortgage off early.

Does this seem solid? Is there anything you'd do differently?

What factors would cause you to cash them in and when? If the interest rate is below a certain percentage, are they better off being cashed once mature (face value) and invested? 

Specifically, if I'm paying back student loans, it seems that leaving a bond that has reached face value to accrue interest at 1.25-3.4% is a worse investment than cashing them and putting them each towards the loan debt (highest interest rates from 7.75-6.5%) as early as possible after they reach face value rather than waiting for them to mature at those low interest rates. Since they are paper bonds (or whatever), my family was able to purchase them at 50% face value, so reach face value is already a huge return on their investment in me.

The above assuming that I'm living below my means with a 3-month emergency fund, but not saving a lot of money at a time after reaching 3rd Green Box (Moderate Interest Debt).",finance,1462382806

personalfinance,"23 years old, over 160k in student loan debt, and my 50k salary isn't making a dent in anything. I need advice.","Hi reddit! At my boyfriend's suggestion, I've finally come to you for help. I graduated from undergrad last May with about 110k (principal) in 2 private loans, 30k (principal) in various federal loans, and 20k to my alma mater for my last unpaid semester. 

I make 50k pretax, but 4% pretax contributions to my 401K (**~$90/mo.**) and set amount to my metro card (**~$160/mo**) on top of Maryland taxes (**~$545/mo**) are killing me. We're moving to Virginia at the end of July, so at least those taxes will go down a bit.

I get paid twice a month (15th and last day) and most of my paychecks get thrown right back into school. 

My share of the rent is **$713/mo**. I pay one of my private loans **$392.96** on the 20th of each month. And I pay $487 once a pay period to my alma mater for a total of **$974/mo**. I'm on a 2 year plan with them, so there's nothing that can be changed in that regard. Plus groceries and pet costs for about **$250-300/mo**. Honestly it's rare I can put more than $100 in my savings a month. It's sitting at $2.7k right now but will probably go down once I have to pay my next set of loans. My credit card constantly has a $0 balance - I've learned to use it like a debit card because I get cash back for any payments I make with it. I just transfer money from my checking account to pay it off immediately. When I cash out on those rewards, since my credit card is with BoA, I get 10% just for depositing it into my checking or savings since they are also BoA accounts. So there's something.

My federal loans have been put on forbearance until December, and can continue to be put on hold, but my second private loan was put under a deferment/forbearance for a large student loan burden. They're going to start collecting from me again in June for over $500 (I haven't been given an actual amount yet, but I am in the process of trying to get them to put this loan on another 6 month forbearance before they start collecting again). If it's anything like the last time I had them put my payments on hold, I'll have to pay one full payment before they grant me another forbearance (if they can, that is. I don't know what the policies are for the lifetime of the loan).

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this financial burden a little easier? I've considered consolidation of the private loans, but I also need suggestions for companies to go with (and why).

Much thanks in advance!

EDIT: I'm in the legal field if that makes any difference. However, I have yet to attend law school. This is all taken on from undergrad alone.

EDIT 2: I don't think I want to go to law school anymore. I want to get through this part of my life first before diving into more stress and loans I can't handle. Also - thank you for all the advice. Super helpful stuff!",finance,1462383668

In roughly a month, I'll be starting my Doctorate of Physical Therapy program at an in-state public university, so the costs are much less when compared to a private university. Although this is a benefit, the issue is that I have no money saved up, so paying for PT school will have to be entirely through loans.


Living at home isn't an option seeing as it's an hour commute, and it'd also be a bad option in terms of studying since there are a lot of distractions. 

The whole plan is to rent an apartment over the next three years, as well as paying for tuition, food, utilities, etc. with federal loans at interest rates as high as 6.84% (with the PLUS loans), and possibly several other lower interest loans, such as Unsubsidized and Subsidized. 

Is there a more efficient way to lower the costs of PT school while still being able to attend? PT is a field that I will definitely pursue regardless, and if I do not attend this year, it'll only get harder to get in again during the next few application cycles.

I have officially had my car for a year now. It is a 2008 Maxima... first car purchase at an absurd ~11% interest.

personalfinance,"Parents thinking of selling their rental property, I'm considering buying it off them as a first home and paying them the mortgage.. It seems like a win/win?","Hi there, long time lurker first time poster.
Backstory: Here in Auckland house prices have skyrocketed in the last couple of years, the current 3 bdrm average is now $850,000. Which you generally need %20 deposit for the Banks to lend.
Needless to say, being a first home buyer is difficult.

My parents have a rental, which they are considering whether to sell or keep renting out, it is in an average area (but still better then I could get mortgage approval for), Market Value; $600,000.
I'm thinking about proposing that I buy the house off them for $600,000, and pay them my $55,000 deposit (%9).
Then i would pay them the remaining $545,000 in installments as a mortgage, rather than going through the bank.
My parents really want to help me, and this would be a massive leg up to help get into the market, I just want to make sure that it isn't for some reason going to be really unfair to them. 

Positives:
The way i see it, they will be saving real estate fees by selling to me, and get a steady stream of income, without the overheads on the rental anymore.
For me, i can get into the housing market and move out of my parents house, pay off the property quicker then having a mortgage with the bank,  as i would be paying principal first and a little interest, not sure how much interest to add on though

On the negative side, my parents wouldn't have a lump sum from selling the house, however if over time they needed a lump sum, i could get a loan from the bank and remove it off what i owe them.

personalfinance,SO and I (mid 20s) finally had our lives under control in spite of his $80k in student loans...but just found out today he is losing his job.,"Throwaway because I don't want this linked to my regular account. 

You've heard this story before: SO went to a fancy private college, picked a major to ""follow his dreams"" that wasn't marketable, parents were low income and after scholarships and federal pell grants there was a big hole in funding, so he borrowed $80k. 

He's recently taken over all payments., since his parents had been helping him a bit, and he even started overpaying by several hundred dollars each month. We started to feel like our lives were on track. Combined, we made $90k/year and were doing as well as we could in spite of his debt burden. I was covering more of our living expenses so he could focus on debt. With overpaying, he thought he could pay down the $80k in about 5-6 years. 

Then today, we find out he's losing his job in a few weeks. The small business he has been working at is closing its doors. He should hopefully be able to collect some unemployment. 

Without his salary of $46k, we're down to my salary of $44k (which will go up to $46k in July when my raise goes into effect). I can afford all of our essentials (rent, food, utilities, etc) on my salary, except his loan payments (and don't like the idea of paying his loans for him in general). 

Here's what his monthly minimums for his loans are:

* $189 - Federal Loans

* $40 - Federal Perkins loan paid directly to the college

* $407 - Navient (private)

* $456 - Wells Fargo (private)

* TOTAL: $1092/month

His savings: 

* $13k in an emergency fund (we were afraid his business would one day shut down so thank god he saved an efund 
in spite of his high debt burden) 

* Approx. .$2k in an old Roth IRA

* no other debts

Our essentials budget that I will be covering with my take home pay of $2600/month: 

* Phone: $90

* Utilities: $160

* My IRA: $183

* Rent: $1150

* Gas: $60

* Food: $420 (could probably cut this down some, but I have some dietary restrictions due to a chronic stomach problem)

* Health insurance and costs: $250

* Subscription renewal savings (AAA, renters' insurance, etc): $30

* Leftover for misc expenses/my savings: $257

My main question is how do we handle his unemployment with his student loan payments? Should he try to apply for deferment? What about the private loans - are there any options?

And when do we start applying to defer or forebear? As soon as he is unemployed? Or should we drain his e-fund for a bit before forbearing?

Also, he has a few more paychecks coming, but I think he should just pay the minimums on his loans and put the rest in savings for now instead of continuing to overpay with unemployment looming. What are your thoughts on that? 

Finally, he is paid ahead several months on Navient. Should he just make interest payments for a while to help retain some of his savings?

personalfinance,"(US/VA) Graduating Saturday, Looking for Opinions/Criticisms on Current Financial Plan","Hey r/pf,

I'm looking for some advice/critique of my post graduation plans and current financial situation. I'm currently 21 years old, living at home, graduating in three days with a BS in CE/EE with a minor in CS. 

Current finances/budget: 

* Student loans: 28,373 of federal student loans, varied interest rates, highest of which is 2k@6.8%, average around 4.2%. 9k is subsidized, everything else is unsubsidized. Not currently in repayment, but my graduation date is May 7 (This Saturday). 
* Car repair/maintenance bill of ~800: Shit situation where my car needed to be serviced/new tires during a week where I was out of state for senior design/school stuff+Finals+Work obligations, so that ended up getting done at a dealership as they gave me a ""free"" loaner while it was being done. Got railed on that one. 
* Insurance/phone currently covered by a parent, subject to change. 
* Food/Household/etc: 
* Consumer debt: None. Credit card paid in full every month for ~3yrs now, 9k limit. 
* Girlfriend owes me ~833 for her share of a mattress/bedset, repaid $100/mo, which I'm not worried about. 
* Should be getting a ~$200 travel reimbursement from the University. 
* Car: I own my car outright, worth ~14k at current age and mileage.
* Liquid assets: 21k between my checkings/savings account


Income:

* Currently working as an intern doing software engineering for $15/h, but I've got a full time salaried position beginning May 9 at 60k/year paid biweekly. 
* Company match of 4% contribution to 401k
* Of that 60k, I plan on contributing ~8% to the 401k and maxing my IRA yielding ~12.5k total savings yearly including company match. 
* Using [this] (http://www.paycheckcity.com/coadp2/netpaycalculator.asp) calculator with my state/withholdings from above, this leaves ~3k/month in net pay. 

Current Expenses (Monthly, projected for new income level):


Expense | Cost
---|---
Gas | $100
Gym Membership | $25
Food/household | $300
Couples related activity fund | $300
Min student loan payment according to Nelnet @ 28k total | ~$300
Car insurance(Predicted) | $60
Phone service(Predicted) | $75
Total, excluding housing | $1160

I currently do not pay for car insurance, but have gotten a few online quotes that all end up around $360/6mo based on my current age, car, etc. 
I currently do not pay for my phone, but I bought a Nexus 6P off contract and can switch the service to whatever makes sense if the need arises. Just taking a brief look at the Verizon site, $75/mo is highballing what I'd need to pay monthly for a decent plan. 

I'm planning on aggressively paying down the student loan balance with ~1kish payments monthly depending on living situation. I'll also be taking the ~20k I've got in cash after the car repair bill, subtracting 6mo total expenses, and dropping the rest on the loan balance straight off. 

Living situation: The plan before this past week was to live with a parent for free for a duration not to exceed 6mo (Their offer, stated multiple times over ~4yrs while I was in college) while I get a real budget set up and put a large dent in student loans. My parent told me Monday of this week that this will not be the case, and beginning June 1 they expect $700 monthly for the same living conditions I've had for the past ~5yrs, while keeping the same parent/son ""Do all the chores for the entire household"" mentality. 

Options:

* Pay my parent $700/mo, 1BR, inflexible rules, ""heavy"" household chore burden. Use extra money for student loan repayment. 
* Pay anywhere between 1k-1.3k all inclusive to rent an apartment in a decent area that is in a decent range (&lt;45min drive time) from my work, girlfriend's work, friends/family/etc. Girlfriend would chip in on this, but she works part time/doesn't have significant income. 

I'm leaning towards just paying the $700/mo for a short time(&lt;12mo) and dealing with some BS in order to set myself up to be debt free in the very near future, but its going to be a drain dealing with all of the parent's requests. Side note for the renting from the parent topic, I doubt that the parent will be wanting to write up an actual lease/agreement, which means that they will likely still be of the opinion that I could be ejected from their home as they see fit. Dunno if that's actually something that could happen or not. 

Anyways, I just wanted some opinions on my plans, budget, and the living situation. I'm just looking to be well prepared for the future and have a solid plan that I can adhere to. If I'm overlooking something or have anything calculated incorrectly just let me know and I'll make the necessary modifications.",finance,1462412550

gaming,Is it possible to rescue all 6 hostages in the frigate level of goldeneye on 00 agent?,"Is there a video or a walkthrough somewhere that says how because it's seriously annoying me. 

I know the game allows one death but I wanted to see if I could get every one of them out safely.It seems that with the hostages in neighbouring rooms, there is no way to rescue one without causing the guards to execute the other in the other room.

edit: W00t!!! Nevermind, did it!

Managed it via a method I'd originally tried but given up because of so many failures. Of the two rooms in which there are neighbouring hostages, I took out the guard pointing his gun at the hostage in the room which is filled with computers. I had previously found this impossible because you can't get a good shot at him from the entrance to this room so you have to run up to him before he shoots the hostage which means running in to the room and immediately strafing left around the bank of computers forming an island in the room's centre. Previously I'd strafed all the way to the wall every time just as habit because it eliminates the chance that I might have just not quite strafed left far enough to clear the computer bank and not be able to advance forward. Unfortunately, doing so  means your gun is now pointed at a patch of wall *just* left of the guard you need to kill *every time* reliably. There's no time to aim with crosshair because the guard then always manages to shoot the hostage before you can take him down.

The solution was simple though, just don't strafe so far on entering the room, only a fraction of a second less spent depressing the strafing button means bond strafes left just far enough to clear the bank of computers in the centre of the room, but not so far that his gun isn't already positioned nicely to spray the guard about to execute the hostage with a machine gun. After that you can swing around and take out the second guard who was just to the right of the doorway you came in through.

The crucial thing about this technique is that if you were to rescue the hostage in the *other* neighbouring room first, the guards in the room with the computers seem to either see or hear the commotion and immediately execute their hostage, however for some reason the same does not apply in reverse, even though clearly it should. Just to make *sure* I could save the next hostage I was a bit more conservative and safe and instead of entering the second room from the neighbouring room's door, I instead retraced my steps going backwards from the first room, on to the deck of the ship, back to the bridge and through the pathway which takes you to the room that neighbours the room that had the hostage with the computers. This way, the first guard that your gun is naturally pointed at when you enter the room is the one whose gun is pointed at the hostage so there's very little chance of failing to take him down before he can shoot the hostage.

Any tips would be appreciated. A video would be much prized.",technology,1462424920

gaming,Game key mapping/binding vs. mouse,"Currently I play an 3d MMO called Vindictus... and my friends complain that my video streaming is unwatchable since the camera movements are too sharp.  The fundamental problem, apparently, is that I don't use my mouse for gaming, except to navigate obscure menus; the menus regularly used are bound to keys for instant access.  Since I use a 83-key XT keyboard, I don't have dedicated arrow keys.  My left hand always gravitates towards placing index finger on 'F'.  My current keys are mapped as follows:

Num_Pad 8: move forwards

Num_Pad 2: move backwards

Num_Pad 4: move left

Num_Pad 6: move right

Q: camera pan left

E: camera pan right

R: camera pan up

F: camera pan down

T: zoom in

G: zoom out

S: attack

D: smash (a stronger attack)

A: strafe/dodge

X: kick

Z: pick up

I've tried using mouse for camera in Minecraft, but that just gave me endless headaches, for some reason.  I'm not a person easily made dizzy by heights or disorientation, but for some unfathomable reason I can't stand using mouse for camera movement.  And people keep propounding at me how all 3d games should be played with mouse and WASD keys for movement.  I can't imagine why WASD should be taken before arrow keys: arrow keys suggest movement inherently.  But I pressed onwards, even going to the length of buying a new mouse to encourage its use, but to no avail.  I can't play games using mouse to control camera.

I'd like to know if there are any people like me who are physically unable to adapt to mouse for gaming and prefer 100% keyboard action.  Perhaps it's because I grew up on a diet of platformers or something.

The relevant specs of the laptop are (to my best knowledge):
-1.9 GHz Dual Core AMD Athlon processor
-3GB ram
-Radeon X1270 Video

1)Back about 5 years ago I got fed up with Vista and converted it to run XP and used it as a school/work computer for a while. Since I was planning on reducing its duties to googling &amp; YouTube, I got clever and decided to install Linux Mint MATE x32 in the hopes of running faster and being a cool kid with a Linux machine. After some fiddling it worked perfectly, except for full screen video - which was unviewably choppy. I couldn't find drivers on AMD's website older than the 2000 series, and none of the options in the Mint driver selector fixed my problem. 

2) I then tried Cloudready to try the chromebook route, but video driver issues covered my screen in black triangles to the point where I couldn't see well enough to do anything. I quickly gave up on it.

3) Finally, I admitted defeat and tried to go back to XP, but I had foolishly uninstalled and, in the time since I first installed it years ago, the drivers I had found have become harder to find - to the point where I wasn't able to even get working wifi drivers. Also, I'm a bit concerned about the lack of support for xp as I'd rather this laptop doesn't become a gaping hole in my home network fortress of solitude.

So, that long tale brings me to this point, where I implore those more knowledgeable than myself to guide me. I want this laptop to:
-start &amp; run quickly
-have wifi
-be able to google things
-play fullscreen YouTube videos

I have no preference in OS and am moderately competent when it comes to these things, any help/guidance would be very welcome at this point. Thanks!",technology,1462458047

My thinking was that if gold is a hedge against inflation (and was going wild at the time) then TIPS are too. Since then I've seen the ETF go nowhere (small loss) and now I kind of want to sell it.

personalfinance,I'm a substitute teacher and no state or federal taxes were taken out of my check,"I recently started working as a substitute teacher.  I just got my first checks (I work for two districts) and there were only deductions for Medi &amp; retirement. Nothing was taken out for taxes on both checks and that concerns me because I don't want to owe any money come tax time. 

I have 0 dependents on my W-4 and I chose to take out no additional money from my check because I figured it would come out on its own and HR said subs usually don't do that. 

Should I add a certain amount to come out every month? Or change the number of dependents to 1?

personalfinance,First time homebuyer: should I put down 5% or 10% as a down payment? [Housing],"Hey Reddit! We're about to purchase our first home, and we're a little stymied on how much we should put down upfront.

Basically, we're looking at either a 5% or a 10% down payment. 5% is really comfortable for us, whereas 10% is less comfortable and likely to leave us with a sad looking savings account for a little while -- just enough to cover emergencies, really. 

We've done our homework and have a very good sense on what we'll be able to save under our new budget once we're in the house, and understand the (relatively teensy) difference between our monthly mortgage payments at 5% vs. 10%.

Being that mortgage interest rates are still quite low, is there a real benefit to paying more upfront? Our offer was accepted at 5%, we're anticipating that we may want to move to a different home in 10-15 years (so we're not in a rush to pay this off), and we know better than to get an adjustable rate mortgage. Are we better off just giving ourselves a little more 'padding' in the savings accounts and having our budget have an additional $100 (approx.) dedicated to a 5% down mortgage?

You guys are like a full-on board of financial planners, so I'd love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance for reading and for any advice you can give.

financialindependence,How do you project your savings?,"This topic came up in a couple of threads yesterday, and I am curious how everyone approaches this in their own planning (much of this post is copied from one I had yesterday). In searching through some old threads and reading people's posts on the topic, it seems like most people use a single scenario estimate. This doesn't make sense to me. While I am new to FI, financial projections are my day job, and the tl;dr version is that a single point estimate is fundamentally wrong for this purpose. Even if you have a stable job, salary can change both positively and negatively at any time. So can investment returns. Unplanned expenses can come up as well. I could keep going.

I personally use a very basic multiple deterministic scenario model. Full-bore stochastic model is overkill here in my opinion, and defining standard deviation, VTE or VaR metrics is not helpful since these implicitly assume that the model accounts for a full range of possibilities, which mine does not. Effectively, everything boils down to savings and interest rate, and the level of detail you use to get to these numbers is a personal choice. I create budgets in a separate worksheet and just plug in numbers from there.

1) For short term projections, I have a 5 year projection with all 401K match and other incentives modeled explicitly in addition to an annual budget estimate. My retirement and non-retirement accounts are split in this projection. Then I have 4 scenarios:

1 a) Current salary, no bonus (pessimistic)

1 b) Increasing salary with expected bonus (realistic)

1 c) Largely increased salary with bonuses (optimistic)

1 d) Lose job and am unemployed for 2 years (very pessimistic)

2) For long term projections (10+ years), I recognize that this is a dartboard. I currently have 8 scenarios (this changes occasionally) with varying savings amounts, including similar savings amounts to today, higher savings amounts, and pessimistic scenarios where I'm not working and spending down before retirement. I don't worry about tax-advantaged status of accounts here.

Thoughts? I'm not saying this is perfect, but it does allow me to see what is both likely and possible. I think it's especially helpful for people who are earlier on in their FI journey and not quite on autopilot yet. For example, if you have to make decisions on liquidity versus maxing out retirement accounts. It's also great if you're a young professional with a rapidly, although unpredictably, increasing salary.",finance,1462466994
personalfinance,(UK) Help to Buy ISA and regular ISA help,"First post here so please excuse any mistakes or lack of clear communication or more likely lack of understanding in finances.

I'm a mid 20s Londoner who has been trying to sort out his finances recently as I've not been keeping as close an eye on it as I should have been. I've been buying Premium Bonds, trying to find a good pension provider (still trying to figure this one out so any advice here would also be of assistance), pay back student loans and sorting out current accounts. 

My focus recently has been on my ISA and opening up a Help to Buy ISA.

I was planning on moving my £20,000 ISA to nationwide with an interest rate of 1.4% (up from 0.25% with Natwest) and then open up a help to buy ISA with Santander which gives 4% interest but only allows £200pcm max into it (with £1000 put into it in the first 21 days of opening the account). I cannot continue put money into the nationwide ISA if I do it this way which means a maximum of £2400 per year in ISA allowance (some £12,840 short of the ISA allowance)
 
Today I went into nationwide to talk about moving over my current ISA and mentioned opening a Help to Buy ISA with Santander and they said that they do one also. Theirs offers 2% interest but allows you to continue to put money into your other ISA also. I feel I should open both ISA's this way through nationwide, but just wanted to take the advice of people here rather than jump into something like this.",finance,1462467934

Currently we (me and husband):
Put $1,800/month toward pure savings.

The question is, should we invest it, let savings pile up in an account, or further speed up our mortgage by putting more towards principal. What would yield the best additional money?

Helpful info:

-We are currently paying an extra $2,000/month straight to principal on our mortgage. With our math, our mortgage will be paid off in about 5 years. Interest is at 5%.

-We have an emergency fund that can cover a full year.

-We just bought a car that will be paid off in 3-4 years. Interest rate is 1.9%

personalfinance,Thinking about marriage with student loans,"Hello all-
Please be patient. I rarely post...

My girlfriend and I have been together over four years now. We both made many mistakes in our youth financially, and have slowly been pulling ourselves out of debt and working on our individual credit scores (which are currently still pretty abysmal.) I have federal student loans that I am behind on, but am working with the people to make right. She is signing up for school in the fall. My question is this: we have begun talking about marriage in the future. Neither of us is huge on the idea, as in we don't need it to fulfill our relationship. We are happy together where we are at. But there are some benifits to being married that we are beginning to explore. Should we wait until she is done with school? Will it help or hinder her student loan application to be one or the other? Any advice is appreciated... 

Thanks!

Edit 1: to clarify, we are both 30 years old. Marriage is a piece of paper, we can take it or leave it. We are reasonably sure we are pretty well stick together at this point out of a mutual love and admiration. But if we can wield that piece of paper to our benefit, we happily will. 

Edit 2: thanks for the response guys. To clarify further (on my phone so I've been succinct, sorry) when I say we ""aren't huge on the idea"" I mean that it's not emotionally important to us. And ""it's just a piece of paper"" refers to the emotional commitment. We are looking at it because of the benefits it incurs. If it were going to be detrimental, we wouldn't do it. That's I guess what I'm saying by ""not huge on it."" It isn't some ""we have to get married no matter what!"" We want to be smart about it, and use it to our mutual gain...",finance,1462469286

As of now I've sent a few job apps, not a huge amount, but have an offer from a three letter federal agency as an auditor.  The position requires a security clearance and background check and I'm in the midst of that right now.

Overall the benefits are fairly good. There is potential for weeks of travel, it's easily accessible by public transit and it is a pathway to getting my CPA license (this is a big one). 

However, the base starting pay is less than ideal, and especially so considering what other firms in the Bay Area pay.  I fully understand my place coming out of school, I'm not really exceptional in any way, heck the thought of working at a large tech firm is quite daunting.  However, I haven't signed any forms and I'm not under contract, should I keep applying to look for that sweet tech job? 

Another aspect is the long game, the government isn't going anywhere, and considering the future value of money if I choose to make a career out of government work I could theoretically retire in my 40's with full pension and start a whole new career.

I have been told by many people involved with the engineering schools that the average salary for new grads in my field is $55,000. 

My wife makes $2300 per month take home. She will be completing a one year online Master's degree next year. That approximate cost being $6000 The following year she will be bringing home approximately $2600 per month take home. I have been working from home part time with unsteady income that I plan to stop soon. I will have 12 weeks of good paying internships at $15-$18 an hour the two summers after this one. I plan on getting a full time job this summer at $10-12 an hour, bringing about $3-4,000 before next semester. We currently have approximately $18,000 in liquid assets.

Our total monthly expenses comes to $3-3,500 per month. This includes daycare, mortgage, insurance, etc. We will be paying $800 in daycare until I am done with school, which is coincidentally when my kid starts kindergarten. We have no debt.

I will also be taking a class or two at the four year each semester. How does this effect how I handle the loan process? 

Might I be able to cover my entire school cost with low/no interest federal loans? How much to take and when? Pay for community college out of pocket and get loans for the four year? Will I get less in loans if I try to get some every year? Is it smart to take on $32,000 in debt with intent to pay it off quickly with a good job?

So, my mom is a total rockstar and she took out some federal PLUS loans to help me through college-- about $23k worth, all in the 6-8% range. She's also got about $17k of consumer debt, ranging from 12-20%. (She raised me as a single mom, so I'll definitely give her some slack there. She also didn't have a strong financial background growing up.) She bought a townhome about 2 years ago that has hugely appreciated, from a $200k purchase price to identical units in her neighborhood now selling for over $300k.

Her original loan was at 4.5%, but she's hopeful that she can get a better rate if she refinances now. (She hasn't shopped around yet, but her credit score is a 724.) She wants to refinance for more than her original loan, to pay off some (or all) of the debt. I've never heard of doing something like that before... is that a fairly common thing to do?

She also wants to move to a 15 year mortgage. I'm not sure this is a good idea... I think she'd be better off keeping it a 30-year mortgage, bumping the amount up to pay off all her debts (so $240k) and just paying that loan down as quickly as she can, but without the added pressure of the tighter term. If she can make the payments that would get her to a 15 year pay-off, great, but if she doesn't have the cash one month, it wouldn't be catastrophic. Does a 15-year term offer any other benefits?

Here's her break-down:
$4,500/month take home, after retirement savings and health care, public transit.

Mortgage: $1,400 month (includes home loan + escrow)

HoA fees: $165

Utilities: $250

Internet and Mobile Phones: $240

0% interest loan: $140 month for 1.5 more years

Food: $400/month max

Gas: $100/month (car is paid off)

Pets: $50/month

Car insurance: $600/year

**Total**: $2,845 of $4,500

How much would it be alright for her to spend each month on a home loan? The calculators I'm using put her new monthly payment at about $1,750 if she got a loan for $240k and did a 15-year loan, which seems totally reasonable to me, but I live in the Bay area and currently put 50% of my take-home towards rent, so I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask.

**Proposed New total**: $3,195 of $4,500

She also needs to have room for savings for travel expenses, and possibly bumping up her retirement contributions. She's 53 and hoping to retire in 10-12 years. Her 401k is currently at around $260k, but she also will get a pension as a percentage of her current salary from her company when she retires. What's the best way to figure out how much money she'll need in retirement? I don't have a lot of experience in that area.

I guess I just wanted to get some impartial opinions on this because I'm not totally comfortable offering my mom financial advice. This plan seems pretty reasonable to me, but I also don't want to support it and then have something go terribly wrong. The stakes are so high!

**TL;DR**: Is it a bad idea for my mom to refinance a home loan for more than the amount of the original loan if the home has hugely appreciated and there's now a ton of equity there? From $200k -&gt; $300k current value, proposed new loan amount at $240k and a 15-year term. The money would go to entirely pay off her consumer debt and the student loan debt she took out for me. The new loan would be ~$1,750 of her $4,500/month take home by my calculations.  I think maybe she should stick with a 30-year term and just try to pay at a rate to pay it off in 15 years. Is there any advantage to a shorter-term loan?",finance,1462504084

personalfinance,"Requesting Financial Advice - Graduating 23 year old, Federal Gov Job","I will be graduating in June (Computer Science) and have an offer made, pending a security clearance. It will be a Federal Government job, with the starting pay around $62,000. I have around $35,000 in debt from student loans and live in California. 

I'm debating living at my parent's home and commuting 1 hour to work which would save me a ton of money but reduce my productivity, or getting a place closer to the job. The cheapest apartments I could find are in the $1400 price range.

Aside from a few things I'd like to spoil myself with once I start working (a top of the line computer) I am pretty frugal and my only other expense would be food (I do like to eat out though). 

I vaguely remember the HR lady telling me about some government savings program that is offered at the job (not 401k) where they would match a percentage of what you save. I'm honestly hoping to move out of this job to a bigger tech company within a couple years so I'm not sure if this is the best way to save. 

I'm looking for general advice, what the best way to save my money is, and things I should look out for. Also would software like Wealthfront be a safe way to invest my money?

stocks,Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) are the Most Undervalued Stocks in the Entire Market - Here's Why,"In 2008 Congress passed the Housing Economic Recovery Act.  This legislation gave the government the power to take control of the Government Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs, if certain threshold criteria were met and their regulator made a determination that intervention was needed to restore operations at the companies.

Approximately 3 months after HERA passed, the Treasury secretary at the time, Hank Paulson, made the decision in consultation with the president, George W. Bush, to takeover operations of the companies and to place them into conservatorship.  In his book 'On the Brink' he characterizes his mentality in making the decision by recalling a conversation he had with the president just before taking control of the enterprises.    The quote is ""Do they know it's coming, Hank?"" President Bush asked me. ""Mr. President,"" I said, ""we're going to move quickly and take them by surprise. The first sound they'll hear is their heads hitting the floor.""  To read a more in-depth excerpt of the decision:  http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/book-excerpt-brink-henry-paulson-jr/story?id=9713451

The major problem with the attitude displayed in that quote is that these companies had, and continue to have, investors.  Their shares are publicly traded.  So while the goal of protecting the economy and taxpayers is very noble, shareholder's in these companies have taken an almost total loss in the value of investments.  Fannie Mae, for instance, has been profitable for 17 consecutive quarters(4 years, 3 months), yet still remains in government control.

Within the next 6 weeks, an appeals court is expected to make a decision in relation to the legality of the present arrangement.  Their conservator, FHFA (Federal Housing Finance Agency), signed an agreement, normally referred to as the '3rd Amendment', that gives their net worth to the Treasury Department forever.  22 lawsuits are challenging the legality of that agreement.  

The Treasury Department GSE Game Plan:

1.  Get Congress to pass HERA 
2.  Use the financial crisis as an excuse to take over the GSEs and put them into conservatorship
3.  Fire the managers and reconstitute the boards of directors with cronies
4.  Delist the companies
5.  Force the GSEs to borrow capital from Treasury at 10 percent interest in the lowest interest rate enviornment in history, AAA credit ratings, and 400 billion dollars in unencombered and unpledged MBS.  Also deny them access to the discount window at the FED while simultaneously telling the public that they have access to the discount window at the FED.
6.  Use Fannie and Freddie to buy up bad mortgage assets from banks at a rate of ""50 billion dollars per month""
7   Encourage NEW public investment in GSE preferred stock and then abuse those good faith patriotic investments by never paying the promised dividends on those investments. (22 billion in preferred stock sold in 2007-8)
8.  Give GSE profits to Treasury forever
9.  Aggressively fight GSE shareholder lawsuits even when 100 percent in the wrong
10. Abuse trust in government by having Congressmen and women introduce unconstitutional GSE reform legislation like Corker/Warner, the Path Act, and Pay Back the Taxpayers etc.
11.  Put the auditors of the GSEs, like Deloitte, in a precarious situation by allowing them to be sued and endangering their investors.  
12. Have the Justice Department claim executive privilege, and other privileges, on 11,000 documents having nothing at all to do with protecting national security or trade secrets.  
13. Encourage Justice Department lawyer's to make a mockery of the legal system by making ridiculous and asinine arguments on behalf of the United States in courtrooms around the country.  Have them act extremely arrogant and disrespect the judges, like Judge Sweeney.  
14. Make a mockery of conservatorship by drawing out the process for 8 years and 17 consecutive quarters of profitability.

I own common stock in Fannie Mae(FNMA), which currently trades at a price of 1.77 share and market cap of 10.16 billion.  That market cap includes an option the Treasury Department has to purchase 79.9 percent of the common stock for .000001 per share.  That option has not been exercised yet, but it makes sense in valuing the company to assume it will be exercised even if there is a possibility that it won't be.  

Historically, Fannie Mae, traded with a P/E ratio of between 15-20 times earnings.  So the probable market cap of the company out of conservatorship after being relisted would probably be somewhere between 150-200 billion.  It is worth noting that the GSEs have doubled their Guarantee fees which has probably doubled their overall profitability.  There are 1.2 billion shares outstanding for Fannie Mae.  20 percent of 200 billion is 40 billion.  

Which means that the shares of Fannie Mae out of conservatorship should be worth $33.33 per share, at minimum.  If the common stock warrant that Treasury holds is never exercised the shares would be worth 165 dollars per share.  That's almost 100 times their current market price.  

Here are the current positive factors that make it unlikely you can lose money holding these shares long term.  But even better the situation is binary which means because there are no in-between investment results possible besides the shares going to 33 or 165, that the share prices are vastly under-valued presently.

1.  22 lawsuits pending and very damaging information coming out in documents in those lawsuits.
2.  An appeals court decision within the next 6 weeks
3.  Very positive media coverage recently.  Rolling Stone, New York Times, The Washington Post, all are on the story and telling it in ways that are great for shareholder's
4. The GSEs have paid over 240 billion dollars to the Treasury on borrowings of 187 billion.  
5. The GSEs are involved with almost 90 percent of mortgages in the United States.  This makes replacing them arbitrarily or quickly extremely challenging. 
6. They are operating with very low amounts of retained capital.  This makes it likely that a decision will have to be made soon that changes the current circumstances.
7. Very vocal grassroots investors movement.
8.  Large hedge fund investments in the companies.
9.  Best law firms in the country fighting our lawsuits
10.Election risk for the democrats.  If a republican gets elected president they might lose the ability to control the outcome for the housing market and housing market groups, which are big political supporters and contributors.

Recently Judge Sweeny in the Court of Federal Claims unsealed some documents related to 3rd Amendment profit sweep decision.  Susan McFarland, the then CFO of Fannie Mae,  says that she told Treasury before the 3rd Amendment sweep that the GSEs were in a sustainable profitability based on her projections.  She also told them that it was possible in the near future that they would be able to release their tax deferred assets.  She even speculates that her report to Treasury might have been the reason that Treasury instituted the 3rd amendment.  Here is the excerpt from her deposition:

Q. (BY MR. THOMPSON) Did you think it was the
20 effective nationalization of the companies?

21 MR. LAUFGRABEN: Objection; form.

22 MR. BARTOLOMUCCI: Objection; form.

23 A. No, I didn't view it as nationalizing. It
24 borders on that; I can see.
25 But I had, shortly before that, had
45
1 a meeting with Treasury whereby we reviewed our
2 forecasts. I had expressed a view that I believed we
3 were now in a sustainable profitability, that we would
4 be able to deliver sustainable profits over time. I
5 even mentioned the possibility that it could get to a
6 point in the not-so-distant future where the factors
7 might exist whereby the allowance on the
8 deferred tax asset would be released. We were not there
9 yet, but, you know, you could see positive things
10 occurring.
11 So when the amendment went into place,
12 part of my reaction was they did that in response to my
13 communication of our forecasts and the implication of
14 those forecasts, that it was probably a desire not to
15 allow capital to build up within the enterprises and not
16 to allow the enterprises to recapitalize themselves

personalfinance,"Looking to start building positive credit and perhaps purchase a newer, more reliable car. Where do I start?","I am a 22 year old living in Midwest America, and I think it's time for me to start taking my financials more seriously. I haven't done any significant harm to my current situation, but I'll give a brief summary below.

I attended a boarding school, so I never really had a job in high school, and the only credit card I had up until graduation was handled by my parents as an ""emergency"" card, i.e. You get stuck at the airport on your way home and need to buy a ticket sort of emergency. After graduating, I attended one semester of University (it didn't work out well for me) on my grandparent's dime, they've offered to pay for my college tuition if/when I decide to go back. 

At the time my spending money came from graduation gifts, and I had a ""student"" credit card with a $500 limit. Unfortunately due to a miscommunication while making a payment over the phone (the card was through the credit union where I bank, and their online payment service was not functioning at the time) when I intended to pay off the entire balance, the clerk made a mistake and left a couple hundred dollars on the card. Because I was young and stupid, I didn't think much about not getting a statement, as I had stopped using the card, and I've later found out this dinged my credit. 

Since then I've been working in the service industry and living paycheck to paycheck. I am able to put gas the car, food in my belly, pay the rent, and occasionally toss some money towards my hobbies, but other than that, I'm mostly just getting by. I rarely have more than a few hundred dollars in my bank account, but I'm also not incurring any debt.

Last time I checked my credit score, I remember it being around 600, but I couldn't tell you which score it was. I tried to check earlier this evening, but (and this has happened before) my information was confused with my father's (we have similar names) and annualcreditreport.com was unable to pull up my current scores. I'm not sure how to fix this issue.

As for my goals. I'd like to find a way to set up a budget I can actually live by. I've tried doing bare essentials before, I've tried monitoring everything in a spreadsheet, but I ended up giving up on it. I'm hoping you guys have some advice for how to intelligently track my spending so I can start setting aside money for savings, but also so I can look at getting a new vehicle. I currently have two cars (a 97 Impreza with a KBB value of $2000 and an 04 F150 with a KBB Value of about $1500). I'm looking to consolidate this down to a single vehicle, preferably newer and with better fuel economy. My fear is that with my credit history (or really, lack thereof) I'm going to get stuck with a jacked up interest rate.

I've heard a couple different ways to establish good credit. The most popular one seems to be just getting a credit card, and paying it off regularly, and only using it on things you know you'll have to buy anyways (i.e., fill up tank in my truck, not buying that awesome new video game). Another way I've heard of, but not sure how legitimate it is, intrigues me in how low maintenance it seems. I've been told you can set up a loan with your bank, where you give them say, $1100 off the bat, they ""loan"" you $1000, and they take your $1100 and set it aside and use it to make automatic monthly payments on the $1000 they ""loaned"" you. So basically, you pay your bank $100, and they create a year or two of good debt payment history. That $100 is essentially interest.

I'm nervous about taking these first steps towards being more mature financially, but I feel like it's something I have to do if I ever want to stop worrying about whether or not I can afford the next big surprise cost. I've seen so many people come to this subreddit and get genuine help, so here's hoping you can do the same for me.

I'm having trouble convincing myself that taking the job with only $250 a month left for ""uh-oh"" situations and anything else that I may want to do is responsible. I would be more than 700 miles from home, and my savings will be wiped out by the moving costs. I'm just not sure that I can knowingly do that. I may not get home to see my family within the first year at all, and I'm hoping to settle down eventually looking for a home and a family, which I cannot do with only $250 a month going into savings. 

I know this isn't r/contractnegotiations but what I'm asking here is does this seem like a fiscally responsible decision? If I didn't have student loans this would be a no brainer, but can I really expect an employer to really care about expenses that I've incurred in the process of gaining education and take them into account when offering employment?

I have $35,000 in federal student loans and I have $10,000 in private loans. The federal loans are all somewhere between 3.5% and 4.5% and the private loan is at 6.74%. I would like to refinance them and roll them all in to one loan at a lower interest rate. Looking around, it looks like there are rates as low as 2.19% (SoFi). A low interest rate like that would save me a tremendous amount of money in the long run. 


Doing some rough calculations shows that if I could get 3% on the full amount and a 10 year term, it would save me a few thousand dollars in the long run. However, I do not plan on spending 10 years paying these loans off. I was actually hoping to knock them out it 2. 


All that being said, is it even worth it to do the refinance if I plan on paying everything off very quickly? If I do want to refinance, does anyone have a recommendation for a company? I thought about trying SoFi but they have some terrible reviews online. Any help is appreciated guys.

personalfinance,What sort of interest rate can I expect for a medical loan?,"Hey everyone. To be frank, my wife and I are having trouble having a kid. IVF is our only viable option. She flatly refuses the idea of adoption at this time without at least trying IVF. Our insurance doesn't cover it. And at this point, even if we were to switch to a different insurer who DID cover it, we would most likely be excluded as it is now a pre-existing condition. So, we're more or less stuck.

We're looking at a $15,000 cost per treatment cycle. We have the cash to pay for one cycle out of pocket right now, but it would involve clearing out a LOT of cash accounts that I don't really want to touch. So, I am investigating the idea of a medical loan.

I have an excellent credit score (in the 800s, the two I have available right now say 884 and 813 respectively). Our combined income is about 155k/yr (about 20k more if you take into account my equity grants and bonuses). If we live like saints, stop our extra investments (outside of 401ks), and pay only minimums on our student loans (~42k) and mortgage (144k), we have an extra cash flow of about $2200 a month. That easily covers the cost of the loan payment.

So, with all of that in mind - what should I anticipate as a ""reasonable"" interest rate? Most places i've looked seem to list a 6-7% rate, but that seems high for someone who is a low-risk borrower. Then again, I understand it would be a short term loan (probably paid back within 1-2 years) so the bank would want to get as much money as possible.

* The Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United marches like a zombie precedent, destroying all in its path. First the case turned the law of campaign finance into a useless corpse. Now it appears the law of political bribery is the next victim. Citizens United let rich people buy candidates; now they may be able to purchase office-holders, too.

* That’s the message from the Court’s argument last week in the appeal of Bob McDonnell, the former governor of Virginia. He was convicted, along with his wife, in a scheme that netted the onetime First Family of the Commonwealth about a hundred and seventy-seven thousand dollars in loans, vacations, and luxury goods from a Richmond businessman. And yet, while the statements of Justices during oral arguments are not always perfect predictors of how they will vote, there was clearly a great deal of bipartisan sympathy on display for this appalling former public servant.

* In the McDonnell case, his lawyers argued that what federal prosecutors called bribery was also really just speech by Jonnie R. Williams, the McDonnells’ benefactor. Noel Francisco, McDonnell’s lawyer, did a skillful job of giving a constitutional gloss to the seedy facts of his client’s case. Williams plied the McDonnell family with expensive vacations, a Rolex watch, fifteen thousand dollars for their daughter’s wedding reception, the use of a Ferrari, and a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in loans in an effort to get the governor to promote Williams’s nutritional-supplement enterprise. According to Francisco, Williams was only paying for access (which is generally legal), not government action (which is not). As the lawyer put it in his oral argument, “The line is between access to decision-makers, on the one hand, and trying to influence those decisions, on the other.” In this view, it’s permissible for McDonnell to be paid for official access, just not for official acts.

* The Court seems determined to define quid pro quo so narrowly that it’s practically impossible to find.

* McDonnell’s lawyer argued, there was no quid pro quo because McDonnell did not take an official action on behalf of Williams’s supplements. All the governor did was host a luncheon to announce the launch of Williams’s new product and set up meetings for Williams with officials at the University of Virginia’s medical school. 

* Justice Stephen Breyer seemed especially concerned about the other side of the charged quid pro quo. He appeared to assert that a conviction of McDonnell would criminalize normal interactions between citizens and government officials. *“For better or for worse, it puts at risk behavior that is common, particularly when the quid is a lunch or a baseball ticket, throughout this country,”* Breyer told Michael Dreeben, the Deputy Solicitor General, who represented the government. Wouldn’t a conviction here criminalize such trivial exchanges? No, Dreeben said, because *“there is a very critical protection here. It’s a requirement of showing something beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.""* If the amounts were trivial, jurors wouldn’t convict.

* As in Citizens United, the Justices appeared heading toward requiring a specific and obvious quid pro quo—a formalism that ignored the workings of the real world. The U.S. Supreme Court is preparing to legalize corruption

personalfinance,Adaptive interest rate for auto loan?,"Hello guys, I appreciate your help with this.

So for example, let's say I currently drive a car thats worth about $5K, and I want to buy a new car for $20K. 

The current car that's worth $5K is paid off and I want to sell it and use that $5K towards the new car, and need to take out a $15K loan for the new car.

However, it's nearly impossible to make this transaction unless you're trading the car into a dealership. And even if it was a dealership, you would be getting lessor value by trading in vs selling it your self.

So my question is, do banks/lenders provide an adaptive auto loan where you can take out a loan for $20K to buy the new car, but adjust down your interest rate as soon you sell your car and pay the $5K towards the loan?

Because I can't imagine getting the same interest rate for $20K vs $15K loan. (I would assume there would be even a bigger difference in interest rates for example a 40K loan vs a 20K loan and etc)

I apologize in advance if this example is confusing, but I really appreciate your inputs.

I currently am paying $1,300 a month in rent to share an apartment in SF and my girlfriend is paying around $1,150 for her own studio in Oakland.

We want to move in together, but rents in the Bay Area are nuts....for a place that is big enough for both of us, we are looking at around $3,000-$3,500 in rent. We have started looking for houses outside the city around the price range of $650K-$750K. With 20% down we are looking at around a $3,500 house payment, which is affordable for our job situation. 

Here is my question. Is buying right now in a hot market a good idea? On one hand, interest rates are low, but it seems like if we ever want to sell, say 5 years down the road, it may be difficult because interest rates will probably be higher, which will price more people out of the market.

I have been able to put off buying a car (I walk to work) but for the longer term this city is a bit difficult to live in without one. I am only likely to be here for two years so buying a newish reliable car and driving it into the ground isn't an option.

Take home I have ~3000 a month
$1000 of this goes to savings
~$1165 goes to monthly costs (rent, power, water, internet, netflix, phone)
The remaining is groceries and discretionary spending


I have ~$7000 over here in my USA bank account and $8000 (in USA dollars) back home. I would want to pay cash for a car as I would imagine that any interest rate I would get with my USA credit score would be painful. 

From Autotrader there seem to be older model (~2005-2007) automatic transmission Toyota Corolla's with 80,000-100,000 miles for $6500-$8000. However I wonder if 


a) I should save a few more months then spend a bit more to get something newer. I know nothing about cars and would like to use this for roadtrips to see a bit of the states while I'm here so the higher mileage/presumably lower reliability is a draw back


 b) Are there other car brands I should look at? I had a Toyota Corolla back home so that was what I gravitated towards but in your opinion are there other car models that would be a better deal in the $6000-$10,000 range. 


c) Alternatively as I am not going to need to drive this car for ever and I don't need it for work should I just go cheaper? If I push out to &gt;150,000 miles being acceptable the corolla price tends to go to $4500-6000. 

Also how would I physically PAY for a car here. Americans don't seem to do electronic transfers between bank accounts very often and as I understand it a cheque takes days to clear. Would I write one for someone and then they give me the car and the title once it has cleared? 

Lastly is the title the only document I need to prove my ownership of the car here?

By then, my loan balance will be $1500. My question is, would it be more beneficial to keep going and finish off my loan, or revert to the minimum payments?

My only other accounts are two credit cards. I also have a short credit history.

So, would it make sense to keep the account around for a while? Or should I just finish it?

I have two parent plus loans (under my father's name)  The total for these together is 22,000, @ 8.5% interest. I've been making payments on these, but I wonder, since my father signed, can I get away with not making payments?  (Shrug)

If not, my payments are 328.00 per month.  I plan to make a yearly payment of 6000.00 Every April, to help pay this down faster.  

The loans that are under my name strictly, total up a bunch of money.  I am under IBR repayment, and The first 5 loans are under pslf.  I dont know why the other ones are not.  I work for an nonprofit, obviously. 

1.  Original:  6287.00 Actual Balance:  6532.36   Interest Rate: 5.16%
2.  Original:  4500.00 Actual Balance:  4275.33   Interest Rate: 3.15%

9.  Original:  4500.00   Actual Balance:  4339.16 Interest Rate: 5.75%

If my current work situation stays about the same, I hope to start paying my own loans off in bulk as soon as the parent plus ones are off.  I don't really want to screw my dad over anyway by not paying.  Pretty sure my name goes on that too.  But what order would y'all recommend?  

I think the loans that are not covered by pslf should go first.  I plan to make the minimum payments and once again, Every April toss 6000.00 at them.  Going with this order: #7 #8 #9 (partial payment)  The next april #9 and part of #6.  

But what should I do? I'd prefer to save the money for the year and throw a big payment down, just because we're still creating a nestegg for our kiddo who will be born soon.  Who knows what happens with those things.  So accident prone!  We also live in a pretty volatile housing area so rent changes often.  We do not plan to stay here for longer than 3 years so buying a home isn't in our cards.

I'm also aware that I owe a lot of money. :\  So please dont point that out.  Student Loans and My car payment (280, no interest) are my only debts though.  So I guess thats ok.  I dont have credit card balances at the moment, and hope to keep it that way.

# #10: Donald Trump supports NSA surveillance on the American People.  

On October 26, 2001, President George W. Bush signed into law the [""Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001,"" more commonly known as the ""USA PATRIOT ACT.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act)  Parts of the Patriot Act expired on June 1st, 2015, and were reborn on June 2nd, 2015, with the passage of a new policy, the [""Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-collection and Online Monitoring Act,"" more commonly known as the ""USA Freedom Act.""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act)  

Much can be said about the Patriot Act, certainly far more than I have room to type in this post, but one of the more disturbing allowances made is the ability of the NSA to monitor your cell phone for information such as who you called, when you called them, who has called you, when they called you, and how long you spoke on the phone, all without a Federal warrant.  At best this was considered an invasion on the privacy of law abiding American citizens, at worst this bulk data collection was a clear violation of our 4th Amendment protections against ""Illegal [warrant-less] search and seizure.""  One part of the Patriot Act that did not survive the translation into the USA Freedom Act was the legality of NSA bulk data collection without a warrant, under current law the National Security Agency must acquire a Federal warrant if they want to collect your phone records.  Certainly this doesn't solve the problem of mass surveillance, but requiring warrants for phone records is a step in the right direction.  

On May 22nd, 2015, Donald Trump explained that:  

&gt;“I support legislation which allows the NSA to hold the bulk meta-data. For oversight, I propose that a court, which is available any time on any day, is created to issue individual rulings on when this meta-data can be accessed.”  [[Google Cache Source](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NYZy9tPGed8J:www.newsweek.com/where-do-presidential-wannabes-stand-patriot-act-334968+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us)]  

Donald Trump suggests that we repeal the one step toward privacy rights that we have made since the passage of the Patriot Act in 2001, and that the NSA should have the ability to collect, maintain, and access the phone records of law abiding American citizens at ""any time on any day.""

On December 7th, 2015, Donald Trump further clarified:  

&gt;“Well, I tend to err on the side of security, I must tell you, and I’ve been there for longer than you would think. But, you know, when you have people that are beheading if you’re a Christian and frankly for lots of other reasons, when you have the world looking at us and would like to destroy us as quickly as possible, I err on the side of security, and so that’s the way it is, that’s the way I’ve been, and some people like that, frankly, and some people don’t like that.  And I’m not just saying that since Paris, I’m saying for quite some time. I assume when I pick up my telephone people are listening to my conversations anyway, if you want to know the truth. It’s pretty sad commentary, but I err on the side of security,”  [[Source](http://truthinmedia.com/trump-supports-reauthorizing-patriot-act-nsa-metadata-collection/)]  

Seeming to imply that the American people should expect, and accept, that when ""they pick up their telephone people are listening to their conversations anyway.""
  
Donald Trump went on to add that:  
  
&gt;“I think that [restoring the USA Patriot Act] would be fine. As far as I’m concerned, that would be fine,”  [[Source](http://truthinmedia.com/trump-supports-reauthorizing-patriot-act-nsa-metadata-collection/)]  

As President, Donald Trump would support the re-authorization of the USA Patriot Act, the re-authorization of NSA bulk data collection, and the ability of the American government to spy on law abiding American citizens, regardless of the protections afforded us by the 4th Amendment to the Constitution.  As he stated himself, Donald Trump ""tends to err on the side of security"" rather than freedom.  

**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: NSA surveillance could be used to target not just terrorists, but law abiding American citizens who are perceived to be agitators or political dissidents.  In theory the NSA could be utilized to stymie, if not stop entirely, any individual or group who the President feels is a ""threat to national security.""  This is not a problem limited to Donald Trump, but extends to any President who may feel the need to use, or abuse, the USA Patriot Act.

# #9: He's opposed to Net Neutrality.  

Net Neutrality is a policy which requires internet service providers, or ISPs, to treat all information on the internet equally.  Under Net Neutrality if you pay for 50mbps internet, you get 50mbps internet for every site your visit, regardless of content.  YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and even Reddit, are all subject to the same speed limit: Whatever you're paying for.  In the absence of Net Neutrality, ISPs could constrict speeds on certain sites, and charge extra fees to bring those sites up to speed.  So say you're a Xfinity subscriber and want to access YouTube, under the Net Neutrality policy a YouTube video would stream in at the full 50mbps that you're paying for, were the policy of Net Neutrality overturned, Comcast could slow down effective speed to YouTube to 50kbps, and require that you pay an extra $4.99 per month to access YouTube at full speed.  

Content creators and content hosts generally support Net Neutrality, as it puts all sites and hosts on a relatively even playing field.  Industry giants like Netflix don't have to worry about Xfinity artificially hobbling their site, or increasing the actual subscription fee for their users, and smaller startups don't have to worry about their service being killed in the cradle by ISPs who fear the competition.  Net Neutrality is a win-win scenario for content creators, content hosts, and consumers alike.  The only opponents of Net Neutrality are those who stand to profit from the ability to throttle, and in some cases functionally censor, competitive content.  Among the biggest opponents of Net Neutrality are internet giants such as Comcast Xfinity, COX, Time Warner, and Donald Trump.  

On November 12th, 2014, Donald Trump tweeted the following:  
  
&gt;""Obama’s attack  on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.""  [[Source](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/532608358508167168?lang=en)]  

This is interesting for a couple reasons.  
  
First, nothing about Net Neutrality would allow the United States government in general, nor President Obama in specific, to censor the internet.  In fact, Net Neutrality stands as a bulwark against ISPs functionally censoring content by means of severely restricting bandwidth.  Imagine there was a website called https://www.ComcastSucks.com, in the absence of Net Neutrality Comcast could theoretically limit the bandwidth available to users trying to access this site to .5bps, functionally preventing any of their users from accessing https://www.ComcastSucks.com.  Under the policy of Net Neutrality this sort of practical censorship would be illegal.  

Secondly, the Fairness Doctrine was a policy implemented in an effort to ensure that opposing viewpoints were presented during news broadcasts.  To give an example: If a news program were hosting an individual claiming that climate change was a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese to undermine American manufacturing, the program would be required to also present the opposing view point that climate change is a real phenomenon with a genuine scientific basis.  Wikipedia offers a brief description of the policy:  

&gt;""The Fairness Doctrine was a policy of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was—in the Commission's view—honest, equitable, and balanced. The FCC eliminated the Doctrine in 1987, and in August 2011 the FCC formally removed the language that implemented the Doctrine.""  [[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine)]  

It may be confusing how one could arrive at the conclusion that Net Neutrality, a policy which acts as a strong defense against censorship, could be used to censor conservative media; or in what way Net Neutrality and the Fairness Doctrine is related.  Your confusion is justified, but also inconsequential: In this case the ""why"" is less important than the ""what.""  What matters is that, for whatever reason, Donald Trump is opposed to the policy of Net Neutrality.  If he is elected President he could overturn that policy, paving the way for increased consumer fees, decreased competition, and corporate censorship.  
  
**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: Internet Service Providers would be legally allowed to gouge their customers based upon the internet content that they browse, functionally censor competing or critical websites, and offer preferential treatment to sites that they support or agree with.

# #8: Donald Trump wants to make it easier to sue media outlets for libel.  

In an effort to stem the tides of frivolous libel suits, the United States Supreme Court decided on March 29th, 1960 in [""New York Times Company vs Sullivan""](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_York_Times_v._Sullivan_(376_U.S._254) that a plaintiff has to show [""actual malice""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actual_malice) before press reports can be considered to be defamation and libel.  Simply put, actual malice can be defined as ""knowledge that the information [in the press report] was false"" or that it was published ""with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.""  In short, in order to sue for libel or defamation, a plaintiff must show that a press organization knowingly or willfully published false information, an intentionally high burden of proof to bear.  This burden of proof was implemented to prevent individuals from suing for misprints, unintentional errors, or other frivolous reasons.  Consider the case for which this verdict was written:  

&gt;On March 29, 1960, The New York Times carried a full-page advertisement titled ""Heed Their Rising Voices"", which solicited funds to defend Martin Luther King, Jr. against an Alabama perjury indictment. The advertisement described actions against civil rights protesters, some of them inaccurately, some of which involved the police force of Montgomery, Alabama. Discrepancies were generally minor. Referring to the Alabama State Police, the advertisement stated: ""They have arrested [King] seven times..."" However, at that point he had been arrested four times. Although African-American students staged a demonstration on the State Capitol steps, they sang the National Anthem and not My Country, 'Tis of Thee. Although the Montgomery Public Safety commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, was not named in the advertisement, the inaccurate criticism of actions by the police was considered defamatory to Sullivan as well, due to his duty to supervise the police department.  [[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan)]

Although Commissioner Sullivan was not named in the advertisement, and the mistakes outlined above were minor, Sullivan was within his rights to sue the New York Times for libel, and won $500,000 in damages from an Alabama court.  Feeling that this decision was unfair, The New York Times Company appealed, and the case ended up before the Supreme Court of the United States, which found in their favor and overturned the verdict.  In their decision the Court stated that:  

&gt;""The First Amendment protects the publication of all statements, even false ones, about the conduct of public officials **except when statements are made with actual malice (with knowledge that they are false or in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity).**""  [[Source](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1963/39)] [Emphasis mine, ed.]  

That's the necessary background.  So what are Donald Trump's opinions on the matter?  On February 26th, 2016 Donald Trump had this to say:  
  
&gt;“One of the things I’m going to do if I win—and I hope we do, and we’re certainly leading—I’m going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money, so when the New York Times writes a hit piece, which is a total disgrace, or when the Washington Post, which is there for other reasons, writes a hit piece, we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they’re totally protected.”  [[Source](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/02/27/donald_trump_vows_to_curb_press_freedom_through_libel_laws.html)]  

Now, it should be noted that Donald Trump already has the right to sue any news organization that writes ""purposely ... false articles.""  So long as Mr. Trump can prove that the publication knowingly or willfully published false information he can sue, he doesn't need to change the libel laws in order to do that.   Unfortunately Mr. Trump hasn't explained exactly what he plans to do to make suing news publications easier.  The Washington Post attempted to pin down the specifics during a recent interview, but Donald Trump was unable to provide any actual policy proposals.  Listen Here: [The Post asked Donald Trump about the First Amendment. Repeatedly.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/editorial/listen-the-post-asked-donald-trump-about-the-first-amendment-repeatedly/2016/03/21/ee82a4b0-efd5-11e5-a2a3-d4e9697917d1_video.html)  

So what *could* Donald Trump do to open up libel laws?  For one thing, as President, he could appoint Supreme Court Justices that would be willing to overturn New York Times Co. vs Sullivan, thus ending the requirement that the plaintiff proves actual malice.  This could open a litigious Pandora's Box of sorts, allowing individuals to sue news organizations for the most benign of mistakes, even if the plaintiffs themselves aren't specifically mentioned.  

Another question worth pondering is ""Why would Donald Trump want to make it easier to sue news publications, especially considering how much free advertising they've provided him since the beginning of his campaign?""  I can't pretend to know what is in a person's heart, but if his actions are any indication, his feelings on libel suits might have something to do with how many of them he's filed, and threatened to file, himself:  

 * In the 1980s, when Trump he sued another businessman who had the same last name as him. Julius and Edmond Trump were trying to buy a chain of drug stores, and their business was called ""The Trump Group."" When Donald Trump found out he went on the offensive: Donald Trump’s lawyer, Roy Cohn, demanded that the Trump Group change its name by the following day or they would face consequences. A little while later, Donald Trump sued Julius and Edmond Trump in New York state court, alleging they were nothing but a pair of late-arriving immigrants trying to piggyback on his good name.  “Plaintiffs have used the Trump family name for 40 to 50 years in the New York area. More recently, the Trump Organization has come to stand for respectability and success across the United States,” the complaint read.  “The defendants are South Africans whose recent entrance in the New York area utilizing the name 'the Trump Group' can only be viewed as a poorly veiled attempt at trading on the goodwill, reputation and financial credibility of the plaintiff.”  [[Source](http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150806/BLOGS02/150809914/the-notorious-case-of-the-donald-vs-trump)]  
 
 * In 1984, Trump sued the Chicago Tribune for $500 million after the publication’s architecture critic, Paul Gapp, wrote an item suggesting Chicago’s Sears Tower, then the world’s tallest building, would remain as such, despite Trump’s plan to build a taller structure in downtown Manhattan. Trump claimed the story “virtually torpedoed” his dreams, according to the Associated Press, by depicting his would-be tower as “an atrocious, ugly monstrosity” even though, Trump said, he hadn’t even yet hired an architect or drawn a plan.  [[Quote source](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/06/trump-sued-everyone-but-his-hairdresser.html)]  
 
 * Trump purchased Eastern Air Lines’s shuttle service in 1988 for $365 million and planned to relaunch it as “Trump Shuttle.” But a problem arose—a different company, Trading and Finance Corp. Ltd., was already using the name. In 1989, Trump sued for the rights to the name.  [[Quote source](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/06/trump-sued-everyone-but-his-hairdresser.html)]   

 * In January 2006, Trump filed a $5 billion lawsuit against author Timothy O'Brien and his publisher for understating Trump's wealth. In his book Trump Nation, O'Brien reported that Trump had estimated his worth at between $150 and $250 million. Trump, who said he had told O'Brien that he was worth between $4 billion and $6 billion, claimed that O'Brien's low estimate had hurt his reputation and cost him specific business deals. Trump's suit was dismissed in July 2009, and his subsequent appeal failed in September 2011.

 * Also in 2006, Trump threatened to sue Rosie O’Donnell, then a co-host on The View, after she said he was bankrupt. Trump retaliated in an interview with The Insider, by labeling O’Donnell “disgusting, both inside and out.” He told People “Rosie will rue the words she said. I’ll most likely sue her for making those false statements—and it’ll be fun. Rosie’s a loser. A real loser. I look forward to taking lots of money from my nice fat little Rosie.” [[Quote source](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/06/trump-sued-everyone-but-his-hairdresser.html)][[Interview source](http://gothamist.com/2006/12/21/rosie_odonnell_1.php)]  
 
 * In 2011, [MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnel] provoked the mogul's wrath when he accused him of being worth less than $1 billion. ""I heard, because his show is unwatchable, that @Lawrence has made many false statements last night about me,"" Trump tweeted. ""Maybe I should sue him?""  [[Quote source](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/03/the-lawsuits-of-donald-trump/273819/)]  
 
 * In February [of 2013], Trump sued comedian Bill Maher who offered, on The Tonight Show, to give Trump $5 million if he could prove that his father was not an orangutan. (The comment was a spoof of Trump's offer to give $5 million to charity if President Obama would release his records and applications for colleges and passports.) Trump dutifully sent Maher a copy of his birth certificate, but the comedian never paid up. ""He has not responded, and the reason he hasn't responded is his lawyers probably tell him, 'You've got yourself a problem,' "" Trump told Atlantic author William Cohan. Maher later said, on his show, ""Donald Trump must learn two things--what a joke is, and what a contract is.""  [[Quote source](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/03/the-lawsuits-of-donald-trump/273819/)]  
 
 * In 2014, Trump sued Trump Entertainment Resorts, which he holds a 10 percent stake in, to remove his name from the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City, which he said did not live up to his standard of quality.  [[Quote source](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/06/trump-sued-everyone-but-his-hairdresser.html)]   
 
This list is not exhaustive, LawNewz.com found that [""Donald Trump has been named in at least 169 federal lawsuits.""](http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/we-investigated-donald-trump-is-named-in-at-least-169-federal-lawsuits/)  
   
**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: Individuals, companies, and politicians could use the threat of libel lawsuits as a means to intimidate the free press into silence.  Such law suits already exist, referred to as [""Strategic lawsuit against public participation,"" or SLAAP for short,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_lawsuit_against_public_participation) but are largely held in check by the ""actual malice requirement"" passed in New York Times Co. vs Sullivan.

I know what you're thinking: ""I thought this guy was going to give me 10 good reasons not to vote for Donald Trump *without* saying that 'He's literally Hitler.'""  I'm keeping my promise on that.    
 
On December 3rd, 2015 Donald Trump said in a Fox News Interview:  
 
&gt;""We're fighting a very politically correct war.  The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don't kid yourself. When they say they don't care about their lives, you have to take out their families,""  [[Source](http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/02/politics/donald-trump-terrorists-families/)] [[Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1eXRXL0nkk)]  
 
Unfortunately for Mr. Trump, intentionally killing innocent men, women, and children [is a war-crime,](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/17/rand-paul/rand-pauls-right-geneva-conventions-bar-donald-tru/) as is defined in [Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions](http://www.cfr.org/human-rights/geneva-conventions/p8778)... 
 
&gt;People who are taking no active part in the hostilities ""shall in all circumstances be treated humanely… To this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever … violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture.""  [[Source]((http://www.cfr.org/human-rights/geneva-conventions/p8778)]  
 
...and [Article 51.2.](https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/470)  
 
&gt;""The civilian population as such, as well as individual civilians, shall not be the object of attack. Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.""  [[Source](https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/470)]  
 
The United States signed the Geneva Conventions in [1955.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_parties_to_the_Geneva_Conventions)  
 
Donald Trump also advocates for the use of torture, as he explained at a rally on February 17th, 2016:  
 
&gt;“Don’t tell me it doesn’t work — torture works, half these guys [say]: ‘Torture doesn’t work.’ Believe me, it works.”
 
Vowing at the same event to:  
 
&gt;“...bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.  Some people say it’s not actually torture — let’s assume it is, but they asked me the question: ‘What are you going to do on waterboarding?’ Absolutely fine, but we should go much stronger than waterboarding. That’s the way I feel.”  
 
And if torture doesn't work?  As Mr. Trump stated in November of 2015:  
 
&gt;“If it doesn’t work, they deserve it anyway, for what they’re doing.”
 
[[Source for the above three quotes.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-torture-works-backs-waterboarding-and-much-worse/2016/02/17/4c9277be-d59c-11e5-b195-2e29a4e13425_story.html)]  
 
Torture in general, including waterboarding, is prohibited by the [Geneva Convention](https://www.britannica.com/topic/waterboarding), as well as the [United Nations Convention Against Torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Torture), and has precedent as being prosecuted as a war crime.  
 
**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: We make a problem that already exists in the Middle East even worse.  On September 11th, 2001, 3,000 innocent American men, women, and children were killed in order to send a political message, Donald Trump is proposing that we do the same thing.  How did the United States respond?  All out warfare for over a decade.  Killing innocent civilians would only serve to strengthen the notion that the United States is an enemy that must be destroyed at all costs, and would act as one of the best possible recruiting tools for extremists and terrorists all over the globe.  Think of it this way: The worst way to prevent getting stung is to throw rocks at a bee hive.

# #6:  Donald Trump doesn't believe in climate change, and thinks that ""what they [the EPA] do is a disgrace.""  
 
On November 6th, 2012, Donald Trump posted the following tweet to his twitter account:  
  
&gt;""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""  [[Source](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en)]  

January 29th, 2014:  

&gt;""Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!""  [[Source](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/428414113463955457)]  

Also on January 29th, 2014:  

&gt;""Give me clean, beautiful and healthy air - not the same old climate change (global warming) bullshit! I am tired of hearing this nonsense.""  [[Source](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/428418323660165120)]  

During an interview with Hugh Hewitt on September 21st, 2015, Donald Trump explained:  
  
&gt;""I mean, Obama thinks it’s the number one problem of the world today. And I think it’s very low on the list. So I am not a believer, and I will, unless somebody can prove something to me, I believe there’s weather. I believe there’s change, and I believe it goes up and it goes down, and it goes up again. And it changes depending on years and centuries, but I am not a believer, and we have much bigger problems.""  [[Source](http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-returns/)]

In an interview on September 24th, 2015, Trump said simply:  

&gt;""I don't believe in climate change.""  [[Source](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/09/24/donald-trump-i-dont-believe-in-climate-change/)]

And on December 30th, 2015, he explained to a crowd in South Carolina that:  
  
&gt;""Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and … a lot of it's a hoax. It's a hoax. I mean, it's a money-making industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of it.""  [[Source](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a42387/republicans-climate-change/)]  

Though, to be fair, on a January 18th 2016 episode of ""Fox &amp; Friends,"" Donald Trump did go on to explain that:  
  
&gt;""I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China. Obviously, I joke.""  [[Source](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-china-created-climate-change-2016-1)]  

This is not an exhaustive list.
  
[Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-china-created-climate-change-2016-1) and [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/24/bernie-s/yes-donald-trump-really-did-tweet-climate-change-h/) both did excellent write-ups on Donald Trump's various stances on climate change.  Whether Donald Trump meant what he said about climate change being a hoax, or whether he was just joking about it, is up for debate.  Many people who have voted for Donald Trump believe that he is a climate denier, others think that he believes in climate change but that it isn't a problem worth addressing.  

On the EPA, Donald Trump has vowed that he would deeply cut spending:  

&gt;“No, I’m not cutting services, but I’m cutting spending. But I may cut Department of Education. I believe Common Core is a very bad thing. I believe that we should be — you know, educating our children from Iowa, from New Hampshire, from South Carolina, from California, from New York. I think that it should be local education, so the Department of Education is one, Environmental Protection, what they do is a disgrace. Every week they come out with new regulations.  They — we'll be fine with the environment, we can leave a little bit, but you can't destroy businesses.”  [[Source](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-epa-dept-of-education)]  

Mr. Trump hasn't revealed what specific programs he would cut, but it bears mentioning that beyond action against climate change, the EPA is also [responsible for:](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do) Enforcing policies such as the Clean Air and Clean Water Act, preventing and litigating the dumping of toxic waste, sponsoring research into environmental threats, educating the public on ways to reduce their environmental impact, and much more.  Also of note is the fact that the [Environmental Protection Agency was created by Republican President Richard Nixon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency) not important to the discussion, but an interesting bit of trivia.  

**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: EPA funding is cut so deeply that the agency is unable to fulfill their responsibilities, potentially impacting the health of American citizens who breath air or drink water.  Cuts could also result in staff reduction at the EPA, hindering their ability to enforce federal laws and regulations, and offering more opportunity for companies and individuals seeking to pollute or dump regulated toxic waste.  Ultimately, however, any susscationn in the fight against climate change could have disastrous effects on not just the United States, but the planet as a whole.  To echo the findings of a Department of Defense report:  
  
&gt;Climate change is a security risk because it degrades living conditions, human security and the ability of governments to meet the basic needs of their populations. Communities and states that already are fragile and have limited resources are significantly more vulnerable to disruption and far less likely to respond effectively and be resilient to new challenges, they added.  [[Source](http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/612710)]  

Not only is climate change a risk to our planet, it also poses a direct risk to our national security.  Failing to take action against climate change could have disastrous and far reaching consequences.

#5:  Donald Trump is a threat to gay rights.  
  
This may come as a surprise to some, considering Trump's personal opinion on homosexuality is rather moderate, but what he's promised to do as President isn't moderate at all.  Donald Trump is a supporter of ""traditional"" marriage, which is to say a marriage between one man and one woman (Previous two wives notwithstanding.)  In regards to the recent Supreme Court ruling that same-sex marriage bans were discriminatory, and therefore unconstitutional, Mr. Trump had this to say:  
  
&gt;“Frankly it should have been state – I was very much in favor of having the court rule that it goes to states, and let the states decide.  It was a shocking decision for you and for me and for a lot of people. I was in favor of letting the states decide and that’s the way it looked like it was going, and then all of a sudden out of nowhere came this very massive decision and they took it away.  I was always in favor of states rights, states deciding – on many issues, not just this.”  [[Source](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/02/19/donald-trump-tells-evangelicals-you-can-trust-me-to-overturn-gay-marriage-ruling/)]  
  
While that sounds very fair on paper, it certainly wouldn't be fair to the homosexual residents of many states.  Rather than having a clear national policy on whether homosexuals could get married, we'd have a pock marked map of legality, where gays could get married in some states, and that marriage not be recognized, or legal, in others.  
  
Based on current polling data, if states were given the right to define marriage, homosexuals in [Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming could see one of their basic civil rights disappear.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion_of_same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_States#By_state_.2F_federal_district)  This is without consideration to states on the fringes of the issue, where the vote could easily swing one way or the other.  
  
As President, Donald Trump would have the responsibility of appointing Supreme Court Justices, meaning that he may have the ability during his four or eight year term to nominate a Judge that would be willing to overturn the ruling on marriage equality.  This is something that Mr. Trump is already considering:  
  
&gt;Trump: “It has been ruled upon. It has been there. If I’m elected I would be very strong in putting certain judges on the bench that maybe could change things, but they have a long way to go. At some point we have to get back down to business. But there is no question about it. And most people feel this way. They have ruled on it. I wish it had done by the states. I don’t like the way they ruled. I disagree with the Supreme Court in that it should be a states’ rights issue.”  
&gt;&gt;Wallace: “Are you saying that if you become President you might try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage?”  

&gt;Trump:  “I would strongly consider that, yes.”  [[Source](http://www.towleroad.com/2016/01/donald-trump-gay-marriage/)]  

Donald Trump has also signaled support for the ""First Amendment Defense Act,"" more commonly known as FADA, which would protect individuals like Kim Davis from federal prosecution for denying gay marriage licenses based upon personal religious beliefs.  Passing FADA would mean that many counties with a limited number of clerks and judges could, in effect, prevent any gay marriages from occurring  
  
&gt;“If Congress considers the First Amendment Defense Act a priority, then I will do all I can to make sure it comes to my desk for signatures and enactment,”  [[Source](http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/12/23/trump-gives-conditional-support-for-religious-freedom-bill/)]  
  
But Mr. Trump is okay with transgendered individuals using their respective bathrooms, so he's got that going for him, which is nice.  

**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: Donald Trump nominates Supreme Court Justices that would be willing to overturn the recent ruling on gay marriage, and return the right to discriminate against individuals based upon their sexual identity to the States.  He could also sign the First Amendment Defense Act into law, allowing state and federal employees to discriminate against individuals based upon their sexual identity without fear of legal repercussions.  Rolling back the Supreme Court decision would put the United States back in the place it had been in 2015, effectively reenacting the [gay marriage ban present in 13 states](http://gaymarriage.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004857), and the passage of FADA could threaten gay marriage rights in the remaining 37 states.

CryptoMarkets,BitMEX introduces perpetual swap for ETHBTC -- earn interest while shorting Ethereum using bitcoin -- heres how it works,"Full illustrated web version here: http://www.bitcoinfuturesguide.com/bitcoin-blog/bitmex-introduces-perpetual-swap-for-ethbtc-earn-interest-while-shorting-ethereum-using-bitcoin-how-does-it-work

Yesterday, [BitMEX introduced](https://www.bitmex.com/register/RrmvSe) its 25x leverage perpetual swap for ETHBTC pair called [ETHXBT](https://www.bitmex.com/app/contract/ETHXBT). CEO Arthur Hayes wrote a [""Swaps 101""](https://blog.bitmex.com/swaps-101/) that tries to explain how it works.

The basics of the product are that there is no expiration, so you can keep your position open forever, as if it were just a spot or margin position. Every day, instead of normal settlement or any expiration, the principal PNL is realized and ready for withdrawal and an interest payment based on the net Poloniex ETH and BTC lending rates is sent from traders who are long ETHXBT to traders who are short on ETHXBT.

**Example of Trading BitMEX ETHXBT Perpetual Swap**

To give an example of how it works, let's say you are short ETHXBT, you have two ways to profit:

1) The interest payment you get at 12:00 UTC each day (positive most of the time when you're short).

2) The decline in the price, which will track spot market value

How much interest will you earn? Look at Poloniex for the reference to see.

If you are short, for example, 100 contracts at 0.02 ETHBTC, worth 2 BTC, then you would have gotten on Friday 0.1306-0.0217 = 0.1089% payment, or ​0.002178 BTC. If you were long the 100 contracts, you would have had to pay this amount to the short holders.

It might seem daunting at first, but it's really as simple as just trading it as if it's spot or margin. You get daily PNL realisation as well as the interest rate payment (positive if short Ethereum, negative if long Ethereum -- most of the time).

#4: Donald Trump is a threat to women's rights.  
  
Donald Trump loves women, that's a well known fact.  He was the one time [owner of the Miss. Universe beauty pageant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe), the [former owner of the Miss. USA beauty pageant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_USA), [he's had three wives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Personal_life), and he is the father to a beautiful daughter about whom he's said:  
  
&gt;“Yeah, she’s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father...”  [[Source](http://www.mediaite.com/online/donald-trump-wont-stop-joking-about-banging-his-daughter/)]  
  
I'm sure that the end of that sentence was ""...treat her with respect and basic human dignity.""  
  
However, despite Mr. Trump's obvious love of women, he's willing to deny them one of the most hard won rights that women have ever fought for: The right to a legal and safe abortion.  
  
When asked whether Mr. Trump's Supreme Court nominees would have to pass an ""abortion litmus test,"" Trump responded:  
  
&gt;“We’re going to look at that. It’s going to be pro-life, we’re going to look at that. We’re going to look at intellect, very important. We want very, very smart people. We want conservatives on the Supreme Court.”  [[Source](http://www.lifenews.com/2016/03/22/donald-trump-my-supreme-court-nominee-is-going-to-be-pro-life-we-want-conservatives/)]  
  
This may be in part because Donald Trump believes that Roe v. Wade ushered in a ""culture of death:""  

&gt;""Over time, our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago, over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country.""  [[Source](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/donald-trump-op-ed-my-vision-for-a-culture-of-life/article/2581271#.VqYjvxKVFbo.twitter)]  

Trump further illustrated his anti-choice stance when he stated that he believes that women who undergo abortions should face some form of legal punishment:  
  
""The answer is that, there **has** to be some form of punishment [for abortions. Ed.]""  [[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQfJpTUYr2Q)]  
  
To be fair on that last point though, [Mr. Trump went on to change his position on punishing women for abortions four times in the following three days, including that the choice of punishing women for abortions should be returned to the state, then that the doctor performing the abortion should be punished and not the woman, then that abortion laws shouldn't be changed at all, then back to letting the states decide and changing the law through judicial appointments.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/04/03/donald-trumps-ever-shifting-positions-on-abortion/)  Which of these positions he believes is dependent on what the voters believe, I've heard Trump supporters defend each position as his one true position.  
  
In the spirit of fairness, it bears mentioning that prior to his 2012 Presidential bid, Donald Trump described himself as ""very pro-choice:""  

&gt;""Well, I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debate the subject. But, you still, I just believe in choice.""  [[Source](http://www.charismanews.com/politics/primaries/51296-donald-trumps-views-on-abortion-confusing)]  
  
**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: Donald Trump nominates Supreme Court Justices that are willing to overturn Roe v. Wade, thus making abortion illegal nationwide.  Mr. Trump could also endorse and sign laws outlining legal punishments for women who have abortions, and doctors who perform abortions; if life begins at conception, as many anti-abortion individuals believe, then the procedure of abortion is tantamount to murder, and should be punished as such.  With a ban on safe, legal abortions women may turn to self administered means of terminating their pregnancy, [including the return of the coat-hanger abortion](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/15/the-return-of-the-coat-hanger-abortion.html), as we have [already seen in many states.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/opinion/sunday/the-return-of-the-diy-abortion.html)

# #3: Donald Trump's stance on immigration will hurt even native born Americans.  

Donald Trump's two most noteworthy positions on immigration from South America in general, and Mexico in specific, are that: 1.) We need to build a border wall, and 2.) We need to deport all undocumented immigrants from the United States.  
  
&gt;“I will build a great wall — and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me —and I’ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”  [[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXcPl4T55I)]  
  
By ""very inexpensively"" Mr. Trump meant roughly $8 billion, but estimates show that the true cost would be closer to [two to three times that much, between $15 billion and $25 billion,](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/09/this-is-what-trumps-border-wall-could-cost-us.html) additionally the [cost to maintain the wall could reach $750 million per year, plus another $1.7 billion per year for additional border patrol agents and holding facilities.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/donald-trumps-immigration-tab-166-billion-121500)  Mr. Trump's explanation for how he will pay for the border wall is simple:  

&gt;""Mexico's going to pay for the wall,""  [[Source](http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/28/donald-trump-mexico-going-to-pay-for-wall.html)]  
  
To which the Mexican Treasury Secretary has responded:  

&gt;""There is no scenario in which Mexico will pay for this wall that is being proposed by the United States presidential hopeful,""  [[Source](http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/03/politics/mexico-treasury-secretary-trump-wall/)]  

Donald Trump proposes to circumvent Mexico's refusal to fund the wall by [preventing remittances, money sent home by both documented and undocumented immigrants, from flowing back to Mexico.  He has said that he will accomplish this by use of the Patriot Act to intercept international money transfers.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/memo-explains-how-donald-trump-plans-to-pay-for-border-wall/2007/)  The feasibility and legality of this approach is questionable, and certain to be challenged, [as it would require a large expansion of the reach of the Patriot Act.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/politics/memo-explains-how-donald-trump-plans-to-pay-for-border-wall/2007/)  
  
&gt;""These remittances amount to nearly $25bn each year, roughly 2% of the Mexican gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. Cutting off these money transfers could doom the Mexican economy to recession and severely damage diplomatic relations.""  [[Source](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/05/donald-trump-mexico-border-wall-plan-remittances)]  
  
Mexico going into a recession, besides just hurting the economic stability of the United States, would also serve to increase the desire to immigrate out of Mexico, legally or otherwise.  

There's also the matter of deporting those undocumented immigrants already on US soil.  Donald Trump has promised to deport all 11 million plus undocumented immigrants, saying:  
  
&gt;""We got to move 'em out, we're going to move 'em back in if they're really good people.""  [[Source](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/29/politics/donald-trump-immigration-plan-healthcare-flip-flop/)]  

So what's wrong with that?  Let's first look at the cost:  [An analysis by the Center for American Progress suggests that it would cost an average of $10,070 to deport a single immigrant](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/immigration/news/2015/02/23/106983/what-would-it-cost-to-deport-all-5-million-beneficiaries-of-executive-action-on-immigration/), which would result in the [American tax payer spending around $114 billion to deport all 11.3 million undocumented immigrants.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34789502)  If we also include the costs of apprehension, detention, legal processing, and deportation, we add on an additional $420 to $620 billion in spending over the course of twenty years, or $21 billion per year.  And what would be the result of that deporting all 11 million undocumented immigrants?  Roughly a $1.6 trillion reduction in the size of the American economy over the course of two decades.  
  
So the American tax payer would be spending $15-$25 billion for a border wall, $750 million per year for maintenance on the wall, $1.7b/year to staff the wall, $21b/year to find and hold illegal immigrants, $114b to physically deport those immigrants, and what do we get for it?  In addition to spending so much tax payer money, we also get to see our economy shrink by 6%, or $1.6 trillion over the course of two decades.  

Donald Trump's immigration policy could best be described as ""Spend more, get less."" or even ""Spend more to spend more.""
  
**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: In addition to the huge upfront cost, the huge maintenance cost, and the massive damage to our economy, we could throw one of our closest allies and strongest trading partners into a recession.  A recession would drive up crime in Mexico, crime on the border, and encourage people to immigrate to the United States.  The economic cost isn't all, though.  If Mr. Trump is true to his word that he will deport **all** 11 million undocumented immigrants, he will have to massively expand surveillance and police presence.  If he wishes to deport every last single immigrant, law enforcement will have to investigate every employer for undocumented workers, investigate private homes for the possibility that they may be harboring an illegal immigrant, and have the right to check identification on city streets similar to the unconstitutional ""stop and frisk"" laws.  All this will require Mr. Trump to acquire a massive number of judicial warrants, or else risk violating the 4th amendment protecting against illegal search and seizure.  There's also the matter of American born children of undocumented parents: By virtue of the 14th amendment these children are legal citizens of the United States, deporting them to Mexico with their families would be a violation of the 14th amendment, allowing them to stay in the United States would put a strain on an already weak adoption system.  The tax payer would be footing hundreds of billions of dollars in additional spending, subjecting themselves to state sanctioned searches of their persons, homes, businesses, and records, and all so that we can reduce the strength of the American economy by $1.6 trillion.

#2: Donald Trump's healthcare plan would cost $270 billion, and leave 21 million Americans without health insurance.  
  
Much can be said about the Affordable Care Act, its critics will be quick to point out that the ACA has made health insurance more expensive, increased taxes, result in job loses, and left millions of Americans uninsured.  The good news for Americans is that those critics are wrong.  In fact, the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, has:  
  
  * Provided insurance for 22.8 million Americans.  [[Source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottgottlieb/2015/05/14/how-many-people-has-obamacare-really-insured/#61482655777f)]  
  
  * Saved hospitals $7.4 billion in uncompensated costs.  [[Source](http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/03/23/5-numbers-to-know-for-obamacares-5-year-anniversary)]  
  
  * Reduced the ten year budget deficit forecast by $137 billion. [[Source](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/50252)]  
  
  * Saved Medicare $716 billion.  [[Source](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-medicare/)]  
  
  * And reduced the rate of uninsured Americans from 15.7% before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, to 9.2% just three months after the law went into full effect.  [[Source](http://obamacarefacts.com/uninsured-rates/)]  
  
But perhaps the biggest benefit of the ACA isn't in the numbers at all.  The ACA made it illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage based on preexisting conditions, this meant that, for the first time, the ill, the disabled, and the formerly ill or disabled, would have access to affordable health care.  [In fact the ACA greatly expanded consumer rights when it comes to health insurance.](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/rights-and-protections/)
  
[Donald Trump's healthcare plan is to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare,) and replace it with a market friendly alternative.](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/healthcare-reform)  
  
I don't feel that much personal commentary is warranted on this, so I'll let Fiscal Factcheck explain:  
  
&gt;By our estimates, Mr. Trump’s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would cost roughly $270 billion over ten years including estimates of faster economic growth, and nearly $500 billion under conventional scoring.

&gt;The policies would cause almost 21 million people to lose their insurance coverage, as the replacement health care policies would only cover 5 percent of the 22 million individuals who would lose coverage upon the repeal of Obamacare. This would almost double the number of Americans without health insurance.  

[[Source](http://fiscalfactcheck.crfb.org/measuring-trumps-healthcare-plan/)]  

Repealing the ACA would allow insurance companies to once again deny coverage based on pre existing conditions, allow them to cancel coverage because one of their customers fell ill, put limits on how much coverage someone can claim, and charge for a wide variety of preventative care including vaccinations.  The removal of these protections would be a boon to health insurance companies, allowing them to raise prices for their customers, cut costs from their bottom line, and return to the good old days of 2008, and the American people would pay for those profits with higher health care costs, lower insurance rates, and fewer personal protections.  
  
As it stands, Donald Trump's health care plan can be summed up in the same way that his immigration policy was: ""Spend more, get less.""  
  
**So what's the worst that could happen?**  
Worst case scenario: Donald Trump enacts his healthcare plan.  The American tax payer is on the hook for between $270 billion and $500 billion in extra spending, and roughly 21 million American citizens lose their health insurance.  Insurance companies could once again deny coverage for existing conditions, throw customers off their plan for illnesses, and raise their prices unchecked.  Essentially the American people would be paying to kick Americans off of their healthcare, while also denying themselves the current rights and protections that the ACA affords them.  This is to say nothing of the moral impact of Donald Trump's plan, which I think speaks for itself.  
  
---  
  
#1 Donald Trump's economic plan is bad for the economy.  
  
Donald Trump's tax plan is simple: Cut taxes, cut spending.  This is nothing new or surprising for a Republican candidate, nor are the specific results of this policy:  
  
 * Lowest income households would save an average of 1% of after-tax income.  
 * The top 1% of households would save an average of 17.5% of after-tax income.  
 * The top 0.1% of households would save an average of 19% of after-tax income.  
 
[[Source](http://fortune.com/2015/12/23/donald-trump-plan-tax-policy-center/)]  
  
Ultimately this amounts to massive tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans, Americans like Donald Trump, and token tax cuts for the poorest of Americans.  Also unsurprising is what Mr. Trump's tax plan would do to the debt and deficit:  
  
 * Increase the federal deficit by $9.5 trillion over the first decade, $11.2 trillion if we include incremental interest payed.  
 * Increase the national debt by nearly 80% of GDP.  
 
[[Source: Tax Policy Center](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan/full)]  
[[Analysis of Tax Policy Center Analysis](http://fortune.com/2016/03/08/donald-trumps-tax-plan-primary/)]  

Put simply: Donald Trump's tax plan would grow the deficit and grow the debt by cutting taxes for the richest of Americans.
  
Now many people will be quick to point out that Mr. Trump could cut spending to offset the increases to the debt and deficit, and they are correct.  Donald Trump has already signaled that he will not cut Medicare or Social Security benefits, which are the largest costs to the federal government.  Without having Medicare or Social Security on the table, Mr. Trump would have to cut 80% of all discretionary federal spending, which would be debilitating to areas like national defense, education, and scientific research.  I think that Donald Trump said it best when he said:  
  
&gt; “It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans. Now, it shouldn’t be that way. But if you go back, I mean it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats. But certainly we had some very good economies under Democrats, as well as Republicans. But we’ve had some pretty bad disasters under the Republicans.”  [[Source](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/21/politics/donald-trump-election-democrat/)]  

And on the above quote I agree with Mr. Trump: Electing the Republican nominee in 2016 could be a ""pretty big disaster,"" and the facts bear him out:  
  
 * Recessions are more frequent under Republicans than Democrats.  [[Source](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/22/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-recessions-more-frequent-under-rep/)]  
 
 * Republican presidents during their terms have contributed far more to the debt load of the nation than Democrats.  [[Source](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/gop-presidents-have-been-the-worst-contributors-to-the-federal-debt/264193/)]  
 
 * Democratic presidents create twice as many jobs and three times more job growth than Republicans.  [[Source](http://www.politicususa.com/2014/10/29/study-reveals-democratic-presidents-create-jobs-republicans.html)]  
 
Those could be the reasons that [Donald Trump has been a big contributor to Democratic campaigns, including Secretary Clinton, his presumptive opponent.](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/donald-trump-donations-democrats-hillary-clinton-119071)
   
**So what's the worst that could happen?**   
Worst case scenario is debatable on this one: Would it be worse to grow the national debt 80% by adding $9.5 trillion onto the deficit over the next decade, or would it be worse to pay for the deficit with an 80% cut to programs like defense, education, and scientific research?  This is probably a matter of political ideology, for Republicans and Conservatives, growing the debt and deficit is worse; for Democrats and Liberals, cutting education, defense, and scientific research to death is worse.  Ultimately, regardless of ideology, everyone suffers under Trump's tax plan...  Well, except Donald Trump, he'd see his taxes cut by nearly 20%.

#Conclusion:  
  
Donald Trump is bad for our civil liberties, bad for our privacy, bad for our economy, bad for our people, and even bad for our planet.  There's no need to attack him on the topic of sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, or any of the rest: His policies are a good enough reason not to vote for him.  You don't need to say ""Donald Trump is literally Hitler,"" you can just point out that, in order to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, Donald Trump may have to have the police check your identification, inspect your home, and read your phone records.  You don't need to say that ""Donald Trump is sexist,"" just point out that opposes a woman's right to choose and thinks that she, and her doctor, should be punished for the procedure.  You don't need to say that ""Donald Trump is a fascist,"" just point out that he ""tends to err on the side of security"" rather than freedom.  There's no need for hyperbole, hyperbole doesn't work.  When someone calls Senator Sanders a socialist like it's an insult, most Sanders supporters tune out: Some supporters simply won't believe it, others may believe it but they just don't care about it, and some are voting for him specifically because of it.  The same is true when someone calls Trump a sexist, or homophobic, or Islamophobic, or a bigot, or a racist.  The point has already been made, and anyone who would have left has already left by now.  Instead of pounding your head against a wall trying to convince someone who doesn't believe, doesn't care, or otherwise, point out how Trump is wrong on policy, because he is.  
  
...  
  
I've got some space left.  How about a few more?  

We've already hit on policy, but what about personality?  Donald Trump's supporters certainly seem to be concerned with the personality of the Presidential nominees: Ted Cruz is sad and pathetic, Jeb Bush is low energy, Marco Rubio is a robot, Trump's opposition are cucks, and Hillary Clinton is things I'd rather not say, 'cuz I'm PC bro.  Many supporters will tell you that their vote was won by Mr. Trump's personality, explaining that ""He tells it like it is"" or ""he doesn't pander"" or even ""I know where he stands.""  Let's explore some of those in my remaining characters.

[Nope.](http://www.politifact.com/arizona/statements/2016/apr/01/donald-trump/does-federal-government-fund-undocumented-immigran/)
  
I picked these seven occasions out of a hat, but Mr. Trump's errors aren't limited to just these.  Currently [76% of statements investigated by PolitiFact have been rated as Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire, (throw in Half True and he's up to 91%)](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/) and he even [won their ""Lie of the Year"" contest in 2015.](http://www.politicususa.com/2015/12/21/donald-trump-tells-lies-misstatements-win-lie-year-award.html)  Rather than pick out specific instances of mistakes Mr. Trump has made, I would encourage you to go find some for yourselves.  There are more than enough to chose from.  Unfortunately I doubt that many Trump supporters would go to PolitiFact to explore, so you may have to take the evidence to them yourselves.
  
So why are so many of Donald Trump's statements false?  As I see it, it comes down to to possibilities:  
  
  1. Donald Trump is an idiot.  
  2. Donald Trump is a liar.  
  
Now for my part, I don't think that Donald Trump is an idiot.  Being an idiot can be quite the hindrance to running a multi-billion dollar brand, and frankly there are not many billionaires that are genuine idiots.  Plus we know that Donald Trump's I.Q. [""is one of the highest""](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/332308211321425920?lang=en), and that he [""knows words, he has the best words.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UIE_MRAhEA)  Idiots don't have the best words.  Checkmate, Libtards.  If Donald Trump isn't an idiot then what's left?  That he's a liar.  Now this makes much more sense.  Being an idiot is quite the hindrance to being a billionaire, but being a liar could be quite the boon.  
  
Trump is just telling voters what they want to hear.  Angry at Mexicans?  Mexico is sending rapists and murderers.  Angry at African Americans?  Blacks are responsible for 82% of white murders.  Angry at President Obama?  His grandmother watched his birth in Kenya.  Your favorite book is the Bible?  So is his!  Just don't ask him his favorite passage.  If it'll get him votes, he'll say it.  If you don't believe me just watch him flip once he gets to the general.  Speaking of which...  
  
---  
  
#He's a flip-flop.  (No, not the footwear.  That wouldn't even make sense.)  
  
So we've already covered how Donald Trump went through five positions on abortion in three days, and everyone knows that he's had three wives, and we touched on how he supported Secretary Clinton back in 2008, but what else?  
  
How about that he supported a ban on assault weapons prior to his 2012 Presidential bid?  
  
&gt;“I generally oppose gun control, but I support the ban on assault weapons and I support a slightly longer waiting period to purchase a gun. With today’s internet technology we should be able to tell within 72 hours if a potential gun owner has a record.”  [[Source](https://theintercept.com/2016/01/27/donald-trump-in-2000-i-support-the-ban-on-assault-weapons/)]  
  
As of 2016 he's pretty fond of semi-automatic rifles, [he was excited to get one as a present from a supporter.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/05/politics/donald-trump-ar-15-gift-new-hampshire/)  
  
He may have changed his position on semi automatic rifles because, as he said on October 19th, 2015:  
  
&gt;""You know, the president is thinking about signing an executive order where he wants to take your guns away.""  [[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfjQr9U0tws)]  

Of course [President Obama has never advocated for gun confiscation,](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/10/trump-hears-obama-wants-to-take-guns/) but maybe Mr. Trump just didn't know that when he said that President Obama was going to confiscate guns.  
  
Yeah, but that's old, what about something recent?  
  
Let's try self-funding his campaign:  
  
&gt;""I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!""  [[Source](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/694560681090248704)]  
  
Of course it was later born out that [Trump wasn't fully self-funding his campaign,](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/moneytips/trump-self-funded-contrib_b_9365730.html) but at least he was self-funded enough to *say* that he was self-funding.  That's got to count for something, right?  But how is this a flip flop?  
  
Well, now that Ted Cruz is out of the race, he's eschewing the antiquated notion that he shouldn't take money from PACs and Super-PACs and getting with the times:  
  
&gt;“I’ll be putting up money, but won’t be completely self-funding, as I did during the primaries,”  [[Source](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/donald-trump-wont-self-finance-his-presidential-campaign-2016-05-04)]  
  
It's okay, I'm sure all those supporters who's vote he won by promising not to take money from special interests won't mind that he's going to take money from special interests.  
  
""Yeah, but I don't care about campaign finance or owning semi-automatic rifles, I'm just an average minimum wage Joe.""  

Well I've got something for you too!  Back in 2015 Mr. Trump's opinion was that the minimum wage was too high:  
  
&gt;""We have to become competitive with the world. Our taxes are too high, our wages are too high, everything is too high, what's going to happen is now people are going to start firing people."" and that  “I hate to say it, but we have to leave [the minimum wage] the way it is,”  [[Source](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/278778-trump-expresses-openness-to-raising-minimum-wage)]  
  
Fast-forward to a world where he has to win in the general election, and [now Donald Trump is ""open to doing something with"" the minimum wage.](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/04/donald-trump-says-hes-open-to-doing-something-on-minimum-wage/)  Before Ted Cruz dropped out wages were too high, 24 hours after Ted Cruz drops out wages are too low, which is interesting considering that wages didn't change between the before and after of Trump winning the nomination.  
  
""Okay, but those are just policy positions, and those can evolve, give me something substantial!""  

Did you know that Donald Trump has switched political parties four times so far?  Trump first registered as a Republican in 1987, but that wasn't for him.  He was a Republican for twelve years before he left, explaining:

He went on to join the Reform Party, which was the Independence Party in New York.  He even [ran as a Presidential candidate for the Reform Party in the year 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign,_2000), but dropped out after Jesse Ventura left the party, and [David Duke offered his official support to Presidential contender Pat Buchanan.](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/03/trumps-david-duke-amnesia/)  After two short years, Donald Trump left the Reform Party:

David Duke is still a bigot and a racist, but at least this time he knows which Presidential candidate to support!
  
But the Republicans were too crazy right, and the Reform party was self-destructing and accepting bigots and racists, so what's left?  The Democratic party, of course!  So in 2001 Donald Trump officially registered as a Democrat, and this relationship lasted another eight years.  He didn't run for any offices, though he did [donate to Democratic candidates right up until 2008.](http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/articles/2016-01-14/donald-trump-donated-to-democrats-until-2008)  

Unfortunately just like his first two parties and wives, his relationship with the Democratic party just wasn't meant to be.  As of September 2009 Donald Trump had rejoined the ""too crazy right"" Republican party, just as a newly elected President Obama was inaugerated to return them to their sanity.  Truly 2008-2016 will be remembered as the golden age of sane Republican politics.  [Aside from a brief period in 2012 when Donald Trump was unaffiliated with any political party,](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-changed-political-parties-at-least-fi/) he has been a Republican since 2009.  
  
And being a Republican again has worked out well for Mr. Trump.  In 2012 he ran for the Republican Presidential nomination on the platform of ""President Obama is a secret Kenyan,"" and ran again in 2016 on the platform of ""I never said President Obama was a secret Kenyan.""  I'm kidding, Donald Trump refuses to answer questions on the President's country of birth.  And that brings us to today.
  
This list is short, but there are *plenty* more issues on which Donald Trump has flip flopped, and I would encourage you to do your own research on issues that are important to you.  I'll get the ball rolling:

(And I encourage you to as well.)  What I found was that many of Mr. Trump's responses were in no way pertinent to the question that he was asked, here is an Imgur album of 23 of the most glaring examples:

Full disclosure: This is not a complete transcript of the interview, I left out questions that he did actually answer.  Many of the questions have been shortened for the sake of formatting.  What I labeled as relevant was my opinion, hence why I included the entirety of his original, unedited response.  About a quarter of the images have relevant misspelled, but it's 5am and I don't want to do the work a second time.

This brings us to the end of our journey folks.  It's not that I'm out of things to write, I'm just sick of reading about Donald Trump, and YouTube keeps recommending videos from Fox News, indicating that Google thinks I support him.  
  
I'll leave you with one final thought: The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing.  
  
We all get downtrodden reading the lies and misinformation being spread during a Presidential campaign, and often times we may feel that we cannot accomplish anything on our own.  Indeed the maxim holds true that ""The amount of energy necessary to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it,"" and Donald Trump is a bullshit factory staffed by under paid Chinese labor.  ([For all I know that's the same Chinese staff that was responsible for making his clothing line.](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/08/news/economy/donald-trump-trade/))  That said, it is incumbent upon us to refute that bullshit for others, because many others are unwilling or unable to refute it for themselves.  That's a lot to ask, I know, but there's a lot at risk.  
  
To quote a user on /r/The_Donald:  
  
&gt;""You don't publicly debate on a forum to change the minds of the people you're debating. You do it to change the minds of the onlookers. If your message is true and good, people will follow.""  
  
You may never be able to convince someone who supports Donald Trump that their candidate is on the wrong side of the issues, many won't be willing to see the truth no matter how well you present it, but you *can* change the minds of those reading along.  If someone sees that ""82% of white murders are committed by blacks,"" without seeing that lie refuted, they may consider it to be a fact.  From there the lie spreads and spreads until someone is willing to take the time and make the effort to disprove it.  This is doubly true in politics: When someone in a position of power, like a Presidential nominee, tells a lie, that lie is believed, that lie is spread, that lie is given undue credence.  Those of us who know the truth have a responsibility to spread the truth, downvotes be damned.  I don't need to remind any of you that our nation, our fellow man, will pay the price for any untruth given voice without the truth making itself heard.

I wanted to say one quick disclaimer about my personal intentions with all of this. Despite the accusations and threatening PM’s I receive on a daily basis, I am not looking to *get* Hillary indicted. From the onset, I have said this story fascinates me. It’s like a good book and every day brings a new plot twist. I can make guesses on how the book will end, but that doesn’t mean I am driving the narrative. Alright so let’s dive in - and let’s start with the “good news”  that Hillary got this week.

_________


[CNN: FBI interviews Clinton aides including Huma Abedin as part of email probe](http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/05/politics/fbi-interviews-huma-abedin-clinton-aide/index.html)

[WaPo: Scant evidence that Clinton had malicious intent in handling of emails](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/federal-prosecutors-in-virginia-assisting-in-clinton-email-probe/2016/05/05/f0277faa-12f0-11e6-81b4-581a5c4c42df_story.html)

The only empirical information I found in the CNN article is that Clinton’s closest aide, Huma Abedin, has been interviewed by the FBI and that other close aides have been interviewed multiple times. The WaPo piece initially started as an article revealing that the FBI is working closely with the U.S. Attorney’s office of Eastern Virginia, famous for handling high-profile cases relating to terrorism and national security - it’s also where Guccifer was extradited to. They quickly picked up on the CNN story and added the speculation that there is **‘scant evidence’ showing that Hillary intended to break classification rules.** CNN went a bit further and said **investigators haven't found evidence to prove that Clinton willfully violated the law.**

These declarative statements are from unnamed source(s) either *briefed* or *familiar* with the FBI investigation. They also claim that Huma fully cooperated in her interview, and that there is no evidence that Guccifer hacked Hillary’s server [which isn't true](http://gawker.com/new-hacked-presidential-art-may-be-bill-clintons-white-1476802573), because he would have leaked the emails and there is no trace in the security logs - more on that in a bit. My only question around the validity of these statements is: What U.S. official(s) would be briefed about the evidence of an ongoing FBI investigation or even the actions of a witness in a recently conducted FBI interview? Not even the President has claimed to be briefed, if you believe him or not. Why would these officials parrot [the exact defense the Clinton camp authored](https://twitter.com/brianefallon/status/728004341777502209) the night before in relation to Guccifer? Interestingly, the NY Times, AP, Reuters did not include these unsourced statements in their reporting. 

Now, I am going to take this paragraph to speculate and say that this source is someone contacted by or close to the Clinton camp - which [after yesterday’s events](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/06/hillary-super-pac-draft-oped/) might not be far fetched. Huma’s interview was never confirmed by any official source (DOJ/FBI) but reported as accurate by reputable news organizations. The Clinton team are the only other party in this investigation that would be privy to that information and would benefit from the claims that she fully cooperated and Hillary’s server wasn’t hacked. This story was wrapped in some of the most explosive speculation we have seen about what the FBI has collected. Motivating some journalists to [declare the entire investigation over](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/05/06/hillary-clinton-is-going-to-be-exonerated-on-the-email-controversy-it-wont-matter/) and to move on. These should have been two separate stories based on the information - I don’t think it was a coincidence that the same sources that can confirm the Huma interview are pushing the narrative that Hillary is free and clear. You’ll notice the sources all made sure to include the exact legal phrasing around *willful intent*, [here is a good writeup](http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/04/emmens_reaem_and_hillary_clinton.html#ixzz47tWr8vQX) that summarizes why that will not be a good defense for Hillary. Full disclosure it comes from a conservative lawyer, but the points stand on their own. Alright, enough with my speculation.

[Romanian hacker Guccifer: I breached Clinton server, 'it was easy'](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/05/04/romanian-hacker-guccifer-breached-clinton-server-it-was-easy.html)

Okay, /u/NebraskaGunOwner time to be impartial and be just as critical about Guccifer’s claims into breaching her server. I will be. Guccifer is not a credible source and I wouldn’t believe him either, unless he has proof. That being the case, let’s look at what he actually said:


&gt; “I was not paying attention. For me, it was not like the Hillary Clinton server, it was like an email server she and others were using with political voting stuff,"" Guccifer said.

Sidenote: What the heck does he mean by *political voting stuff*. Continued...

&gt; “For example, when Sidney Blumenthal got an email, I checked the email pattern from Hillary Clinton, from Colin Powell from anyone else to find out the originating IP. … When they send a letter, the email header is the originating IP usually,” Lazar explained. 

&gt; He said, “then I scanned with an IP scanner.""
Lazar  emphasized that he used readily available web programs to see if the server was “alive” and which ports were open. 
In the process of mining data from the Blumenthal account, Lazar said he came across evidence that others were on the Clinton server.

&gt; ""As far as I remember, yes, there were … up to 10, like, IPs from other parts of the world,” he said. 


So we know that Guccifer hacked into Syndey Blumenthal’s AOL account and would have at least seen emails originating from Clinton’s server. We know his MO was to use one email contact to get to another. Though he admits that he didn’t think of it as Hillary Clinton’s server, certainly no else did at the time either. He described most of the emails as boring, which might be why he never posted them online? Shout out to /u/Monodioxide for pointing out that there is [evidence already that Guccifer breached the Clinton Library server](http://gawker.com/new-hacked-presidential-art-may-be-bill-clintons-white-1476802573) which is likely the same server Hillary used as Secretary of State.

[Alright so what was the security like on her server?](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/467ff78858bf4dde8db21677deeff101/only-ap-clinton-server-ran-software-risked-hacking)

&gt; Clinton's server, which handled her personal and State Department correspondence, appeared to **allow users to connect openly over the Internet to control it remotely,** according to detailed records compiled in 2012. Experts said the Microsoft remote desktop service wasn't intended for such use without additional protective measures, and was the subject of U.S. government and industry warnings at the time over attacks from even low-skilled intruders.

&gt; The AP exclusively reviewed numerous records from an Internet ""census"" by an anonymous hacker-researcher, who three years ago used unsecured devices to scan hundreds of millions of Internet Protocol addresses for accessible doors, called ""ports."" Using a computer in Serbia, the hacker scanned Clinton's basement server in Chappaqua at least twice, in August and December 2012. It was unclear whether the hacker was aware the server belonged to Clinton, although it identified itself as providing email services for **clintonemail.com.** The results are widely available online.

&gt; Remote-access software allows users to control another computer from afar. The programs are usually operated through an encrypted connection — called a virtual private network, or VPN. **But Clinton's system appeared to accept commands directly from the Internet without such protections.**

&gt; In Clinton's case, Internet addresses the AP traced to her home in Chappaqua revealed open ports on three devices, including her email system. Each numbered port is commonly, but not always uniquely, associated with specific features or functions.



Okay, so we know that her server wasn’t even protected against the lowest-skilled intruders through open ports and open RDP/VNC. But this is something she pays people to deal with, right? Why should Hillary be worried about this sort of thing?

[According to this primary source:](http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boswell-memo.pdf)

She was briefed specifically that: 

&gt; A dramatic increase … in attempts by [redacted] to compromise the private home e-mail accounts of senior [State] Department officials.”
“Specifically, the actors are sending cleverly forged e-mails to victims’ private web-based accounts (e.g. Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo),” he wrote. **“These ‘spear phishing’ messages appear to be sent by U.S. government officials but are designed to trick recipients into activating embedded malicious code by clicking on an attachment or link.”**

&gt; “Although the targets are unclassified personal e-mail accounts, **the likely objective is to compromise user accounts and thereby gain access to policy documents and personal information that could enable technical surveillance and possibly blackmail,”** Boswell wrote.

If only Boswell knew that Hillary’s server wasn’t anything like Gmail or Yahoo.

I want to come back on the the bolded part later. But, In fact, [Hillary was the target](https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/HRCEmail_OctWeb/223/DOC_0C05787240/C05787240.pdf) of several of these attacks. She responded to one of them:

&gt; *“Neera–did you send me this? If not, I think your email address book has been hacked. If so, why?”*

Now, either Hillary is proficient enough to recognize this as a phishing attack without clicking on the link, or she clicked on the link and discovered that it was not something Neera would typically send to her, and asked why she sent it?

Maybe Guccifer authored an email from Syndey Blumenthal that was less obvious than this? Either way, let’s look at how the professionals would have done it:

[Clinton server faced hacking from China, South Korea and Germany](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/hillary-clinton-email-server-hacked-china-south-korea-germany-214546)

&gt; Hillary Clinton's private email server containing tens of thousands of messages from her tenure as secretary of state — including more than 400 *(2000)* now considered classified — was the subject of hacking attempts from China, South Korea and Germany after she stepped down in 2013, according to Congressional investigators.

&gt; **The attempted intrusions reported late Wednesday by AP were more direct attempts from abroad to gain unauthorized access to Clinton's server and did not rely on email messages.** However, it is unclear whether they represented a concerted effort by one or more foreign intelligence services to access Clinton's data or if the efforts were part of the far more commonplace hacking on the internet.

Okay, so let’s look back at Guccifer’s claim. It really doesn’t seem that far fetched in context of what we know about her server. If he didn’t hack it, it seems quite likely others did. As for the security logs which showed no intrusion. Responsible outlets have reported how silly this is as a defense. A user earlier analogized it to Nixon’s goons signing the guestbook of the Watergate hotel when they broke in. Clinton did not have an [intrusion prevention system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system) installed which are logs that could be viewed as reliable. The most damaging [Russian hack of our Federal Government](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/10/politics/state-department-hack-worst-ever/) origintated from a phishing attack inside the State Department. Are we really to believe that Russian hackers who gained access via the State Department wouldn’t have thought to look into the Secretary of State’s email address? Especially when it is **ClintonEmail.com**? I mean hell it’s certainly possible that breach is because of this homebrew server. Clinton communicated with some of the highest ranking government officials, including the President, on what was an easily compromisable server.

Just to quickly add, [Clinton sent out a State Department wide memo that stated:](http://www.ijreview.com/2015/03/264683-internal-memo-hillary-clintons-state-dept-employees-dont-use-personal-email-accounts/)

&gt; “avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.” 
“It is the Department’s general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized AIS [the authorized department information system] which has the proper level of security control to provide non-repudiation, authentication and encryption, to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the resident information. 

&gt; Employees should be aware that transmissions from the Department’s OpenNet to and from non-U.S. Government Internet addresses, and other .gov or .mil addresses, unless specifically directed through an approved secure means, traverse the Internet un-encrypted.”

So as far as Guccifer goes. Do I believe him? No, not without proof. But what he has said is completely aligned with what we know currently. Furthermore, it seems incredibly naive to believe that it wasn’t breached by other hackers. 

____________


[With this case apparently coming to a head in the next couple weeks.](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-to-be-interviewed-in-fbi-email-investigation/) I want to talk about some questions I have that might still get answered, or hopefully the FBI will speak to ultimately. 

Let’s start with the fact that when we talk about this investigation, most of us, including myself, think about this in the context of her time as Secretary of State. However, some of the most potentially damaging decisions she made was as a **private citizen** while still possessing the server full of classified materials from her time as Secretary of State. Including her unilateral [decision to destroy over 30,000 emails](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4g4noe/facts_around_hillarys_30000_deleted_personal/) without any government review. 

But, /u/nebraskagunowner *“she had no classified materials on her server, it was all retroactively classified!”* Let’s start with the fact that we haven’t seen half of what she had on her server, or what has been withheld from the public. Seems that would be pertinent information before making that claim. More importantly though, [she signed this agreement](http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/HRC-SCI-NDA1.pdf) when she was sworn in:


&gt; **Intending to be legally bound,** I hereby accept the obligations contained in this Agreement in consideration of my being granted access to classified information. As used in this Agreement, **classified information is marked or unmarked classified information,** including oral communications, that is classified under the standards of Executive Order 12958, or under any other Executive order or statute that prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of information in the interest of national security; and unclassified information that meets the standards for classification and is in the process of a classification determination as provided in Sections 1.1. 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4(e) of Executive Order 12958, or under any other Executive order or statute that requires protection for such information in the interest of national security. 

&gt; **I understand and accept that by being granted access to classified information, special confidence and trust shall be placed in me by the United States Government.**

&gt; **...I understand that if I am uncertain about the classification status of information, I am required to confirm from an authorized official that the information is unclassified before I may disclose it…**

Interestingly, State Department policy required her to go through an exit debrief where she was supposed to sign the same document that later states:

&gt; **“I agree that I shall return all classified materials which have, or may come into my possession of for which I am responsible because of such access…. upon the conclusion of my employment or other relationship that requires address to classified information.”**

Both Hillary and Cheryl Mills never signed this part of the document. Huma Abedin did however. 
**So as private citizens**, both Hillary and Huma were clearly violating all of the authorized record keeping requirements for classified materials. No one can argue that a private citizen’s homebrew server in their basement would constitute an “authorized location”.

___________

What really is Bryan Pagliano’s role in all of this? We know he was granted immunity. Hillary and her team have mentioned this is just so he can provide empirical facts in regards to the *security review*, some have said it’s because his [separate income personally from the Clintons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/clintons-personally-paid-state-department-staffer-to-maintain-server/2015/09/04/b13ab23e-530c-11e5-9812-92d5948a40f8_story.html) was never disclosed to the government. 

So the Clintons pay him out of their own pocket. He gets an unheard of political appointment in the State IT department. Yet, he is so incompetent that he can’t setup an email server with basic protections? If he is worth half what he was being paid wouldn’t he have warned that what he was doing was extremely risky?

[Justin Cooper, a long time Bill Clinton aide, senior Clinton Foundation advisor, Senior Teneo consultant,](http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/29/report-clintons-are-paying-legal-bills-for-aide-who-registered-private-email-address/) *reportedly* has racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. The domains the Clintons used were registered under his name. Would he be the person Pagliano would have interfaced with in setting up the server?

_____________


Finally, I want to come full circle and talk about the issue of her server being hacked and the implications of her being a compromised candidate. This is purely my own thoughts and I know it’s likely to rile up her supporters, but it’s a valid point in my mind. 

As shown above, Hillary Clinton was warned by the State Department that hackers are trying to: ***compromise user accounts and thereby gain access to policy documents and personal information that could enable technical surveillance and possibly blackmail.***

Crazy theory, right? Hillary being compromised and blackmailed? *The State Department thought it was serious issue.* Looking at the way she failed to protect her server, it seems like the burden of proof almost needs to be proving it wasn’t hacked, and it’s safer to assume it was. There were no reliable methods to identify intrusions and it had root access vulnerabilities from day one. 

Hillary, her aide’s, her family, and the Clinton Foundation used this server for both business and personal communication. Through the unprotected server, personal devices would be easier to compromise by professional hackers. Is it completely ridiculous to think that there is something that would cause a potential disqualifying scandal if revealed, even if it’s purely personal in nature? Would any of us be able to weather that - certainly not my browsing history. If China or Russia have the equivalent of the Monica Lewinsky scandal in their backpocket, how can Clinton or her aides properly negotiate with these governments. There is a reason the intelligence community actively looks for infidelity, debts, personal vices when trying to flip or blackmail foreign officials and protecting our own.

Okay, that is about as *conspiracy theory* as I will get, but again, the State Department thought it was a serious issue.

In this post, the reader will see the following: descriptions of the current electoral systems, their problems and then possible solutions. These descriptions rely heavily on links to very informative and interesting videos. Knowledge of the information in these videos is integral to understanding the proposals.    

What I’m looking for is discussion, comments, suggestions and constructive criticisms about these proposals. What I’m *not* looking for is a discussion about political preferences. I view these proposals as non-partisan and believe they would benefit everyone in the US.    

This post does not discuss how to get these proposals through, as I really have no idea how to do this. Therefore, I would also be interested to know how to disseminate the proposals here and which politician(s) might be receptive to these ideas. In other words, how do we make these changes happen?    

Sections are organized, by issues addressed. Thus, section 2 addresses legal corruption and campaign finance reform. Section 3 touches on voter disenfranchisement. Section 4 talks about presidential elections. Section 5 discusses congressional elections. Section 6 expresses some of my thoughts on congressional apportionment. Finally, section 7 has a tl;dr.    

With all that in mind let us begin.    

**2. Legal corruption and campaign finance reform**    

This issue has been brought to the forefront during the presidential primaries and I believe that [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig) does an excellent job of explaining it.    

Luckily, the same organization which made the first video about the problem also made another video about [a solution] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhe286ky-9A).    

Given that these videos make a plug for the organization that put them together, I feel obligated to say that I’ve never been involved with that organization in any way. I simply believe in their ideas. However, I’ll probably get involved later today. :P    

[Here] (http://anticorruptionact.org/full-text/) is the text of the American Anti-Corruption Act.    

**3. Voter disenfranchisement**    

Another issue brought to the forefront this election is voter disenfranchisement. As we have seen, on the Democratic side, many have been reporting issues with their registrations being changed nilly-willy in closed primary states. On the Republican side, we’ve seen that the way that the Colorado delegates were chosen was totally and completely undemocratic. This will be addressed in section 4.1 below.    

Yet another issue is the fact that the number of polling stations were reduced in some states (e.g. AZ and CT) in order to disenfranchise voters.    

However, these are not the only issues. We also know that some people cannot vote simply because they do not have time. Many people work long hours and have other duties that cannot be skipped. In addition, many convicts who have already paid their debt to society are being barred from voting.    

Therefore, I suggest the following:    

Every election day is a holiday in its jurisdiction. For example, county election days will be county holidays, state election day will be state holidays, national election days will be national holidays.    

Additionally, the number of polling locations must be proportional to population and area size and cannot be changed by people. I don’t know the ideal numbers because I can’t seem to find any information on the location of polling stations nationwide, but my instinct tells me that there should be at least two polling locations per zip code, they must be accessible by public transport, they must service fewer than 10,000 people and they should not be further than 20 miles or 60 minutes from the voter’s address. (Note: Again, this is a suggestion based on instinct rather than empiricism, so I’m especially open to criticism on this.)    

Moreover, we must have instant registration of all eligible voters nationwide (to unaffiliated status). Voting rights must be restored to convicts immediately after their prison term is completed. Homeless people can also vote.    

**4. Presidential elections**    

In this section, the reader will see two subsections, the first on primary elections, the second on the general election. Before delving into this section and others, it would be helpful if the reader were knew about the [First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) voting method] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo). This is the method we use for all elections here in the US and as the video explains, it is problematic. An easy fix to this is the [Alternative Vote (AV) method] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE), where people can rank the candidates in the order in which they like them. As the video shows, this voting method is superior to First-Past-the-Post because it eliminates the spoiler effect, which allows third-party and independent candidates to run without splitting the voters. This increases voter satisfaction, which in turn should increase voter turnout. Another nice walkthrough of how this system works can be found [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA3_t-08Vr0).    

**4.1 Primary elections**    

[This video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_95I_1rZiIs) shows how primary elections work today.    

In my mind, the fact that IA and NH go first, coupled with the alliance formed by Super Tuesday, skews perceptions on how the primaries are actually going and benefit whoever has the most popularity in those states. Furthermore, it increases the influence of the states who go first at the expense of other states.    

To prevent these problems, I’ve created a new primary system, which I’m calling “Random Regional Primaries (RRP)”. It goes as follows:    

All primaries will be semi-closed. In other words, to vote in the Republican Party primaries, one must either be affiliated with the party or be an unaffiliated voter. Voters can change affiliation any time before they vote. This means polling locations must have equipment which will allow voters to do this quickly. I believe this addresses the disenfranchisement which Democratic voters were submitted to.    

(Note: At this point, the reader may ask themselves, “why not open primaries?” I believe that that opens the door into a world abound with the possibility of shenanigans where Republicans may vote for a Democratic candidate that they know will lose in order to sabotage the Democrats. Also, if voters are allowed to change registration right up until they vote then it’s kind of an open primary anyway. In addition, if someone wants to play shenanigans, they’ll have to take an extra step which may discourage them from doing so, while if someone truly believes in a candidate from another party, they will certainly want to take that extra step. However, I’m still not sure about this specific part: open, or semi-closed?)    

The country will be organized into thirteen primary voting zones. Twelve of these zones are in the continental US. They contiguous and composed of two to five states. The thirteenth zone consists of the non-continental US, including Alaska, Hawai’i, Puerto Rico, Guam, people abroad, etc.    

States within a zone vote on the same day. Order of zones will be random each year (methods and actual choosing of the order of zones will be published and televised). Zones will vote two weeks apart on Tuesdays, starting on the second Tuesday in January. (Note: Should they be one week apart and start later in the year to decrease voter fatigue?) A map of the zones can be found [here] (http://imgur.com/9IWoSh7).    

Primaries will be decided in all states through a ballot vote. (I believe this addresses the disenfranchisement which Republican voters in CO were submitted to.) Caucuses will not determine winners. However, caucuses will be held the Saturday before an election, not as a way to determine the results of the contest but rather as an informal meeting in which people within voting districts can discuss and debate about candidates they support.    

When people vote, they no longer vote for delegates, but rather the candidates themselves. To win nomination, candidate must have 50% of vote nationwide. Primary elections will use the Alternative Voting method referenced above. (Note RRP would still work under the delegate system we have now)    

All primaries are optional.    

**4.2 General election**    

As the reader may know, when people vote for presidential candidates in the general election, they do not vote for the candidates themselves, but rather electors, who in turn choose the president. This system is known as the Electoral College. For those unfamiliar with this system, the [first video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUS9mM8Xbbw) presents an introduction. The [second video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wC42HgLA4k) illustrates the problem with the system. Finally, the [third video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHEDXzOfENI) shows what happens in the event that no candidate wins a majority of electoral college votes. It’s a clusterfvck. As we have seen from the videos, the electoral college is a terrible system and it should be abolished.    

To fix these problems, I suggest the following for the general presidential election:    

Abolish the Electoral College. When people vote, they no longer vote for delegates, but rather the candidates themselves. (Note: Should citizens in territories be allowed to vote? Certainly if the territory in which they live pays taxes) To win elections, candidate must have 50% of vote. Elections will use the Alternative Voting method, where people can rank the candidates in the order in which they like them.    

Voting is to be compulsory and failure to vote is punishable by a fines which ranges from $20.00 to $5,000.00, depending on your income. This is meant to increase voter turnout. Furthermore, in my mind, voting is not a right but a duty. Special accommodations must be made for the poor and disabled so that they can vote without incurring fines. Although I don’t know how.    

**5. Congressional elections**    

This section has two subsections, one on each chamber of Congress.    

**5.1 Senatorial elections**    

I suggest that:    

Senators be elected through AV.    

Voting be compulsory and failure to vote is punishable by a fines which ranges from $20.00 to $5,000.00, depending on your income. Special accommodations must be made for the poor and disabled so that they can vote without incurring fines.    

**5.2 Electing Representatives**    

As we know our elections for Representatives are done through FPTP, a system which leads to voter dissatisfaction and frustration. Additionally, this system can lead to unrepresentativeness, as shown in [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9rGX91rq5I), which should be seen as a case study of how awful FPTP is. Additionally, we must deal with [gerrymandering] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mky11UJb9AY).    

(Note: To bring this closer to home, the reader will be interested to look at these maps of congressional districts per state. First, [Kentucky] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Kentucky_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif/lossless-page1-2685px-Kentucky_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif.png). Second, [Connecticut] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Connecticut_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif/lossless-page1-1182px-Connecticut_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif.png). Third, [Ohio] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Ohio_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif/lossless-page1-1300px-Ohio_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif.png). Fourth, [New York] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Map_of_New_York's_congressional_districts_from_2013_to_2022.png). Look for the 7th, 8th, and 10th districts in the NYC area. Fifth [Pennsylvania] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Pennsylvania_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif/lossless-page1-1808px-Pennsylvania_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif.png). Sixth, [North Carolina] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/North_Carolina_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif/lossless-page1-2712px-North_Carolina_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif.png). [This page] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_congressional_districts) lists all districts in the US.)    

It seems agreeable to me that gerrymandering is an intolerable act of corruption and we must have system which prevents it. To prevent it *and* increase satisfaction with elections, I present two options:    

(1) Establish [Mixed-Member Proportional Rep (MMP)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT0I-sdoSXU) in which parties are awarded seats according to the proportion of people that voted for a given party. As the video mentions there are problems with this method, but it is favorable to FPTP. OR    

(2) Establish [Single Transferable Vote (STV)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8XOZJkozfI) in which multiple districts are combined without reducing the number of representatives. For instance, if two districts are combined, then the new district has two representatives, and so on. As the video explains, this allows for a more proportional system (however, less proportional than MMP), higher voter satisfaction and cuts down on gerrymandering.    

I believe that STV is preferable to MMP and other proportional systems because it disallows party favoritism from becoming a factor in choosing candidates. More on this [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DNtsjB7L_I).    

Thus, I suggest the following changes to the way we vote for Representatives:    

Switch to STV using the shortest split-line method. Congressional districts are to be confined to and within a state. In other words, no district will cross any state lines nor can any two states form one district.    

Voting be compulsory and failure to vote is punishable by a fines which ranges from $20.00 to $5,000.00, depending on your income. Special accommodations must be made for the poor and disabled so that they can vote without incurring fines.

[John Cleese explains STV] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qWDPauV_p4). It’s very funny!    

**6. Congressional apportionment**    

I feel that [the process by which seats in the United States House of Representatives are distributed among the 50 states] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment) needs reform,  because under the current system, when a state grows in population, it not only gets more seats but it also takes some away from another state. This seems unfair.    

However, I’m unsure what to suggest for this. Perhaps, there should be one Representative per 600,000 persons (not voters, persons). In a population of [320,000,000] (http://www.census.gov/popclock/) this would yield 533 representatives. I don’t think this suggestion is problematic. What is problematic is how to change this when the population changes. In a population of one billion people, one Representative per 600,000 persons would yield 1667 Representatives. This number is too high as Congress will be bogged down and ineffectual. In other words, we must figure out a proportion which adjusts the number of Representatives automatically and reasonably, given a change in population.    

If a law is passed that which simply says that given our population of 320,000,000 we should have one Representative per 600,000 persons then that law may have to be adjusted every time we take a census. This would leave it up to the politicians and they may adapt it for their gain and not ours. This was the whole point of the [The Congressional Apportionment Amendment (CAA)] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment), which was a proposed amendment and whose enactment fell short by one state in between 1791 and 1803. After that, it fell further and further behind as more and more states entered the Union.    

My concern with the CAA is that it was meant for a country whose population relatively small. If there is to be one Representative per 30,000 people and the limit for this proportion is 100 Representatives, then the population is 3,000,000. After getting to 100 Reps then the proportion goes up to one Rep per 40,000, with the limit at 200 Reps, then the population at the limit for that proportion would be 8,000,000. I believe that’s how it works, but I’m not sure. Could any of the smarter people in the room see if this is right?    
 
Moreover, the CAA was written for a pre-industrial society. Nowadays, we have cars, phones and the internet. In our times, the concern that Reps. may not know the local circumstance of their constituencies if they represent a large amount of people may not be as dire, given that we can talk to anyone in the world simply by logging on.    

So I’m not sure what to suggest here, which is mainly because of my lack of understanding of the CAA.    

(Note: Should territories be given representation in the House? Certainly if the territory in which they live pays taxes.)    

**7. tl;dr**    

So there you have it, reader. My suggestions for electoral reform are: (1) Enact the American Anti-Corruption Act, (2) Automatic registration of all eligible voters, (3) Change the primary system to Random Regional Primaries and Alternative Vote (section 4.1), (4) Abolish the Electoral College, and switch to AV for the general, (5) Switch to AV for Senate elections, (6) Switch to STV for House elections, and (7) Make all federal elections compulsory (not including primaries). Finally, I wanted to make a suggestion regarding Congressional Apportionment, but due to my unfamiliarity with the Congressional Apportionment Amendment, I cannot make an informed suggestion.    

So, what do you think? Do we want these changes? How do we make them happen?",finance,1462628787
personalfinance,Should I use cash from a cash out refinancing of my home to pay off wife's car payment?,"Last week I started the process of refinancing my mortgage and taking some of the equity out of my home. I bought the house in 2010 for $355k, currently owe around $300k, and the appraisal came in at $555k.

My current plan is to refinance and take out ~$50k in equity. With the increased principal, better interest rate and removal of the mortgage insurance I am currently paying, we will be saving $400/month. With the cash out equity, I want to do some home repairs and pay off my wife's and my debt.

All of the debt I plan to pay off has higher interest rates than my new mortgage does except for my wife's car payment. The mortgage rate I will be paying is 4.25%, my wife's car loan is at 2.9%. By paying off all of our debt and refinancing, we will be saving ~$1800/month assuming I pay off her $485/month car payment along with everything else.

My thoughts for taking $14k from the refi to pay off my wife's car are:

1. She doesn't consistently work (she's a student and temps for a friend as needed) so she sometimes has a hard time making her car payment without help from me. We never miss a payment, but I sometimes have to transfer cash to her to cover the payment.
2. I need to buy a new car soon because my current one died and would prefer to not have 2 car payments
3. The monthly payment to the mortgage company is going to be less than to the owner of the car loan since the mortgage is for 30 years instead of 5

My concerns with paying off the wife's car are:

1. I'm taking the profits from a great investment and putting them into something that is guaranteed to devalue

2. The interest rate is higher on the new mortgage over a longer period of time, so I could be paying more for the car over a longer period of time

A couple of other items to mention is there are 2.5 years left on the car loan and we plan on moving in the next 2-5 years.

What are your thoughts? Should I pay off the car loan? Any ideas or something I am missing? Thanks in advance.",finance,1462632570

Quick background: 236,000 with 5.125% rate on current mortgage with 24 years left.  The house has gone up to 440k in value from the purchase price of 265k.  I know there is a negative to refinancing to a lower rate because it starts the clock over but why shouldn't I try to refinance for a lower rate AND take money out of my equity to pay for a solar installation.  The install would be around 27k not counting the 8k federal rebate which would go right to the mortgage.

Why bother with the solar loan with a 6% rate and a 20year payoff?

politics,Debunking common myths/disinformation in this election cycle.,"I picked these because they're easily falsifiable and extremely tenaciously spread around.

##1. Bernie's a socialist. 

When the media have called him this he corrects them saying ""democratic socialist"". When Bernie explains what he means by ""democratic socialism"" he describes ""social democratic"" countries with strong welfare/social safety net programs and strong regulations. ""Democratic socialism"" and ""social democracy"" are similar but different. 

Here's Bernie explaining what he means by democratic socialism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFAq-4Vv5c0 – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7jlAZSGXf4 

Here's more [throughout his political career, and the media pinning the title on him](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/14-things-bernie-sanders-has-said-about-socialism-120265).

Bernie points to countries like Denmark, which are top rated by the right-wing Heritage Foundation for economic freedom: http://www.heritage.org/index/country/denmark – http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/19/opinion/something-not-rotten-in-denmark.html

Social Democracy is a centrist political ideology that is a mix between pure capitalism and socialism. It tries to take the best of both. Pretty much every developed country (including the USA) is a social democracy. Going by the universal political spectrum and/or other 1st world countries, Bernie is a centrist.

The universal political spectrum looks something like this: 

anarchy | communism | socialism | social democracy/mixed economy | capitalism | propertarianism | anarchy
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----

^^You ^^might ^^switch ^^out ^^propertarianism's ^^spot ^^for ^^fascism.

Was the US a socialist nation in the mid 1900's when we had [top tax rates of 70-90%](https://www.savantcapital.com/blog/tax-rates-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow) along with [public higher ed](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/feb/09/bernie-s/was-college-once-free-united-states-and-it-oversea) and [stronger welfare programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act)?

##2. Bernie's an extremist, dreamer, or ""falsely optimistic idiot"". 

Sanders has been running on a platform of public education, universal healthcare coverage, getting money out of politics, and addressing global warming. None of these are extremist positions, and [polls show that the majority of Americans agree with him](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/4/27/noam_chomsky_bernie_sanders_is_not). Virtually everything Bernie is advocating for has been the norm in other developed countries for decades. 

And I've never once even heard him mention welfare. So the ""free shit"" and ""handouts"" arguments are baseless.

The US has drifted so far to the right that centrist policies and even right-wing policies touted by famous right-wing economists (see #10.4) are called socialist and communist. 

##3. The nordics can afford these things because they have much fewer people. 

This is one of the dumbest ones I've seen. I feel like this usually comes from people purposely trying to spread disinformation.

1. They never give a reason why they think the programs couldn't scale to larger populations.
2. When you buy in bulk the per-unit cost gets cheaper. So not only does it scale, but it's actually better to have a larger population. 
3. It gives you more leverage when negotiating things like drug prices. Access to a market as big as the US is extremely important. 
4. Germany has 80 million people in comparison to Norway's 5 million, and Germany's doing just fine with very similar programs.

##4. We can't afford these things. Other countries can because they're much richer. 

The US is smack dab in the middle of all the other countries that provide the programs we don't: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita 

Our healthcare system is extremely inefficient. [Single payer would be much cheaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2t7vbe). We already [pay as much of our GDP \(as a percentage\) towards government healthcare \(medicare, medicaid\) as do other countries with top ranking systems that cover the entire population](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1oz3wc/privatization_benefits_the_1_while_public/ccx3ds5).  

##5. The nordics can have these programs because their populations are homogenous. 

I'm not even sure what these people are trying to argue... That minorities are somehow inferior? That white people don't want to see welfare benefits going to minorities? That we have too many immigrants that would ""suck the welfare tit dry""?

Either way [Canada has proportionally more immigrants than us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_immigrant_population) yet they have universal healthcare and real welfare: http://i.imgur.com/cgJDhFb.png – http://www.emploiquebec.gouv.qc.ca/fileadmin/fichiers/pdf/Publications/SR_dep_montant_prestations_en.pdf – http://www.caledoninst.org/Publications/PDF/1031ENG.pdf

Regarding immigrants being a burden, [there are studies supporting both sides of the argument](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2teh6q).

##6. Greece is a good example of why these policies won't work.

[Greece is marred by a culture of corruption, tax evasion, and nepotism](http://www.thenation.com/article/whats-wrong-and-right-about-greece). 

Economist Joseph Stiglitz: [The forced Austerity predictably made Greece's debt crisis worse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knbpTydM4Fk&amp;t=150). 

More appropriate countries to use for comparison are Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and the Nordics. [These countries with the strongest welfare programs &amp; regulations are the ones that were the least affected by the economic crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr3LPFh8CsM). 


##7. Our taxes are high.

[The US is one of the lowest taxed OECD countries](http://www.vox.com/cards/federal-taxes-explained/american-taxes-are-high-or-low-international-context).

Our taxes have been [plummeting ever since Reagan came in](https://www.savantcapital.com/blog/tax-rates-yesterday-today-and-tomorrow/) with his ""Reaganomics"", also known as ""cutting taxes on the job creators"", ""trickle down economics"", etc..

##8. We have welfare in this country.

We do not have general welfare for able, working-age adults. 

We have temporary welfare for new mothers (TANF), and we have a number of specific programs that target some specific people. We have EITC, which is a tax refund (which means you have to have worked &amp; paid taxes). Some people can get unemployment insurance but it's [very limited in multiple ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits#United_States).  

We have food stamps/SNAP, which (beyond a 3 month limit) you have to be working to receive. And we have things like electricity discounts for people who qualify for SNAP. 

We have subsidized housing where you pay 30-40% of your income towards rent. You can get this through section 8 vouchers which are typically only available to apply for once a year or once every few years, and there's a window of about 1 week where you're able to apply, and after you apply the wait might be another year or longer. You can also get subsidized housing through public housing. The waits for these are typically between 1 and 5 years. They're often pretty terrible places to live.

##9. People who want higher taxes to pay for welfare/social safety nets are leaches. 

This is a myopic view that fails to see/address things on a systemic level. It's a view that only sees ""me vs you"" and fails to take into account the affects that political/economic policy has on a society/system [[1](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006)], [[2](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/its-official-benefits-and-high-taxes-make-us-all-richer-while-inequality-takes-a-hammer-to-a-9914941.html)], [[3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2t7pi8)], [[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyEP2H3QsII&amp;t=12m2s)]. Things like [crime, the affects of the overall education level of citizens, health, etc](http://www.plymouth.gov.uk/plymouth_fairness_inequality.pdf).. 

1. [There are lots of low paying jobs](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/23/low-paying-jobs_n_5868350.html) that must be filled by someone. Union busting lowered the pay of these jobs even more: http://i.imgur.com/6wJ7GS0.jpg – http://www.epi.org/files/charts/img/4127.png

This is not surprising given the [GOP's disregard of facts](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2vmw5o).

On most of the big issues [they are polar opposites](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2kaubu/just_a_reminder_of_what_the_senate_was_doing_the/cljns3q).

""The other guy is just as bad"" rhetoric benefits the party most at fault.


##So why can't we have these programs in the USA?

People keep voting against it. It's that simple. People see politicians promising ""lower taxes"" and see a direct benefit for themselves, but no democrat or republican politician ever seems to talk about [the consequences](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaxKArchive/comments/4hxj82/politics/d2t7pi8). One reason is that ""pro-tax"" is complex and difficult to fit into an appealing soundbite.

What it comes down to is that our education system is a total joke where there is no standardization or federal requirements for things like [science](http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/09/alabama_will_require_students.html), [civics](http://ktar.com/story/92126/arizona-lawmakers-push-for-mandatory-civics-test-in-high-schools), etc., which means people aren't taught the difference between socialism, communism, capitalism, mixed economies, etc., or even how our government works and what it currently does and does not do. And thus people are extremely susceptible to disinformation &amp; hearsay. This is a HUGE problem in a democratic society since democracy only works if the public is well educated &amp; informed. 

Probably in due large part to those problems we also have extremely low voter turnout which plays a big role in the fact that [the people who donate the most to politicians get all the influence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig).

personalfinance,Can I afford this mortgage or am I setting myself up for failure?,"Hi, 

I am potentially a first time home buyer, and I'm concerned as to whether I can afford the mortgage/home I'm interested in. 

Here's some background info regarding my finances...

I am a 24 year old currently working full time and also attending school. I make approx. 38k a year, after taxes and health care I bring home about 2050 a month. 

I have approximately 40k in student loan debt, which is not in repayment as I am in school. 

I also have about 6k in credit card debt. 

I'm going to school for computer information systems, with an anticipated graduation in 2 years. This would potentially (pending the job outlook in that market is still growing) raise my income to the low 60s. 

I have been prequalified for a mortgage of up to 90K. 

The first prequalified mortgage I was offered was for 85,500 with a lower interest rate but higher closing fees. 

The 90k mortgage is a higher rate, higher amount, and no closing fees. 

The condo I am looking at is listed at 100k. It has been on the market for 45+ days and has had its price reduced 7k already.  It seems like I would be buying from a developer, no previous homeowner. A previous comp sold for 105k, but I would like to put in an offer of 85-90k. This would mean I could put a higher percentage down on the down payment and apply for a lesser mortgage. 

I could be looking at somewhere between 700 and 800 a month with HOA fees, property tax, and mortgage payments. 

I currently pay 634 in rent, and live pretty comfortably. 

Also, a relative passed away last year and I have inherited some money that has not yet been distributed (approx. 60k) which I planning to use to pay off student loans. 

I know very little about money management to be honest, and even less about real estate. 

1) should I even be considering buying this condo? Or is this totally out of my means?
2) if so, which mortgage would be wiser? 
3) is an initial realty offer of 10% less than asking price offensive?

Thanks for any input you can give me!!",finance,1462643964

personalfinance,How to get through my last year of college without crippling debt?,"My other post got deleted somehow so trying this again...

I'm hoping you all can help me. Please bear with me, because this will be a bit long. At 18 I decided to move across the country and go to a school I couldn't afford. I won't get to into the details too much, but I was escaping an abusive environment, and it was the right decision for me at the time. I'm now struggling with the financial implications...

I currently have about 30k in personal student debt, (part of which is wracking up interest), and my father has taken out federal direct loans of about $40k. I'm going into my senior year at this point, and I will owe about $50k more out of pocket (pending a scholarship and some emotional breakdowns in the FinAid office that could make that number more like $35k). $13k of this amount is due over the next 3 months, and I'm scrambling trying to figure out how to pay it. I'm working currently at $400/week and have a job that guarantees me free room and board. These are two separate jobs just to clarify, and the $400/week one will tentatively end in October. I currently only have about $1500 saved up since my last tuition payment.

Here's the catch, my dad is the abuser from the situation I mentioned above, and he has basically said ""NO MORE LOANS."" I dislike having to depend on him for these things, but I am just trying to graduate and make a better life for myself at this point. I have just learned about the Total and Permanent Disability discharge (he is physically disabled), which I think can get any Parent Plus Loans discharged. Would this be my only realistic shot at being able to finish school if I can get my dad to agree to signing off on the remainder of the costs (~50k)? I'm not sure how likely it is that they will discharge ~$90k of his total loans, but I'm hoping it could still be a considerable amount that will make the payments manageable.

I'm not sure what my other options would be besides trying to take out private loans, which I doubt I could get approved for that much anyway. Any insight or assistance anyone can provide is appreciated. I'm so close to getting my degree, and I just need to make it through the next 12 months at this insanely expensive school. Please be gentle, I know I made a bad financial decision, but ultimately I'll have a degree in STEM and hopefully many job opportunities.",finance,1462656778

personalfinance,Graduating college and finally taking a second to realize my poor financial decision making. Need help planning.,"Hopefully this isn't too long but I want to give you guys a good understanding of my situation. I'm 21 and after 4 long years of college I'm finally graduating next week with a degree in computer science. yay! But after browsing this subreddit, I started planning out my finances and now I'm a little worried. My parents make decent money but not enough to support me so aside from a few small scholarships, I was forced to pay for school with federal loans(including some parent plus loans). At the beginning of college I wasn't worried about getting a little student loan debt, I had the attitude of ""ahhh whatever, I'll deal with it when I have to"". Luckily, I was really focused in my studies and managed to get a part-time job in my field. Midway through my schooling I moved into an apartment and bought a car which only gave me more bills but it wasn't a big deal at the time because I had an income. 

Fast forward a few months later, I'm beginning my 3rd year of college and I've quit my job (because the stress of being a full time student and working 30+ hours a week as a software developer was starting to get to me) but my savings didn't last long at all. I got to the point where I wasn't buying textbooks because I was using loans to pay my monthly bills. When that wasn't enough I made the mistake of opening up credit cards still with the attitude of ""ahhh whatever, I'll deal with it when I have to"". Now I have FOUR. And have basically maxed out all of them to get by. This is what my credit card debt looks like now:

Balance     APR

* $2,295 26.24%

* $1,996 25.15%

* $995 18.40% (With the same bank I have a checking and savings with)

* $700 36.00% (Desperate times call for desperate measures)

Total Credit Card debt: $5,986

After 2 years I haven't missed a payment but I only ever pay the minimum. I don't really understand how I still get mail about being pre-approved for more credit cards. I almost wish I was denied for the credit cards I have now. I also made the mistake of not closing an old checking account I opened at the end of high school. It went delinquent with a balance of -$130 and got sent to collections a few months ago (Which I still haven't payed because I'm too poor to spare $130). Now I have a derogatory mark on my credit report and my score is &lt; 600.

Compared to some people my student loan debt is reasonable but I think it is pretty significant this is the breakdown of the individual loans.

* 1.) $3,500.00 3.400%
* 2.) $4,957.00 6.800%
* 3.) $2,478.44 6.800%
* 4.) $1,000.00 3.400% 
* 5.) $5,070.00 3.860%
* 6.) $3,763.85 3.860%
* 7.) $4,389.25 3.860%
* 8.) $8,032.97 4.660% 
* 9.) $4,831.94 4.290%
* 10.) $2,766.00 4.290% 

Total Student Loan debt: $40,789.45

Looking back at the debt I've acquired and bad decisions I've made really upsets me but I'm focused on being more responsible and planning better.

Looking forward, I have a few job offers lined up with an average base salary of about $65,000 and similar 401k plans. I expect to take home about $3600 a month. Here are my current monthly expenses

* Rent (cost after split with roommates): 340
* Utilities (cost after split with roommates): 60
* Internet (cost after split with roommates): 25
* Renters Insurance (cost after split with roommates): 7
* Car Insurance: 125
* Netflix: 10
* Music streaming service: 8
* Gas: 100
* Food:	 200
* Toiletries: 25
* Fun stuffs: 100

Total monthly expenses: $1000

My car is old and has a few issues and I'm worried that it could die on me any day. My goals are to build/re-build my credit, get a new car, pay off my student loans as fast as possible, and start investing early. From reading around on pf I understand that I need to prioritize paying off my credit card debt.

I am aiming to reach FIRE in 8 years and as its not much time in the scheme of things, I want to create a roadmap to follow to ensure I stay on track. I am wondering if anyone has done a ""FIRE Plan"" document (like a business plan / projection) that they wouldn't mind sharing a template for? Or maybe there's a software that you're all secretly using? I have a budget sheet that I've been using for years to track my spend and savings, but I want something that I can use to say ""ok by 2020 I should have xyz if I do this and that in 2019, 2018, etc"". So basically a step by step roadmap. 

I'm sure everyone here with a finance degree is laughing. I have no formal education in finance and am really relying on self-education online and common sense. I do read about finance but am still very, very new to all of this.

I have (can't believe I'm saying this) a ""Diversified Portfolio"" now after investing in Vanguard and buying a rental property so its more complicated than before where I was just tracking my income vs. spend. I have seen business plans before that take into account projected expenses and assets, so I figure this would be great to have for personal finance as a guide to FIRE. I just can't see FIRE happening unless I see every step between here (employed working my ass off) and there (with ""fuck you"" money).

Also, I want to take a moment to sincerely thank everyone on this sub for the life changing conversations I've both participated and lurked in on.

I would also like to thank my bosses 14 year old son for making fun of me for not knowing what Reddit is, thus causing me to join, then find this sub, then changing my life.

personalfinance,Tackling student loan debt,"Growing up, I was never taught the importance of saving and financial freedom in the future. All I knew was that I would go to school, study, graduate, get a job, get married and have kids, grow old and die. There was no talk of retirement and saving money in that timetable. 

In college, I took out a loan from Sallie Mae for $45k. At this time, I also had a CITI cc and BOA cc which I paid minimums on monthly. Graduated from college with my degree but found out it wasn't for me so I applied for another program and got in. Loan payments were deferred at this point until graduation and I was lucky enough to get a scholarship to cover my schooling for that entire year. Unfortunately after graduation, lots of family health issues occurred, had to take care of those issues, so couldn't work and therefore couldn't pay for loan when payments started. Parents tried helping to pay minimum amount per month but with their own financial troubles, they weren't able to continue. At this point, I had maxed out both my credit cards trying to survive and eventually those had to be closed due to being so late in payment. Lots of laziness and mistakes occurred during this time period that are regrettable and could've been avoided in hindsight. 

Fast forward to almost a year later, finally found a job (take home $30k) and slowly started paying my debts. I tackled both credit cards first and paid those off in a little over a year ($12k total) while I paid minimum amount on my student loan each month. After that, I took a look at my student loan (now through Navient) and realized I was paying $180 monthly and accruing something like $250 plus in interest - I wasn't even touching the principal! I called Navient to see if I could come up with a plan that wouldn't stretch me too thin, and they offered me practically 0 interest rate with a $200 minimum per month for 2 years unless I wanted to settle for $25k. Obviously I didn't have that money lying around, so I took the former offer and have been paying the monthly (with a little extra here and there). I currently owe $32k and the 2 years is up this summer.

My dilemma stems from this: I recently looked at credit karma and didn't realize that the student loan was ""closed derogatory - charged off, paying partial payment agreement"". I don't know financial lingo and am obviously a novice at all things monetarily related but I had assumed it was still an open account because I was still paying monthly. I hadn't looked at my credit score or credit report the last 2-3 years for fear it was horrific and neither had I thought to ask the Navient rep when I spoke with them. So my question is, since it's already a closed acct - should I settle for paying it off, pay it in full but would take some time, or keep paying the current monthly and supplementing with more?

During the last 2 years, I've been saving and creating an emergency fund and slowly trying to build credit: opened up a secured cc with cap1 and got another store cc which I both pay in full every month. I contribute to my 401k 8% (job matches up to 6%) and have been thinking about opening up a Roth IRA which I should've started before but I had no knowledge of until recently. I have about $20k in savings as I've been frantically trying to save as much as I can after all the debt trouble I went through. I can use the 20k for a settlement (depending on how much the settlement would be) but that leaves me with nothing in my emergency fund and I just can't start from scratch all over again with nothing to fall back on. I'm also trying to save for a house (which I won't buy for another 2 years so that gives me time to save for down payment). 

I can save about $1000-1300 a month which I can use to either pay the loan, contribute to an IRA, or save for a down payment for a house. I know best bet is to pay off the loan, I don't want the student loan hovering over me when I'm actually looking at buying a house. So, what to do? Settle the loan for less than the amount (if 60% = ~$19k, credit score would decrease but it's already low and I know I'll be taxed the difference as it's considered income) and rebuild my savings right after or pay off the entire $32k completely which would take some time (but doable in the next 2 years if I used savings). Unless someone has a better strategy, I'd appreciate the input!

I am an U.S. Citizen, currently residing in NYC. I day-trade stocks for a living. I am planning on doing it while living in other countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, etc. For the purpose of not exceeding the stay without a visa in these countries, I will return to NY and flying back out. However, when I do return to NY, I don't plan on staying longer than 7 days before flying out to those countries again. You can almost say that I will live for no more than 25 days in a year in US/NY. Just a few questions:

1. Am I subjected to both Federal, NY and NYC taxes?
2. Will I need to pay taxes in those countries I stay in?

personalfinance,"I can refinance an investment property at a 1.125% lower rate (15 yr fixed) and get $80,000 cash back. My total interest paid over 15 years will end up being higher. Does getting $80k to invest outweigh additional interest I'd pay on the refinanced mortgage?","I was lured into a refinance and make the impulse decision to start the process, but now I'm wondering if this was the wrong move. Historically I've been smart and done my research with these decisions but I'm not sure now.

Here are the details of my current mortgage on this investment (rental) property:

* $933 / month at 4.875% fixed
* 9.25 years until it is paid off
* ~20k in interest will be paid

The details of the refinance:

* $1220 / month at 3.75% fixed
* 15 years 
* ~51,912k in interest will be paid
* $80,000 cash back

I make enough that the additional ~$300 per month is not problem.

The idea of getting $80k cash-in-hand is really nice, except I'm not sure what to do with it. I already have enough in savings to cover any big expenses I might have.

I have 2 auto loans (2 and 3%), 1 student loan (18k ~4.75%), and another mortgage (3.5%), but since they are relatively low interest rates I don't think it makes sense to pay them off early with the $80k vs investing the $80k elsewhere.

I'm trying to think if there is a somewhat ""safe"" (I know this is impossible to claim) investment plan for that $80k that will more than offset the additional interest I will pay after I refinance and earn me more than what I'd save if I paid my other loans off. There's the additional benefit of having that additional money available if I ever did need it.

What are your thoughts? Is this refinance a bad idea or is there a low-risk investment that makes this worthwhile?",finance,1462732043
personalfinance,"$4,300.00 in credit card debt 0% APR running out soon, $1,300.00 payment due in one week. 750 Credit Score. Options?","Hi All,

I currently have $4,300.00 in CC debt. $3k is on a 0% APR (until September 1st then its 24.24%) Chase Freedom Card, $1.3k is on a Southwest CC through Chase (16.24% APR). 

I have $500.00 in cash. I have a check coming on the 15th that will be about $1,100.00. I have a car payment and car insurance payments on the 18th that total $490.00. I have a bonus check coming this month that should be around 3,500.00 but 75% is going into my 401k so after taxes it will only be a couple hundred dollars that I actually see. 

My 1.3k payment is due on the 14th. 

I looked into transferring the debt into my 0% APR card but it wouldn't let me as it was chase to chase. 

It appears I would only pay less than 20$ of interest for the month but going forward what is my best move. 

To give you some background My checks are actually about 1,500$ every other week but I put 500$ into my 401k (50% match up the fed max) to take advantage of 250$ in match (I'm on track the reach the fed max of 18k this year). I was keeping up with payments even after this but over the last month I've made some pricey decisions and decided to go to Europe (about 3,000.00$ in cost) over the summer. I graduated last year and started work right away and have never left North America - but I'm starting to feel guilty about the trip now. 

I was thinking of opening another 0% APR card and transferring balances over to it? 

How will this all affect my credit? What options do I have? I believe it is more wise to keep a debt on my credit card then to stop paying into my 401k as I get such a great match, but thoughts? Once I pay off the 3k card I won't be using it again as it has worse rewards and higher APR than my Southwest Card.

Is a 55-45 stock/bond split too aggressive for *retiring* at 55? I understand asset allocation should correlate with my need, ability, and willingness for risk.

I was too naive and hopped on the hype train, really believing that it would be revolutionary and offer me hundreds of hours of fun.

Instead, I see a glitchy game with a generic storyline, terribad voice acting and bland, forgettable characters. The entire game is literally a grindfest with little variety in enemies to the point where even Destiny does not equal The Division's grindery. And don't get me started on the end-game - level 30 is all about going into that Dark Zone, getting fucked up by hackers and griefers (which are 75% of those that you will meet) and grinding your soul away, bit by bit so you can get orange loot. The stats are fucked up beyond repair to the point where a 160 gear stat person can SHRED someone with 220+ GS. 

And exploits. The game is riddled with exploits. To combat this, Ubishit nerfed loot drops, Phoenix coins and crafting to the point where the latter is utterly useless. Oh, and you know that entire Rogue system? It's terrible. The game contradicts itself by suggesting in all trailers and teasers to go Rogue, only to punish you with insane XP and DZ currency losses and offering you little reward if you somehow manage to run from the entire server.

This game is not what Ubishit showed us at E3. It is a far cry from what we were promised, and they managed to fuck it up once more, just like they did with Watch Dogs - for example, instead of an interesting story about the dangers of the digital world, they cut the story down to the generic main-character-wants-revenge garbage.

personalfinance,Got a lot of financial problems that I need help with!,"VERY LONG POST..SORRY ABOUT THAT

Hello, I've been following this page for a little bit and with what's going on in my life, I figured you guys can help me out. I have a lot of questions about various things so I will try to keep this brief. 
So a little bit about me. I am 28 years old, live in NJ, married and I have 2 kids. A 3 year old and a 4 month old. I work 2 jobs and my wife currently does not work. Both jobs are security jobs. One for a police department in a university and the other is for a hospital. After taxes, my monthly income is roughly 3200 dollars. Total bills per month is exactly 2000 NOT including spending for groceries, gas, whatever my kids may need, and what not. 
On to the financial mess. I owe about 13,000 dollars in student debt, which isn't bad at all considering the massive amounts graduating students have to pay these days. I graduated in December 2012 and deferred my payments three times because I had one crappy job at the time. Once I was required to pay, I have never missed a payment but I'm only paying the minimum of 150 per month. Obviously at this rate, it will take forever. 
More serious issue: I got married in 2010 and charged  most of the wedding expenses on credit cards. Bad idea, I know lol. I made the payments on time for about a year but when I got accepted in to Rutgers University as a student, it was difficult to pay everything. So I hired a debt consolidation company that would charge me one fee and than disperse the amount into smaller payments to all of my creditors. Total debt was a little over 33,000 on credit cards. Horrible for a junior in college. However, I did not know the company I hired was about to go bankrupt. I did a little bit of research before signing with them and everything seemed legit. It had positive and negative reviews but I had to do something. I paid them roughly 800 dollars a month for about a year. Turns out, in that year they basically pocketed the money and did not contact any of my creditors. Every time I let the company know that a creditor or collection agency called me, I always got the same response that I should fill out the form they gave me and fax it over to the consolidation company. Than one day, I noticed the company did not charge me for the previous month so I attempted to contact them. Kept getting a disconnected line. They literally disappeared. Could not find anything online about them, lost all that money, and now everything was in collection and my credit was destroyed. I than hired an attorney to settle my debts. His total costs was about 8000 dollars that I would be paying in installments. He had been in business since the 80's and was on multiple radio shows, a couple of talk shows, and had an A BBB rating. A couple of weeks after I hired him, I contacted a few creditors and they said that I had legal representation moving forward. So I was reassured that I got the right guy. I was with him for about a year and a half and he settled a little over 28,000 worth of debt. Some were completely settled down to 0 (2 chase credit cards totaling 11,000 dollars). Here’s what sucks.  Apparently, one of the legal associates in the office did something they weren’t supposed to and since my attorney is in charge, he got in trouble for it and was not allowed to practice law for 6 months. http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/local/boynton-lawyer-disbarred-and-boca-attorney-suspend/nmqgH/. So I was affected by that because he could not continue to represent me in the remaining 3 or 4 remaining cases. That sucked. 
Next Issue: My credit is now destroyed and about a 450 score. I have been trying to rebuild for about 3 years and it is now at a 616. Slowly getting there. I’m getting approved for more cards and more offers are coming in the mail. I got a car in August of 2014. Unfortunately, because of bad credit. I got hit with very high interest. 19% interest on a 19,000 car for 72 month financing. At the time, my credit score was about 550. I had to get a reliable car because I had a baby in the car now. I’ve been paying the minimum 440 a month since I got it. Paid over 8800 for it and the remaining balance is at 16,000. Which means after 20 months of payments, I’ve only lowered the balance by about 3,000 dollars. Would I be able to refinance a better rate since my score is higher now than it was at the time?
Finally: Finances are already a problem. To add to that, my wife’s 2 younger sisters and mother are going to come live with us. We are already working on the papers for them to come to this country. Im hoping it will take a couple of years for them to get their visas to come here lol. I don’t have a problem with this at all. I love my in laws and would love to help them. My wife’s father was killed in 2007 and the mother has been having health problems ever since. I would like her to come to this country and get the medical attention she needs and for her two sisters to be able to get a good education here and become something more than just house wives. Before they get here, the goal is to pay off the car, the student loans, and at the very least, move into an affordable townhouse with enough room for all of us. I work for a university police department.  They have their own federal credit union. I have never been there, don’t have any accounts or anything with them so far. I have a bank account and a savings account in PNC bank. Every week, I deposit 75 dollars in it as a saving for my daughters’ college tuitions when they go to college. There’s a little over 4500 dollars in it. At this rate, I figure when my first daughter starts college, there will be a little over 55,000 dollars in that account. I’m very dedicated to this account. Never withdrawn from it or missed any deposits. 
So that is everything currently going on and expected to happen in the future. I have several questions regarding these problems. Since I only owe 13,000 in student loans, am I better off just making very large payments and clear it off ASAP? Will my credit score go up if I if I clear it all off sooner? Next, what can I do about the remaining 3 or 4 cards in collections? American Express reports charge off every month. Will settling those and clearing them improve my credit score? Can I refinance my car for a lower interest rate and make payments for the remaining months from the original 6 year finance plan? What do I do when my in laws come? A friend told me to get them Medicaid, apply for food stamps, and claim them on tax papers to get extra money. How do I begin preparing to get a townhouse, at the very least, at this moment? I was told to look into low income housing. Is how I am saving for my kids college expenses the best way? Lol I was hoping they would go to the university I work at so they can go for very cheap. How can the Federal Credit Union help me in these situations? Finally, I was thinking about taking out a loan for about 50,000 dollars and use that money to just pay off everything at one time. To pay off both cars (my sisters car is under my name), loans,  and collections debt. At least this will clear off multiple debts reported the credit bureau including the ones in collection that are reporting negatively every month. When applying for the loan, I would be applying under my name and my sisters name so they can see multiple incomes under the loan and maybe be more willing to approve it. Is this a good idea? I guess that’s all I can think of, for now. Thanks in advance",finance,1462743437

Any Feedback is Welcome! Thank you for reading this far :)

____________________________________

**Why am I doing this?**

Answer - Well as you know Fallout 4 is extremely dense with locations and buildings that take hours to explore and loot fully, although that's just scratching the surface, these Secondary Locations aren't on the map, (as in with an icon), however there are loads of them! The want to do this stems from my pervious experience with New Vegas and Fallout 3, finding these hidden gems where always such a joy, in the middle of nowhere (bar Deathclaw island in New Vegas, though the armour was pretty handy). 

____________________________________

**Who's this For?**


Answer - Well... anyone really, veterans who have sank hundreds of hours into the game so far appreciate my effort, all the way to people who have just stepped out of the Vault, it's all for fun, some of the places have a cool name and perhaps a nice item such as a easy Nuka Cola Quantum (1.17), Nuka Cherry (1.03), Cooking Stations (1.21), Safes (1.23), Terminals (1.30), Protectrons (2.02), even Melons (2.04) There are also Radioactive Swords (13.02)!

____________________________________


**What could you find at these locations?** 

I'll have to admit some places have just ammo or meds, a nasty enemy or two, although with that said every location has a story, which is one of the main reasons I love to explore them! So yeah, thanks for reading this far! Below is a link to several of my episodes; be to sure tell us what you think!

Noticed that the inverter was reading 12.4 of battery #3 and the charge battery #1 was being fed 14.1 .

The charge wires are 10 gauge and the inverter wires are 1 or 2 gauge and 18"" long. Should i move the inverter cables to the charge battery and then parralel out to the other batteries one on each side of that, or should it not matter? The cables between the batteries are 6 gauge but thinking of making the move to a bus bar.

personalfinance,What to do with $$ from sale of house?,"So my wife and I bought a condo unit three years ago for $287k in a gentrifying neighborhood in Chicago.  Fast forward three years, and I receive a job offer in Denver.  We want to sell our house (instead of renting it out) in Chicago, and then rent for 1-2 years in Denver until we get our bearings and decide where we want to buy.

As I mentioned, we bought for $287k, and are going under contract today for a sale price of $368k.  That's $81k profit.  $18.4k will be going towards agents fees, leaving us with a net profit of $62.6.  My question is, ""What do I do with that money?""

A few points:

* We would like to invest that money, but still have it somewhat liquid.  The investment would likely be approx. 1.5-2 years, as we would need that money as a down-payment on the purchase of our next home.

* We have about $10k of credit card debt, averaging an interest rate of around 22% APR.  We are planning on paying off all credit card (unless someone finds a compelling reason why we shouldn't).

* Also worth noting:  We have student loan debt of approx. $40k.  We are not planning on using any of the proceeds to pay down the student loan debt.

**This leaves us with about $52k.  Where is the best place to put this money to maximize an investment in 1-2 years?**

Our cost of living will be as follows (in the event it matters at all):

* Income:  His salary of $100k/year, plus a 25%-50% annual bonus to be awarded in February.

   Her income is $43k/year

* We have a one year old son, whose daycare costs approx. $1,450/month.

* Our rent is $2,200/month

* Car lease of approx. $300/month

* Student loan payment of approx. $350/month.

* Rest of expenses are normal expenses for a family of 3 incl. groceries, cable, cell phones, etc.

personalfinance,sell house vs become a landlord / how is being a landlord ever a good deal,"I'm trying to figure out if renting out my house makes financial sense. The analysis I've done so far leads me to believe that it doesn't, but it also makes me wonder how any landlord actually makes money so I'd like a second opinion.

I think I could get $180k for the house or rent it out for $1500/month. 

If I already had the mortgage paid off the math would be pretty simple: $18,000/year in rent minus expenses: 10% for the management company, $3200 in taxes and insurance, and $2000 for maintenance and repairs comes to $11,000 in taxable income. In the 25% bracket that would leave me with $8,250 in income. 

If I sold for $180k, after paying the 3% commission to the real estate agent I would have $174,600. Therefore we can look at renting as holding onto a $174,600 asset in exchange for $8,250 a year, with an ROI of only 4.7%.

I have done some research online and found out about the ""50% rule"" which is the rule of thumb that says expenses, including repairs, taxes, insurance, and vacancy periods but not the mortgage, normally equal about 50% of the rental income. Per my calculations above I'd be keeping 45.8% of the rental income, so it seems in line with the rule of thumb, but my analysis does not consider vacancy so maybe expenses are just high in my area? 

This makes me wonder if the ratio of average sale price to average rent is just bad for landlords in my area - rents are too cheap and houses too expensive, but that doesn't sound right. The ratio is worse in other parts of my city, at least. 

If the house was worth a little less the math would be easier: $150k to buy vs $1,500/month to rent. Using the 50% rule that property would produce $9000 in annual income for an ROI of about 6.2%. That still sounds low, but maybe a good rule of thumb is that you need to be better than this simple ratio to consider it, whether that's $150k sales and $1,500 rents or $200k sales and $2000 rents or whatever. 

My research also revealed that a lot of people make it work by ""leveraging thier mortgage"" to have as little invested into principal as possible. The mortgage I have is a 10 year loan so this is the route I would probably go if being a landlord makes any sense at all. I'm on a 10 year loan so my payment is high, and if I kept the mortgage I have now there wouldn't be any income: the mortgage and other expenses would be more than what I would get in rent.

So say I refinance and get a 30 year loan for 80% of the homes value. My starting principal balance would be $144k. At an APR of 5% I'd be looking at a payment of $773/month - $9,276/year. The first year of the mortgage $7,152 of that payment would go to interest. 

So I'd get $18,000 from the tenant and have the following tax-deductible expenses: $1,800 management company fee, $3,200 taxes and insurance, $2000 maintenance and repairs, and $7,152 mortgage interest brings, so my taxable income would be $3848 and after paying 25% income tax on that I'd have $2,886 out of which I'd still need to pay the principal portion of the mortgage which in year 1 is $2,124 and I walk away from the whole thing at the end of the year with profit of $762 and an increase in equity of $2,124 for a total increase in net worth of $2,886. 

Now, that's a lot less than the $8,250 I'd get if I didn't have a mortgage at all, but I also only have 20% of the home's value invested in the property. If I sold for $180k after paying the 3% commision and the principal balance I'd have $30,600 so the ROI in year 1 is 2886/30600 = 9.4%.

Out of that 9.4% I'd have to justify whatever the closing costs are on the new loan, and the ROI will decrease from one year to the next as I make payments to principal which increase the amount I have invested in the property, making the income a smaller percentage of what I have invested. 

9.4% in year 1 and less with each subsequent year doesn't sound like a great deal to me. If I could get a 6% return through a mutual fund on the same $30,600, I'm looking at an additional 3.4% for the hassle and risk of being a landlord. That's only $1040/year. 

So, after all that here are my questions:

1) The analysis above does not consider local taxes or the federal tax deduction for depreciation. Is it okay to assume these are both negligible and/or cancel each other out?

2) Does your homeowner's insurance go up when you make a house you formerly lived in a rental property? By how much?

3) How does anyone actually make money as a landlord? Do you just need a better sales price to rental price ratio, like you would have with a multi-unit building?

4) Are there parts of the country where this ratio looks better, or are the people who rent out houses counting on other factors (home value rising faster than inflation, thinking that any alternative investment in the market will lose money, moving back into the house after a few years, etc) or just people who never did this analysis and think they're getting a better deal than they are?",finance,1462805873

I'm in my mid-30's and my wife and I are starting to make decent money.  We are each just under the 6-figure mark for income, individually.  We both invest a fairly significant amount of money into our employer-provided Fidelity 401k's (~15% each, plus a ~7% match from our employer).  We are no longer eligible for a Roth IRA due to our combined income, but had been contributing for the last few years.  

I don't have many personal savings in my bank account but I also have no debts.  I feel like I have ""all my eggs in one basket"" with my 401k.  We are looking to save money for retirement and for the long run.  

Is there something else we can do to save for retirement?

personalfinance,Student loan issues - need some advice on how to get organized.,"Hello PF.

I'll be as brief and concise as possible. Me (27) and my wife (26) live with our two young children. I work full time and earn $3,630 per month after taxes. My wife does not currently work. We decided it was best for our family for her to stay home with the kids, but we both have plans for her to return to work in a few years.

We currently get by just fine, with enough to pay the bills and take care of our kids. We live within our means and budget pretty carefully. A good chunk of our income goes toward our student loans. We don't have a lot left over at the end of the month, but it works.

Here are the details on our student loans:

* Loan 1 - Federal - $32,332 - rate of 5.93% - in my wife's name
* Loan 2 - Private - $18,513 - rate of 7.93% - in my wife's name
* Loan 3 - Private - $4,044 - rate of 5.00% - in my wife's name
* Loan 4 - Federal - $21,221 - rate of 6.80% - in my name

With a total loan balance of over $76k, we have quite the mountain to climb. In the next 5-10 years, I will be making substantially more than I am now, so we will be able to afford larger payments then. But at this point, I'm simply interested in ways we can lower our loan payments to give us a little extra breathing room. I have a few questions about how we should proceed.

1. Would it make sense to file taxes as Married Filing Separately in 2016? I know we'd take a bit of a hit on our tax return, but is it possible to lower the payments on my wife's loans to almost nothing by doing this since she has no income? I understand that interest will continue to accrue even though the payments are reduced, but we really need some relief from these payments.

2. Will consolidating our loans help at all? I am not very knowledgeable about this process.

However, I am in the processing of transferring to University for the Fall 2016 quarter, and I will be taking out substantial student loans. Some of my loans will be Federal, others will be through a yet undecided private institution. 

I am unfamiliar with security freezes, and I don't know if they'll prove troublesome with my loans. I'm thinking of enacting them after I have my loans sorted out (over the next month or two). At the same time, I certainly want to avoid identity theft and any other problems that can arrive from data breeches.

personalfinance,Student loan consolidation questions...,"Ive been getting a lot of mail recently about refinancing my student loans. Currently 30k in the hole and the total debt is split between two different types of loans that vary in interest.

personalfinance,College student about to run out of money before starting summer internship again. Considering two options,"21 year old college junior. Two more weeks until semester is over then moving back home for the summer where expenses will probably go from around $100 a week to about $50 assuming no major expenses come up. I also need to expend my business wardrobe a bit as I need to dress up every day for work now. Full time internship starts June 6th paying $18.75/hour. First paycheck will probably come June 20th which also includes a $2000 housing stipend, but I'm not paying rent since I'm still living at home.

Currently have around $180 in my checking account and $365 in my savings account but the majority of the savings account has to be spent on rent at the beginning of June. Parents have paid their share of rent the past months so I don't want to burden them for more money. In a nut shell, I don't think I can stretch that $180 for another month and a half so I am considering two options:


1. I have an American Century Investments account worth around $500 that my uncle opened up for me when I graduated high school. It has matured so I could cash out at any point. I'm not exactly sure how the account is setup but I could probably only cash out a portion of it as I need it, that way whatever I leave in there can continue to grow.

2. Open up a credit card so that I can begin building up my credit score. My hope here is that if I use it responsibly just for daily expenses and such I can pay off the first month's bill once I receive my first paycheck at the end of June. (Feel free to suggest any good student credit cards as well) My worry here is that if I get the first month's bill before I get paid, I won't be able to pay it off in full and will be subjected to a very high interest rate that is common with student credit cards.

Edit: feel free to suggest other options for me as well. Too late now to find another job as even if i got one it would still be mid June until I got paid and no one would want to hire me for only a couple weeks.",finance,1462828422

worldpolitics,Failure of trickle-down economics - Average guy focuses town hall round-table on key issue and sparks a national debate in a federal election campaign where EVERY federal seat is up for grabs in historic Double Dissolution election,"&gt;“I’ve got a disability and a low education, that means I’ve spent my whole life working for minimum wage,” said Duncan Storrar. “You’re gonna lift the tax-free threshold for rich people. If you lift my tax-free threshold, that changes my life. That means that I get to say to my little girls, ‘Daddy’s not broke this weekend. We can go to the pictures.’ Rich people don’t even notice their tax-free threshold lift. Why don’t I get it? Why do they get it?”

a post by /u/enigmasaurus- summarised my thoughts precisely https://redd.it/4im0f6 ...
&gt; 
&gt; Listen, assistant treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer... we need to get something straight: trickle down economics is not a fucking thing. It never was a fucking thing. It is never going to be a fucking thing. It is not an economic principle or theory: it is political populist bullshit. 
&gt; 
&gt; It originated in political commentary (by a comedian and journalist) during the Great Depression with the phrase 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt;""money was all appropriated for the top in hopes that it would trickle down to the needy."" 
&gt; 
&gt; This phrase was meant to *criticise* the stupidity of the idea.
&gt;  
&gt; In the past, a similar idea was also highly criticised by real economists. In the late 1800s the idea money to the rich would assist the poor was referred to as the ""horse and sparrow theory"" (again as a strong criticism) 
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ... the trickle-down approach to economic policy—what an older and less elegant generation called the horse-and-sparrow theory: 'If you feed the horse enough oats, some will pass through to the road for the sparrows.'""
&gt; 
&gt; Many studies have shown it doesn't work - *not even a little*. In fact, a high concentration of money in the rich actually *significantly* hurts GDP growth. A 2012 study in USA found:
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; ""wealth of the super-rich does not trickle down to improve the economy, but tends to be amassed and sheltered in tax havens with a negative effect on the tax bases of the home economy.""
&gt; 
&gt; Last year the IMF also did a study showing how [wealth inequality hurts economics.](https://www.google.nl/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc7Neeh87MAhUJaxQKHZYfCGoQFggvMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imf.org%2Fexternal%2Fpubs%2Fft%2Fsdn%2F2015%2Fsdn1513.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsQXYsCqvUzXIpcy_n4nYDDYOZAQ&amp;bvm=bv.121421273,d.d24)
&gt; 
&gt; Yet you - our assistant fucking treasurer and minister for small business no less - are sitting on TV spruiking this theory as though it's economic fact. So, Kelly, here's how economics actually works:
&gt; 
&gt; If you give a low income person $100, that person will spend ALL of that money. So ALL of it trickles UP to help the economy. Their landlords, shopkeepers, creditors - they all get some of it, and then *they* spend it. Overall the money works much, much harder. It directly leads to GDP growth. It improves the economy and benefits everyone - even the rich.
&gt; 
&gt; If a rich person gets $100 they will squirrel much of it away - usually at least 70%. Yes *some* of it works to generate growth, but *most* of it just goes fucking nowhere. It sits somewhere stoking a rich person's ego and doing absolutely nothing else. It benefits no one. It hurts the country.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is why, Kelly, you are economically incompetent - much like the rest of your political class. 

A double dissolution is a procedure permitted under the Australian Constitution to resolve deadlocks between the House of Representatives and the Senate. If the conditions (called a trigger) are satisfied, the Government can request the Governor-General to dissolve both houses of Parliament and call a full election. ==&gt;

personalfinance,"Baby steps: first, gettin' real.","I've been reading /r/personalfinance for a few weeks. The sad thing is I haven't learned much new -- I've known the basics for quite some time, but just kept putting off the inevitable. Not sure where that came from; but that level of psychoanalysis is for another group. (Although, I do feel finding the roots of these behaviors and habits are really important to ferret out if I don't want to just be in this same spot again.) 

So... baby steps. I've set up an account with ReadyForZero. I put my mortgage and student loan in there, but didn't include them in ""the plan."" 

My real problem is the $30k in credit card debt that has been racked up. Eating out, travel, luxuries... Bills for car repairs and other things here and there. Always with the ""Oh, I'll just charge this one thing, I'll pay it off next month..."" And then next month comes and I've got other fun things I want to do, so... I don't. 

In short, I've just always felt that things could be dealt with ""later."" Well, I'm 44, and I realize that later is really much, much closer than one would think, and that frankly there might not ever be a later. 

The good news is my home is modest (and refinanced to a great rate 15 year mortgage last year), and I have about $30k in equity. I have a very secure job making $80k/year. I CAN PAY THESE THINGS OFF. If I just focus, have discipline, and make this the priority. No excuses. 

My current steps are: 

1. No discretionary charges on credit cards. Pay cash when possible. Limit debit card usage to budgeted items only. And only use a credit card -- and then only one -- for the utilities and bills paid that way. 

2. The ""minimum payment"" for a credit card is the statement minimum PLUS any new charges PLUS the interest charged. 

I'm going on about three months with these two steps. I've stopped the bleeding, and am seeing a path to recovery. 

I'm trying to change my habits -- no more impulsive purchases. Make do with what I have (and I do have a lot, really). Eat in instead of out. Waste less (used to buy a lot of groceries and then go eat out). Habits are hard to break, and I'm curious as to what is really lying beneath the surface with these. 

Most people see these things and think... duh. That's how a reasonable person lives. Believe me, I don't know how I ended up here. My parents raised me right. I'm educated. I'm not an idiot. 

Except with money. I am an idiot with money. 

So now... a question. SoFi has been courting me with an offer for a personal loan. The numbers can't be beat; the interest rate is lower than my lowest credit card. I've researched -- what's the downside? I can't find one. 

IF I did do that, I would pay off credit cards and close all but one. I imagine that would deal a blow to my credit rating, but I have no plans to buy a home, car, or other item on credit in the anywhere near future.

personalfinance,Hard looks at credit keep happening weeks after filling out auto loan applications.,"I recently applied for an auto loan at my credit union (Navy Federal) and also at multiple dealerships.  In total I applied 7 different places.  All within a 2 week period.  I know that having multiple inquiries (hard looks) at your credit hurts your score but I have also learned that if you say apply for a similar loans in a small period you get a sort of grace period and it doesn't negatively affect your credit score.  Or so I was told

So I applied for the loans in early April.  I was approved by a dealership of my liking and purchased a car on April 15th.  Now almost a month after my initial applications I am receiving mail from multiple lenders approving or denying my loan application.  The worrying part is the first letter I got stated my credit score was 802.  The subsequent letters all had similar formats but kept posting a lower credit score and then among the reasons for denial where ""too many inquiries in the last year"".  I have received over 10 letters with the score gradually lower each time 796, 790, 788, 763, eventually down to 729.  

So my question to you is: Is this normal?  Did I do something wrong by applying multiple places?  And if so how is anyone supposed to shop around for a good rate on a loan?

personalfinance,Is finishing my degree worth it?,"Hey reddit. Throwaway account. So I've been struggling with whether or not I should go back to school in the fall. Had to drop out as a junior during summer 2012, my parents went bankrupt and couldn't cosign student loans, and of course fafsa doesn't have a place to tell them that, and federal loans didn't come close to covering my costs, even living off campus. State university, so even a cheaper college. Fast forward 4 years, now that I'm 24 I don't need to give my parents financial information, and I could get a $5000 Pell grant for each of my remaining two years. Thing is, paying off my current student loans have been such a hassle, that I'm scared to take out more debt and be possibly no better off after I graduate. I was going for philosophy, but being older I realize I should have a better career endgame with my choice of major. I initially had $14000 in loans that combined to $200 a month for payments, now down to $9000. I'd have to take out roughly $20000 more dollars to finish a degree, so I'm guessing my monthly payments would be between $300 and $400 a month then. And here's the kicker. When I turned 18 I got a slew of visible tattoos, because, ya know, my punk band was gonna make it big. Anyway, I don't know what kind of job that requires a specialized four year degree would hire someone as inked as I am. And I've been to almost every tattoo removal place in the state, and to remove all my visible tattoos would cost $4000, and the process would take a year. So a lot to consider and it feels like a huge gamble, but I'm tired of working dead end jobs and scraping by. Thoughts?

Edit: Lots of good advice (and debates) in here, guys and dolls. At this point I think I'll put off college until I have a definite career endgame in mind, and continue to make overpayments on my current loans when I can.

financialindependence,FAQ suggestion,"One of the questions was on the topic of inflation and mentioned that average inflation was ~4% per year historically.

I recommend against using averages especially with periods of deflation. I suggest including the *annualized* inflation rate as you can use this value for backtesting and projecting for the future.

Let me show you what I mean:

Let's say you had some cash saved up. If someone tells you that inflation over X years is 4% annualized, you can calculate the exact realized return of that cash (which is actually a loss in this case). However if someone tells you that inflation over X years is 4% *on average*, there are an infinite number of terminal values for that cash position depending on the degree of inflation and deflation in each year within that time period.

[From CPI data](http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/) the annualized inflation rate has been about 3.14% annualized since 1913 when the data starts. You can do a quick calculation to check this using the January 1913 index value of 9.8:

9.8* (1+0.0314)^(103 years) = 236.916 which is the January 2016 index value.

You can rearrange the equation to calculate annualized returns like how I got the 3.14% figure:

(final value / start value)^(1/years)  - 1

This tells you that if you invested in 1913 and got 10% nominal returns, you would have 6.86% real returns. You can see this with an [S&amp;P 500 returns calculator](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-return-calculator/) although it's a bit thrown off due to dividend reinvestment.

So if you project to make 6% annualized nominal returns, I think it would be more reasonable to project 6% - 3.14% = 2.86% annualized realized returns than 6% - 4% = 2% annualized realized returns. It is also worth mentioning that the Federal Reserve targets an [inflation rate of 2%](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm); however, I use 3% in my calculations to be conservative and because it approximately matches historical inflation.

personalfinance,"Student loan debt, mortgage applications, and personal goals","My wife and I have a plan on moving into a house sometime either this summer into early next year. 

Some questions about mortgages and student loans with our situation: 

We have ~21k of student loan debt at an interest rate of 5.125%. We are currently saving for a down payment and holding off on student loan payments (made a large ~8k payment which deferred payment for a few more years). We have no other debt. **Would paying off the student loan debt help us get into a house any faster?** My gut feeling is no, because we will be diminishing our cash which we are saving for a house, but maybe it will help with the mortgage application to an extent I do not foresee. *Yes, I understand that paying off the student loan first is better in the long run, but our personal goals are more important right now, and we can spare an extra thousand or two on interest to be able to move into a home quicker.* 

Notes:

We have roughly $65k saved.

We are looking for houses around 200k-350k. So, by that standard, a down payment of 40-70k is required. Plus, we need an emergency fund for a few months at least and more money for first-time-home-buyer incidentals, furniture, appliances, etc. 

Our combined gross salary for this year will be 200k (with a pessimistic projection around 175k). We had some fortunate work opportunities happen so we do not expect this much next year (160-165k expected). 

Bare expenses are 1-2k per month. 

Student Loan: ~21k @5.125% interest.",finance,1462848076
personalfinance,Understanding Diversification and Inflation (For New Investors),"Diversification is one of the most essential concepts for all investors to understand. When something is diversified, that means that there is a wide range of products of all sorts and varieties. I like to use the analogy of a very large garden, because there are many different types of flowers, fruits, vegetables, and trees that can be planted in the garden. Plus, who would want nothing but daffodils in their big, beautiful garden?

When it comes to diversification with investments, that means that you own different investment vehicles (stocks, bonds, ETFs, CDs, options, etc.) in different industries (manufacturing, entertainment, technology, medical, etc.) from varying businesses. The reason for doing so is to protect you from losing all of your money. Let’s say, for example, that you decided that diversification was not necessary, so you invest all of your $5,000 into eBay @ $25/share. Since eBay does not pay dividends to its investors, the only way you can make a profit is for the value of the stock to go up and for you to sell it when it does. Let’s pretend that eBay somehow ends up going out of business. Since the business has failed, the value of its stock will drop to the point where it will be worthless, so even though you sold your stock as soon as news broke, the value of the stock dropped to $15/share. Since you put all of your money into one single investment, and that single investment did poorly, you lost $2,000 of your $5,000. This is why you will almost always hear the phrase “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” when talking about diversification. If that basket were to have a hole, all of your eggs will splatter all over the ground and will not be able to be recovered.

Diversifying your portfolio is very difficult to do when you are not working with a large amount of money, because buying that many different investments would cost quite a fortune. Fortunately, that is where mutual funds and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) come in. They offer investors the opportunity to invest into hundreds or even thousands of different companies in different sectors all for a reasonable price.

The next concept that I would like to cover is inflation. To be quite honest, inflation has nothing (specifically) to do with investing, but has everything to do with everything else. Everything in this world has a price, and overtime, that price continues to increase. The best examples to demonstrate this include: movie tickets, sodas, and coffee. Let’s go back to a time in ancient history… 1970. Back then, the average price of a movie ticket was only $1.31, which is substantially cheaper than the $8.70 average we have today. If you divide current cost by the previous and multiply that number by 100, we get 664, which means the price increased by 664%. In 1970, a six pack of Coke cost $0.64 compared to the $2.50 (if you’re lucky) price of today, a 390% increase. And finally, a pound of coffee in 1970 cost $0.91 compared to the $5.00 of today, for a medium-grade coffee bean (like Folger’s or Community Coffee) for a whopping 549% increase. If all of those numbers and percentages were confusing to you, I will put it in simpler terms: The price of everything is rising each and every year and is showing no signs of stopping.

So, how does inflation affect investors? Well, it affects everyone like I said earlier, but investors must take it into consideration because the rising price of everything is cutting the profits they make from their investments. If an investor yields about 7% each year, meaning his total investments increased in value by 7%, but inflation increases the price level by about 3% each year, that decreases his net annual yield to only 4%. Luckily, in the recent years, inflation has been kept to less than 2% by the Federal Reserve and world-class economists. Keeping the inflation rate down is no easy task, but failure to do so could put our whole country in ruin if it gets as bad as history has shown. When inflation rates skyrocket, like they did in Post-WWI Germany, prices can increase to astronomical levels. In June of 1922 it cost 1 Mark (Weimar Republic currency) for a loaf of bread, and by the end of 1923, that same loaf of bread cost 1,000,000,000,000 Marks. Although this hyper-inflation has never happened to the United States, it just goes to show the importance of regulating inflation.

Inflation is a frightening concept, but as long as your investments yield a percentage equal to or greater than that of inflation, it does not hurt you. But, you should always keep it in the back of your mind that the price of everything is gradually increasing year after year. So, what is your plan of action in combating inflation?

Currently I am in the process of consolidation through WF, and they are offering me 8.49% variable rate to consolidate.

Not sure if I should look for more options, only consolidate my highest interest rate loan, or take what they give me. Considering I want to get my cosigner (My Mom) off my loans within a year, they don't look to be the best option to be able to do that since I would have to wait 2 years to eligible.

personalfinance,Want to turn primary residence into rental...things I need to know?,"I purchased my first residence 2 years ago with my wife and we have been going back and forth on if we should sell the home or turn it into a rental property.

I took a 7 year ARM on the home as the interest rate was one of the lowest available at the time.  The choice to do an ARM had mainly to do with the fact we knew the home was temporary and it was one of the lowest interest rate options at the time.  We could have bought the home in cash and figured that after 7 years if the rates readjusted to an insane rate we could just pay the mortgage off and escape any high interest environment.

My question is...what would I have to tell my bank? I remember signing lots of papers saying that this home would be my primary residence and not a rental.  Do I have to refinance the house? Do I let the bank know Id like to turn this into an investment property?

personalfinance,Wondering about refinancing a car loan.,"First time posting here so I apologize is this is a dumb question or I am not being comprehensive.

When I was 19 I was in the military and bought a brand new car for over 50K. I wanted a new and reliable vehicle since on leave I would drive home around 12+ hours and I didn't know much about vehicles. Obviously at that time I didn't have much going credit wise and got an interest rate of about 5.75%, which stuck me with a monthly payment of a bit over $400 monthly for a 72 month term.

As of now I am almost 24 and still owe about 12k on the vehicle, with about 2 &amp; 1/2 more years to pay. I don't have any problem making the payments month to month as they are. For a long time I have lived in a tiny apartment that I payed $350 a month for rent. Bad thing is my apartment is 45 minutes away from work currently and I work at least 6 days a week, so I have been looking into buying a house to be closer (and after so long in an apartment where you can barely move around freely, me and the GF want a yard, pets, and just the freedom of owning a home). We aren't going extravagant with it but regardless I know it is going to be costing more and I have been looking into ways to save some money. I am a ""better safe than sorry"" type of guy when it comes to finances so I always prefer to have much more than I need and I am always looking for ways to cut back spending.

In the last few years I have made great strides with my credit, never missing payments, keeping credit cards low and it has done well. I hop on credit karma from time to time just to check on how things are going and I have been keeping an eye my recommendations about refinancing my auto loan. I see offers that are usually around 3.25% for 60 months effectively cutting my monthly payment almost in half. Would refinancing my auto loan be something worth doing? Just to have an extra 200$ monthly for whatever I may need when it comes to the new house? Thank you for any insight you can give me with this decision.",finance,1462856840

personalfinance,"Transferring car from my name to my mother's, or should she get a different car? Credit/loan issues too","This is sort of a long story.  My mother had a newer car that needed a new engine (it was a lemon).  She couldn't afford a new engine, so she needed a new car.  I apologize as I don't remember the specifics.  But she still owed money on the lemon car.  Anyway she's gone through a lot of financial issues (mostly being extremely underemployed in a high cost of living area - she filed for bankruptcy less than 7 years ago) and we ended up getting her a car in my name because I have much better credit and got a much better interest rate.  So the car loan had to cover what she owed on the lemon car, and the cost of the new (used) car.  Long story short, she owes more than the car is worth at this point.

She's been making the monthly payments on the car.  However, since it's in my name, it's making it so that my debt to income ratio is way off and I'm trying to look toward buying a house in the nearish future.  The bank recommended that we need to get the car out of my name.  I guess - how do we do something like that?  Does she need to take a car loan out in her name and then buy it from me?  The amount of the car loan on the current car is more than the value of the car.  My mom still is in financial difficulty so I think any loan she’ll be able to get will probably be more than the payments she is making now, which is going to be a stretch for her.  Or do I try and sell her current car and we get her something that's cheaper?

investing,Associated Capital: Buying $1 of assets for $0.75,"[In November 2015, GAMCO—an investment management and advisory company owned and managed by famed value investor Mario Gabelli—moved a substantial portion of its cash, investments, and 4.4m of their own shares into a newly created company named Associated Capital. As of this writing, Associated Capital currently has a market value of $770m, which seemingly indicates that the company’s stash of cash and investments is being fairly valued by Wall Street.](http://www.slowappreciation.com/blog/2016/4/28/associated-capital-ac)

**MARKET VALUE**|**$770,870**|**$30.12**

&amp;nbsp;

Yet in addition to the spin off of cash and investments, GAMCO also created a five year $250m promissory note (i.e., loan), payable to Associated Capital at 4% interest.

Despite the note representing a very real economic benefit to Associated Capital, it’s true worth is obfuscated by the GAAP accounting because it’s a “related party loan”—i.e., a loan between two companies controlled by the same person—thus excluding it from the asset side of the balance sheet. But as the note matures, Associated Capital will receive payment from GAMCO, thereby increasing the company’s cash balance by an additional $9.83 on a per share basis.

GAMCO $250m Note|$250,000|$9.83    

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, Associated Capital’s downside risk is relatively low because its other assets are highly liquid and thus easy to value: cash can be taken at face value, and many of AC’s investments have market quoted prices. And Mario Gabelli—who owns 75% of both companies—has a proven track record of creating long-term value. Recognizing that Associated Capital is trading at a discount, the Board of Directors has authorized a buyback of 500k shares, which will help to close the gap between value and price. 

With 25% of its value not yet realized by the market, a value-centric owner in Mario Gabelli, and a highly liquid asset base, Associated Capital makes for an attractive opportunity with very limited downside. An investment in the company would be like buying a house worth $500k for $500k, and then a month later discovering that there’s shoebox buried in the yard stuffed with $125k. The GAMCO note—much like the shoebox—represents hidden value not yet appreciated by Wall Street.

Long-time lurker here. You guys give some great advice (from which I've benefited tons from), and now I'm hoping for a little bit more advice.

My wife (58F) and I (60M) are both working solid jobs, and though we've got an eye on retirement, we both intend to work at least through 65. We've made a good life for each other and our combined income is $200k+. Our house is nearly paid off and we have a decent amount tucked away in savings and retirement

Our son is 28 and will be starting his MBA at Duke. We've always intended to help fund his graduate study, but now that we need to start disbursing money, we wanted to make sure we're doing things properly. He's always worked hard (we're extremely proud of his work ethic) and we're not too concerned with his post-graduate prospects (he intends to pursue management consulting or banking). We originally intended on gifting him the entire amount (~$180k), but he came back to us with a proposal to take the entirety as a loan and to pay us back with interest (son proposed 4.5% over 10 yrs). His reasoning is this would be a benefit for my wife and me, and he would also benefit since our loan would be cheaper than what he could get through the govt or a bank.

**My initial areas of concern:**

a) Is it correct to assume we would have to report the interest as income and owe taxes on the income?

~~b) For federal/private bank education loans, my son would be able to write off the interest payments. Would he be able to do so for a loan that his mom and I make to him?~~ Solved. Thanks u/takeandbake!

c) What kind of paperwork do I need to give him at the time of making the loan, and on an annual basis?

My wife is all in on the plan, but I'm a little wary (I absolutely trust my son, but I've never done something like this). Is there anything glaring I should be thinking about?

personalfinance,Trying to help my brother budget and get out of debt... It's a mess,"I consider myself fairly good with money, taking tips from this sub on the proper way to pay off my own dates and save. I've been mildly successful.  

&amp;nbsp;

My brother has had some very bad spending habits as you are about to see. I helped him pay all of his utilities on time last week, but this coming paycheck (he gets paid weekly) is stressing both of us out, because we are going to have to decide who gets paid late.   

&amp;nbsp;

Necessary background: My brothers own a large two story house together, as the result of a lawsuit when they were babies. They split the bills, which is why his utilities seem so low. The house is rundown and a total wreck and honestly, neither brother can afford rent on their own so it just... stays what it is.  
Here's a rundown of the money:

&amp;nbsp;

Income $550/week (sometimes as much as 650, sometimes less, never below $490)  

&amp;nbsp;

Utilties (all due the first week of the month. They are all current except for Uverse)  
Electricity: $75/month  
Gas: $30/month  
Water: $30 (billed and paid bi-monthly)  
Uverse (TV and Internet): Just cancelled TV so this will be going down to $about $35/month; but he currently owes them $200.  
Verizon: $218/month due on the 2nd. He pays for two phones under contract--ex girlfriend. Any ideas on what to do to help this out? He has the ex's phone but can't sell it obviously because it isn't paid off.  

&amp;nbsp;

Debts:  
Personal loan: $1960 is the payoff, $150 min/month  
Stage Card: $550 is the payoff, minimum right now because of late fees is $108, typically $35/month. He has not been paying, but it is always due on the 11th.  
Secured Credit Card: don't know the payoff but I believe it's $550, $35 min/month. Paid on the 1st.  
Aaron's Bill: $1237 is the payoff, he pays in two bills minimum $100, so total $200 a month. Paid on the 1st and 15th.  
Misc. Credit Card: This one is in collections for $723. They offered a settlement in March at $469, doubt that offer is still good.  
Car Note: $376 per month, paid on the 19th  

&amp;nbsp;

On top of this he owes property taxes at $550 before August or they sell the title.  
His license is suspended, so he needs to pay $120 to reinstate.  

&amp;nbsp;

personalfinance,"Ballooning credit card and student loans debt, no income (seeking employment), but own a home","Hi /r/personalfinance,

&amp;nbsp;

**Background**

I'm a married man in his 30s, who has gotten himself into a financial hole, due to a pattern of irresponsible spending and borrowing. I have a graduate degree and I'm currently seeking employment. I expect that having income will certainly make things better, but given my poor history, I've decided that I need some guidance.

&amp;nbsp;

**Debts**

Type| Interest Rate | Balance |
:---------:| :---------:| :---------:|
Credit Cards|14.24%-16.24%|$26000|
Citi student loans|3-4.5%|$16000|
ACH student loans|5.0%|$71000|
Navient student loans|6.8%|$72000|

&amp;nbsp;

Navient loans are of multiple types, including Department of Ed unsub/sub FFEL Stafford dating back to 2007 to more recent ones that are seemingly REPAYE eligible.

After years of living above my means and spending without any kind of budgeting, I'm quite lost as far as how to manage my ballooning debt.

&amp;nbsp;

**Things I own of significant value**

In terms of things I own, I have a car and I own a home because it was gifted to me by my family and it is paid in full. I'm looking to move out this year, because I have to move to get a job in the Bay area, so I will have to either rent it out or sell it, although that will require some big expenditures in terms of remodeling. Based on the latest comparable, my house's price does not seem to have appreciated, so I'm looking at a potentially huge loss (realtor fees) if I sell. I bought in 2013, so the real estate market around here has been mostly sideways from then. As far as renting it out, I've looked into various sites that help landlords, but currently it's unclear how much money I might be able to get by renting it out. 

I also own modest amount of stocks and ETFs. They can obviously be mobilized to pay off my debt, especially my credit card debt, although I feel happy about having stocks... **edit**: I've liquidated my stocks.

&amp;nbsp;

**Questions**

I've done some reading of the material here and it seems that avalanche method of paying off high-interest loans first would make sense for me, which in this case would be the credit card debt. 

Credit card: I tend to put most of my daily expenditure on credit cards, because I like getting the perks from credit card (airline miles), but that habit is exactly what made me end up with paying 15% interest on an ever-increasing debt.

**Question 1)** How can I pay off my credit cards first (since they're high interest) while still putting some of my expenditure on the credit card for perks? Is there a good method of doing it?

Student loans: Also I'd like to know how to manage my student loans, because currently it's being serviced by Citi, Navient and ACH (which is tied to my grad school alma mater), and they have various interest rates ranging from 3.0% to 6.8%, and I'm not sure whether I am eligible to apply for REPAYE/IBR type plans nor how to proceed if I'm only eligible for some of them.

**Question 2)** What is the best method of action to manage my student loans, other than paying off high interest ones first? Should I consolidate? Refinance? Apply for REPAYE?

personalfinance,ALMOST CC debt free - what to do with other debts/problems? Help!,"WARNING – LARGE POST AHEAD!!

I moved cross-country on Christmas Day and arrived with close to $10,000 in credit card debt. (28/M if this helps at all for any reason)


I’m only making $18.00 an hour right now and now have a state income tax that I didn’t have before. I usually get about 3-4 hours of overtime a check ($27.00/hour) which covers the difference in income taxes that I’m not used to. My usual check, after taxes, comes out to about $1,100.00. Here are my expenses:



Rent: $600


Car payment: $325.90


Gas: $200 budgeted (I drive 60 miles a day, 5 days a week. And usually end up doing the driving on the weekends)


Food: $400 budgeted (includes contributing to groceries, paying for going out to dinner and drinks for my girlfriend and I)


Cable: $55.00 (Internet only, no TV)


Insurance: I pay the 6 month premium all at once for the discount, averages out to about $105/month but I don’t usually factor it in my budget


Cell: $85.00. Family plan with mom that is somehow $170 for 2 lines, 12gb shared data (Verizon). I use most of the data using GPS to and from work and well everywhere because I’m new to the state still


Toll road: $40.00. I use the toll road once or twice a week when the traffic is really bad and it will save me 25+ minutes getting home or if I oversleep and need to get to work in 30 minutes (as opposed to an hour and 15 minutes). The replenish amount is at $40 which is the lowest I could set it


Hair: $23.00. I get one haircut and shampoo a month and give a $5 tip


Cat: $40.00. This covers dry food, canned food, and cat litter.



Total monthly expenses: $1,768.90


Total monthly income: ~$2,200.00


Total net: ~$430.00


I’ve put every free penny towards knocking out my debt. The ~$430.00 x 5 months comes out to around $2,150.00. I received a student loan check in February for the Spring semester that was around $1,700.00 and I put it all towards the credit card debt. I got my tax return in the amount of $4,600.00 and dumped it all in. That adds up to around $8,450.00. I’ve put every extra dollar earned from any additional overtime that I’ve worked in; I’ve stayed late and come in on Saturdays a few times. I’ve sold some of my text books and other miscellaneous things. I’ve been really good about not buying myself anything – I bought 1 video game for my birthday in April. 


I am officially about $200.00 away from being completely credit card debt free. I should be there around the end of May or mid June.


What do you all do when you finally make it there? How do you resist the temptation to treat yourself? This whole time, I’ve been looking at this and that and compiling a list of things that I would really like to purchase. They aren’t useless purchases but things like hiking shoes, books, some car parts (Hobby #1 – had to leave project car in FL with family as it wasn’t CA legal), a new gun (Hobby #2 - had to leave all of mine in FL with family and need something CA legal). So not even considering the material things that I would /like/ to have to make me happy(ier?), I have a few issues that are more important:



PROBLEM #1 – I have $0 in emergency funds. I know that I should have had one all along but I’ve been trying to knock out this credit card debt  (with crazy APR’s of like 18-20%) first. Once I’m done by next month, I will definitely start building up to at least about 3 months’ worth of expenses. That’s a little over $5,000 which will take pretty long to accumulate, unfortunately. If I put every dollar towards this fund, it would take me about a year.


PROBLEM #2 – I have no retirement/IRA/401k. I once had about $8,000 in a 401k back when I was 24 (crazy that I was able to do that while making $10-$12/hour). I got laid off, messed up my unemployment, couldn’t find a job, and had to cash out my 401k to get by. It was super penalized and mega taxed, and I was never able to pay it back. I got stuck in bad situations and made bad decisions and haven’t contributed since then as I have been living paycheck to paycheck ever since. I definitely want to begin contributing to a 401k or an IRA asap, but I’m looking into getting another job and will probably wait until then, which leads us to…


PROBLEM #3 – My pay sucks. I am a paralegal and have 7 years of experience in the industry (foreclosure &amp; bankruptcy). I work in Irvine, CA. The mean hourly rate is $28.18 and median is $26.74. The mean annual salary is $58,620.00 and the median is $55,620.00. I make $18/hour which is about $37,440.00 gross pre-tax. I NEED a better paying job. I just graduated (05/07/2016) with my Bachelor’s in Paralegal Studies, which leads us to..


PROBLEM #4 – I’ve accumulated about $13,000.00 in student loans. They’re all low interest rates between 4 and 5%. I’ve elected the 6 month deferment so my payments won’t begin until the end of the year.


PROBLEM #5 – My car loan is at about $24,166.00. I did 4-year financing at 2.9% that matures 01/12/2020 and will have a balloon payment of around $11,000.00 due. I plan to sell the car at the maturity date and it /should/ cover the balloon.


So now I’ve typed it all out. Any personal finance wizards out there or just generally wise redditors who could share some helpful advice on what to do, how to do it, how to stay happy and still pay off these other debts while building an e-fund and retirement, etc.?? I REALLY appreciate any responses. Thank you so much!!",finance,1462899873
investing,What to do with $$$ from the sale of a house?,"So my wife and I bought a condo unit three years ago for $287k in a gentrifying neighborhood in Chicago. Fast forward three years, and I receive a job offer in Denver. We want to sell our house (instead of renting it out) in Chicago, and then rent for 1-2 years in Denver until we get our bearings and decide where we want to buy.

As I mentioned, we bought for $287k (current UPB is $272k), and are going under contract today for a sale price of $380k. That's $108k profit. $19k will be going towards agents fees, leaving us with a net profit of $89k. 

**My question is, ""What do I do with that money?""**

A few points:

* We're hoping for a better return than a CD would offer.

* We would like to invest that money, but still have it somewhat liquid. The investment would likely be approx. 1.5-2 years, as we would need that money as a down-payment on the purchase of our next home.

* We have about $10k of credit card debt, averaging an interest rate of around 22% APR. We are planning on paying off all credit card (unless someone finds a compelling reason why we shouldn't).
Also worth noting: We have student loan debt of approx. $40k. We are not planning on using any of the proceeds to pay down the student loan debt.

* This leaves us with about $52k. Where is the best place to put this money to maximize an investment in 1-2 years?

Our cost of living will be as follows (in the event it matters at all):

* Income: His salary of $100k/year, plus a 25%-50% annual bonus to be awarded in February.
   Her income is $43k/year

* We have a one year old son, whose daycare costs approx. $1,450/month.

* Our rent is $2,200/month

* Car lease of approx. $300/month

* Student loan payment of approx. $350/month.

* Rest of expenses are normal expenses for a family of 3 incl. groceries, cable, cell phones, etc.

personalfinance,Having trouble getting a credit card with seemingly good credit. Could use some advice on where to start.,"Hello everyone,

I am struggling to get approved for a credit card or loan based on my credit history and I am not sure how to go about fixing the things being held against me. A little over a year ago I went a purchased my first truck from a dealer and had to deal with getting a loan set-up as I could pay for the truck in cash, but it would have depleted my emergency money, which I do not like to dip below in my bank account, just in case.

They sent my info to quite a few different places and ended up getting a 5.99% over 4 years which isn't bad for my area from the calls I made in addition to theirs. I took this offer and have been paying on time since with no hiccups. A couple of weeks after this I started getting denial letters about not enough credit history, low credit score, things of that nature and thought it was strange, but I guess not strange enough to look into it more at that point.

Fast forward to about a week or two ago my fridge dies in the house and I head to Lowes to get a new one. I see they have a credit card sign up special where if you sign up for their in store CC you get no financing for 1 year. That seems like a pretty good deal to me, knowing the interest rate would probably be 25% APR, but I knew I could pay it off so I figured why not take a year to do it, and build some credit at the same time. I got denied in the store, which I thought was strange and had to pay with my debit card anyways. No big deal, but I decided to look into it more when I got a letter in the mail from Chase today about why I had been denied.

They denied me for not enough credit accounts and not enough credit history(time wise). I understand that, I've basically only had 1 CC in my life that I never used once I got enough money in my bank account to cover anything I would need so I cancelled it years ago. The thing that struck me as the most odd however is the company that ran my credit history had my credit score at an 860, from what I understand that is good, maybe even very good?

I am just not sure where to go about getting a credit card that I can use and build credit without ruining my credit score applying for multiple different credit cards as each one of them must run a check on me. The company that did my credit check also noted that I had applied for too many accounts recently. The only thing I've applied for loan or CC wise in the last 5 years has been my auto loan.

I am just stuck and not sure where to go to try and get ""un-stuck"". I am 30 years old and have a good amount of money in my checking account and a 401k that I am building from my current employer. How do I get all of this to translate into getting a credit card so I can build credit because I don't want this to hurt me in the long run trying to buy a house or anything of the sorts.

Thanks in advance for any help and advice! Sorry if this is one of those FAQ's but I looked through all the basic stuff and didn't see anything that would pertain to my specific situation. If it is there and I missed it I apologize!",finance,1462902029

I make about $36k usd a year and my current payment is 201.81 which is paying is only paying part of my monthly interest it appears. There's two groups of loans consolidated under the same company and they are presented as such.

Account Summary:

I had never looked at these statement details until today and was alarmed and frustrated I had not done so a long time ago. With my current wage and other financial obligations I cannot afford much more than I'm currently paying and I'm not sure refinancing would even help at this point, but I did try ONE institution, SOFI, and was declined. 

The only option I can see right now is to pay off my car loan, which is around 9,000 before this months payment, but I'll have to chip away at it for the rest of the year and possibly going into 2017. I have not done the math on that yet. 

Once I've knocked that out I'm considering taking a public service job that would pay me considerably less to start with but as long as I stick with it, full time, for 10 years and make 120 on time payments on a ""qualified payment plan"" the student loan debt will be forgiven.

Without eliminating the auto loan I would have to take more drastic measures to lower my living costs, such as taking on a roommate. I'm already going to crunch down hard on my food spending (too much eating out) and recreational spending.

personalfinance,Part of my budget is strongly unpredictable. Could I still benefit from using a budgetting tool?,"Hello,

I am using a throwaway account because I don't want this topic to be connected to my other account.



**TL;DR: Can I budget around an amount of money withdrawn from my bank account (0 - 1200 € / month, gets paid back occasionally)?**

I'll introduce myself, explain my financial situation and then ask for advice.

I'm a 23 years old student in Germany. I am currently doing an internship earning ~1300 GBP/month before taxes. After taxes ~1000 GBP. 450GBP go to rent, the rest is spent on groceries or other stuff or saved.

I'm receiving 400€/month support from my father (my parents are divorced). This is prescribed by law until I get 25 years old or graduate, whichever comes first.

After this internship, my master thesis will start and after that I hopefully will start a full-time job earning more money than I am doing now. So now I want to start planning my financial future. This leads to the following problem:

My mother has a strongly unpredictable income. She is not good in dealing with money. Any effort made by me tackling this problem did not succeed. Discussing money with my mother just does not work. We are two different worlds. My mother has access to my bank account. From time to time she withdraws money from my bank account to cover her expenses. This varies between 0€ to sometimes 1200€ per month. After some time, she pays the money back to my account. We seldomly talk about this issue but everytime it comes up she is devastated and feels sorry about this. I have a part time job since I am 16 years old, still I didn't save any money until now. I thought saving money will not work as long as money is taken from my account randomly. I don't know if the money was wasted by me or if there is some amount that my mother didn't pay back.

It is stupid that I didn't started saving when I started my first part-time job. It is bad that my mother has access to my bank account, still I don't want to deny her the financial help. But I am fed up with hesitating spending or saving money because I always think ""What if I buy that smartphone / book this holiday / buy this laptop / transfer half of my income to a savings account and then my mother takes some money and THEN I can't pay the rent? Better not spend money."".

I always feel bad when I spend money on something that I don't necessarily need. For that reason I read the /r/personalfinance wiki and looked for budgetting tools. My problem is that I really don't know how much money I will have for the month.

Now I have one seperate account for my internship abroad over which I have full control. So maybe now it's a good point to start budgetting.

Is it possible to 'budget around' this unpredictable cash flow?

I know that the actual problem lies in the situation with my mother. But I have absolutely no clue how to address that.

So is it somehow possible to save money in that situation? I am clueless.


edit: Thank you all for your suggestions! I think I will discuss with my mother wether I just leave a fixed amount on one account and open another or if I just give her a fixed amount each month that she can pay back when she is able to. Although eventually cutting her off is the logical solution, the other option feels quite reasonable and doesn't include a huge drama.",finance,1462908178
personalfinance,Need Advice on killing student loans. Refinance or use zero interest CC checks?,"Hello Personal Finance! 

I've been a longtime lurker of this subreddit, first time poster. 

Now I come to you readers of PF to discuss what'd be the best strategy on paying off my student loans. I'm looking to kill them off in about 4-5 years.

Recently, I've been burning down a great portion of my remaining credit card debt (Currently stands @ $3600, zero interest until October - paying &gt; $500/mo) that's on pace for payoff by September. As I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel for my CC debt, I'm starting to shift gears towards paying off my student loans.  

**Here's some information about me**

* Age: 28
* Annual Salary: $40k 
* Side Hustle: $800/mo (Drive for Uber/Lyft on the side) 
* Rent: $490/mo (Includes utilities)
* Car Payment: $215/mo
* Car Insurance: $97/mo (about 20k miles annual living in Northern California w/ 15 mile work commute)  
* 401k cont: 5% to max employer match
* CC #1: $3250 (0% APR through October '16) 
* CC #2: $300 (0% APR through Feb '17)  
* CC Payments: $700/mo 
* Phone Bill: $45/mo  
* Student loan Payment: $152/mo
* E-fund: Zero (Looking to improve this alongside paying my loans down - starting to add $100/mo) 

Please let me know if you need more information.

**My student loan situation (All Federal, no private)**

I'm on an an extended graduate repayment plan through Mohela that gives me a low monthly payment right now to optimize cash flow in paying down my CC debt. This is presented in form of balance and interest rate (0.25% shaved off to reflect auto payments)

* Loan #1: $5447.55 @ 5.35%
* Loan #2: $5448.56 @ 4.25% 
* Loan #3: $2466.90 @ 6.55%
* Loan #4: $6095.97 @ 6.55%
* Loan #5: $2319.85 @ 6.55%
* Loan #6: $5791.37 @ 6.55% 

A few potential strategies I've thought of: 

1) I have a very high credit limit of $40k+. On a bunch of these cards I have carried a zero balance for quite sometime. Ever so often, I receive zero percent balance transfer checks (promotional for a year) that come with a 2-3% fee for the amount I transfer over. Once CC debt is eradicated I would use one of these said checks to pay off a $2-3000 chunk of student loans. I have money saved to pay the 2-3% fees upfront and would maintain an aggressive paydown rate to pay the balance off before the promotional APR ends. Once the CC hits a fair balance (25% of borrowed amount) then I rinse and repeat with a new card and its promo balance transfer.

2) I look into Student loan refinance companies and see if I can get a lower interest rate at least for loans 3-6. What's been your experience with these kinds of companies? Is it worth it to lose potential federal bennies in exchange for a lower interest rate? I would think to go variable interest rate in this scenario granted I hold an aggressive paydown plan. 

3) Pad my current monthly payment to kill the principal down at a faster rate. ~~Readjust my payment plan to pay more per month by paying a larger amount than what I owe now. However, I like having my lower payments to give me flexibility with cash in case an emergency hits and I need to tap into credit (that I'm almost in position of paying off within a month of using it - I increase my side hustle ).~~

btc,"Greg Maxwell /u/nullc (CTO of Blockstream) has sent me two private messages in response to my other post today (where I said ""Chinese miners can only win big by following the market - not by following Core/Blockstream.""). In response to his private messages, I am publicly posting my reply, here:","*Note:*

*Greg Maxell /u/nullc sent me 2 short private messages criticizing me today. For whatever reason, he seems to prefer messaging me privately these days, rather than responding publicly on these forums.*

*There was nothing particularly new or revealing in his messages - just more of the same stuff we've all heard before. I have no idea why he prefers responding to me privately these days.*

*Everything below is written by me - I haven't tried to upload his 2 PMs to me, since he didn't give permission (and I didn't ask).

**TL;DR: The code that maximally uses the available hardware and infrastructure will win - and there is nothing Core/Blockstream can do to stop that. Also, things like the Berlin Wall or the Soviet Union lasted for a lot longer than people expected - but, conversely, the also got swept away a lot faster than anyone expected. The ""vote"" for bigger blocks is an ongoing referendum - and Classic is running on 20-25% of the network (and can and will jump up to the needed 75% very fast, when investors demand it due to the inevitable ""congestion crisis"") - which must be a massive worry for Greg/Adam/Austin and their backers from the Bilderberg Group. The debate will inevitably be decided in favor of bigger blocks - simply because the market demands it, and the hardware / infrastructure supports it.**

Hello Greg Maxwell /u/nullc (CTO of Blockstream) -

Thank you for your private messages in response to my [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ipb4q/bitcoins_market_price_is_trying_to_rally_but_it/).

I respect (most of) your work on Bitcoin, but I think you were wrong on several major points in your messages, and in your overall *economic* approach to Bitcoin - as I explain in greater detail below:

---

**Correcting some inappropriate terminology you used**

As everybody knows, Classic or Unlimited or Adaptive (all of which I *did* mention specifically in my [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ipb4q/bitcoins_market_price_is_trying_to_rally_but_it/)) do *not* support ""340GB"" blocks (which I did *not* mention in my post).

It is therefore a straw-man for you to claim that big-block supporters want ""340GB"" blocks. *Craig Wright* may want that - but nobody else supports his crazy posturing and ridiculous ideas.

You should know that what actual users / investors (and [Satoshi](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3wo9pb/satoshi_nakamoto_october_04_2010_074840_pm_it_can/)) actually do want, is to *let the market and the infrastructure decide* on the size of actual blocks - which could be around 2 MB, or 4 MB, etc. - *gradually* growing in accordance with market needs and infrastructure capabilities (free from any arbitrary, artificial central planning and obstructionism on the part of Core/Blockstream, and its investors - many of whom have a vested interest in maintaining the current debt-backed fiat system).

You *yourself* (/u/nullc) once said somewhere that bigger blocks would probably be fine - ie, they would not pose a decentralization risk. ~~(I can't find the link now - maybe I'll have time to look for it later.)~~ I found the link:

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43mond/even_a_year_ago_i_said_i_though_we_could_probably/

I am also surprised that you now seem to be among those making unfounded insinuations that posters such as myself must somehow be ""paid off"" - as if intelligent observers and participants could not decide on their own, *based on the empirical evidence*, that bigger blocks are needed, when the network is obviously becoming congested and additional infrastructure is obviously available.

*Random posters* on Reddit might say and believe such conspiratorial nonsense - but I had always thought that *you*, given your intellectual abilities, would have been able to determine that people like me are able to arrive at supporting bigger blocks quite entirely on our own, *based on two simple empirical facts*, ie:

- the infrastructure *supports* bigger blocks now;

- the market *needs* bigger blocks now.

In the present case, I will simply assume that you might be having a bad day, for you to erroneously and groundlessly insinuate that I must be ""paid off"" in order to support bigger blocks. 

**Using Occam's Razor**

The much simpler explanation is that bigger-block supporters believe will get ""paid off"" from *bigger gains* for their investment in Bitcoin.

Rational *investors and users* understand that bigger blocks are necessary, based on the apparent correlation (not necessarily causation!) between volume and price (as mentioned in [my other post](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ipb4q/bitcoins_market_price_is_trying_to_rally_but_it/), and backed up with graphs).

And rational *network capacity planners* (a group which you *should* be in - but for some mysterious reason, you're *not*) also understand that bigger blocks are necessary, and quite feasible (and do not pose any undue ""centralization risk"".)

As [I have been on the record for months publicly stating](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=author%3Aydtm&amp;restrict_sr=on), I understand that bigger blocks are necessary based on the following two objective, rational reasons:

- because I've seen [the graphs](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+bitcoinxt+bitcoin_uncensored+btc+bitcoin_classic/search?q=author%3Aydtm+graphs&amp;restrict_sr=on); and

- because I've seen the empirical research in the field (from guys like Gavin and Toomim) showing that the network infrastructure (primarily bandwidth and latency - but also RAM and CPU) would also support bigger blocks *now* (I believe they showed that 3-4MB blocks would definitely work fine on the network now - possibly even 8 MB - without causing undue centralization).

**Bigger-block supporters are being objective; smaller-block supporters are not**

I am surprised that you *no longer* talk about this debate in those kind of objective terms:

- bandwidth, latency (including Great Firewall of China), RAM, CPU;

- centralization risk

Those are really the *only* considerations which we should be discussing in this debate - because those are the only rational considerations which might justify the argument for keeping 1 MB. 

And yet you, and Adam Back /u/adam3us, and your company Blockstream (financed by [the Bilderberg Group, which has significant overlap with central banks and the legacy, debt-based, violence-backed fiat money system that has been running and slowing destroying our world](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin_uncensored/search?q=blockstream+bilderberg&amp;restrict_sr=on)) never make such objective, technical arguments anymore.

And when you make unfounded conspiratorial, insulting insinuations saying people who disagree with you *on the facts* must somehow be ""paid off"", then you are now talking like some ""nobody"" on Reddit - making wild baseless accusations that people must be ""paid off"" to support bigger blocks, something I had always thought was ""beneath"" you.

Instead, Occams's Razor suggests that people who support bigger blocks are merely doing so out of:

- simple, rational investment policy; and 

- simple, rational capacity planning.

At this point, the burden is on guys like *you* (/u/nullc) to explain why *you* support a so-called scaling ""roadmap"" which is *not* aligned with:

- simple, rational investment policy; and 

- simple, rational capacity planning

The burden is also on guys like *you* to show that you do *not* have a conflict of interest, due to Blockstream's highly-publicized connections (via insurance giant AXA - whose CED is also the Chairman of the Bilderberg Group; and companies such as the ""Big 4"" accounting firm PwC) to the global cartel of debt-based central banks with their infinite money-printing.

In a nutshell, the argument of big-block supporters is simple:

**If the hardware / network infrastructure supports bigger blocks (and it *does*), and if the market demands it (and it *does*), then we certainly *should use* bigger blocks - *now*.**

You have *never* provided a counter-argument to this simple, rational proposition - for the past few *years*.

If you have actual numbers or evidence or facts or even legitimate concerns (regarding ""centralization risk"" - presumably your *only* argument) then you should *show* such evidence. 

But you never have. So we can only assume either incompetence or malfeasance on your part.

As I have also publicly and privately stated to you many times, with the utmost of sincerity: We *do* of course appreciate the wealth of stellar coding skills which you bring to Bitcoin's cryptographic and networking aspects.

But we do *not* appreciate the obstructionism and centralization which you also bring to Bitcoin's economic and scaling aspects.

**Bitcoin is bigger than you.**

The simple reality is this: If you can't / won't let Bitcoin grow naturally, then the market is going to eventually route around you, and billions (eventually trillions) of investor capital and user payments will naturally flow elsewhere.

So: You can either be the guy who wrote the software to provide simple and safe Bitcoin scaling (while maintaining ""reasonable"" decentralization) - or the guy who didn't. 

The choice is yours. 

The market, and history, don't really care about:

- which ""side"" you (/u/nullc) might be on, or 

- whether you yourself might have been ""paid off"" (or under a non-disclosure agreement written perhaps by some investors associated the Bilderberg Group and the legacy debt-based fiat money system which they support), or 

- whether or not you might be clueless about economics.

Crypto and/or Bitcoin *will* move on - with or without you and your obstructionism.

**Bigger-block supporters, including myself, are impartial**

By the way, my two recent posts this past week on the Craig Wright extravaganza...

- [where I criticized Gavin when he *did not* demand simple and conclusive cryptographic proof](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hjn4s/my_username_ydtm_refers_to_a_foundational/);

- [where I praised you when you said you *would have* demanded such proof](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ibk2w/unullc_on_craig_wright_if_he_contacted_me_i_would/)

...*should* have given you some indication that I *am* being impartial and objective, and I *do* have ""integrity"" (and I am not ""paid off"" by anybody, as you so insultingly insinuated).

In other words, much like the market and investors, *I don't care who* provides bigger blocks - whether it would be Core/Blockstream, or Bitcoin Classic, or (the perhaps confusingly-named) ""Bitcoin Unlimited"" (which isn't necessarily about some kind of ""unlimited"" blocksize, but rather simply about liberating users and miners from being ""limited"" by controls imposed by any centralized group of developers, such as Core/Blockstream and the Bilderbergers who fund you).

So, it should be clear by now I don't care one way or the other about Gavin personally - or about you, or about any other coders.

I care about code, and arguments - regardless of who is providing such things - eg:

- When Gavin didn't demand crypto proof from Craig, and you said you would have: I publicly criticized Gavin - and I supported you.

- When you continue to impose needless obstactles to bigger blocks, then I continue to criticize you.

In other words, as we all know, it's not about the *people*. 

It's about the *code* - and what the *market* wants, and what the *infrastructure* will bear. 

You of all people should know that *that's* how these things should be decided.

**Fortunately, we can take what we need, and throw away the rest.**

Your crypto/networking expertise is appreciated; your dictating of economic parameters is not.

As I have also repeatedly stated in the past, I pretty much support *everything* coming from you, /u/nullc: 

- your crypto and networking and game-theoretical expertise, 

- your extremely important work on Confidential Transactions / homomorphic encryption.

- your desire to keep Bitcoin decentralized.

And I (and the network, and the market/investors) will always thank you profusely and quite sincerely for these massive contributions which you make.

But open-source code is (fortunately) *à la carte*. It's mix-and-match. We can use your crypto and networking code (which is great) - and we can reject your cripple-code (artificially small 1 MB blocks), throwing it where it belongs: in the garbage heap of history. 

So I hope you see that I am being rational and objective about *what* I support (the code) - and that I am also always neutral and impartial regarding *who* may (or may not) provide it.

**And by the way: Bitcoin is actually not as complicated as certain people make it out to be.**

This is another point which might be lost on certain people, including:

- many of the [so-called ""programmers"" who supposedly make up the so-called ""consensus"" behind Core/Blockstream's so-called ""roadmap""](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ecx69/uvampireban_wants_you_to_believe_that_a_lot_of/), or 

- [clueless yuppies like Trace Mayer](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/49i7sa/core_is_like_the_chicago_bulls_with_jordan_pippen/d0s584q) whose main achievement so far has been to (almost) destroy Bitcoin's most secure wallet, Armory.

And that point is this:

**The crypto code behind Bitcoin actually is *very* simple.**

**And the networking code behind Bitcoin is actually also fairly simple as well.** 

Right now you may be feeling rather important and special, because you're part of the first wave of development of cryptocurrencies. 

But if the cryptocurrency which you're coding (Core/Blockstream's version of Bitcoin, as funded by the Bilderberg Group) fails to deliver what investors want, then investors will dump you so fast your head will spin. 

**Investors care about money, not code.**

So bigger blocks will eventually, inevitably come - simply because the market demand is there, and the infrastructure capacity is there.

It might be nice if bigger blocks would come from Core/Blockstream. 

But who knows - it might actually be nicer (in terms of anti-fragility and decentralization of development) if bigger blocks were to come from someone *other than* Core/Blockstream.

So I'm really not begging you - I'm warning you, for your own benefit (your reputation and place in  history), that:

**Either way, we *are* going to get bigger blocks.**

Simply because the market wants them, and the hardware / infrastructre can provide them.

And there is nothing you can do to stop us.

So the market will inevitably adopt bigger blocks either with or without you guys - given that the crypto and networking tech behind Bitcoin is *not* all that complex, and it's open-source, and there *is* massive pent-up investor demand for cryptocurrency - to the tune of multiple billions (or eventually trillions) of dollars.

**It ain't over till the fat lady sings.**

Regarding the ""success"" which certain small-block supports are (prematurely) gloating about, during this time when a hard-fork has not happened yet: they should bear in mind that the market has only *begun* to speak. 

And the first thing it did when it spoke was to dump about 20-25% of Core/Blockstream nodes in a matter of weeks. (And the next thing it did was Gemini added Ethereum trading.)

So a sizable percentage of nodes are already using Classic. Despite desperate, irrelevant attempts of certain posters on these forums to ""spin"" the current situation as a *""win""* for Core - it is actually a major *""fail""* for Core.

Because if Core/Blocksteam were *not* ""blocking"" Bitcoin's natural, organic growth with that crappy little line of temporary anti-spam kludge-code which you and your minions have refused to delete [despite Satoshi explicitly telling you to back in 2010 (""MAX_BLOCKSIZE = 1000000"")](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3wo9pb/satoshi_nakamoto_october_04_2010_074840_pm_it_can/), then there would be something close to 0% nodes running Classic - not 25% (and many more addable at the drop of a hat).

**This vote is ongoing.**

This ""voting"" is not like a normal vote in a national election, which is over in one day.

Unfortunately for Core/Blockstream, the ""voting"" for Classic and against Core is actually two-year-long referendum.

It is still ongoing, and *it can rapidly swing in favor of Classic at any time between now and Classic's install-by date* (around January 1, 2018 I believe) - at any point when the market decides that it needs and wants bigger blocks (ie, due to a congestion crisis).

You know this, Adam Back knows this, Austin Hill knows this, and some of your brainwashed supporters on censored forums probably know this too.

This is probably the main reason why you're all so freaked out and feel the need to even respond to us unwashed bigger-block supporters, instead of simply ignoring us.

This is probably the main reason why Adam Back feels the need to keep flying around the world, holding meetings with miners, making PowerPoint presentations in English and Chinese, and possibly also making secret deals behind the scenes.

This is also why Theymos feels the need to censor.

And this is perhaps also why your brainwashed supporters from censored forums feel the need to constantly make their juvenile, content-free, drive-by comments (and perhaps also why you evidently feel the need to privately message me your own comments now).

Because, once again, for the umpteenth time in years, you've seen that **we are not going away.**

Every day you get another worrisome, painful reminder from us that Classic is *still* running on 25% of ""your"" network.

And everyday get another worrisome, painful reminder that Classic could easily jump to 75% *in a matter of days* - as soon as investors see their $7 billion wealth starting to evaporate when the network goes into a congestion crisis due to your obstructionism and insistence on artificially small 1 MB blocks.

If your code were good enough to stand on its own, then all of Core's globetrotting and campaigning and censorship would be necessary.

But you know, and everyone else knows, that your cripple-code does *not* include simple and safe scaling - and the competing code (Classic, Unlimited) *does*. 

So your code cannot stand on its own - and that's why you and your supporters feel that it's necessary to keep up the censorship and and the lies and the snark. It's shameful that a smart coder like you would be involved with such tactics.

**Oppressive regimes always last *longer* than everyone expects - but they also also collapse *faster* than anyone expects.**

We already have interesting historical precedents showing how grassroots resistance to centralized oppression and obstructionism tends to work out in the end. The phenomenon is two-fold:

- The *oppression* usually drags on much *longer* than anyone expects; and

- The *liberation* usually happens quite abruptly - much *faster* than anyone expects.

**The Berlin Wall stayed up much *longer* than everyone expected - but it also came tumbling down much *faster* than everyone expected.**

Examples of opporessive regimes that held on surprisingly long, and collapsed surpisingly fast, are rather common - eg, the collapse of the Berlin Wall, or the collapse of the Soviet Union. 

(Both examples are actually quite germane to the case of Blockstream/Core/Theymos - as those despotic regimes were also held together by the fragile chewing gum and paper clips of denialism and censorship, and the brainwashed but ultimately complacent and fragile yes-men that inevitably arise in such an environment.)

The Berlin Wall did indeed seem like it would never come down. But the grassroots resistance against it was always there, in the wings, chipping away at the oppression, trying to break free.

And then when it did come down, *it happened in a matter of days* - much faster than anyone had expected.

That's generally how these things tend to go:

- oppression and obstructionism drag on forever, and the people oppressing freedom and progress erroneously believe that Core/Blockstream is ""winning"" (in this case: Blockstream/Core and you and Adam and Austin - and the clueless yes-men on censored forums like r\bitcoin who mindlessly support you, and the obedient Chinese miners who, thus far, have apparently been to polite to oppose you) ;

- then one fine day, the market (or society) mysteriously and abruptly decides one day that ""enough is enough"" - and the tsunami comes in and washes the oppressors away in the blink of an eye.

So all these non-entities with their drive-by comments on these threads and their premature gloating and triumphalism are irrelevant in the long term. 

The only thing that really matters is investors and users - who are continually applying grassroots pressure on the network, demanding increased capacity to keep the transactions flowing (and the price rising).

And then one day: the Berlin Wall comes tumbling down - or in the case of Bitcoin: a bunch of mining pools *have to* switch to Classic, and they will do switch so fast it will make your head spin.

Because there will be an *emergency congestion crisis* where the network is causing the price to crash and threatening to destroy $7 billion in investor wealth.

So it is understandable that your supports might sometimes prematurely gloat, or you might feel the need to try to comment publicly or privately, or Adam might feel the need to jet around the world.

Because a large chunk of people have rejected your code.

And because many more can and will - and they'll do in the blink of an eye.

**Classic is still out there, ""waiting in the wings"", ready to be installed, whenever the investors tell the miners that it is *needed*.** 

Fortunately for big-block supporters, in this ""election"", the polls don't stay open for just one day, like in national elections.

The voting for Classic is *on-going* - it runs for two years. It is happening now, and it will continue to happen until around January 1, 2018 (which is when Classic-as-an-option has been set to officially ""expire"").

To make a weird comparison with American presidential politics: It's kinda like if either Hillary or Trump were already in office - but meanwhile there was also an ongoing election (where people could change their votes as often as they want), and the day when people got fed up with the incompetent incumbent, they can throw them out (and install someone like Bernie instead) in the blink of an eye.

So while **the *inertia* does favor the incumbent** (because people are lazy: it takes them a while to become informed, or fed up, or panicked), **this kind of long-running, basically never-ending *election* favors the insurgent** (because once the incumbent visibly screws up, the insurgent gets adopted - permanently).

Everyone knows that Satoshi explicitly defined Bitcoin to be a voting system, in and of itself. Not only does the network vote on which valid block to append next to the chain - the network also votes on the very definition of what a ""valid block"" is.

Go ahead and re-read the anonymous PDF that was recently posted on the subject of how *you* are dangerously centralizing Bitcoin by trying to prevent any votes from taking place:

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4hxlqr/uhoh_a_warning_regarding_the_onset_of_centralised/

The insurgent (Classic, Unlimited) is *right* (they maximally use available bandwidth) - while the incumbent (Core) is *wrong* (it needlessly throws bandwidth out the window, choking the network, suppressing volume, and hurting the price).

And you, and Adam, and Austin Hill - and your funders from the Bilderberg Group - must be freaking out that *there is no way you can get rid of Classic* (due to the open-source nature of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin). 

**Cripple-code will always be rejected by the network.**

Classic is already running on about 20%-25% of nodes, and there is *nothing* you can do to stop it - except commenting on these threads, or having guys like Adam flying around the world doing PowerPoints, etc.

Everything you do is irrelevant when compared against billions of dollars in current wealth (and possibly trillions more down the road) which needs and wants and will get bigger blocks.

You guys no longer even make technical arguments against bigger blocks - because there are none: Classic's codebase is 99% the same as Core, except with bigger blocks. 

So when we *do* finally get bigger blocks, we will get them very, very fast: because it only takes a few hours to upgrade the software to keep all the *good* crypto and networking code that Core/Blockstream wrote - while tossing that single line of 1 MB ""max blocksize"" cripple-code from Core/Blockstream into the dustbin of history - just like people did with the Berlin Wall.",cryptocurrency,1462911396
Bitcoin,Suggestion for correcting Bitcoin's centralization problem,"Argument of Bitcoin centralization:
Bitcoin is a fascinating story; its mysterious origins combined with an open source, revolutionary method of distributing and securing information make it a really unique and promising technology the entire world can benefit from. When Satoshi began the first blockchain in January 2009 they envisaged a truly decentralized, secure network protected not by steel and concrete but by mathematics, combined with geographic diversity, so that anyone could use, contribute and be rewarded for securing the global decentralized fledgling blockchain.

As time went on industrious miners sought ever more efficient and powerful methods of cracking blocks. The financial reward for the development and implementation of; at first specialized software for GPUs, and later specialized hardware, massively increased the difficulty of finding new blocks. The average home user could no longer compete with their peers, turning instead to pool mining in an attempt to maintain profits and keep the Bitcoin flowing. It was at this point, where miners started pooling resources, centralizing mining efforts and entrusting their precious profits to pool operators that Bitcoin in its original concept began to fail.

The days in which anyone could download the wallet, contribute to network security and be rewarded for their efforts were over. As mining pools grew so did their total hash rate, bringing with it the threat of 51% attacks and chain forking; today the peace kept by pools artificially keeping their hashing power below 51% - a far cry from the mathematically secured, globally distributed system Satoshi envisaged at Bitcoin's inception. In recent months there has been an ongoing argument over block size. Back in the days when Bitcoin mining was highly distributed the community would vote as to which version they would run by running the code of their choice. As centralization wormed its way into the core of Bitcoin the large pools were given more power to decide over the direction development should take - leading to the impasse Bitcoin now faces broadly between miners and users.

All of the above has led to the inescapable conclusion that Proof of Work (PoW) no longer provides the highly distributed, ubiquitously inclusive security model that technology such as Bitcoin requires. This is not a failure of the technology behind PoW, but a failure of the humans (myself included) that employ it to turn a profit and drive the blockchain forward.

Proposal for change:
One of the key benefits of Bitcoin in comparison to traditional monetary systems is decentralization. By removing a central issuing authority and placing the generation of new money and processing of transactions in the hands of the majority consensus, Bitcoin has provided hope to those seeking a fair monetary system that isn’t gamed by a controlling minority. 

Due to some unforeseeable developments occurring after the launch of Bitcoin, the ugly head of centralization has made an appearance and some changes are necessary if we care to correct it. No longer can an individual run the Bitcoin software on their PC and participate in the Bitcoin network in an influential manner. Mining pools and farms have taken the average individual out of the equation and allowed big players to become the owners of blockchain transaction confirmation and the generation of new coins. Again we encounter control in the hands of the minority with all others forced to follow along, left without a voice. Sound familiar? 

To fix this problem, I would like to propose an alternative to PoW for discussion as a solution, Proof of Stake (PoS). Not the traditional PoS you find in Peercoin and its clones, but an evolved and improved version that also addresses and corrects the problems found in traditional PoS. Proof of Stake Participation (PoSP) which is not just and idea, but is a tested and proven product currently employed in an alt coin, Crypto Bullion (CBX). The PoSP white paper can be found here http://cryptobullion.io/white-paper/ for further details.

Traditional PoS as employed in Peercoin (white paper can be found here https://peercoin.net/whitepaper) was created as an attempt to address some of the issues in PoW, primarily the vulnerability to attack, or manipulation that can occur resultant to centralized majority control. (Peercoin actually employs a hybrid system, which uses both PoW and PoS, but I am just going to discuss PoS.) Additional to this, PoS offers a far more energy efficient solution than PoW for generating new coins and confirming transaction. 

Where PoW requires a high hashrate for security, PoS instead requires a high volume of coins being held online in the network to confirm and enforce honest transactions. The idea being that those with larger investment into the network, reflective by their ownership of coins, are most inclined to act honestly as nefarious activity hurts the value of the network and therefore their investment.  

The problem however in the traditional implementation of PoS is that it rewards for behavior detrimental to network security. Coin owners are rewarded by interest that is paid on the coins that are held stationary in their wallet for a minimum of 30 days or a maximum of 90 days. Basically, if implemented in Bitcoin, you would have to hold your Bitcoin in your wallet for at least 30 days at which point you could connect to the network and compete to claim interest on the coins you own. A slightly higher interest rate reward would be paid to those who held their Bitcoin stationary for 90 days before connecting and claiming their interest. 
So instead of mining as we find in PoW, the creation of new coins in PoS occurs via interest payments used as an incentive to encourage coin owners to bring their coins online to the network to validate honest transactions.  However since security is dependent on coins being held online at all times, the reward structure of traditional PoS is actually detrimental because it rewards for coins being held off-line.

In contrast, PoSP encourages and rewards for coins for being held online. In fact, only coins held online are eligible for earning the reward and those that are held offline forfeit their share to coins active on the network. This is accomplished first by changing the reward structure to a fixed amount per block instead of a variable based on percent of coins staked. PoSP takes a set annual rate of growth in money supply, divides it by the number of blocks set to be generated in a year and establishes that value as the block reward that is doled out to network participants at the generation of each block. So in order to compete and earn a block reward, one must a) own coins, b) have their coins online and c) accumulate 1-hour of coin age (time their coin is held stationary in their wallet – the 1-hour time requirement helps smaller wallets to compete with larger wallets). The reward encourages people to keep their coins online, and since all coin owners will not do this, it allows for an interest earnings rate that surpasses the annual inflation rate further benefiting those who secure the network and confirm transactions and encouraging more people to participate in the network and further enhance security. As an example, PoSP implementation in CBX averages payouts of about 8-10% per year to network participants while the overall inflation rate remains at 2%.

If employed in Bitcoin, this would allow everyone who owns Bitcoin and an Internet connection the opportunity to participate in the Bitcoin network confirming transactions and generating new coins – reviving the realization of decentralization. 

The reward structure could be matched to Bitcoin’s current schedule for growth in money supply and once the 21 million-coin cap is reached, the block reward would transition to be composed solely of transaction fees. Therefore no change is necessary in Bitcoin’s scheduled money supply.

Regrettably, since centralization has already occurred to a certain extent, making this change now means it would have to be agreed upon by those who currently control the blockchain. These are unfortunately the beneficiaries of the centralization that has occurred so they of course will be hesitant to make this change. However, the push for a fair decentralized system is one of the keys that spurred the growth of Bitcoin to begin with, so to ensure longevity of Bitcoin through loyalty of the majority, centralization has to be dealt with and corrected.

personalfinance,28F w/High Debt - Needs Budgeting Help,"I am a 28F living in Texas with an annual income of $72,975 plus a 2.5% quarterly bonus (total annual = $80,272.50).  I contribute 15% to a 401k with a 3% company match (only started a few months ago but currently have about $11k in it). 

With about $4,000 per month in take home pay (internet + cell phone reimbursement included but bonus excluded), my current expenses are as follows:

Mortgage: $675

Internet: $130 (Company reimburses)

Health Insurance: $315

Food: $150

Student Loan #1: $337 (Private; 7% interest; balance at $37k)

Student Loan #2: $622 (Federal, IBR; 7% interest; balance at $200k)

Car + Auto Insurance + Renters/Jewelry Insurance: $365

Gas: $100

Health Insurance for 2 Dogs: $39

Cell Phone: $50 (Company reimburses)

ASPCA Donation: $20

Credit Card: $400 (6 months left)

Savings: $400

Horseback Riding: $160

Misc./Entertainment: $100


The total comes out to $3,863, leaving little left over.

Any spare $ is being put toward my credit card balance (thanks ER bill!) and will be paid off ASAP.

Working 60+ hours per week means that there’s little time/energy for hobbies so my 1 hour of riding per week more or less keeps me sane, and is the one expense I’m not willing to cut.

My fiance also works long days so our “entertainment” is usually Netflix (using my family’s account) and ordering delivery of some sort once per week.

Where should I be cutting costs?

Would it make sense to cut back on my 401k contributions to get caught up on my debts?",finance,1462916737
personalfinance,"Starting my retirement, TSP and Roth IRA help please","I have done the reading and googled tips but still feel so confused about what to invest in.

worldpolitics,How political parties and elections have made us all terribly selfish.,"Just my opinion on just one major way people think about politics. Particularly relevant with the U.S elections going on, but something to think about in all political situations, and life in general.


From a very young age we are told by our parents that one party is good, and the other is bad. From the time we are children, when we can’t possibly be expected to understand economy, health care, war, or international affairs, we have already taken a side. And for the most part, we pick the side that our parents are on, and they have taken the side of their own parents. The same goes for religion, various demographics, thoughts on economy, civil rights, and just about everything else. The few kids that don’t have influence find something else to teach them. A book, a magazine, a role model, something that has it’s own views and political bias. We easily clamp up, and keep away the ideas that are foreign to us. We see the words ‘Republican’, ‘Democrat’, ‘Liberal’, ‘Conservative’, ‘Socialist’, ‘Federal’, ‘Catholic’, ‘Muslim’, ‘Protestant’, ‘Baptist’, ‘Lutheran’, ‘Right Wing’, ‘Left Wing’, we all think something different. Nearly everyone belonging to a party has this horrible, unprecedented bias. We block out the bad parts of our own party, and pour over the terrible stuff about the other side. This is how American, and to some extent, international politics work. We don’t care about how nice a politician is, how much they lie, how much they really care about us. We care about how many taxes we’re paying, where and how are education and healthcare is being provided. ‘Who cares what the other fifty percent of the population thinks?’ Says the average voter. ‘I’m voting for who will work best for me.’ It’s human nature to take sides. It’s a lot easier to let you side do the thinking for you, and all you have to do is repeat what they said.

But in all honesty, neither side, right, left, blue, red, is any better than the other. Sure, we can blow up each other’s words to make ourselves seem evil, or corrupt, but at the root, all parties are the same. Both sides appeal to major regions, classes, and cultures. They do this in both fair, and erroneous ways. Everyone has tried to explain the differences between the parties before, and we find ourselves using some very broad grammar when doing so. Words like ‘usually’, ‘tend to be’, and ‘often’ are almost inevitable. And even these broad statements are met with exceptions. If a single human being was dropped down with no knowledge of the party system, and sides and bias and such, there would be some politicians they liked, some they didn’t, and a lot they wouldn’t be sure about, both Democrats and Republicans. This area of not being sure about someone is where a lot of them fall, because there is no such thing as a perfect politician. Every political figure is good at something, whether it’s public image, or speaking, or negotiation, or taking control, or joining people together,and they also have a splurge of mistakes and idiocies. No one is perfect, and no party fits one person perfectly. This has forced politicians to revert to one of the most obscure and terrible ways of winning over power. Convincing the majority.

What’s so depressing about the majority is how huge amounts of individuals, communities, and demographics, can get swept away under the carpet. It’s worse than pleading to the masses, because the masses are at least fifty percent. Since only sixty percent of Americans even show up to vote, you only need thirty percent of America to like you in order to win. This means that you only need to get a couple groups on your side. If you have the African Americans and immigrants, you win. The catholics and baptists, you win. The upper and upper middle classes, you win. But what does this mean for everyone else? Are we just screwed? Will our leader just keep trying to pass laws that help out a certain group while the rest of our opinions float around in congress until someone comes and tries to get them going again? The question we should be asking at this point is, why can’t we come up with a compromise? Wouldn’t it be better for everyone to get a little say, rather than a few getting a ton? The answer, sadly, is that we’re just too damn selfish.

Imagine for a moment that you are a mechanic catholic. Doesn’t matter what party you belong to or anything else. It’s all very similar. Election season is rolling around so you take a bit of time to decide who you are going to be supporting. There are three big choices. The first is a catholic politician that has a campaign focusing in on blue collar workers. You of course are thinking about the luck you are having, and immediately think about how wonderful this person will be as a candidate. The second choice is this person that you don’t like very much at all, they seem to be aiming more toward the middle class and minority groups. The last person however, is a little different. They don’t seem to be appealing to anyone in particular, and all their policies are about making the nation more fair for everyone, trying to build up a compromise in many arguments that the first and second nominees seem to be having. You don’t think that this nominee is all that bad, but they have said a few things that you aren’t totally okay with, and there is no reason to not vote for the other person, who will make your life easier. Before long, that last, everyone - sort - of - likes - me nominee becomes irrelevant. Your favorite candidate loses to the one you dislike, and you despise how they make unfair decisions for your country. All of a sudden, you sort of wish that you had chosen the nominee who had met them in the middle, because at least they were better than the one who was selected.

The point I’m trying to make here, is that we as Americans instinctively choose what is best for ourselves, and not necessarily what’s best for the country. And unless this somehow changes, politicians will be forced to appeal to certain groups in order to get enough support. People get torn apart, furious that other people won’t vote for someone that would make no sense for them to vote for. It is impossible to make a decision that will please everyone, especially in a place as large and diverse as the United States, but you can get almost everyone to not despise every decision that you make. And if you are looking at all of us as one entire unit, that’s probably the best option. George Washington warned us that political parties and other differences would pull us apart, and I’m afraid that it already has.

The best thing we can do for ourselves, our communities, our nation, and our planet, is to look at all of each other in a new light. Let’s be more open to people in other, or no parties. Let’s hear their opinions, try to reach compromises rather than arguing when we know neither side will change it’s mind. There are goods, and bads, in everyone, and when choosing someone like a mayor, or president, or any politician, including outside the U.S, let’s pick someone who is going to be fair, kind, and the least amount of people hate. I don’t think that there are many, if any of these types of politicians around right now in major elections, or even any that might be in elections in the next few years. Hopefully though, in the future, we will be able to look at candidate and say “I guess they wouldn’t be so bad.” But for now, we all just need to try and settle our differences, and understand our fellow citizens opinions are just as relevant as our own.",finance,1462922014

Regions and Ameris.,"My wife and I have a checking and savings account at Artisian Federal Credit Union which, up until recently, has been a fairly good experience. My original gripes with them have been minor, such as limiting card usage to four transactions from Friday to Monday and three transactions (at any time) cannot consecutively exceed $500.

Other issues are that you cannot purchase anything outside of the U.S. The branch closes at 4 on weekdays, 12 on Wednesday, and they are not open on the weekends. 

Recent issues are a bit more deal-breaking. I live in South Georgia and had to travel towards Atlanta for a business meeting. I tried to buy lunch and they put my card on fraud alert protection. My wife has called them 3 times and I have done the automated phone thing and it has not worked. My card is still inactive a week later. 

I am also interested in using Android Pay and Google Wallet. Artisian is not supported with either. 

The two banks we are considering are Regions and Ameris. I know Regions is supported in both apps. Ameris is not. 

Any other information about these banks is most welcome.

personalfinance,$190k in debt with a decent paying job. Do I cash out $30k in investments to speed up the process?,"Throwaway account due to the number of people who know me through my normal account.  I should also add that I'm a single guy with no kids, since that probably enters into these equations somewhere.


Also, sorry for the wall of text.  I've never been good at being succint.

**background**

I work as a psychologist in a major city in a fairly well-established practice.  I had worked there as a post-doc for the last two years and, after getting licensed, was offered a new position with a new contract.  Same job responsibilities, but I go from making $36k/years (so about 2100 take home pay) to closer to 100k/year (about $5k take home pay).  My employer matches up to 3% in a simple IRA, so currently I'm putting 3% in it.  They also cover half of my health insurance.  I say about since my income fluctuates a bit month-to-month, but that's a number based on the number of billed hours I was able to do as a postdoc.  After a year of being licensed year, I'm eligible to receive an increase in the percentage of my billed hours that I receive, which would increase my monthly take-home pay to just under $7k.  That means that the numbers I post below are likely going to be a bit improved in terms of time frame, but since I'm not there yet I'm not counting on it yet.

Getting to this point wasn't easy though. Through no one's fault but my own, I took out a significant amount of student loans to get through undergrad and grad school. I graduated two years ago, but as a postdoc I wasn't able to afford the already high monthly payments (I've been on the IBR).  After paying off the credit card debt I accrued over the past two years, I'm now ready to start paying off my loans.  Currently, they are all at 6.8% interest and total 190k. 

Additionally, several years ago I had come into some money and invested it, hoping never to touch it.  Currently, that account sits at just short of $30k.  I also have $3k in an emergency account.

**expenses**



Apartment - $1200

car insurance - $60

Gas for car - $80

Professional liability insurance - $35

Groceries - $240 (I'm pretty consistent with this)

Cable and phone - $175

Electric and gas bill - $50

Minimum student loan payment - $2200

Also, I have no car payments or any other debt.

this puts me at $4040, and leaves me with about $960 for fun expenses/dating, building up my emergency fund, and paying off more towards my student loans.  On months I make more, obviously I have a bit more money to divide between these three areas.  Assuming I divide that into thirds ($320 for each, with the assumption that I'd roll over any unused fun-funds to be re-divided again), I'd be paying ~ $2500/month towards my loans.  This would shorten the length of the loan by 1.8 years (100 payments), and save me just over $13k in interest.


**The question**

Now, I've looked into refinancing the loans, but I can't find anything yet that offers me a lower interest rate.  I sort of wonder if that's a function of having had the higher pay for such a short period of time, so obviously I plan to try to look again in a few months.

However, if I cash out that $30k, and continue paying roughly 2500/month, I can save almost 3.5 years of repayment time (80 total payments) and save over 21k in interest.

So basically, if I cash out this 30k, I save 7k in interest (assuming I never refinance, although I'd like to), but more importantly I save 20 months of repayment time.  

I'm not wild about the idea of cashing out this account, but 20 months of repayment time is... a lot.  I'd love to say I'd immediately put that $2500 back into investment right away, but I'm sure at that point I'll want to be saving for other things as well - a house, kids, who knows. I'm fairly confident from where I stand now that I'd be investing some of it, but I can't imagine I'd recuperate the loss of the investment account (let along what it could potentially grow to) in those 20 months.

So, is it worthwhile to cash out the account? Is it better to have 30k in mutual funds in case the sky falls and I need it?  In a real emergency , I have family I could turn to who would be able to help (either as a gift or a loan, depending on who I ask and for how much). So I wouldn't be entirely without a safety net if needed.

Any help/tips here would be appreciated.  Thanks!",finance,1462932649
personalfinance,Advice for College - What to do?,"So... this is kind of a finance question and kind of not.... This is also a throw away account 

**Background** I started college at Shepherd University in 2013 for a degree in Economics with a minor in Financial Planning. In 2015 I got married, moved, and sadly had to transfer colleges since Shepherd had no online classes for the program I wanted. the transfer killed me since I had taken many upper level courses and almost nothing would transfer. So I started taking classes at Tidewater Community College online. Today marked the end of my classes there and I am now a graduate with my associates degree. Now I am looking at colleges to get my Bachelor's Degree. I have already gained about $20,000 in student loans and though I know I am going to be incurring more, I am very hesitant to do so. 

My husband is Military so I am eligible for the MyCAA scholarship but that only applies to Associates Degrees and Certificates. I am also eligible for about $1500 of Pell Grant for this next year. TCC sent me an offer of financial aid with two additional grants which would make any classes I take there next year completely free.

I applied to Penn State and was accepted under the Military Tuition Rate which does make tuition cost less, however it is still much more. And next year when my husband gets out of the military I will no longer fall under that program so the tuition will be increased, which we will not be able to afford and I will again have to go somewhere else or wait to finish school which will set me back a lot. 

I also applied to UMUC which I get a lower rate because I work at Navy Federal Credit Union. I could potentially graduate within the next year from UMUC but will still have to take out about $10,000 in student loans, but my degree will be finished by the time my husband gets out of the army (if not I will only have one semester left which will be an additional $1500). But again - degree will be finished and I will no longer have to worry about schooling until I go back for my Master's. I could then get a really good job and we will be set for when we move. 

My third and final option (other than PSU and UMUC) is to go back to Tidewater Community College for a year and get another associates degree completely free and wait to get my Bachelor's Degree. The thing is, I really, really want to be either a University financial aid or admissions counselor and for both of those jobs I have to have my Bachelor's Degree in something. 

Sorry for the rant and if this is the wrong sub, I am just unsure what to do right now and need some guidance from some personal finance masters.",finance,1462933721

She is currently paying about $1,100/month total on all of the loans. From what I’ve gathered she is making minimum payments on everything, looking at the loan details it looks like the majority of them have been paid down very little or the balance has actually increased. 


She would be comfortable making payments of $1,500 a month and could probably be convinced to go higher if need be. 


Clearly she needs to consolidate most or all of her loans.


Some questions I have:

* Would you consolidate the federal and private loans separately?
* She currently works as a Nurse at a non-profit tax exempt hospital, so I believe she should be eligible for loan forgiveness on her federal loans after 10 years of repayment. Would consolidating these loans effect this?
* Should she consolidate all of her loans? Interest rates on some of her loans are under 5%, should those loans be left alone?
* Who should she go through for consolidation? Are there better options then SoFi?


She and her spouse make a little over $10,000 a month in take home pay, personally I think she should be able to afford to pay more then $1,500 a month on her student loans but I’m not hopeful I’ll convince her of that. She lives in Santa Clara and pays a little over $3000 a month in rent, $1,000 a month in car payments, and they have some credit card debt that they're paying off as well.

So I mistakenly forgot to send in forms for my tuition when I was in university, now I've been working and I just received a letter from CRA saying I have quite a hefty amount of unused credit. Like a lot. 

I did a bit of research and I guess that tuition credits are non-refundable, but they carry over every year if unused. Can I only utilize this if I have taxes owing? I contribute to an RRSP so I won't likely have a lot, if any, owing taxes - does this mean I don't really get to utilize all these credits?

personalfinance,Post mortem fraud,"Trigger Warning - this involves a rather detailed account of a death. 

My dad just died of a heart attack suddenly and in the past weeks since his death we have made some chilling discoveries.   He was on vacation when he died, where we have a second home.   It is a gated community in the southwest with a golf course, pool, workout room.   

Dad's age: mid sixties

Whenever  my dad left the house, he would say out loud ""money keys wallet cell""  and would bring all of those things with him, without fail. He had a pilots license and was keen on checklists. 

Cause of death: suspected heart attack, but autopsy came back inconclusive and they ordered more tests. 

Here is the order of things as we know them. 

* He had just golfed 18 holes booked via golfnow, starting at 3:20, which I confirmed via his email 
* After golfing, it's presumed he went to the workout room, near the clubhouse (same parking lot) where he signed in at 8:50.  Five hours for 18 holes sounds about right for him. 
*He only changed from his golf shoes to his loafers so I am thinking he was just lifting weights as he was known to. 
* As he was leaving the workout area (which requires a key card to enter) it is presumed that he collapsed and had a heart attack in the hallway (which does not require a key card for entry).  
*  He was discovered by a college student, whose parents live at this gated community. He was in the fetal position, clutching his backpack. His face was blue. 
*  His wallet nor his cell phone were ever discovered. I flew down to the state he died in and searched our car, golf bag, house. 
* I spoke to the person who found him, I do not suspect he would steal these things, but I do not know for certain. He has been forthcoming with information. 
*  when I spoke to him he did asked me when I found out about the fraudulent charges on my dad's debit card, he also asked if there were any leads. 
*  there are no video cameras on the premises. 
*  they presume my dad was on the ground for 20 minutes before this young man found him. 
* this young man apparently didn't have a cell phone, because he ran upstairs to tell someone to call 911
* security came and administered CPR until the fire truck and ambulance arrived at which point they took over, used the AED machine, but his heart never restarted. After they gave CPR his color improved, but I believe this was just oxygenated blood from the heart being circulated and not him being revived. 


 I have come to find out that my dad's debit card has now been used  seven days after he died in Paris, France for just under $200.

His cell phone was never recovered.  

 I am fairly certain he did not authorize this transaction, and it took seven days to post if he did.  I have been in contact with the police investigator about the suspected fraudulent charges and possible post mortem robbery or altercation. 

 It is mortifying not knowing what happened and my dad's last moments of life. It is hard enough having my dad die at such a young age, as I am an only child and we were very close.

I don't remember contributing anything as I had no idea what the heck 401k meant at that time. Anyways, it doesn't matter because the university does not contribute to my 401k anymore. I am looking at a steady **take home income** of about $2,200/month for the next 4 years. I say take home income because the HR system neatly calculated my tax deductions and I get very little money back from IRS (Federal/state/local).

### Current budget/expenses
Okay, I was going to write detailed/itemized expenses per month but I will spare you the details. Simply put, I never spend more than $800 / month (typically stay within $600/month) and try to live a frugal life. This includes rent, utilities, groceries, health insurance, transportation, occasional outing, periodic gift buying (bdays), and rare visits to hospitals.

### Creditworthiness
I currently have just one credit card with about $2,000 credit limit which I pay every month in full (statement balance). There's very little chance that I will ever miss or pay less on my credit card statement.

My credit score is in the healthy range of 710-730. Surprisingly, I got the _you're pre-approved_ mail from Citibank for their 2% cash back card (name: Citi Double Cash credit card). I am planning to get apply for it and use it as my main card in the long run. Please comment if it's not a good idea.

### Debts : the main meat of the matter
I have a student loan from an Indian student loan company of around $57,000 (around INR 3,800,000) with 14.85% interest rate (I know, its ridiculous). Currently, I pay around $1,200 per month towards that loan (about INR 70,000/month). If I keep paying at this rate (1.2k/month) it will take me the end of year 2023 to pay it in full (**shudders**).

I have saved up around ~USD $2,000 in my bank account as my emergency fund.

I have a quick question and a longer strategic question:

Quick question: Should I take out the $1,300 from my 401k account and pay towards my loan?

Long question: How should I tackle my debt?

I am wondering from both tactical and strategic point of view. Tactical plan could be like how much money should I send every month to India towards the loan? Should I send $1.2k/month to the EMIs, save up $200-$300 every month here and then send extra $1,000 every 4 months towards the loan?

Strategic plan could be other ways to make big payments to the loans, e.g. I am planning summer internships (currently no offers). If the internship pays handsomely and I am able to save over $5,000 during the summer - how do I use that money?

There's also the question of yearly big expenditure like making a visit to India which could cost about $1,200 per year. I would really like that to happen but so far I have been using that money to build my emergency fund.

Thoughts? Plans? Suggestions? Questions? Helpful tips and tricks?

Thanks a lot /PF ! There is a great deal of wisdom in the sub and I am already reading up on the wiki articles to answer some of my simple questions.

I will be starting dental school this August. The total cost of my education will be ~250,000 for the next four years, and then I will enter a residency hopefully in orthodontics. My parents are amazing and are covering my undergraduate expenses, but my graduate school education is on me! 

My education will be financed primarily with govt. loans and maybe some institutional lower interest rate loans from my school as well. 

My question is the repayment strategy - when I am finally out of school and in private practice, what is my best strategy for paying it off? I am confused when people say, ""attack the principal,"" or, ""pay off the interest first"". I calculated it out to be roughly $3,000/month on a 10 year repayment plan. If I were to choose to, could I pay, for example, $5,000/month to get rid of my debt faster, or are there consequences to that? Unfortunately, dental school students loans cannot be refinanced.

I'm a newbie and I'm interested in seeking some advice. I've never had debt in my life and this is going to be a monster to pay off. 

If people think I'm crazy for taking this much debt, just know that I choose the CHEAPEST possible dental school. One of the Ivys I was accepted asks their students to budget $460,000. Nonsense.

MachineLearning,"Essay: Which package does medium-data learning algorithm training better, H2O or Apache Spark?","Background: H2O is a major new analytics programming platform for machine learning applications using computer clusters.

Question:  Is h2o able to process datasets bigger than working memory?
 
Apparently not: 
“The join algorithm needed more than a mere 100GB to complete the task and hence failed. Given that a common rule of thumb is “3x data size” for working memory, to fail with 0.1x data size as working memory is very reasonable. Internally we refer to H2O as a fast calculator. Like R and Python it is in-memory.”
Source: http://blog.h2o.ai/2016/05/red-herring-bites/

Oh my goodness!  It’s a big nasty surprise because it means that the application code and the application developer are left to do it themselves regarding the out-of-core processing or virtualization of medium data and big data datasets.  In case you haven’t noticed, small data is not all we have to work on today.  We also have medium data, and we also have big data.  You may have heard about it (!).  Failure to virtualize out of core processing is just an inexcusable design flaw in 2016 for any newly developed analytics software packages that have high ambitions to be adopted by data scientists or machine learning application developers.  By contrast, good quality relational database servers like Oracle have been processing datasets larger than RAM easily since around 1985, and doing it well.  Yes, I said Oracle.  I said good quality because last time I checked, MySQL doesn’t do a lot of things that a good RDBMS must do. That’s OK though there’s a place for that package. The Apache web server used to be goofy like that too, but I digress.

But I imagine the protests already.  Let’s say you bring a bias against Oracle for your own reasons, whatever, because maybe you were born too late or some junk. OK let’s pretend for a moment “it’s different” which is a common way for people to verbalize that they think a comparison is unfair.  Let’s say it is indeed unfair of me to hold this against H2O designers because of some claim that we shouldn’t hold one type of server software to the same standards as another type of server software.  To be clear, I’m not buying this premise at all, because computer science has solved such out-of-core problems at least as far back as 1985, and some good application developers evidently remembered to correctly apply their CS skills to their day jobs on software packages.  But let’s go along with the bad argument anyway.  “H2O is not a database.”

Now consider the package SAS, which is centrally a data analysis and computational tool, not even a database server, which again also handles larger than RAM datasets and computations. SAS has been processing datasets larger than RAM easily since around 1985, and doing it well, and doing it so seamlessly, that the code for out-of-core analytics processing just never spills over into the application code. I don’t like SAS because it’s too expensive for little guys, but the federal government likes it well enough.  I haven’t used SAS in a long while but man, it sure did something right. SAS runs on pretty big data even with little RAM by comparison, falling back to disk storage transparently and, most importantly, terminating correctly, with a correct answer from your calculation.

R fundamentally has a working set or out of core processing problem.  Base R is designed to assume that app developers writing apps in the R language, can just go load the entire data frame into RAM all at once. You don’t get hurt by this problem on the built-in academic datasets but you sure do hit the problem fast once you move beyond the Iris and the Agewage datasets as useful as they are. Python too has a working set problem because Pandas has a working set problem, so it’s the same thing.  Pandas is the python equivalent of R’s built-in dataframe.  To work around these problems, as a data scientist you have to augment these systems with other packages or write the code yourself.  Workarounds for data of size medium and up commonly include tricks such as random subsampling, adding a good RDBMS or cute but helpful SQLite to your pipeline, using tools (toolz package) which stream the processing better in python, and even as far as partitioning your datasets by rows or by columns and then running learning algorithms on the sub-parts one at a time and combining the models back together at the end in some way such as by simple voting, simple averages or sophisticated layered machine learning ensemble techniques.  All this stuff just further complicates an already complicated application.  All I wanted to do was complete a single learning algorithm training session in the first place. But that one training session comletely crashed the computer and failed to terminate correctly before outputting the model I waited so long for.  Now I am stuck doing quite fancier things in my application code, but not even because I wanted it, or needed it, for my reproducible research results. Adding salt to the wound, I don’t even know how many of my peers are actually going to comprehend my code now, damaging the reproducibility.

  So now we are in 2016 where we sit squarely in the age of big data, virtualization, deep learning, computer vision, and web logs and social media records of hundreds of gigabytes in size being completely typical and just the tip of the iceberg.  You can’t even compete in a money-paying Kaggle competition with small data any more, because medium data is commonly the entry level of perfectly typical real world datasets.  Just a single month -- one month! -- of user comments in ascii text on Reddit is at 1.5 terabytes, and that was in May 2015, a year ago today. Yet here we go with H2O which is newly designed squarely for analytics in the age of big data, and I was really hoping to use it, yet H2O is apparently expecting users to purchase an amount of RAM that is as large as the dataset itself, or larger than it. 

That’s just not happening.  Worse, that is a losing design in our data climate. Anybody’s purchases of RAM going forward are simply not going to keep up linearly with the data size we have to process. This 1.5 terabytes of reddit comments is raw data, meaning that I have not even created term vectors yet with a few thousands of numeric dimensions that I will need to add onto it, at least.  The prospect of buying some *multiple* of 1.5 terabytes of RAM (RAM I said!) just to finish processing at all, to get a final model, is a total non-starter.  Anyway a CUDA accelerator GPU board has at most 12 Gb of RAM so I don’t get how that’s being handled if cluster-aggregate and node-level main system RAM needs to be gigantic in comparison. An Nvidia GPU with 12GB RAM is the go-to device for deep learning algorithms currently.  I would expect that if the H2O system could process 12 Gb chunks of data at at time in GPU memory -- and H2O does seem to be able to do it although I don’t know it with certainty yet -- then a similar technique as out-of-core on GPU could also be used for processing small chunks of data in main node memory and CPUs.

Didn’t today’s cutting edge package developers pass their traditional Comp Sci courses in college?  What is the deal with the current breed of scientific and numerical software package developers on the free software scene?  Don’t computer science students even get exposure to other software like SAS during their entire university experience?  Why do users have to suffer simpleton (toy) software limitations camouflaged by, and mixed in with, high powered analytical code, that doesn’t even meet the clear and present data size needs of today’s datasets and databases? To be clear, there are indeed apparently some genuine cutting edge software ideas being excellently implemented in H2O as well as R and python and some other packages. The lure of using these new packages for their great aspects, just makes it all the more frustrating.  I cannot happily and profitably spend my or my employer’s time filling in the pot-holes that have no business being in the analytics software in the first place. I have to spend my days doing data science, not computer science.  The computer science people will need to get involved.

My next assessment is Apache Spark.  I shall go check if Spark has such a big data design guffaw too. I’m hypothesizing that Spark does it right, actually.  Spark has MapReduce baked right in from the start, which is no guarantee I guess, but it’s a pretty good clue, that they expected to encounter big data.  I am no longer sure though unless I go verify it.  I received a big surprise, a big disappointment, on the H2O package, so I am going to find out what Spark does regarding out-of-core processing.  There can be no escaping or waffling when it comes to out of core processing in the age of big data.  We cannot just purchase more RAM to match our dataset one-for-one.  Data size is growing faster than our wallets, and there is no way to avoid this reality.  We have passed the singularity event of big data. There is no going back from here.  

As for me and my current Reddit natural language processing project, I cannot justify the use of H2O’s cool bits from my Spark code, if I am just going to have to add lots of complex workaround code as well, just to get my model training to complete when I call out to H2O’s machine learning routines.  I think I would just restrict my code to calling Spark’s native MLLib if that’s the case.",technology,1462979580

- 10k in savings for down payment

- 5.4k in a Roth IRA (using to contribute to down payment)


Monthly expenses / savings
- $645 rent. Includes internet and WSG(really lucky to have this low of rent)

- cellphone $75 (I can lower this by about $15)

- I am saving about 2.5k per month for my down payment
$120 per month.

- 5.5k in student loans (around 4% interest)
$115 per month. $850 on a zero interest Amazon credit card

- No car. I take public transit and company provides cost free transit card.


My house purchase price is set for 500-520k fixer upper with 5% down. I know it's not 20% which is recommended but if I figure between putting money into the house plus appreciation I can knock off the PMI in several years .

MachineLearning,What's the point of using linear input projections with LSTMs?,"What's the point of a linear input projection matrix for something like an LSTM? I.e. projecting the raw inputs (say a one-hot representation of words) to a lower-dimensional wordvec-type of representation, before it's fed into the LSTM. I'm asking because all the various gates of the LSTM do their own linear projection, and obviously any two matrix multiplies can be represented by just one (assuming dimensions agree), so what exactly is being gained?
I can identify a few possibilities. One, it's a single input projection instead of the three that would be used in the LSTM, so there's a sort of weight sharing there. Two, depending on the dimensionality of the input projection matrix, one can effectively impose additional low rank structure on the matrix that would otherwise arise in the various LSTM gates (i.e. we're saying that the mapping from raw inputs to LSTM gate must be decomposable in terms of two matrix multiplies that have low rank). And third, given that the overall problem is non-convex, then the addition of the input projection layer may change the optimization landscape.

None of the above increases the representational power of the network--in fact number two decreases it. So is that it? Or is there something that I'm missing?",technology,1462985318

Background:  

My wife and I, both 29, live in NJ in a townhouse which we rent for $1800 a month. Our current combined net income is ~$110000, but that number is subject to change soon. We have no school loans, and 2 car loans, one has about $4000, and the other closer to $18000 left in principal. Our monthly bills including my wife's paralegal courses are just about $4500. My wife has no credit card debt, and I have about $4k, with a credit limit of about $25k between 3 cards.

I have the following questions regarding the next few months as major changes are coming.  

1) What type of funds and plans can we use to start building the college fund NOW?  

2) We have the liquid assets to knock out my credit card debt now, but it would drop us to about 1 month emergency fund without pulling from the investment account, should we?

I've never been late on rent or any other big payments, etc. I also think I'm pretty good with money, so I don't anticipate having any problem paying the loan off quickly once my new job starts.

So: Would a personal loan in the amount of, say, $5k be advisable? That seems like more money than I need, but I'd rather be safe than sorry, and I certainly don't have to spend it all. Should I get this loan from the bank where I have a checking account? What sort of interest rate should I be aiming for? Is there anything else I'm not considering?

What are my other options, besides a loan? I have a $7k credit limit on my credit card... Maybe I could afford to pay less than the full statement amount for a couple of months?

My current car is a Dodge Avenger worth about 6k according to kbb. The vehicle I'm looking to buy is a 2015 dodge ram. (I really need a truck) $25-30k range 

I have $10k in savings $2500 in an emergency fund and about $600 in my checking account. 

1 more thing I should add is ill be moving out probably within a year or 2. 

I know this is a mess but I'm just looking for some feedback. 

Any and all will be greatly appreciated

personalfinance,(AUS)First real estate purchase and conflicted,"Hi all,

Bread and butter is that i'm in my early 20's and have just landed a job which pays ~70k AUD before taxes in the middle of a large city. I'm looking to secure my future and hopefully start getting some properties under my belt sooner rather than later, however the property market is (as many would know) not really friendly to first home buyers at the moment.

I'm currently weighing up my options of what to pursue first and was wondering if r/pa could give some advice.

Assuming interest rates were the same for both, would I be better:
Saving up 15% for a Mortgage on a $500,000 Studio apartment in the city for myself.

Save up 35% for a $200,000 2 bedroom house in an area interstate which I know is currently rapidly growing, and rent that out while I continue to rent and work where I currently am.

personalfinance,To Refi or not,I am thinking of refinancing my house and rolling some other debt into the mortgage. My current mortgage is 166k with mortgage insurance of about $200/mth. The house has appreciated to around 250K so I have a sizeable amount of equity. The only way to get rid of MI is to refinance which I think is a good thing to do. I can drop the interest rate to 3.5 from 4.25 and remove the MI which is basically just a waste of $200/mth. The real question is I have a second mortgage of about 16k from a new furnace/ac we had to put in a few months ago plus my remaining student loans of about 40K. Is it a bad idea to consolidate all this debt into one payment? It would help me free up about $1000/mth and dramatically reduce the rate on the student loans.,finance,1463005590

personalfinance,Refinance current mortgage or not?,"Hello PF,
  I love this sub and subscribe through another account.  Hope someone can provide a little advice.  I am embarrassed that I don't know this at my age.

  I live in Northern California just outside the bay area.  Small town that is growing super fast due to all the gentrification in Silicon Valley, City, and Eastbay.  My wife and I are ready to move but want to keep our home as more or less and investment property as it appreciate quickly this next decade.  
  Here is the rub.  Both of us make good money but neither of us came from a station in life that was financially or educationally fluent.  We have learned a great deal, mostly through mistakes including mortgaging the shit out of our current property.  
  Our current home has a HELOC.  The total debt for the primary mortgage and the HELOC are near equal to current market value.  Like I said, we don't want to dump the house but we want to move.  Our current interest rate has increased each year due to an ARM on primary.  It is going to top out at 5.75 or 6.00 this Summer.  Current interest rates are quite low again and we are considering refinancing to lock in lower interest rate and reduce the monthly cost because we want to rent it out.      
  HERE IS THE QUESTION:  I don't know if it is best to try to secure a loan for the house we want to move into first, or refinance our current home first?  I assume that by refinancing current house and combine Primary and HELOC together at a lower rate is best, but not sure if that is going to ding my credit so much that I can't search for a new loan for an extended amount of time.  Again, if we are going to rent it out, it would be best to lower the monthly and secure a lower rate so the rent can pay the mortgage but, if I seek credit and refi, how will that impact me looking for a new loan over the next 6 months? 12months?  18? etc..

Our credit scores are around 730.  We have no balance on revolving credit but do have a small loan we are paying off.  No car loans.  Other than that, our primary mortgage and HELOC our the biggest liabilities.  Have about 35K in savings that we have been working on to find a new home.  How will refinancing our current proper impact our credit and will it prevent/hinder us from trying to secure a second (small modest) home?

Thank you very much in advance!",finance,1463010977
personalfinance,Having some concern over inability to access gov't financial records at 18.,"Hi, I'll be 19 next month and have recently completed my first year of college.

After the ssa.gov link was posted today and with my parents discussing me opening my first own credit card (I'm currently listed as a user on one of their accounts and carry it with me, however) I decided to try and create the ssa.gov account and access my credit report for the first time today.

When I tried to create an ssa.gov account, after putting in the first page of information it told me records indicate I have home and auto mortgages, which I do not, however my parents do. Since I couldn't verify this information I was not allowed to create an account.

After this I annualcreditreport.com to access credit reports, which the FTC directed me to. I filled in my information and first tried the Experian report only, however it told me it was unable to access these records. I tried TransUnion next with the same results.

I'm certain my SSN is correct, have lived at the same address since I was 2 with the exception of a college dorm this past year, and have held a couple jobs over the last few years so I feel I should have records.

personalfinance,"lost control of my finances, am I back on the right track?","Hello /r/personalfinance (sorry wall of text incoming),


i am 25 years old, single, living in CA - looking for some validation that I am on the right path, and sharing my story in the hopes it helps someone else from making my mistakes.

* I currently make $1855/bi-weekly (take home pay) 
* my total expenditures **were** ~$2200/month (!!! more on this below)
* i live at home so i do not pay rent
* i currently have 2 savings accounts ~$1000 (brick+mortar bank .01% interest) ~$1000 (online bank .85% interest)
* i have a car payment with a local credit union with ~$7,200 remaining (4.24% interest, $270/month payments)
* i have a credit card with a balance of ~$9000 (22.49% APR!!)
* i have a paypal credit line with a balance of $1500 (0% APR til 8/14 on $800, and 0% APR til 10/14 on $600 ~20% APR after that)


About a year and a half ago i got a real job and started making around $60k/year, and with no rent or other major expenses I got out of control! I was living an extremely lavish lifestyle - went out for drinks often, smoked a lot of weed, took many weekend trips, attended festivals or concerts every month, etc. When out with friends i would often cover the check and ask everyone to venmo me back without actually following up with people or ensuring i was getting the full money back.

Around a year ago i spent about $6k on my CC over the course of 2 months on a ""business venture"" with a friend - we thought we had developed this awesome product and without any foresight blindly spent a considerable amount of money before realizing we had been chasing a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  Because this was my first real job i didn't really have any savings built up prior and wasn't doing any saving at the time, so this debt doesn't get paid off.

Around 4 months ago i had a major car issue which ended up costing me ~$3k, suddenly I'm in debt around $9k.

 My parents (who have no idea that I've been jerking my finances around so much) approach me about buying a house so that i can move out - they generously offer to help by giving ~15% of the down payment. I can rent out the other rooms to help cover the mortgage, build equity, and pay my parents back interest free over time. At this point i take a look at my finances and realize -  holy shit, i have really messed up.

i go back to my parents and explain all the above to them - they are obviously very disappointed but shockingly keep the offer to help me buy a house on the table, however i need to bring my debt back under control and establish some basic savings/funds before they are willing to do so (at this point i am legitimately crying, i am so lucky holy shit). In addition - because these debts were incurred while i was an adult - they will not give me any assistance in eliminating them unless my primary income is lost for reasons outside of my control. Also i have to start either paying $500/month of rent at home (to be given back when i move out, again holy shit i am lucky) or find my own place. 

So here's my plan!

* ~$4000/month - income
* ~$570/month fixed spending - car insurance/car payment/gym/life insurance/health insurance
* ~$700/month rent (i plan to move out, something my parents agree with. i have never lived outside the house, and though it may be financially stressful its also a good way to quickly learn to be self-sufficient)
* ~$1500/month debt service - i plan to amortize my paypal payments so they are paid off in 3months each, with the last payment being the month the 0% interest offer ends. the remainder of the money goes towards the CC balance
* $1000/month spending (more on this below)
* remainder into savings

This would have my debt completely paid off by next February if i follow the budget!!

So here are some lifestyle changes that i have made in the past month as well as some plans i have to help my debt payments

1. completely changed my spending attitude - this past month my spending was only $600. most of the savings came from just being smart and aware about when and where i would spend my money - no happy hour every day, no bars/clubs every weekend, less weed, etc. (note i had no less fun this last month then I've had any month previously!)
2. CASH IS KING - when going out with friends, bring cash! overnight those massive $70-$100 charges were all gone from my statement. 
3. track your spending - sounds simple i know, but just by tracking my spending it was easy to tell when i had overspent for the week, or conversely had a little extra money to go out for that drink without feeling guilty!
4. until my CC debt is paid, i have decided to stop using my CC completely. once i get back to ground zero, i'll have to be very judicious in only spending what i can pay off and keeping the card for emergencies otherwise. Credit is a great tool but not unless you use it correctly.
5.  In addition i am going to speak to my brick+mortar bank and my credit union about what options i may have for a balance transfer to a card with a lower interest rate


Finally some goals I have set for myself for the near and long term future!

1. Pay off all my debts by February of next year
2. Purchase a house by June of next year (thanks mom and dad)
3. convert those debt payments into savings investments - ideally i would like to see that $1500/month go to first establishing an emergency fund then go to $1200/month being invested into various savings opportunities with the other $300/month added to my spending balance as a reward
4. have a full established emergency savings fund and be started on an IRA/401k by December of 2017


Sorry again for the wall of text - any and all comments and advice are welcome. from browsing a little bit here, i am obviously blessed to the heavens that my parents are willing to support me in such a way, and that my debts have not yet gotten out of control - this is a wake up call for me to get my act together!",finance,1463014542

financialindependence,How has your savings rate changed over time? How have your personal circumstances affected how much you save over time?,"**TL;DR:  Tell us your story about how your savings rate has changed over time.**

Objectively, your story of financial independence is the story of your savings rate.  Very few of us are like Mr. Money Mustache, who apparently came out of the womb counting pennies.  Many of us have gone through periods when we had lots of debt, little income, or were just plain wasteful.  Some of us may have saved a bit when we were young, but didn't really crank up the savings until we learned about the FIRE community.  **So my question is  - how have your personal circumstances affected your savings rate over time.**

My story is this: I was raised in a poor household.  After college and grad school, I had some student loan debt, but managed to save about 10-15% for the early part of my career.  I got married to someone who came from a more affluent family and managed to save a bit more early in her career.  We were pretty good with our money, but I came to the realization that to maintain our lifestyles in retirement, we would have to have about 4 million in savings, and we were not on a path to do that.

I read [*The Millionaire Next Door*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door) and learned about ""prodigious accumulators of wealth"", but saving that much didn't seem realistic to me, especially with a lot of debt and being early in a lowish paying career.  (My wife and I were both in education at the time.)

Around 2013, everything changed.  Three things happened that year that shifted my perspective.  In April, I read [a Washington Post article about Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/meet-mr-money-mustache-the-man-who-retired-at-30/2013/04/26/71e3e6a8-acf3-11e2-a8b9-2a63d75b5459_story.html).  In the May, my wife and I had a baby after years of trying.  And then in October, the federal government, my employer, shut down for two weeks, making me realize my job was not secure.

After that, we went from having a savings rate in the teens to saving significantly more.  I only started calculating our savings rate this January.  For the year, our rate will be about 47%, and we will try to increase it in the future.  We bought a house in 2012 and had another baby last year, so our expenses are fairly fixed, meaning future changes to our savings rate will probably be incremental.

So I'm interested to hear from other folks.  How has your savings rate changed over time?  Has it been a gradual rise, or a sudden jump followed by incremental changes?  How has your life changed relative to your savings?  Thanks for your stories!",finance,1463057008

personalfinance,Using Margin loan for down payment on home?,"Hear me out before you bash this risky idea:

I have access to borrow at ~ 1.37% interest rate as a margin loan from a certain brokerage account.  I would like to buy a house but most of my money is tied up in various investments (I want my money to work for me).  I realize that I can very easily borrow on margin to make the down payment on the home and borrow the rest on easy 30-year fixed rate loan.  So essentially, the way I look at it:

Upside:  Home is 100% financed and I get to keep my money that I would have spent into the down payment in my investments which currently earn &gt; my margin rate.  

Downside:  The portion that is financed from margin is exposed to short term interest rates and market risk.

I will obviously make sure to have the ability to pay back the margin loan (sell off other securities and also have additional cash if necessary).

personalfinance,Credit report cleanup as I'm getting out of debt,"Hi /r/personalfinance!

&amp;nbsp;

I'm trying to figure out the best way to clean up my credit reports as I'm getting closer to paying off all of my debt.

&amp;nbsp;

Quick backstory: Had a large amount of available credit and was using it heavily while working in a low paying job which I gradually made less and less at. Wound up with about $50K in revolving debt on credit cards and after 0% promos ended was having trouble making payments. Between 2012 and 2013 I missed or was late on many payments and ended up having one card be charged off and sold to a debt collector and several others be charged off but not sold. 

&amp;nbsp;

Around July/August 2013 I did two things.:

&amp;nbsp;

**1.** Setup a payment arrangement with my two biggest cards (both with the same creditor, 150+ days late and charged off, being collected by a third party CA for the OC) for 0% interest, no fees, set payment amounts for 18 months (after 18 months this same offer was renewed for another 18 months). 

**2.** I got in touch with a non-profit Consumer Credit Counseling Service and got setup on a Debt Management Program for the rest of my debt (except for one card I was managing). They were able to negotiate with all of my creditors to waive fees and substantially cut down on interest. Had interest rates between 15% and 29.99% on all of the cards originally; on the DMP most of the interest rates are 0% or 6% or 9.9%, with one being ~17%. This allowed me to get afloat and get on track to pay everything off.

&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to today, I've paid off ~$41K so far and have around ~$9K left. The one collection account I have has a small amount of money left on it (&lt; $300) and I want to pay it off in full this week. I would love for this collection account to be taken off of my credit report, but I don't know the feasibility of it. Will they consider doing a PFD at this point when I've been paying them monthly through the DMP for ~3 years now and would be receiving the final payments in the next couple of months anyway? When I call and tell them I want to make the final payment, if I ask for them to remove the collection account from my reports when I pay it off, will they even consider that?

&amp;nbsp;

Similar question for the rest of my accounts, almost all of which have 30/60/90 and some even 120 day late payments listed on them. Any thoughts if a goodwill letter would work for these? Some are paid off and some are not at this point. For example, the payment arrangement that I setup in #1 above, just yesterday I had them cancel the remaining 3 or 4 payments and made payments in full. If I call now to ask for the letter stating it's paid in full, would they laugh at me if I ask them to remove the late payments/charge-off status from my report, or even ask for the tradeline to be removed altogether?

&amp;nbsp;

Any insight or advice would be appreciated!",finance,1463061452
personalfinance,Am I better off to double down on home loan or car loan?,"Hi.
Getting married later this year. After that is over and the dust has settled I really want to buckle down and knock out as much debt as we can so we can buy a house together hopefully sometime mid 2017. Currently I own a condo that I carry a main 30 yr mortgage and a much smaller 10 yr secure loan on. The secured loan was to finish out the 20% to avoid the PMI. Long story short but based on location no bank would approve the mortgage without the 20% end of story. I also have a car payment that will be paid off in June 2017. I do have really good credit and typically get great interest rates in case thats a factor anywhere along the lines of giving suggestions.

Question is: both the car payment and the secured loan still have a balance of roughly the same. While I do pay much more per month percentage wise into the secured loan, I pay much more overall for the car payment. We plan on selling the condo I currently own to finish paying it off and use the remainder as a down payment. Am I better off to start putting the extra money we will have towards the car payment, pay it off as fast as we can, then start squirreling that monthly payment away towards a bigger down payment?

My main concern is using the money that comes from selling the condo to pay off a secured loan and not the actual mortgage since they are from 2 different banks and didn't know if there was tax issues that might bite me in the butt over this. Or is this just completely irrational thought?

Keep your money in the Roth since the market was roughly increasing 7.5% per year. However, in recent years the market has been very poor on returns and I don't see it increasing soon. Then again, who am I to predict the future? My student loans are only unsubsidized government loans so the interest rate is 4.29%. The market has made my roth (currently holding $4000) a whopping $44 in the past year and a half, and half of that is only because of dividends. I will have $22k in student loans and I'm wondering if taking the $4000 from my roth to make a big payment on them initially makes more sense. Obviously I can't withdraw the earnings, but as I stated those are only $44...My starting salary should be in the 60-65k range depending on my employer, but I already have an offer on the table.

personalfinance,"What are the repercussions, if any, for applying for another loan, the same amount of money, to pay off a recently acquired loan due to high interest rates?","Hello,
I know the title may be a little wordy, but let me try to explain. I applied for a personal loan for $10k to consolidate my debt and pay off all my outstanding debts quicker. However, two weeks later, I found a loan for nearly half the interest rate of my newly acquired loan. Will it hurt me, look bad, etc., to apply for the lower interest rated loan and pay off my existing loan with this new loan, or should I wait a while to switch the balance over? Essentially, I want to transfer my loan to a lower interest rate loan, but I just received my $10k loan a month ago.

personalfinance,Do I consider interest on debt as compounding in the same way I consider compounding growth on an investment?,"I am trying to determine how much of my excess money I want to put towards paying off student and car loan versus putting it into savings investment. I figure if the ROI of the savings investment is expected to be higher than my debt interest rate, it is more beneficial to put it into my investment account. Part of my thought process was thinking about the compound growth benefit on the investment, but then I asked myself can I also treat my debt as having a compounding loss negating the bonus of compounding on my investment? 

Does the fact that the life of my loan is expected to be only 5 more years compared to my investment that is going to compound for 40+ years mean that the compounding growth on an extra $1000 Dollars is better put towards the investment assuming interest rates and growth were equal? I am inclined to believe it might but I am not sure if I set up my formulas correctly.

Also since I can deduct interest paid on student loans on my taxes does that mean I can calculate my effective interest rate on my student loan as a percentage less than what ever highest tax bracket I am in? (assuming I make less than the $74,000(?) needed to qualify for the deduction?) Example student loan rate is 4% and I am in the 25% tax bracket my effect student loan rate is then 3%?",finance,1463065033

We've just refinanced our mortgage of $370,000 and dropped the APR from 5.5% to 3.8%. This will save us ~$700 a month in interest. We’ve been in the house for 8 years and started with a mortgage of $430,000. 
We (me and my wife) are both maxing out our 401k plans. Contribute sporadically to an IRA. Ineligible to contribute to a HSA. We plan to work here in a high COL area for another 8 years or so, which we then plan to sell the house and move to a nice and quiet low COL area.  
My question is: With the monthly savings in the lower interest rate, should I max out my IRA or pay extra principal to build more equity in the house? With the refinanced mortgage, we are starting out at 30 years again and paying next to nothing in principal for the next few years.

personalfinance,Should I buy a $405k home without selling my current home first?,"Hey Reddit:

So I want to buy a $405k home and I have been preapproved. 
The catch is that I am going to buy it WITHOUT contingency of my current home selling. 

Some facts about my home

- My current home is worth an estimated $360 with a rock bottom sale price of $350. 

- It is going to need some money put into it shortly (roof) new retaining wall.

- I bought the home for $320 three years ago and my outstanding mortgage is $270. 

- My next door neighbor who has a SIGNIFICANTLY smaller home just sold for $340. Finishing are similar.  

- Interest Rate is 4.5%

Some facts about me

- I am 29

- My credit is 821.

- My income is $102k. Wife is $50k

- I have $70k saved. And an additional $120k in IRA and retirement accounts (not going to draw on these under nearly any circumstance.

- My total debt is very low. We drive modest cars (Cruze and Elantra) my car as no debt. My wife's has $11k. It is entirely interest free. I have NO other debt than my mortgage.

Some facts about the new home:

- It is much bigger and on the other side of my neighborhood. I don't have any dramatic property tax increases to worry about.

- it is listed for $430 but it is a relo and the relo company will take $405 as long as there are no contingencies. 

- interest on new home is 3.6% (I think)

My plan:

- buy the house for $405 and put 10% down pulling from my $70k in savings. (My mortgage company said I'd have no PMI. monthly payment on the new loan would be $2400ish Current monthly is $1700ish. Moth monthly include taxes and insurance. Savings would be at $30k

- sell my house (accept $350 rock bottom) 

- I assume it would be a sale price of $350, less 5% in fees for a collection of $330ish. 

- Pay off my old loan of $270 and have $50k left as well as my remaining $30k in savings 

- my new loan with the 10% down would be roughly 365. I would put $40k of the proceeds straight to my new mortgage. Principal the. Would be down to $325. The other $10k I didn't put to the mortgage I would use on some upgrades to the new house. My monthly mortgage at that point would be roughly $2000 all in for taxes and insurance

In the end if I do this would have a much better property with total debt of $325. And roughly $30k in savings.

If don't do it, I have my existing property with $70k saved and total debt of $270.

We live entirely off my salary. Vacations, monthly living expenses, mortgage, ROTH IRA contribution (8k a year) EVERYTHING all come from my salary. Right now we save 50% of my wife's salary and put the other 50% toward paying our mortgage faster (effectively ""saving"" all of it.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing Help,"Hi PersonalFinance. First time post here... I am hoping you all can help me clear up some questions and steer me in the right direction on my Student Loans. 

I've been out of college since December of 2010 and have been making student loan payments since June 2011. I have never had an issue making my monthly payments but after 5 years, I've found them to be a bit, tiresome. My wife and I both have good paying jobs and excellent credit. We are welcoming our first child next month and I want to get some of our finances in order beforehand. I have been receiving mail for the past year about refinancing and quietly ignored them while making monthly payments to my current loans. With the baby on the way, I'm thinking refinancing might be the way to go? Here is a breakout of my current loans:

$9,496.52/monthly payment of $94.07/3.750% Interest - Private Loan, payment satisfied in 2026

$9,779.31/monthly payment of $133.30/11% Interest (holy heck!) - Private Loan, payment satisfied in 2026

$3,776.87/monthly payment of $70.75/6.55% and 4.25% Interest - Stafford Loan payment satisfied in 2021

$8,150.86/monthly payment of $162.25 (I can't locate the interest rate) - Stafford Loan, payment satisfied unknown

This makes my total monthly payment of $460.37. Like I said before, I have never had an issue repaying this amount, it just, sucks. I looked at Citizens Bank (US) refinancing options and it looks enticing. I can refinance with them over 10 years and approximately a 5% fixed interest rate. This will save me around $100-$140 per month, bringing my payments from $460 to $327-$370. 

Is this worth doing? Are there any risks I should be made aware of? I feel like I am just blindly making payments to these scum of student loan companies and should consider other options. For years I thought I would be done in 10 years total (my final payment in 2021), but it turns out this is not the case. 

I really appreciate everyone's insights and thoughts in advance. Much appreciated.

personalfinance,Should I borrow from my 401k for a house downpayment?,"I'm considering BORROWING, not taking money out for hardship and getting hit with a tax penalty.

A little about me: I'm 28 years old and all of my expenses cost a little less than 1/3 of what I earn on a monthly basis. I typically put 50% of what I earn in to savings (I live a frugal life). I have never owned a house.

I want to know what my options are, savings accounts are a joke.

I plan on having more than enough for a down-payment within the year, but from what I understand I can contribute as much as I want from my income in to my 401k up to the amount of 18k annually.

Right now I think I'm doing 5% which is low, and I can adjust the contribution amount as often as I'd like. What's to stop me from forgoing putting money in to savings (I already have a rainy day account and my rent is paid off for quite a while) and just for the next year hit that 18k, so I can borrow 9k of it (the 50% I'm allowed to take as a loan) and and combine that with some more cash from my savings to make a down-payment?

I'm not paying taxes on that income that's going in to contribution, and between fed and state, I'm probably paying ~30% of my income in to tax. I understand I can only take 50% of my 401k contributions out as a loan, so that's 50% vs 70% but the other 50% is gonna sit there and be saved for retirement which isn't bad at all.

I understand that it's a loan from myself and I need to pay it back, but I can then lower my contribution and pay it back rather quickly while handling the mortgage. (I know this can affect my ability to get a mortgage)

Also, I don't know if contributing that much would be work in terms of getting me in to a lower tax bracket because I'm too far from 15% but that would be a positive thing if that was something I could achieve.

personalfinance,Questions/Opinions on Housing Loan Modification,"I'm sure some of you have heard of SPS (Select Portfolio Servicing). I won't bore you with a long story, but will just tell a quick one so you understand where I'm at.

I was married back in 99, bought a house, divorced, refi'd in 2005 for equity before the housing crash. Part of my settlement agreement was that the ex-wife would get 30k, but due to poor wording in the agreement, she refused to sign on a short sale I had lined up as I wasn't going to give her 30k. I took her to court, judge basically said to live with our decisions.

During the short sale process, was told not to make any more payments. This process took 5 months (no payments being made). Ultimately came down to her refusing to sign because she wasn't getting any money. Due to lack of lawyers, no verbage in our agreement about what happens in this type of situation.

So, I work with my mortgage company to get this straightened out. They come out with an agreement that I'm just now seeing after trialing its payments for 3 months.

They lowered the interest from 6.3 to 5.6 which dropped the payment quite a bit. The concerning part to me is that the interest is expected in full balloon amount on the maturity date.
""A final balloon payment of the interest bearing principal balance of $84,405.07 is due on the Maturity Date"".

I think this is absolutely terrible if I understand it correctly. I'd essentially need to take another 30 year mortgage to take care of that making this a 60 year mortgage.

More verbiage from the agreement as I dont understand it.

""Balloon notice. The amortization term of the loan is 480 months. as a result, borrower will be required to repay the entire principal balance and any accrued interest then owing on the maturity date.""

What happens if I want to sell in 10 years? I only owe 107k principal balance now. I dont understand any of this stuff.. Almost thinking it makes more sense to not accept the agreement and slowly repay the 5 months.

Am I overthinking this, or am I correct? My monthly payment before this was $905, with the agreement, it's $716. Obviously, having a little more money is nice, I'm just concerned about everything else at this point.

Another important note I just read is as follows:
the modified principle balance of the note will include all amounts and arrearages that will be past due as of the modification effective date (including unpaid and deferred interest, fees, escrow advances, and other costs, but excluding unpaid late charges, collectively, ""unpaid amounts"") less any amounts paid to the lender but not previously credited to the account associated with the note. The new principal balance of the note will be $110,645. the borrower understands that by agreeing to add the unpaid amounts to the outstanding principal the added unpaid amounts accrue interest based on the interest rate in effect under this agreement. Borrower also understands that this means the interest will now accrue on the unpaid interest that is added to the outstanding principal balance which would not happen without this agreement.

My opinion is that this is a terrible idea to accept. I just don't understand the consequences if I do and want to sell in say 7 years.",finance,1463086755

I have read over a bunch of posts regarding student loan repayment options in terms of the income driven plans.


My loans total $500,000+ composed of Direct subsidized/unsubsidized, Direct Plus, AND Subsidized/unsubsidized FFEL Stafford and Plus loans.  

I just graduated and currently I am not working. However, I will start work in July 2016. My yearly income starting July will be $50K, with the subsequent 2 years  being $52K, $55K. After 3 years, income will increase to approximately ~$200K.

Because I am not currently working, under those 4 repayment plans, it gives me the options as follows: [with $0 monthly payments for now]

* REPAYE (revised pay as you earn)(10% of discretionary income) :
projected loan forgiveness $724,526 with repayment period of 300 months.

* PAYE (pay as you earn)(10% of discretionary income) :
projected loan forgiveness $932,155 with repayment period of 240 months.

* IBR (income based repayment)(10% of discretionary income vs 15% of discretionary income if not new borrower) 
projected loan forgiveness $1,499,885 with repayment period of 300 months.

* IBR for new borrowers 
projected loan forgiveness $932,155 with repayment period of 240 months

* ICR (income contingent repayment)10% of discretionary income vs 15% of discretionary income if not new borrower) 
projected loan forgiveness $1,134,472 with repayment period of 300 months.

My FFEL loans are only eligible for IBR for new borrowers, UNLESS I consolidate. If I consolidate, I am eligible for all of the above. 

Please explain like I am 5 years old, which plan makes the most sense for my Direct sub/unsub/PLUS loans. In addition, is it cost effective for me to consolidate the FFEL loans and choose the above 4 or should I not consolidate and do the IBR for new borrowers? The more I read about it, the more similar they have begun to seem to me. I would like to make an informed decision that will affect me for the next 20-25 years of my life. I appreciate all of everyone’s input. Thank you.



edit to add: For those that are curious, I have 2 professional degrees, and undergraduate degree. 

* EDIT 2 to include more questions:
* Do I consolidate all of my federal loans (through the dept of ED) before going on a payment plan? More specifically, do I consolidate my FFEL loans separately than my Direct loans? Do I do them together? Does it matter? 

* How will these repayment plans affect me when I get married? Do certain ones make you file jointly?

* Edit 3: I copied and pasted my forgiveness values from the studentloans.gov website, which is based on my current income ($0)

* Edit 4: u/rexualchocolate suggested this www.whitecoatinvestor.com , blog which essentially talks about refinancing your loans to save upwards of 10K/year which you could put towards payment of your loans. Anyone have any opinions on this? Is refinancing the same as consolidation? I was under the impression that using 3rd party to refinance/consolidate FEDERAL loans was ill advised. Opinions?

My question is, instead of putting money in my savings account, would it be smart to pay off 1/2 or a full loan per month? I have about 10 different loans varying from $800 to $5k. Would it be dumb to drop $1k a month to pay off a couple of my loans early instead of saving up? Specifically the ones with higher interest rates. I'd love some feedback!",finance,1463094238

investing,[X-post] Interesting comment for those interested in tobacco\vaping,"[Look, I know Reddit loves to make vaping the butt if its jokes, but I'd like to be serious here for a minute.
The FDA just passed regulations that will essentially ban 99% of vapor products in the very near future. Any vapor product released after February 2007 will be banned, which is essentially all of them, save for the most rudimentary devices that are crap. Ecig technology has advanced tremendously in 9 years. I stopped smoking a few years ago thanks to vapor. Many millions of others have also stopped smoking by using ecigs.
The must infuriating thing about it, is in order to introduce a new vapor product, the manufacturer must submit it for review to the FDA, a process which could take a year or more and cost several hundred thousand to millions of dollars, and approval is not guaranteed. The problem with that, is the vapor industry is dominated by small and medium sized businesses, which do not have the kind of resources to comply with this approval process. And even if a couple do have the resources, the FDA can just say lol no after they've invested the time and money.
You know who does have the time and money to comply? Big tobacco companies. The vapor products you see in gas stations- Vuse, MarkTen, and Blu are all substandard products distributed by tobacco companies. You bet your ass they won't get pulled from shelves while all of the small vapor companies shut their doors. This regulation will destroy thousands of small businesses and jobs. A billion dollar industry dedicated to getting people to stop smoking has been snuffed out like a cigarette.
It is very plain to see that tobacco companies have bought and paid for the FDA. Why? By eliminating disruptive competition, they can keep people hooked on their smelly cancer sticks and keep the profits rolling in. The interests of big tobacco and the interests of public health are mutually exclusive.
If you smoke, know someone who smokes, or know someone who has been killed or maimed by tobacco, it's imperative that you write your members of Congress in support of HR2058, which will give vapor companies the breathing room they need to fight this overreaching abuse of power by the FDA and tobacco companies. You can also help by donating to vaping advocacy groups like CASAA or SFATA.
tl;dr- The FDA, seduced by big tobacco's money and lobbying clout, has essentially banned vaporizers; a move which could literally kill thousands and thousands more people by keeping them hooked on cigarettes. The FDA must be stopped. - OP u/jmanpc](https://np.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/4ixsad/we_get_it_you_vape/d32aywr)

personalfinance,"Outrageous TimeWarner charge got sent to collections, credit score dropped, about to apply for loans. What do I do?","Hi all,

I'll try to keep this short. 



In 2014, TimeWarner tried to charge me $90 (which I genuinely owed them) but was incredibly stupid about how they went about trying to get it from me. I was a continuing customer, paying a monthly bill, but they never bothered to call or email me about the charge, which they ended up sending to a collection agency. After being contacted by the agency, I corrected the issue with TimeWarner. Seemingly issue resolved...



Then, in the summer of 2015, I get more collections calls about the same debt. I investigate with TimeWarner, and apparently it was just an error in their system sending out the same debt. Caught it early, so no damage. 



Then today, I discover on CreditKarma that my score was hit (~800 -&gt; ~750) and I had no idea why. Turns out that TW sent that was $90 debt to another agency in February, but that agency never bothered to contact me, so it actually ended up hitting my TransUnion report. Both TW and the agency were WAY less than helpful on the phone today, and I'll have to spend some more time with them tomorrow... but it will be resolved, at least in terms of me not having to pay. 



BUT, the real issue is that I'm about to go to Law School this fall, and I'm looking down the pipe of about $50k in private student loans that I need to apply for this summer (to cover the first year). I've still got decent credit, my parents will cosign, and I'm going to a great school with almost sure prospects of landing a BigLaw gig in NY, but still I'm worried that TW's incompetency is going to cost me $$$ down the road in higher interest rates. 



**TLDR:** TimeWarner fucked up and it's completely their fault (I have recorded them admitting to 100% fault on the phone), my credit was hurt, and I'm about to apply for a significant amount of student loans


**Questions:**

 * What should I do in terms of getting this collections hit immediately removed from my credit report? 

 * How can I best communicate TW's disgusting incompetency to potential lenders?

 * Should I seek compensation for potential or realized damages?",finance,1463106331

personalfinance,Need your opinions. Ive done my research but want input,"Please excuse me if I do something wrong here, this is my first post; I've read into /personalfinance and /studentloans already. I for the most part try to follow the steps of Dave Ramsey and it has made a huge impact for me, but I would still like to know if anyone has any insight or helpful tips for my current situation...


Here is the run down: I am 29/m now, I went to a community college right out of high school and graduated with an Associates in Science, then transferred to a 4 year university and wasted a lot of time and money. I dropped out, went to doing petty work and smoking pot being a bum, I eventually stopped smoking, moved back in with my parents at 26 and obtained a job at a grocery store making a little bit of nothing and worked my way up to full time grocery leader (hourly supervisor making 11/hr), I went back to trade school for industrial electricity and went full time, while i was working full time and graduated with straight A's all the way through. Fast forward to today, I'm 29, living at home and make pretty good money ($25/hr ; 52k/r ; bring home 600-620 on a normal week), I'm hourly management (engineering/maintenance) on the track to make more each year and moving up where I am at (a company that has been around 100+ years and will prosper even in a failing economy), I put money into savings, I pay into a 401k, and put a little into a Christmas club and a savings account through where I work also. I've grown and learned to manage myself and my money; In the past year I have paid off 17k that I owed on my truck; My credit score is also great, FICO = 834, and TU and Equifax are about 785; I'm not lazy by any means and only have myself to blame for the loans I owe on now. I have about 40k in federal loans and a 38k private loan. The federal loans are about 7-10 smaller loans ranging from 1500-8000, the are on IBR and total about $150/month that is due. My private loan in fixed interest and I pay about 308/month. Needless to say this is almost a mortgage in itself. Following the Dave Ramsey plan I should pay off my smallest federal loans first, my issue with this is that a 1500 loan on IBR (stretched to 25/yr repayment plan) comes to about 5-7 dollars due a month. Paying this off will bring down my debt but isn't going to benefit me much right now, $7 a month isn't really even noticeable. I have about $7k in savings, and don't have any other credit card bills really, I pay truck insurance and for a cell phone, and groceries. I have an amazon credit card, I use it for amazon ""primeing"" items, I pay student loans with it, I do this because I earn points (its not much but still), also I use it because my debit card was used by someone online fairly recently so I don't like having it online anymore that required anymore. I never carry a balance on my credit card, and don't go wild ordering crap I don't need either. I think I'm in the small percentage of people that handle having a credit card well, even though I absolutely hate them. Does anyone have any advice for getting me where I want to be? IE 20% down on a home.. Also I have just recently received a 25k inheritance, the will said this was for a HOME and nothing else, I have no intentions of using it any other way.

Thanks for any input. Please keep rude/snide comments about student loans to yourself. Thanks again.

personalfinance,YNAB in Excel II -- Paying off Debt by the Numbers -- Aggressive Paydown vs. Minimum Payments,"As of today, we are debt free (except our monthly revolving credit cards that we pay down in full each month). It took 23 months of some serious number crunching and discipline. Here is how we did it (or TL;DR pay down debt as quickly as you can; link to revised spreadsheet at bottom of post):

Our original loans totaled **$91,719** (interest rates varied from 0% for my $20,000 salary advance to 7.65% on a student loan). 
We started out paying the minimum until we settled into our jobs (for four months). We then kicked our payments up to **$3,000** (30% of our total outflows for eight months), then **$4,000** (40% of our total outflows for three months), and eventually **$5,000** each month (50% of our total outflows for eight months). 

In the end, we paid **$95,770**, which includes only **$4,050** in interest. We overpaid our minimum payments by a total of **$64,629**. To give meaning to this number -- we could have gone on about 17 more honeymoons or had a fancy dinner every single night for about eight months straight or had our wedding three more times! Our paychecks certainly said that we “deserved” these things. We worked really hard! But unfortunately, our past selves had already spent the paychecks our present selves were depositing -- the money had just been advanced by the good old American tax payer. So we shut up about what we “deserved” and stripped down our outflows to what we truly felt was necessary for a comfortable existence. 

What did we get for all of our hard work, or, better, what did we give our future selves?

If we had made minimum payments and not rolled up payments once loans were paid off, we would not have paid off our loans until **July 2041** (we’d be in our mid-50s). We would have paid **$149,170** in total, which would include **$57,451** in interest. That is **$53,400** more than we actually paid in interest. 

If we take our minimum payments from today until July 2041, invest them and make just **5%** interest (a conservative estimate by all counts), we will have earned **$263,884** by July 2041. 

I know not everybody can pay the amounts we did towards loans and that we are very very lucky to be in the position we are in. But everyone can certainly consider where they put their money each month. Are student loans really “crushing” us, or are we choosing to spend our money on other things at the expense of our future selves? By skipping those vacations and dinners and all the other shit no one really needs, by being disciplined for just these 23 months, we have saved 300 months of our lives paying down debt. We took a **$53,400** loss and turned it into a **$263,884** profit, making a net gain of **$317,284** (or about **70 vacations**). I am not the biggest fan of Dave Ramsey, but I do like this quote of his: “If you will live like no one else, later you can live like no one else.” I certainly think we have achieved that, and I have no regrets about those 17 vacations we missed out on. I’m looking forward to the next 70. 

Below is a link to a form of the spreadsheet we use to track our expenses. I have shared it here before ([Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/31odjl/ynab_in_excel/) or Google ""YNAB in Excel""), and get emails asking for the annotated Excel file referenced in the link frequently.

personalfinance,[Housing] Semi-Monthly Mortgage Payments,"I have a mortgage with Wells Fargo at a great rate and I want to pay it off as slowly as I can.

That said, I recognize that if I can make semi-monthly mortgage payments where the early 1/2 payment is applied to the principal should reduce my interest rates without actually increasing my monthly/annual spends.

I've seen a lot online about bi-weekly payments which I'd like to avoid because I don't want to pay any more than the minimum, I'd just like to pay down principal a couple of weeks early.

Are there any mortgage lenders that offer this? My research for wells fargo allows you to set up bi-weekly payments but according to them:
 &gt;Payments made weekly, every two weeks and twice a month are treated as partial payments and may not be applied to your mortgage until full payment is received.

personalfinance,Debt debt debt and more debt..advice please,"I'm trying to dig out of debt that is brought about because my ex husband is a madman and a drug addict who wiped out all my savings and created major expenses because of the addiction.  Debt was over 100k but I'm down to 90k now...and more importantly, I haven't drowned yet.  

I am a small business owner (realty firm) and my income fluctuates.  I have made some budget crunches at the work level so that business will break even this year so that will be a wash. 

My income going forward will be from personal sales and this year it should be about 70 to 80k based on what's going on now and the fact that I've had to give up business to manage the firm.

So my worrisome debts are..60k in a credit line at payment of 807 and 40k in credit cards at 11 to 12 percent.  

I'm a new business owner (just got through the first year), and equity in the house is what's backing up the credit line of 60k.  If I sold the house it would go for 220 and debt on it is 200.  With sales costs it wouldn't leave much and rentals are about even with what I pay for my mortgage and credit line.

My mortgage is 708 and so with both mortgage and credit line loan of 807 I'm still able live in my house for about rhe same price as rent in the area.  

I have dropped health insurance (650 a month), and cut out entertainment,  therapy or anything else that helps get me through this so I'm really at the basics.

I have talked to the credit card companies about the possibility of paying a lump sum of 15k to wipe out the debt but it will show as a big stain on credit.  They also have not said they'd agree.

They have other options of lower interest payments for an 18 month period and pay it slowly...or make larger payments if I have a good month.

So my question is this...by the end of this month I will have 15k to payoff the cards because of good month of personal sales.  If I don't go with that option I can put that 15k toward the credit line and pay down the credit cards slowly, maybe at a 0 interest rate over 18 to 24 months.

I'm really leaning toward credit line reduction because it will give me a chance to have a cushion as well.  I have no savings at all right now and the income is very hard to predict.  I want to check to see if you think this is a good idea or should I do something different. 

Again, refinance isn't an option.  No parents or people to borrow large sums from.  I was the loan person prior to this mess.  

Lastly, what is your advice regarding negotiating with Chase and Capital One.  I usually had a 790 credit score and now I'm not even at 615.  I'm 1 month late and have been talking at length with them.  My credit score is horrible because I'm over capacity on my cards and now missing payment.  Can I ask them to fix that on the credit report as part of the negotiations or should I just let it go and know that it will remedy itself?

Thank you for your advice.  I'm looking forward to getting out of this mess and I'd love to get your input.",finance,1463123746

personalfinance,"40% Stock Loss Over Several Years, What to Do?","Hi all - throwaway so I can give more specific numbers not connected with my main account.

Husband has had ~$40k in an investment account which was managed by his mother until he was of age in his state to take over the account. At that time, he decided to let his mom continue taking care of it because he wasn't into learning how to deal with it, so it's a joint account with his and her names (JTWROS). MIL works with a broker, has an interest in the stock market, and does this for herself as well. I added it to my Mint account last summer to keep an eye on it for any major changes.

Yesterday, I took a closer look and realized that his entire portfolio is down a lot: down 25% since July 2015, and down 40% from buy prices. As of today, most individual stocks are down in the 30-40% range, but one is down almost 60% and another is down 85% (over $4,000 down on this one). 

My husband's immediate reaction was to contact his mom and say she's done managing this for him. I really wish she had even tipped us off on the state of this too. 

I know some of this might seem it's for /r/relationships, but here are my PF questions:

1 - Husband is considering cutting his losses and pull out of the stock market. We're not that interested in the stock market and it's not enough money to pay someone else to do it. It seems like this might be good because we avoid further losses, but bad from a tax perspective because the losses are way more than you can write off, and we would probably put it in a savings account with only a 1% interest rate. However, I'm not sure if we can remove his mom's name from the account without closing it.

2 - If we do move this money into something else worthwhile and we don't want to do it ourselves, would something like Betterment, Wealthfront, etc be a good idea? I was looking into them yesterday and they seem like they fit our needs from a simplicity, fee, and availability standpoint. We will probably want to use this money in 3-5 years as part of a house down payment.

personalfinance,[DEBT] Thoughts on a debt consolidation loan?,"Dear redditors of personal finance, I'm interested to hear your thoughts on an unsecured debt consolidation loan.  My situation is thus: I have just signed on (one month ago) to a two year job in research.  This is my first steady job and it feels great to be getting my life back together.  However in the year before this job, I made some poor financial decisions (putting rent on credit cards, not paying medical bills etc.)  I am no considering a debt consolidation loan from my credit union to 1) build credit 2) more than anything, to make the medical companies bugging me for unpaid copays go away.  Here are the specifics

Salary: I bring home ~1050 every two weeks

Expenses: Commuting costs are ~60 per month
Rent costs is ~900 (including utilities)
Food costs I try to keep low ~50 per week
I ditched my car insurance and already own my car
I am currently on deferment for student loans but in December my loan payments will go to ~200 per month (I believe, this might not be accurate and I have other repayment options and deferment possibilities up my sleeve).

The debt: ~1300 in credit that I am getting charged with interest on (700 is 12% interest and another 700 is 18% interest)
-I have ~1500 in medical related debt, some more pressing than others.  Some can set up monthly payments, but all of it just feels unmanageable since it's like 20 different collection companies trying to get 30-200 dollars from me.
-I owe a family member ~1000 and this is low priority for her but high priority for me

My credit: 631 but it is certainly not getting any better as I've had the 1300 in credit debt for the past few months.  Some of these medical bills have already hit my credit.

The loan: I was offered 2,000 at an 18% interest rate by my credit union.  I was hoping for a much lower interest rate.  The monthly payments are $91 every month for 28 months.  If I pay it back on time, no earlier and no later, I will pay ~450 total in interest.

I'm trying to figure out if this loan is worth it--in other words is paying 450 dollars over 2 years worth 1)making my disorganized mess of medical bills and debt collectors disappear by actually paying them and 2) making headway on my credit card and family debt 3) making my credit stronger via this loan (I will need loans again for school!

personalfinance,Credit Card FICO Score?,"Hey guys,

Anyone have any experience with the credit card FICO scores? Amex is telling me 714 while Citi is saying 647. Also I recently got a car loan and they gave me the interest rate of someone with a 720+ score. 

I am not sure who to trust to have the most accurate metric. 

Is it really just the difference between Experian (Amex) and Equifax (Citi)? Should I put more trust in one or the other?

personalfinance,Escrow Problems,"We have a mortgage through Navy Federal CU.  Last year when doing our 2014 taxes, I noticed that that when doing our itemized Schedule A form that only 1/2 of our annual county taxes were paid.  That week, we also got an escrow refund deposited into our checking account after they did their annual analysis.  Not surprisingly, it was within a few dollars of the missing county tax payment (from October 2013).

I called NFCU and they didn't understand what was going on since according to their records the payment was sent to the County on time, but was returned by our County with no reason given.  

They tell me they will have to research it farther.  Fine, no problem.  I call every week for a month to follow up, and nothing.  Finally a month later I get a call from NFCU.  They explained that the County had received payment from someone else for our home.  Not for the April 2014 payment, just the October 2014 payment.  NFCU contacted the County, and were told that the County could only give the servicing escrow company information, but no names.  NFCU contacted the other company and heard no response from them.  They tried again, and didn't get a response.  NFCU called the County again, and were basically told that there is nothing they can do as they show the taxes paid by someone else, and then also the payment from us.  I even called the County, and they would only tell me that it was paid.  The County had already returned the over payment back to NFCU so that is all they could do or say about it.  

So NFCU calls me to tell me that the escrow refund will be staying in our account because they received it back as a refund and legally, it has to go back into our account.  

Knowing that the error would eventually (ha!) be caught by someone else because THEIR taxes weren't getting paid (and hopefully both they, and their mortgage company were getting notice of this) that they would get in touch with NFCU and demand their money back, I put the refund into our savings account.  

A year later, and there's no word from anyone.  

Now, this year, the same thing happened!  The April 2015 tax payment was made by NFCU, but the October 2015 payment was made by someone else resulting in another refund from our escrow account in April.

Has anyone heard of this before or had it happen to you?  How long did it take to resolve itself or did it just never happen?  Any thoughts on how to fix the problem so it doesn't happen again?

Bitcoin,BigchainDB: a prime example of blockchain bullshit,"## Intro

BigchainDB is ""a scalable blockchain database"" (which falls under the category of so-called ""private"" or ""permissioned"" ""blockchains"", I believe) which was released in February 2016. It generated a lot of hype due to impressive scalability benchmarks: it was able to process a million transactions per second.

BigchainDB got a lot of praise from private blockchain enthusiasts. It entered many partnerships, e.g. with Eris Industries, Everledger, Capgemini, etc.

But BigchainDB's architecture is _fundamentally flawed_. All BigchainDB nodes, by design, connect to a single RethinkDB cluster. (RethinkDB is a distributed NoSQL database, kinda like MongoDB but better.) If something bad happens to that RethinkDB cluster, the whole blockchains goes down.

E.g. suppose one node is hijacked by an attacker and executes ""dropTable"" on the RethinkDB cluster it is connected to. All other nodes will go down because they don't have an independent storage.

I think it's a beautiful illustration to [Andreas Antonopolous's argument](https://medium.com/institute-for-the-future/bitcoin-is-the-sewer-rat-of-currencies-b89819cdf036) that private blockchains will end up less secure:

&gt;  In the end, it also lags behind in terms of security because it’s not exposed to the kind of robust peer review that an open Internet-based system has to have to survive. While bitcoin is getting stronger and stronger with security, these things will actually wither.

&gt; The idea being that intranets end up being these really insecure places where you’re running Outlook and FrontPage and old versions of Apache that haven’t been patched. Whereas on the Internet, if you’re Facebook, if you’re Google, if you’re Apple and you’re operating Internet applications, you have to be robust. You have to respond to vulnerability. You have to make systems that are antifragile, resilient to attack and they’re constantly evolving and they’ve become very robust.

I used to think that this argument is weird, but we've got a confirmation: a system which is _fundamentally_ flawed gets all the praises and people start building apps on top of it before it is thoroughly analyzed.

## Proof

You might think I'm just making this up or exaggerating. It's hard to believe that all 9 people working on BigchainDB (that's how many co-authors its whitepaper has) don't see a problem with using a single shared RethinkDB cluster. I though that maybe I'm missing something, so I asked this question in their gitter:

&gt; killerstorm @killerstorm May 01 23:03 Hey people, do you I understand it correctly that all nodes are connected to a single rethinkdb cluster? what if one of nodes will execute r.dropDb(...)?

&gt; Rodolphe Marques @r-marques May 02 12:56
@killerstorm yes all federation nodes are connected to a single rethinkdb cluster. We are working on a consensus protocol that requires a majority of the nodes to agree in any change done in the database (voting of blocks is part of that consensus protocol). For data deletion we are listening to changefeeds on the data and revert any change that should not happen. Regarding more admin tasks like table and db drops we are trying to leverage rethinkdb permissions and replication to make sure no single node is able to just drop the database (still work in progress).

&gt; killerstorm @killerstorm May 02 15:39
&gt; Sorry, I don't see how changefeed can protect against data loss. Where would data come from after it's deleted? Is there a backup?

&gt; Rodolphe Marques @r-marques May 02 15:41
&gt; backups are a planned feature. Changefeeds can be used to restore data when documents are deleted. When documents are deleted the changedfeed will return the documents that were deleted
Although changefeeds are not enough to prevent dataloss in case a node uses db drop.

So they confirmed that a single db drop can destroy this ""blockchain database"".

But they say that some time in future they will start working on securing their system. A day after I asked a question about dropDb, they added an issue: [How to lock down the RethinkDB ""admin"" account?](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/240):

&gt; @killerstorm pointed out that anyone with admin access to RethinkDB could just drop the database. What can be done to prevent that and similar things (e.g. dropping tables)?

So, basically, 8 months after they started the project and 3 months after they released it publicly they became aware that this problem exists. Wow, just wow.

## The mindset

Obviously, this isn't the only potential attack vector. It's just the simplest thing which came to my mind. There are probably _thousands_ of serious attack vectors. The fundamental issue is that RethinkDB is not Byzantine fault tolerant, it is not designed as such, it's just an ordinary database. And so if you implement a ""blockchain"" as a thin layer on top of RethinkDB you get it exposed to potential attackers.

It's hard to imagine that none of people working on BigchainDB weren't aware of the problem, that would imply that all 9 people working on it are pants-on-head stupid.

No, they know that BigchainDB isn't ""Byzantine fault tolerant"", it is mentioned in the white paper.

They just don't see a problem with it. It is a startup mindset: make an MVP, ""fake it till you make it"", generate buzz... Security is literally their last priority. They believe that they will add security after they get a lot of money from partners, investors, etc. And, meanwhile, it's just a prototype, bro.

The problem with it is that it's highly misleading. Here's what BigchainDB paper says about security:

&gt; Byzantine faults: In order to operate in a trustless network, BigchainDB incorporates
measures against malicious or unpredictable behavior of nodes in the
system. These include mechanisms for voting upon transaction and block validation.
Efforts to achieve full Byzantine tolerance are on the roadmap and will be
tested with regular security audits.

It incorporates measures, you see. Mechanisms. Business people reading this will understand that it's ""mostly secure"".

While in reality it's like not secure at all. It can be destroyed with a single line of code.

The mechanisms they are talking about are hashes and signatures. It's similar to what Bitcoin does, but by themselves hashes and signatures do not make things secure. You need to use proper architecture and protocols. After all, hashes and public key cryptography existed for almost 50 years, but we've got Bitcoin only 7 years ago.

An apt analogy for BigchainDB would be a cargo cult of a blockchain tech: it has hashes like in a real one, it has blocks, etc. There is superficial similarity. But it doesn't ""fly"" like a real one, because superficial similarity doesn't define object properties.

And BTW that 1 M tps benchmark they didn't isn't impressive: they were, basically, testing RethinkDB IO speed (as they say themselves). Yep, sure, RethinkDB is great. BigchainDB, on the other hand...

The lack of focus on security is understandable when if you take into account that there are no serious uses for ""private blockchains"" yet. People are just experimenting with stuff, doing proof-of-concepts and whatnot. Everybody understands that you aren't going to have real adversaries when you run an internal test. So these make-believe blockchains are OK.

Maybe in future this stuff will mature app. BigchainDB might become secure if RethinkDB becomes Byzantine fault tolerant, for example. But, personally, I'm rather disappointed with the ""security last"" approach and deceptive marketing.

## Disclaimer

I work in a company which might be, potentially, a BigchainDB competitor. This isn't a coincidence:  obviously, ""blockchain tech"" people review blockchain tech software.

So this post might be seen as ""shitting on your competitor"" kind of a post, I understand that. But I'm writing this on my own, in my spare time. And when I mentioned BigchainDB to my colleagues, they recommended against writing any articles.

personalfinance,[25/F] Need advice on what to do with savings account in order to make my money work for me!,"Read the sidebar, but still need some help making decisions :| I don't come from a family with money or financial know-how so I'm goin in blind! 


**Background info about me:**

* 25 years old
* No 401K at this job (I know) 
* No health insurance taken from checks cuz I’m still on my moms; this will change this coming year (ie increase in expenses to be expected). 
* Currently $12,000 in savings account that I never withdraw from
* Interviewing for new job, pay would probably be not much more than current (hoping for 50’s)
* Monthly required payments (rent, utilities, etc) total: 775; 
* Live alone, no dependents, no child support, etc. 
* Budgeting for food and gas, probably round up monthly expenses to $1000, plus $400 in loans (grand total of $1400 a month in expenses)
* no other accounts (HSA, FSA,401, etc)
* Savings account: $8500 would be for 6-month emergency fund, remaining $3500 is extra savings I’ve accrued

**Loans:**

* 1 student loan that is ~$5000 (payment: $100 a month; min. is ~$50). paying this one most aggressively, probably just going to pay it off in the next month or two. Or at least major chunk.
* A bunch of other loans ~60,000; IBR payment plan (payment: $303 which is the min payment); interest anywhere between 4-8% (I think, will double check when I'm at home)
* All federal loans; a part of PSLF 


**Actions I am considering:**

* Moving savings account from Wells Fargo to Ally (1.0% APY) or Barclays (1.05%). but I don't like that Barclays has a deposit limit
* Starting IRA account of some sort—or some other type of account (CD, maybe?) that would make my money grow/work for me at least somewhat 
* Signing up for Capital One Venture card to get travel rewards for spending—random, but just putting it out there



**Questions:**

* Would it be smart to transfer savings account (i.e. emergency fund and then some) to an *online* savings account? I’m worried about needing it in a pinch or how I would be able to deposit money to an online bank, but I love that the APY is ~1.0% for both Ally and Barclays. 
* I assume that if I did get an IRA, it would be Roth, yes? 
* Best provider to go with? I know nothing about Vanguard vs. Fidelity vs. Schwab. I have a friend who has a Roth IRA with Fidelity, but that’s about it
* Would it be smart to start a Roth IRA even though I still have lots of student loans? How does PSLF factor in? 
* Seems like I would only have a couple thousand to put into the IRA if I were to do it today. Is it even worth it?
* Is something like a CD a better option given the amount I have available after emergency fund? 






I **definitely** want to move my savings account to another savings account with higher APY. 

Iffy on IRA, CDs, or other types of accounts. Just an option I'm considering. I am absolutely fed up with the shit APY I get with my current WF savings account.

economy,Why investment crowdfunding is hot,"We all know how crowd-funding works, but the development of technology continues to bring some new inventions in finance, and it looks like investment crowd-funding might be a next big thing.

There are lots of reasons for investment crowd-funding to become something really really big:

* Security - for centuries banks where the primary source of financing new enterprises, then began a new era of angel investors and venture capital - they reduced potential risks for entrepreneurs and provided them with cash, in return they received a stake in the enterprise. Very often after an initial success they took over the company leaving the founder out of business. Investment crowdfunding is very different in this sense since the number of potential borrowers is huge it is not that easy for anyone to take over the company. It means a higher level of security for the potential founder.
* Cost effectiveness - entrepreneur is almost always winning when he is financing his enterprise through crowd-funding platforms, most of the banks seem to lose interest in small business and prefer huge corporations to them. Interest rates proposed by these banks usually also too big. Investment crowd-funding gives an entrepreneur incredible opportunities to find a very cheap source of credit.
* True alternative to a stock market investing - as we all know, almost all the companies experience their highest growth in their first three-five years, so by investing in a company at the seed phase potentially you can receive higher returns than you can get in the stock market.

What do you think about investment crowd-funding? Is it a new reliable industry, which one day can become a serious contender to a stock market, or it is just a flash in the pan?",finance,1463169461

This is going to sound familiar, and i feel dumb for bringing it up, but i need some advice.

A couple of years ago a friend came up to me and desperately needed help. He said his identity was stolen, bank accounts drained, and needed help securing a personal loan to pay his bills. He said he was working with his bank to try to recover some of his lost money but needed money to float his accounts in the meantime.

I went with him to the bank and helped him secure a $21,000 cosigned loan at a decent interest rate on a five year term. Without my help his interest rate would have been insane. He assured me that within six months he'd get his money back, pay off the loan and we'd be square. This was 2014.

Not only has any evidence of this identity theft mysteriously never materialized, but he is late with payments (7 times so far) and it's affecting my credit score. I don't need to answer calls from the bank asking where the payment is, especially when he told me that he only needed my help securing the loan. No payment necessary.

I want to extricate myself from the loan, but I'm not sure how I can without getting messy. He would need to refinance under his own name, right? We no longer work together and he doesn't take my calls or answer texts in a timely manner. I feel used and it's slowly ruining my credit score every time he makes a late payment.

Does anyone have any suggestions? The loan about 1/3 paid (balance about 14k) and I was thinking I would ask the bank myself about removing my name from the loan and letting him deal with the increased interest rate. Please help. Thanks. I'll think twice about cosigning for someone who I thought was a friend but who has only brought inconvenience to my life.

I for the most part try to follow the steps of Dave Ramsey and it has made a huge impact for me, but I would still like to know if anyone has any insight or helpful tips for my current situation...

Here is the run down: I am 29/m now, I went to a community college right out of high school and graduated with an Associates in Science, then transferred to a 4 year university and wasted a lot of time and money. I dropped out, went to doing petty work and smoking pot being a bum, I eventually stopped smoking, moved back in with my parents at 26 and obtained a job at a grocery store making a little bit of nothing and worked my way up to full time grocery leader (hourly supervisor making 11/hr), I went back to trade school for industrial electricity and went full time, while i was working full time and graduated with straight A's all the way through. Fast forward to today, I'm 29, living at home and make pretty good money ($25/hr ; 52k/r ; bring home 600-620 on a normal week), I'm hourly management (engineering/maintenance) on the track to make more each year and moving up where I am at (a company that has been around 100+ years and will prosper even in a failing economy), I put money into savings, I pay into a 401k, and put a little into a Christmas club and a savings account through where I work also. I've grown and learned to manage myself and my money; In the past year I have paid off 17k that I owed on my truck; My credit score is also great, FICO = 834, and TU and Equifax are about 785; I'm not lazy by any means and only have myself to blame for the loans I owe on now. I have about 40k in federal loans and a 38k private loan. The federal loans are about 7-10 smaller loans ranging from 1500-8000, the are on IBR and total about $150/month that is due. My private loan in fixed interest and I pay about 308/month. Needless to say this is almost a mortgage in itself. Following the Dave Ramsey plan I should pay off my smallest federal loans first, my issue with this is that a 1500 loan on IBR (stretched to 25/yr repayment plan) comes to about 5-7 dollars due a month. Paying this off will bring down my debt but isn't going to benefit me much right now, $7 a month isn't really even noticeable. I have about $7k in savings, and don't have any other credit card bills really, I pay truck insurance and for a cell phone, and groceries. I have an amazon credit card, I use it for amazon ""primeing"" items, I pay student loans with it, I do this because I earn points (its not much but still), also I use it because my debit card was used by someone online fairly recently so I don't like having it online anymore that required anymore. I never carry a balance on my credit card, and don't go wild ordering crap I don't need either. I think I'm in the small percentage of people that handle having a credit card well, even though I absolutely hate them. Does anyone have any advice for getting me where I want to be? IE 20% down on a home.. Also I have just recently received a 25k inheritance, the will said this was for a HOME and nothing else, I have no intentions of using it any other way.

personalfinance,Capital gain with (maybe) sketchy purchase.,"I bought shares in a private company (S Corp) from my dad 8 years ago. As of today the company as a whole was bought out and the proceeds are being distributed to share holders. 

The confusion on my end results in the fact that the shares weren't bought so much as ""bought"". 8 years ago I wrote a promissory note to my dad for the purchase, about $250,000. Every year he and his wife gift the IRS maximum allowed to me which I turn around and pay him on the note. In essence the shares were a gift but he did it this way to avoid a lump gift while I was in HS/college. 

Now the company is being bought and my payout will be about $350,000. The note will continue to be ""paid"" until it is satisfied. 

How should I handle the capital gains? 

Is the process I ""bought"" the shares by the same as buying the shares as normal? So essentially my capital gain is ~$100,000?

Or is my capital gain the whole amount? 

Or somewhere in between?

personalfinance,Emergency fund is now fully funded. Thinking about the next level.,"Just recently, I managed to get my emergency fund to the level of 6 months expenses.  I currently have about $1000 (post-tax) to devote to my financial goals, so, now it's time to take some further steps.  Some things on my mind are:

* Getting a credit card.  According to Credit Karma, my score is around 600, and I think I might be able to improve that by getting and responsibly using a card or two.  I plan on using it for some automatic payments and paying it off every month, just to build up a payment history.

* Aggressively paying down student loans.  I have a $135K federal consolidation loan at 5.875% interest (with a 0.25% reduction for using automatic payment, which I do).  

* Upping my deferral rate for my 401(k).  The $1k/month after taxes is about $1.5k/month before taxes, so I could either max out or come close to maxing out my contributions that way.  There is no match, unfortunately.

* Stuffing it into a Roth 401(k).  We have the option of using either traditional, Roth, or both at my work.

* Throwing wild parties with hookers and blow.  Lol, just kidding. :)

I think the credit card is practically a no-brainer at this point, since it would diversify my trade lines (currently I only have student debt) and increase my percentage of on-time payments, thus further reducing the impact of those very old late payments.  I'd want to go for a card with no annual fee, because annual fees annoy the piss out of me, and I don't care all that much about cash back or rewards points.

I'm a little paranoid about the opportunity cost of either stuffing the extra money into a traditional 401(k) or aggressively paying down student loans.  Yes, I have a 6-month emergency fund, but there have been times I was out of work for longer than that, so I've got a little financial PTSD from that.  

I should also mention I'm in my late 30s and before 4 years ago, never made more than $30k/year.  Now I make significantly more than that, but in the SF Bay Area, with its high CoL. :/  I am single with no dependants.

personalfinance,"25 yo, French, retirement funded by state, safety net ok: what now? Please discuss my plan (or lack thereof).","Hey there,

I've read through a decent number of threads here and articles on other websites, and I think I'm getting a somewhat clear picture on how to manage one's savings, but I could benefit from more precise advice as I am not a US citizen. Here is my situation:

- I am a 25 year-old Frenchman with a very secure job;

- I have a safety net;

- The State unilaterally takes part of my salary to fund my retirement (actually, to fund current retired people's pensions, but let's assume the system works in 40 years from now), so there is no 401k plan that I should contribute to;

- I don't really know what I'm saving for. I think I would like to buy accommodation in 10 years from now while also saving for an extra source of income when I retire, in 40 years. I guess it is possible to aim for both goals with stocks (by selling some of them in 10 years to fund the accommodation purchase), but from what I understand, asset allocations vary for different horizons. What do you think?

Anyway, I'm thinking about investing my savings into ETFs (I like Blackrock's ishares) but which ones, and with which allocation? There seems to be a rule of thumb stating that I should invest my age in bonds, (or a bit less), so let's say 20% in bonds: should they be government bonds or corporate bonds? In France, there is a loss and tax-free saving plan with a 1.5% interest rate. It's the safest thing out there, should I use it as the ""bond"" section of my portfolio?

Regarding the stocks, I've found different strategies somewhere I can't recall, one of which, deemed ""aggressive"", goes like this:

- large cap blend (eg, eurostoxx 50): 25%

- mid cap blend (eg, stoxx europe 600) : 20%

- small cap blend (eg, euro stoxx small): 15% 

- international markets (eg, s&amp;p500 and MSCI world): 10%

- emerging markets: 10% (I don't think I'm willing to take the risk, so I may put 20% into the international markets section)

- bonds: 15%

- cash: 5%

However, I've read in [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing) that ""for investors outside the US, it is common to recommend allocating a much small percentage to domestic stocks (20-30%)"". I do not understand why. The portfolio I've just described has 60% in european stocks, which I like because they are eligible to a tax free plan. What do you think?

personalfinance,Seeking advice on how to spend money: pay student loans aggressively or save for a down payment on a house?,"Hello,
26 years old, net $43K before the unlimited overtime I'm allowed to work at my private sector job, ~$45K in undergrad/graduate student debt, all of which is federal loans at 6.8% interest. No other debt, as I don't own a car, have kids, a mortgage, and no credit card balance. Before tuition is due for the coming semester, I have about $5400 in a savings account. 

My loans are currently in deferral, as I'm putting myself through a post-masters certificate program out of pocket while continuing to make $400/month payments so I don't fall off the payment wagon and accrue more interest. I'm interested in purchasing a place of my own one day and will need to sock away a bunch of money for a down payment. At the same time, I'm obviously interested in getting rid of my student debt ASAP. My graduate degree is in a field that I assumed would land me a public/education sector job and would, thus, qualify me for the 10 year public service loan forgiveness program. I sold my soul to the private sector and am now liable for all that money. 

Should I pay the loans more aggressively in order to get them gone faster, or should I divert that money into a savings account for an eventual down payment on a place? In addition to other living expenses, I could probably afford roughly $1K/month, but it would limit my quality of life. I don't want to miss out on the rest of my 20s because I committed the financial sin of getting an education, but I don't want to avoid responsibility either.

personalfinance,My younger sister is naive and in a ton of debt. Requesting help in budgeting and working her way out of debt.,"Hi PF,

Long story short:  My sister (age 23) is naive and believed that my parents knew what was best when advising her about schools and finances.  She is now over 100K in debt.  I found out how bad it is a few weeks ago after she attempted suicide. (She's doing okay now.)

Her situation:  She graduated in May of 2015 from the local state university. Parent's told her not to work between June 2015 and April 2015, since she was applying to graduate school for Occupational Therapy (did not get accepted anywhere).  Also, advised her only to pay her private student loans in repayment and ignore the federal loans because they will be deferred. She didn't know she had any student loans because ""parents were paying for school."" Since their credit is so poor, they had her take out a credit card for them to use.  They racked up $5K in debt on that card and are making minimum payments.

Income:  total $1200

* ~$600 part time job working in retail 15 hrs/ week at $12/hr

* ~$600 nannying for a family friend of mine.  ~10-15hrs/week @ $10/hr
Shes currently applying for another part time job and full time jobs in her field.

Expenses: 

* Private student loan 1: $3K @ 6.24% min payment $50

* Private student loan 2: $21.5K @ 6.24% min payment $190

* Private student loan 3: $12K @ 6.74% min payment $110

* Private student loan 4: $22.7K @ 8.62% min payment $230

* Private student loan 5: $12K @ 9% min payment $150

* Federal student loan: $27.3K @ 3.4-6.8% (8 loans that great lakes doesn't let her see minimum payments per loan) min payment $280.

* There are also $1100 of missed payments on the federal loans because they opened her mail and hid the forms from her.  She didn't qualify for IBR in April but now that she has a job we're going to call and see if she can be placed on that plan.

* Credit Card 1: $800 @ 14.5% min payments $30 

* Credit Card 2: $1200 @ 18%  min payments $32

* Credit Card 3: $1200 @ 24.99% min payments $60

* Credit Card 4: ~$5K @ ??% min Payments %?? (She doesn't have the log on info for this card.  Parents changed it... I found out the amount after having her pull her credit report so we could look at it)

* Medical: $80 a month for psychologist appointments

She lives at home so all other expenses are taken care of and she only have about $100 in savings.  Parents are also listed on her bank accounts so they get the bank statements in the mail.

Right now, I'm working with her to get her on a monthly budget, an other part time job and/or a full time job, and setting up a bank account that doesn't have her parents names.  I locked her credit so our parents can't take out any more cards/loans in her name.  (I had to do the same thing after her sophomore year of college because they had me be here co-signer without telling me...)

personalfinance,Need Help figuring out my Medical Debt &amp; Situation,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I need your help figuring out my situation and if I am screwed. Please bear with me as it’s a long post. 


Location: New York, USA. 


In the Fall of 2015 I was diagnosed with cancer and had many appointments with the clinic that treated me (doing surveillance), up until February 2016 where the cancer further spread and I needed 4 cycles of chemotherapy. I am happy to say treatment was a success


Now, here’s where I’m struggling. All the appointments had co-pays with them (USD 30 each) but I was never asked to pay by the people heading the desk for my visits; I assumed they would mail me a bill within a reasonable time frame (2 weeks) - that never happened. I started asking questions and talking with the billing department when around February/March 2016 I received a call from the cancer clinic’s “in-house” bill collectors asking about a single payment from October 2015. Since then, I’ve tried working with the cancer clinic’s billing department, but it’s such a struggle. I’ve been unemployed through the whole cancer diagnosis so any money I had was going to life essential services. I’ve explained to numerous people what it is that I do as a government analyst and my job prospects, and that sending me off to debt collectors is not in either party’s best interest (me for losing my ability to work, and the clinic’s for not getting pay). Since then, I’ve take steps to best work with them. During my chemotherapy treatments I had several heads/directors/and supervisors of these departments come talk with me. Again, I explained to them what it is I do and how we need to work with each other. Luckily, the patient advocacy and billing department has helped me to apply for Medicaid for 3 month back payment (Jan.-Mar.), as well as their in-house financial aid to cover since I became a patient (Sept. 2015). I am currently awaiting a reply from New York State (I was approved for straight Medicaid, we are waiting for retroactive coverage) and the cancer clinic; I assume it will be accepted, and anything left over I will pay. My problem is I am getting very worked up (and I’m trying not to) about the bills when I should focus on getting better. I mean, I even worked with a licensed social worker to talk about many things (bills included) that the cancer diagnosis did to me. 


Today (14 May 2016) I received a letter (dated 10 May) from a known debt collector agency, Security Credit Systems Inc. This is the first and it states I owe 60 dollars to the cancer institute. It also comes AFTER the department head in patient advocacy told me that the outstanding bills on my account (Sept.2015-Jan.2016) are put on hold until a Medicaid and in-house financial aid decision is made (I have an official letter stating this, too, dated 10 May). For the record, the outstanding balances are 120 for the clinical practice side, and 60 for the hospital side. There are other bills, too, but are not considered outstanding; all bills are up for financial assistance via Medicaid and the thru the cancer institute – that is what we are waiting for. Again, my plan (which I explained to cancer institute and they are in agreement) is that once Medicaid determines retroactive coverage eligibility, the cancer institute can determine in house financial assistance, and then will I pay any remaining amount. Also, I did call the patient advocate and left a voicemail about this and will not hear back until Monday.


I’m literally losing my mind over this and I don’t want to. I mean, for fuck’s sake I kicked this cancer in the ass and anything else that comes along doesn’t compare to it. But this is fucking with me because I honest to God do not want to be disqualified from ever working for the government (security clearance), or from any job (I don’t want to work in a factory beating my body up for scrap wages), or doing anything with credit. Also, what about my credit? How fucked has it become? Should I run a credit check now? If not now, then when? What if there is a hit on it? Also, can the cancer institute ""take the debt back"" - that is, I want any payments I make to go to the institute and not the collectors (I will push for this with all parties, as I despise collection agencies). 


So please /r/personalfinance, talk to me. Help me figure this out. What should I do, and how?


Thank you

investing,Are the central banks propping up oil futures and the energy sector to prevent another bubble from bursting?,"Was reading an article recently (won't post link because not sure if allowed), but basically brings up some great points. The price of oil futures rose from $26 to $40 in an oil glut purely on speculation that Doha Opec meeting would produce a freeze, but after it failed prices stayed afloat. 2 days prior, about the time the Saudi prince was stating there would be no freeze without Iran the Fed calls and emergency meeting, chairmen meet with President and VP, and other central banks chairmen fly in from all over the world. 

Since the Doha meeting any substantial news relating to oil glut is met with support and even mild rise while any shred of good news rallies beyond belief (ie a week after Doha failed a mediocre inventory draw report  for US stockpiles sends it flying $3 in one day in the global price).

Recall that during the housing bubble banks foreclosed on all the bad loans and the market tumbled. Now the problem is all these energy companies and shale companies not able to profit at these low crude prices (anything below $45) and you have another domino affect between a huge portion of the energy sector going bust, employees laid off, other sectors dependent on that sector but on a global scale.

* A few months ago, someone filed a tax return under my father and mothers social security numbers. As I understand it, my father has straightened this out with the IRS.

* Later, someone charged $3000+ on a credit card in my father's 
name. The bank did not hold him liable for these charges because they were fraudulent.

* I also was supposed to get a rebate gift card from Continental tires for buying car tires from them. It never came in the mail so I called them and they said that the card had already been activated and already used. There was a single transaction in a Home Depot that I've never been to. 

* Perhaps I'm wrong, but I can't see anyway someone would get a hold of my gift card and my father's credit card number without physically going thru our mail. 
Today, I noticed that our mailbox was wide open, but no one in the family had retrieved the mail. There were a few letters inside but also a clustering of ants around some object which I haven't checked thoroughly, but it makes me think someone opened the mailbox and may have gone through our mail today and put in some food scraps.

* Someone has vandalized our mailbox in the past but it was years ago, we also got one of our trees toilet paper'd once.

* On one occasion, my mother noticed several pieces of jewelry missing. I can't know for sure whether someone came into the house or not and took it. Nothing else was noticed missing.

* Not related to the mail situation, but to identity theft in general, I got a letter from the federal government stating that they had had some data breach and my records (clearance stuff - which basically all my personal info) were among those that were compromised. They offered no solution except to pay for credit monitoring for which I could enroll. Also at some point, both of parents have separately lost their drivers' licenses on different occasions and had to get new ones.



I don't know what to do. I am so mad right now. 
I am thinking I need a new mailbox that only has a slot for putting mail in and can be locked with a key. And maybe a security camera for our house.",finance,1463278059

My new job pays **$105K/year** and will give me $5K for relocation.  Benefits include healthcare/vision/dental, $15/month unlimited public transportation (I can't drive), unlimited vacation, stock options, and generous continuing education.  They have a 401K but no match.  I think my salary is around $60K after taxes, even after considering that Washington has no state income tax.

I have almost **$100K worth of student loans**, about $25K of which are through my credit union.  They are as follows:

Type | Principal | Interest Rate
---|---|----
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $3500 | 3.4%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2000 | 6.8%
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $4500 | 3.4%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2000 | 6.8%
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $1000 | 3.4%
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $5500 | 3.86%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2000 | 3.86%
Direct Subsidized Stafford | $5500 | 4.66%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $2000 | 4.66%
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford | $20500 | 5.84%
Direct Grad PLUS | $24040 | 6.84%

Perkins Loan | $800 | 5.00%
Perkins Loan | $800 | 5.00%
Credit Union Loan | $20000 | 4.25%

I have about $5500 worth of interest accumulated on all of the above so far.

Given that I'll be in Washington and looking for a straightforward commute downtown, what should I do to get rid of these loans as quickly as possible, outside of the obvious ""Don't blow money on stupid shit a lot"" and ""Live with roommates?""  Is it worth giving up federal protections and going to Sofi or a similar service to save money on interest?  Should I bother saving in a 401K with my debt and no company match?  Should I consolidate to make paying 16 loans easier?  Additionally, is there anything specific to Seattle that you guys can recommend in terms of getting rid of loans quickly?

Thanks!


**EDIT:  I just did the math and figured out that a federal consolidation loan will have an interest rate of 5.31%.  Seems kind of high.**",finance,1463287446
personalfinance,Help this 31-year-old get serious about his finances. Full financial profile inside,"Dear r/PersonalFinance,

Longtime lurker, first-time poster. I'm a 31-year-old male who's recently experienced some major life changes and milestones and this has encouraged me to start getting smarter about my finances. For a long time I was just spinning my wheels and not really doing much with my life (I was in and out of college for many years, finally graduating at the age of 27) but I'm in a pretty good place now and getting my financial house in order seems like the logical next step. It's a late start, but better late than never, right?

Here are some of those major life changes and milestones I mentioned:

* April 2015: Completed paying off about $26,000 in student loans
* December 2015: Financed a new car (details below)
* January 2016: Got into a serious, potentially long-term relationship
* February 2016: Went from a corporate job to a job at a startup
* June 2016: Will be moving into a new place (relocating for work)

And here's my current financial situation:

**Income** 

* Salary: $68,750
* Monthly take-home: ~$3,860

**Monthly Expenses**

* Rent starting June 2016: $1,175
* Utilities starting June 2016: ~$75
* Car payment: $419.23
* Car insurance: $76.47
* Gas starting June 2016: ~$80 (when I move I'll be a 25-minute walk from work and I plan to take advantage of that)
* Groceries: ~$200
* Phone bill: $48.20
* Spotify: $12.99
* Netflix: $8.99

Total: ~$2,100

**Assets**

* 401(k): $12,259.14
* Savings: $21,001.70 (interest rate and APY 0.01%)
* Checking: $985.51

Total: $34,246.35

**Debt**

* Car loan: $13,283.03 at 0.90% APR
* Credit cards: $180.19

Total: $13,463.22

To expand a little on why I'm suddenly so interested in improving my finances, I feel a little unsure about the startup I'm at (there's plenty of runway and it was about a 40% raise plus options, but it doesn't offer a retirement plan, and you just never know with startups) and also about the new place I'm moving into, as the rent will be double what I'm paying now. Currently I'm commuting around 2 hours each day and as I mentioned above when I move I'll be within walking distance of work, which will be awesome, but sometimes I wish I would have just stayed at my current place and sucked up the commute. That $600 will be missed. Honestly, I even question buying my new car sometimes. But we're past all of that, as they say, and the best thing I can do now is start educating myself and figure out how to make the most of my current circumstances.

Tentatively, here's what I plan to do to start getting my financial house in order:

1. Create a budget and start tracking my spending
2. Roll over my 401(k) into an IRA (as mentioned above, my new employer doesn't offer a retirement plan)
3. Move savings into a higher-yield savings account
4. Look into increasing my withholding allowances (currently 0)

Beyond that, I'm not sure what I should be doing to set myself up for a better (financial) future. Quite honestly, I'm not even sure how to go about 1-4 above. How much should I be saving? What's practical as far as spending money? What's the best kind of an IRA for someone like me? What all do I need to consider before increasing my withholding allowances? And so on, and so on. What advice can you guys offer?

I should note that I'd like to start taking guitar lessons and traveling more (1-2 trips a year).

Thanks,

personalfinance,"Is my plan financially sound? (Moving Out, 18yo)","Hi r/pf, I've been thinking of moving away from my parents for quite some time now, and I need to make sure I'm doing this right. I really appreciate it.

My moving goal would be near September or late October at the latest.

I applied for FAFSA and I only qualify for direct federal loans, my folks make near 100k, so I'm guessing this would be unsubsidized Stafford loans? I know when I move out I won't be able to put my parents' tax info for future FAFSAs.

I'll be attending a community college (approximately 10k, 2 years) and transferring to Stony Brook for computer science (approximately the same as the community college, BUT I'd need to rent an apartment in NYC since an hour and 45 minute commute is too far and dorming would ramp it up to 40k in 2 years) 

I'll be living in a friend's house, so rent/utilities and food costs will not be a concern for the first 2 years. 

I don't even have a driver's permit, so I plan on walking (college is a 15 minute drive) and saving up for a bike ($700 at most maybe?) 

Never worked before, but I have $300 and it could potentially turn into $400 - $600+ since I plan on selling my videogames.
I'll be smuggling clothing and backpack to friend's house, I do not wish to contact my parents about the move so I wouldn't really own anything else 



**So my plan is...**

* Get a job hopefully 20 hours+. 20 hours of minimum wage would get me about 8,400k after taxes, of course above 20 hours would be ideal

* Get my legal documents, might cost me some if I need to replace. 

* Possibly get a second job and apply for scholarships and try to get side income as best as I can

* Take out near max-max Stafford loans to pay for the first year of community college and hope the 1st job earnings pay for the second year 

* I *need* health insurance (no dental), so that'd be from 300-400 a month, $3600-$4800 a year. I'm hoping I can qualify for Medicare though

* Save up for necessities like the bike, a phone, a cheap laptop

* Get a credit card and hope I can build good enough credit to take out private (hopefully deferred) loans for Stony Brook, apartment rent is around $500 a month, may need to use bus transportation

* Job pays at least 60k out of college, so I'm obviously hoping I can find one to pay those loans off



Is this possible to achieve?


Note: I have not talked to my school counselor about this yet, I'm unsure what advice she'd give but I'm not counting on qualifying on independency status on FAFSA, nor am I going to the military or getting married.

 I could seek a homeless shelter to qualify for homelessness, and just eat at my friend's house or food banks, but it seems like too much of a hassle

personalfinance,College Planning,"Hello, Personal Finance!

I realize this is a tough question because, in the next 15 years, a lot could change about education. Can tuition really keep skyrocketing like this? How will access to student loans change? Will I just pay to download a degree to my kids' brains (only half kidding). But, reasonably controlling for these variables, what is the school of thought on where tuition will be when my kids are entering college, and how much should I be saving monthly? 529s have some tax advantages, but how can I hedge my bets and diversify in the event that they get scholarships or do not attend college?

&amp;nbsp;


**The Basics**


* My daughter will be 4 later this year. Let's assume she goes to college in the fall of 2030.

 
* My son is 2. Let's assume he goes to college in 2032.


* I have been contributing $250 per month per child to my state (SC) 529 plan (directly - no advisor). I currently have $12,698.55 for my daughter and $8,404.29 for my son. I also have $3,844.05 in a Fidelity 529 for my daughter (not actively contributing - this balance came from a rewards credit card).


* I have been contributing $500/mo to a taxable brokerage for saving as well, but also have added additional funds that were not necessarily intended for school. The balance in that is currently $21,103.61.


* My wife and I do not expect any windfalls from inheritance, etc. We would love to give our kids the gift of entering the workforce without student debt, but do not have rich parents, aunts, uncles, etc that will be sweeping in as a surprise benefactor.


* I am in a high income tax bracket. I believe any contributions to the state 529 is an immediate tax savings of 7% (rate in SC), although admittedly, I am not positive on this. I should know, but I'm not aware of how Federal taxes are affected with 529 contributions.

&amp;nbsp;


**Questions**


Any advice, no matter how formal or specific, is welcome. However, if anyone is feeling ambitious, my specific questions are...


* How would my contribution rates need to change for 3 scenarios: in-state college, out of state public college, or private college?


* Is my strategy (basically $500 per kid per month with half going to 529 and half going to brokerage) reasonable, both for total amount and split between education-specific accounts and non-education accounts?


* For savings placed in non-education accounts, what funds might you recommend?


Any and all comments welcome - thank you for taking the time to read and to help me plan for my kids!

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans while still in school?,"Howdy.

25-year-old male here, got some questions about my financial situation. (I've never posted here, so I do apologize if I'm doing something wrong.)

Because of major flip-flopping, taking a year off, and other silliness, I'm on track to get an eight-year bachelor's degree. 


My debt stats:

$36,000 in federal loans. $23,000 subsidized, $13,000 unsubsidized at 6.8% apr.

$15,000 private loan, first through a bank, then transferred to another institution (by them, not me). 7.24% apr.

$4,000 on a single credit card, accumulated over the past 5 years. I've finagled it to zero interest until next year and I'm now paying aggressively on it, trying to knock it out or at least reduce it substantially before student debt comes due.

Speaking of, as I'm rushing to write this on mobile, I haven't been able to find when I'll have to start making payments. The private loan site says my deferral period ended this month, but it also says my current and next payments due are $0. The federal site is a nightmare that looks like it hasn't changed since 2002 and information about payments due wasn't immediately visible.


Other financial info:

I share an apartment with my girlfriend and am responsible for 1/2 rent and utilities ($800 a month total, my share being $400), other expenses fairly normal (food, gas, etc). No medical bills, no car payment, nothing like that.

I work full time, making less than I'd like. ~$18,000 a year before taxes. I'm looking for more money. Have had a few interviews, no luck.

My credit is decent, just shy of 700. Main negative is the age of my credit, evidently.

Turns out the federal government isn't keen on financing this much schooling for one degree, and it looks like I'm approaching the federal loan limit and I'll need an additional $4,000-$6,000 from another source to finish my degree.

I've also apparently been awarded six times the lifetime limit for the Pell Grant, which is alarming. Not sure if I'm going to be penalized for that; there's no option to refuse it, either through the FAFSA or through my school. 


TL;DR

$51,000 in debt for college. I'm looking to acquire the $6,000 more I need to finish, consolidate my loans, lower my interest, and hopefully defer payments another year. How do I go about doing those things?

I'd also love to hear /r/personalfinance's thoughts, suggestions, and general comments on my situation. I'll answer questions as I can.

I’m 22 years old and have just graduated from college, I’ve got a decent paying job and a large sum of student loans to pay off, I’ve been active in maintaining a budget and keeping track of my money for the past ~4 years, so that’s nothing new to me. I’m looking for feedback on what I plan on doing, mainly on the aspects of paying of my loans and savings. So here’s what I have::
--
**Income / Inflow**
--
-	Once I start my job I will be making **~$4040** / mo. after taxes, paid bi-monthly

**Expenses / Outflow (per month)**
--
-	Main payment is for student loans, I currently have **~$80,000** in student debt to pay off, ranging from %3.5 – %7.5 interest rates, hoping in the next few months to possibly refinance for lower rates, currently I’m hoping to pay them off in ~4 years
-	**$2,000** in student loan payments
-	Apartment costs (including utilities) **~$657**
-	Food/Fuel/misc. **~$580**
-	Car Ins. / Rent Ins. **~$43**
-      Subscriptions **~$8**
-	401(k) **~$223** (Employer matches %100 up to %4 of salary, so this is to meet that cutoff)

**Total / mo. = $3,511**

**Savings / Other**
--
-	Savings account **$500** (Currently hold a BoA account, looking to switch to Ally for my savings)

**Total Budgeted / mo. = $4,011**

So that’s my current plan, any extra I get each month I plan on throwing towards my loans. I have no other debt, and I was hoping to get rid of them as quickly as possible, however if there are better options I’m open for suggestions.

personalfinance,Can I afford This House?,"**Current Budget**

Take Home: $6,200/mo (After 401K, taxes, etc.)

Expenses X-Mortgage: $1,850

Current Home's Mortgage: $870 (including taxes/insurance/escrow/etc.)

Current Remaining: $3,700/mo

No debt except the current mortgage

I do not plan to sell my current home as rent goes for $1,300/mo. After rental fees would net me $325/mo all of which would go into a fund for this houses maintenance/upkeep. The occupancy rate for rentals is very high and there are very few available. Average annual days a home is not rented is 15-30 (off 12 month leases).

**edit**My current home is worth an estimated $130-140K. I owe about $110K on this mortgage. The new home has an estimated $300K purchase price. If I sold I could expect 15-18K to ""walk away"" with.

I currently have about 10% of the purchase price available for a down payment. I would still have an emergency fund.

**Projected Budget Buying With Current Funds - 10% down**

Take Home + Rent: $7,500

Expenses: $2,400 (assuming larger utility bills and property management fees)

Mortgages: $2,000 + $870

Remaining: $2,200/mo.

**Other Option - 401K Borrowing**

Borrow from the 401K to get to 20% lowering the new mortgage to $1,600/mo. It would ""save"" me $400 a month and leave $2,600/mo. However I would be dumping all or most of the remaining back into the 401K to repay the loan as fast as possible (expecting to complete in 10-16 months).

*****

Ideally I just save for 6-8 months and know there will always be homes for sale I could fall in love with. What ""scares"" me is interest rates go up and/or home prices continue to skyrocket in this area (They've increased 20-30% over the last 12-18 months) and there is a massive shortage of homes for sale - They usually only last about 3-7 days on the market, especially in the desirable areas.

personalfinance,Savings account for down payment/mortgage,"Hi all,

My wife and I are currently saving for a house. We plan to make a purchase sometime in early 2017. Right now our down payment funds are commingled with the rest of our savings, but I would like to get a separate account that I can directly deposit our house fund into monthly. We've never bought before, so we're relatively unfamiliar with the mortgage process. So what's the best place to set up this savings account? I know for car loans certain banks will give you a lower interest rate if you have an account with them, and I was wondering if anyone is familiar with something like this for mortgages? Or is it just better to find the highest yielding account and not worry about which institution it's at?",finance,1463404000
personalfinance,[Planning] Saving up to buy a house,"Hey guys and gals,

I'm in a little bit of a weird place as I look ahead. Basically, I feel like I'm doing everything right: earning money, putting money into a retirement account, and not spending too much money. Great! But... what now? When I search around for the next steps they seem to be missing, like they should come naturally after you get your savings on track. But while I know my options, I don't feel like I know what my next steps are.

Things you might need to know about me to give advice:

 * 23 years old, graduated almost exactly 1 year ago, started working fresh out of college
 * Earning $84,000 per year, have some stock options vesting over time (but have no real desire to excercise until I know they're worth something - yes I understand the tax implications of this)
 * Contributing 10% of paycheck (~$700 per month, no matching) to ROTH 401(k) as of January 1st, just throwing it all at Vanguard Admiral Shares fund
 * $1,000 per month (for the time being, at least) goes into a Barclays Dream Account (just opened recently)
 * $25,000 available money in Chase checking and savings (so lower interest rates, thinking about moving that) (I don't count the Barclays account as ""available"" money)
 * $4,500 in a Robinhood account, with half in riskier assets (for entertainment and educational purposes) and half in more stable assets
 * Monthly expenses (food, rent, etc.) are just under $3,000 per month, but I'm still figuring out what things I need (example: I visited my parents recently; who knew a suitcase might be a good thing to own?) so this fluctuates a bit but is trending down. Basically I'm averaging saving around $1,000 per month (when I figured that out is when I opened that Barclays account)
 * No debt
 * I live with my girlfriend of more than 4 years (so yes, there's a big expense brewing, though not in the foreseeable future). We keep our accounts separate, so for simplicity I think it's easier if we just consider my side of the equation

As far as I can tell, I've put myself in a good position for future success. But the next big thing, and almost certainly the biggest single expense of my life, would be buying a house. Currently I live in the Bay Area so buying a house is a pipe dream until I have a lot more money in the bank, but with my girlfriend graduating in some number of years (she's a graduate student) there's a good chance we'd move as she finds a job (in all probability a place with a lower cost of living). So I'm thinking we should save money for the next 4-5 years so we can afford a house when she's done with school. But what's the way to go about doing this?

People say to max out your 401(k) and then open an IRA with the extra cash! Well, sure, but I imagine to buy a house at some point in the near future I require money in the bank, which I won't have if it's all going into retirement accounts. 

People say to invest in stocks/bonds/their new business venture! I'd be fine putting some of my money into something riskier like that, but this seems like something I should be very risk-averse about. Basically, with a shorter-term goal of earning money over ~5 years, this seems like the most volatile strategy and I don't know if that's a good thing. 

People say to put that money into a high interest rate savings account or a CD! Sure, but that loses to inflation. It might be worth switching off Chase (but... locations as numerous as Starbucks... and those sweet credit card rewards...), but this doesn't seem like a very efficient strategy. A CD also loses to inflation and you have to go to 5 years to get 2% from what I've seen. I also don't think the interet rate difference is enough to justify it over the ability to have the money on hand with a savings account. 

Basically, none of these sound like they're the obvious choice.

I've talked to my parents but they'll always take the super conservative approach to money (aka ""keep earning money because that's where most of your money comes from, and if you want to put it in a better interest rate account I guess you could put effort into that"") so I thought I'd ping the internet for some opinions. 

Thanks and Happy Monday!

personalfinance,"Selling one house, buying another. Advice on using the money?","I'm selling my home of five years, which I purchased as a foreclosure.  Fortunately the market has improved drastically and I am fortunate enough to enjoy a decent windfall from this sale.  After paying realtors' fees, I'm going to be left with around $50,000 cash, give or take $2k.  I am closing on a new home as well at the same time.  The house price is $213,000 and I'm using a 203K home improvement loan (3.75% interest) to do around $25,000 worth of improvements as well (finishing the third floor as a master suite and adding a two car detached garage).  This will make the total purchase price around $238,000.

Since this 203K loan is FHA, there will be PMI regardless of if I put 5% (~$12k) down or 20% (!$48k).  I'm only planning on keeping the FHA loan for a year at the most before re-financing to conventional so PMI will go away at that point.

I have about $4000 in cash of my own, and $15,000 in credit card debt ($10,000 at ~10% interest and $5000 at 0% interest until October).  Any other debt is negligible and of a lower interest rate than the house.  When I refinance I need to make sure that I hit the 20% LTV mark on the conventional loan so that I can avoid PMI for the long term.  I will need around $6000-8000 to make some other immediate purchases/upgrades (converting a pantry into ½ bath &amp; laundry, plus appliances) for the house right now.  And within the next year or so I would like to redo the kitchen; it’s stuck in the mid 50’s, has no dishwasher, and a range that’s on its last leg.  I’m thinking about doing this one of three ways and would like to hear some opinions.

**Basic money info:**

* $50,000 house sale money

* $4,000 cash on hand

* -$12,000 5% down payment

* -$15,000 credit card debt

* -$7000 immediate house fixes/upgrades

**1)**	Low risk, low reward.  Keep the credit card debt, keep the cash.  Re-finance the house in ~6 months once the basic upgrades are done and we have it looking nice.  Some of the upgrades/fixes will boost the appraisal value of the home, and I can fill in the rest of the equity line with the remaining cash from my home sale in order to hit the 20% LTV mark and then avoid PMI in the future.  It’s safe, but it will have me paying credit card interest for at least the next few months.  Any leftover money once the house has been re-financed can be put on the credit card debt.

**2)**	Medium risk, medium reward.  Pay off the credit cards now.  This frees up around $300 from mandatory monthly payments (I’ve been paying $200-300 extra per month to catch up).  That extra couple of hundred dollars per month can go toward a future upgrade fund.  Extra cash can fix any immediate unexpected issues and be put toward the loan once I re-finance to hit 20% LTV. 

**3)**	High risk, high reward.  Pay off the credit cards now, do the half bath/laundry upgrade and use remaining money to upgrade the kitchen (likely $15,000-20,000).  The kitchen is attached to what will become the laundry room/half bath, the cost of doing that room would go down slightly since the contractors would already be on site and have any plumbing/wiring changes in mind as they are working.  When I refinance the house, the equity built up by doing the kitchen now would factor largely toward hitting my 20% LTV rate.  I would also have the extra money from credit card payments left over that could be used to build more of an emergency fund, and pay down other debts.

I work at small company and nobody is in my situation and hr is kinda lost too on what i should do. 

Basically problem started when i got my first paycheck, 35% of it was taken away into taxes. 

Google research revealed i must do w4 form properly. So what number of allowances should i put for Allowances requested. 

Many people suggested i should put down 0 or 1 given i'm single, work 1 job, etc. 

However some suggested i use https://www.irs.gov/individuals/irs-withholding-calculator

from which i get ""5"" withholdings.

**this is what i put in this calculator**:

 - Single 
 - Dependent: No

**General Information**:

 - number of jobs : 1
 - no longer employed : uncheck
 - tax-defered...plan this year : uncheck
 - cafetaria plan : uncheck 
 - scholarship or grant : uncheck 
 - number of dependents : 0 
 - not 65 and not blind

child care credit : 0

child credit : 0

other credit : 0

**NEXT SECTION**

**gross income** : 48000 - now my income is around 70 but since i started this month i'd not make 70 this year but 48k instead. So i expect to recieve this much. Correct?

**Bonuses** : 0

**Tax withheld so far** : 584 - ive gotten 1 check.

**Federal tax withhold Last salary** : 584 - again i had one salary so far.

**frequency of being paid** : bi-weekly

**date closest to when you first held this job in 2016** : may 1

**date closest to when this job will end in 2016**: december 31 ? i guess why would it end? 

**non wage income**:
 - all zeroes

**Adjustment:** 
 - all zeroes even though i paid tution.

**Deductions**
 - all zeroes

**RESULTS**

Now Here is **the problem**

Based on the information  ...  anticipated income tax for 2016 is $5,190. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $9,928 withheld for 2016 resulting in an overpayment of $4,738 when you file your return. If you want your withholding to more closely match your anticipated tax, adjust your withholding on a new Form W-4 as follows:

For the only job you entered (which has a projected salary of $48,000): 5 allowances.
Check the “Single” box on your Form W-4

Assuming this recommendation is in effect for the rest of 2016 your expected refund should be about $525. Following this recommendation will ensure that the amount withheld from your wages will cover all of your projected tax liability while minimizing your refund. 

**Questions**:

 - Should i put 5? when people have told me to put 1. Also 5 for both state and federal?
 - why would my refund be $525 when i have 10K!!! in overpayment
 - gross salary is my annual official salary or salary ill get this year, i started in may. so ill work and get paid for 8 months, 4 months less.
 - should i go to accountant, where? i live in nyc. I definitely not want To pay over $100 for this to be sorted out.

right now, i have about 22,000 in credit card debt and 2500 in medical bills. i have tried looking for a part time job, but i have to have open availability for my full time job and where i live, a night job hasn't been an option. not only do they all seem to be snatched up, but we are a small town with not many 24-hour places. I keep trying and looking, though, and will continue to. I am on a debt management plan with all but one credit card. I pay 474 dollars a month toward this, which has lowered my monthly payments and interest rates, however I cannot afford these payments. it's too much.

my car is paid off, luckily. 

i have recently looked into chapter 7 and was going to meet with an attorney today about a free consultation for it. now i am having cold feet about showing up. i do not have family to ask for help and probably would not anyway.

i have read many threads about people letting their accounts go into collections and then negotiating down, but they all seemed to have much higher paying jobs and lower debt than i do. right now, i have no cushion or emergency fund. i am literally living paycheck to paycheck again. i do not want to do that. i want to go back to school as well, eventually, but that would mean having to take a cut in hours at work and I cannot afford to do that. my finances are as follows:

rent :950 a month,

electricity/water: 180 a month,

phone bill: 78 a month. i have negotiated this down, believe it or not. i live on an island and most cell phone companies have 0 service here, my options are very limited., 

cancelled cable, had to keep internet for work: 60 a month,

gas: 200 a month,

car insurance: 72 a month,

food: 250 a month,

prescriptions - 100 a month,

i have a 401k i borrowed from (without penalty, borrowed against myself) to pay down some of this debt, so i get 60 taken out of my paycheck each week to pay that back while still making 6% contributions matched by my employer. my checks are about 500 a week after all insurance, taxes, contributions and the 401k loan is taken out.  i live in an expensive area, and i have done all i can to cut finances. i only grocery shop sales, i haven't bought any new clothes, etc, sold what i could on ebay (didn't have much, what got me into this to begin with), i do not drink or smoke and my social life has been nearly non existent both due to work and because i don't want to pay to go out.

i can manage money, i did for a while. i just got in a hole and i am having trouble getting myself out. the good thing right now is the only thing in collections is the medical bill, i have closed all my cards with the DMP, and am current as of right now, however I overdraw my account every month to pay my rent on time and often times have to pay bills late because of it, which eats into any savings I try to put away.

what is the best way to go about getting out of this debt? my landlord wants to do a lease purchase next year and I am not interested, so I will need to find something else, but if I can save up can I combat bad credit/a  bankruptcy keeping me from renting a place with upfront rent for extra months?

The rewards programs on these are a joke, and usually I just use any accrued points to get an account credit since I never collect enough points to actually redeem anything worthwhile.

personalfinance,Past Due Tax Question(s),"**TLDR;** Three years of unfiled tax returns and unpaid taxes being dealt with and want to make sure I'm going about it correctly per questions 1-4.

Hi r/personalfinance,

Over the past year I've been lurking around this thread and it's inspired me to start thinking long term about my finances. Long story short-ish, upon graduating college a few years ago I got a job in my field filing as a 1099. Being young, stupid and irresponsible I spent every penny I earned and set aside nothing for taxes. The end of the year came and went, no angry letters from the IRS. The next year I switched jobs, another 1099 and continued my bad habits. The company I worked for luckily switched us to full time employees the following year, but I of course rationalized continuing to not file a return that year with ""well, I'm already paying taxes."" I also managed to rack up about 15k worth of CC debt during this time and lived paycheck to paycheck like a rockstar.



Fast forward to today, I have an awesome job and an amazing girlfriend that I plan on proposing to this year. She also helped break my tax-phobia and helped me file my 2013 return and each year since. I also decided last year to get control of my finances and have reduced my CC debt to 2.8k with plans of paying it off in full by August of this year. Unfortunately however, even though I have yet to be contacted by the IRS I still have this significant tax issue to resolve and wanted to get some advice before proceeding.



**2010** - 1099 - $27500 GI - Unfiled/Unpaid

**2011** - 1099 - $15000 GI - Unfiled/Unpaid (I also worked at a restaurant during this time and probably made an additional 5k~, but am in the process of attempting to request a W2 prior to filing)

**2012** - W2 - $30000 GI - Late Filed/Partially Paid (IE 2.7k taken per W2 for fed)



I never had any investments, student debt, etc, so my AGI has been identical to my GI per my 1099s/W2's.



I've spent the past month gathering all of my previous financial documents and have all but my 1099 from 2010 (unfortunately the organization no longer exists and all attempts to contact former co-workers have been dead ends) and a W2 from 2011. I've attempted contacting the IRS a few times over the past week but of course have been met with hours of busy signals due to the time of the year. My first goal is to get my two returns filed and start making payments, but I want to make sure I'm doing it the right way so I had a few questions after spending the past few weeks searching /r/personalfinance and other online resources.



**1)** I noticed that you can apply for a payment plan with the IRS for payments and was able to set up an account which prompted me to list how much I owe and start the payments. I assume I need to speak with the IRS and get a formal plan worked out prior to doing this, or can I just sign up and start making payments after my returns are filed?

**2)** I know there are late fees for both a return being late (5%/month up to 25%) and late payments (.5%/month up to 25%) along with interest. Does this mean any unpaid taxes I owe (since they are all long enough ago to be at the maximum penalty length) will have an additional 50% late fee + however much the interest fee is?

**3)** Given that I'm unable to contact the organization that I had a 1099 with, is there any other way to request this information or can I just file a 1040 with my AGI (which I do know based on old bank records)?

**4)** As a reality check - I feel comfortable handling this primarily myself (IE not hiring a lawyer/accountant) and feel this will save me $1000+ that I can put towards taxes instead of services. Am I just being a stubborn fool or is this something that a regular joe such as myself can navigate without going to jail in a few years?

personalfinance,Closing costs when refinancing a mortgage.,"Hi r/personalfinance, I hope my question is appropriate for this sub.  I bought a home last year with 20% down and a 30 year fixed rate loan at 4.125% interest.  My fiance and I can make extra payments comfortably every month with a schedule of paying off the loan in 15 years. Current 15 year fixed interest rates are very attractive (received a GFE at 2.75% interest), so overall we would save over $50K in interest after 15 years, so the decision to refinance is pretty clear.  My question is around the closing costs of the new loan.  The broker we are working with quoted as at $6K to close (everything is itemized). The house is in NY, $330K remaining balance on the current loan, and our current mortgage allows for a CEMA (service fee of $1,495).  Is $6K in the ballpark for the closing costs for a mortgage refinance?",finance,1463433368

personalfinance,Graduated 3 years ago but have just barely started making payments on my ~$30k in student loans -- is consolidation a good option for me?,"Hi all,

I hope this is the right place for this.  I got my BA about 3 years ago and promptly went on the income-based repayment plan since I was just barely above the poverty line for my city (SF Bay Area) and was also doubly afraid of having to start dealing with my loans.  

Anyway, now I've got a much better-paying job (as in, I have $100-300 bucks left over each month after bills and rent and groceries -- so not a lot, but better than I was doing before).  I'm also less afraid of dealing with my loans and want to tackle them head-on now.  I finally started paying them back in October 2015.

I want to consolidate because it seems like the easiest and best option for me -- however, I don't entirely trust my loan servicer (Great Lakes) to give me an unbiased assessment of how I should handle this.  I thought I'd be able to get some sharper and more objective advice here.  I've paid off about $1000 in the past 6 months, but all of it has gone to interest.  I can't pay more than a couple hundred a month right now since I'm saving up to move to a city/state that isn't so outrageously expensive.

Thank you in advance.  I appreciate it and I'm looking forward to delving more into the world of consolidation, lol.  It seems great, personally, but I fear that my loans are almost too ""old"" for it to be worth it for me since it would kinda reset the clock on some of them.

Pasted below is my loan info, but please pleeeease let me know if there's something I'm missing or if anyone needs more details.  I'm looking forward to figuring this out -- my parents don't know much about this kind of stuff, and most of my friends either didn't take out loans or make far more than me and don't worry about their payment schedules as much as I do.

1. *discovery &amp; conflict-of-interest:* Besides the main UTMA account, I don't actually know how much I have, nor do I know the quantities or institutions. Is there a way for me to find out without my father knowing that I'm digging around? If I call his accountant for information, does his fiduciary duty require him to notify my father? (He also files my taxes, so technically I am also a client... but I'm not sure if the services are paid from my account or if my father covers it).

2. *taxes:* I anticipate that I will be in the 25% tax bracket next year. If I receive my UTMA and/or other assets, will that be counted as income, thereby increasing my tax rate? Or do I just need to pay capital gains tax for the UTMA specifically?

3. *financial aid:* If/when I go to law school, will my higher net worth by virtue of UTMA funds affect my ability to receive federal financial aid? I would have received them the year prior (i.e. 2016 instead of 2017 or 2018 when I actually go to law school), not sure if that changes anything.

4. *suing my father:* I was informed by Merrill Lynch that while my father is legally obligated to transfer my UTMA when I request it, since I am above age of majority, he needs to fill out and sign a form in order for the transfer to be initiated. I do not believe he will do this voluntarily. In such a case that I decide to take advantage of my legal rights... what type of lawyer should I hire? I work at a trust/estate law firm, should I just talk to my boss?

**Background:**

My life situation in brief: I was accepted at pretty good law schools with partial scholarships, but parents refuse to help me fund the rest, and I don't really want to take on that much debt. My plan is to work for a year or two, retake the LSAT after more serious study, and hopefully either go to a good law school with a larger scholarship or if another opportunity presents itself, so be it.

On to the fun part: My parents do not support my decision (for various reasons). They will cut all funding if I pursue that path, which I will. I have asked numerous people in all walks of life for advice, trying to be as unbiased as possible--I have unanimously been told that I am making the right choice and my parents are being excessively controlling.

I can definitely fund myself for a couple of years with my savings + money earned working, so no problem--but my parents will be furious and I imagine this is going to lead to a multi-year conflict between us. I know I have a decent amount of money that my father has been investing in his company under my name, as well as a UTMA account, and possibly other assets that ""belong"" to me but I have no knowledge of. It may be in my best interest to claim them, especially in order to offset a potential future educational loan.",finance,1463445717

Recently my parents told me that my grandmother has saved up $10,000 cash for me while I was growing up. She's worked cash jobs ever since living in the states (babysitting/dog watching), so my parents decided to keep all the money in a safety deposit box. 

I am wondering if...

1) Is there any tax implications if I was to deposit $10k into my bank account and use it to make a large payment?

2) What is the best way to apply that cash to my loans?
2a) In addition to the 10k in cash, I am planning on using ~5k of my own savings (so 15k total)
2b) Is it possible to specifically isolate which loan to make a payment for? If so.. should I pay off the 7%? and then continue to the 6% loans?

I have both public and private loans and am paying them back via Great Lakes. I am paid ahead $4,472 on my private loans (technically don't have to make a payment until 12/2017.

personalfinance,I'm purchasing a home for my undocumented father with his 401K fund. Will he get taxed if he pays for the down payment for a house under my name?,"This is a bit of a complicated story, so I apologize for the biography. I don't have too much experience in investment, home purchases, or retirement funds, so I come to you in hope of a solution.

My father is undocumented but still has a 401K fund set up with his ITIN number.  He is 52 years old with only $12,056.63 in his 401K.  If he works until he is 65 assuming a 3% annual growth on his total current balance, the future value is $17,705.57.  I figured we could probably have a higher rate of return if he purchased a property here in CA.  Obviously $8,439 ($12k minus 30% from taxes and early withdrawal fees) is not enough to buy a property, but it is enough to provide a down payment.  The values of homes in this particular area have been increasing steadily for the last 3 years, so I don't want to wait any longer as waiting will ultimately decrease our return.  

I am currently a college student in California who is married with a combined family annual income of around $50,000. Any extra income could jeopardize my financial aid awards and scholarships so I couldn't have my father withdraw the money and gift it to me. I want to finance the home (~ $220K) since I have a valid SSN, but have my father fund the downpayment. Now here is where it gets complicated.  The company managing the 401K is automatically withholding 20% for federal taxes for the lump sum withdrawal.  

So here are my questions:

Since my dad is technically not purchasing the property, but putting up the down payment for it, is the withdrawal taxable as income? (I read somewhere that purchasing a property is a tax exemption/ write off).",finance,1463463337

After doing some more digging it turns out that my current APR is at 5.98%, with me still owing 11.6k.

As it stands right now, if I throw about half of all of my bonuses at the loan and keep making my normal payments I can have the loan cut significantly (18 months instead of the 32 remaining) which, regardless on the consensus here I will still do.

One suggestion on my last post really interested me about looking to refinance to lower my interest rate and continue to make my normal payments to get it paid off quicker with less interest, and I would add in the half of every bonus to my loan. My question is, would it be worth looking to refinance my loan to accomplish this a bit faster and while spending less on interest? I just want to know if there might be some reason unknown to me that this would be a bad idea.

I am really happy here, I want to be here, and I want to stay, so I would like to figure out a raise structure or plan for us to implement so I can be of more validated use."" (something verrrrryy close to that) He was totally cool, said that I have met expectations and exceeded, and the amount chosen for my position was due to them juggling 4 different people in my position that were not capable of performing, but that they want to better utilize me and he will come up with a written plan around a raise and cross training opportunities for me to fill people's positions while they are out/help in understaffed areas. It was a quick, calm and completely understanding conversation. Thank you all for the awesome suggestions and support.",finance,1463494808
personalfinance,5 years of studying in Germany. My detailed expenses [data],"Hello reddit! Since I moved out I started monitoring all my expenses. Not because I struggled with money or someone told me to. It's because I like numbers and I like looking back at the data. Maybe some of you might be interested as well or want to compare stuff. I am curious! *(None of my friends does something similar)*

I try to explain my circumstances and what and how I monitored and then show the data.

&amp;nbsp;

**My background:**

I grew up in a small family with my single mom and my sister. My sister moved out to attend university just as I did, but she left 2 years earlier.

I was born in 1991, finished school at 18, attended university at 19. I am currently 25 and will leave university with my MSc at 26.

&amp;nbsp;

**The time:**

I finished school in 08/2010 (13 years, in Germany you get the ""Abitur"" - you need it to attend universities). I joined the german military ""Deutsche Bundeswehr"" for the following year. 6 month were mandatory back then, I extended the time to 12 month because I ~~wanted more money~~ love my country. Because I had an accident and needed my knee to be fixed, I left early in 08/2011 and attended Technische Universität Darmstadt (TUD) in 10/2011.

It took me 7 semesters to get my Bachelors degree and I am currently in my third of 5 planned Masters semesters.

I always lived in the city center where I can reach everything with my bike in a few minutes. I lived in a 1-room-apartment for the first year in Darmstadt. The following 4 years I lived in 2 different shared apartments with other students.

&amp;nbsp;

**My income:**

First and easiest you get child support (~150€/m) for your kids until the age of 25. My mother paid some insurances for me but gave the rest to me since I moved out and paid for everything myself.

Ever since my parents got a divorce my father pays alimony for me and my sister (another ~150€/m).

In Germany there is a ""federal student financial aid"" (BAföG), let's call it FFS. You can get financial aid, if your parent don't make that much money or have high expenses = many kids. And the amount varies for that matter. You can get up to ~700€/m or nothing, depending on your parents' financial situation. You only have to pay back 50% of what you got, some years after you finished your degree.
It is a lot of paperwork you have to do once a year but it is definitely worth it. You can get FFS for your standard period of study (6 semesters Bachelor, 4 semesters Master), not longer. Important to mention: you are also not allowed to earn much money yourself or it will be deducted from your FFS. Such a job called ""Mini Job"" where you earn a maximum of 400€/m, later 450€/m. Mini Jobs are tax-free.

My mother changed jobs during that time and went from *low-paying-job* to *no-paying-job* to *high-paying-job*. Therefore the FFS amount varied each year. The first year was 650€/m^FUCKYEAH! but it went down to 300€/m the following year and was 150€ after that :/

I worked at a research lab since day one of my time in Darmstadt. Nothing special, had nothing to do with my field of study, but it was an easy and okay job. I typed stuff, carried stuff, copied stuff, did whatever came up. I worked 10h/w and stayed under the 400€/m mark.

After I got my BSc. I started working in a start-up IT company in Darmstadt in 10/2015. I work 20h/w now and earn too much to get child support, alimony or FFS - that all stops now. But I get paid enough to be on my own for the first time (1,1k/m with taxes). That's why 20h/w is okay to handle since I can afford it to study an extra semester or two.

in summary:

* 150€/m child support 
* 150€/m alimony
* 150 to 650€/m FFS
* 400€/m job

and later:

* 1100€/m new job

&amp;nbsp;

**My expenses:**

I keep every bill of everything I spend money on for a month. If I didn't get one (splitting the bill with someone, paying something on the way,..) I keep a little TXT file on my smartphone where I can quickly add the amount.

I split my expenses in 11 categories (described below). If i buy items of different categories (e.g. buy food and drugstore stuff at the supermarkt), I split the items into two bills so they don't get mixed up.

If a bill does not fit a single category, I split it up: E.g. if I go out to eat in a restaurant, the bill goes 50/50 into ""Food"" and ""Going out"". If I take my GF out for coffee it goes 33/33/33 into ""Food"", ""Going out"" and ""Gifts"" (but that is the most detailed it will ever get).

**1 Rent:** ""cold"" rent with no utilities

**2 Utilities:** water, electricity, internet, mobile phone, other apartment utility fees

**3 Food:** includes non-alcoholic drinks

**4 Going out:** clubs, ""going out"" to eat/drink, alcohol

**5 Clothing:** socks mostly

**6 University:** Tuition Fees? nope. *Hooray Germany!* You only have to pay ~250€/semester but that is for some paperwork and a local-transport-ticket. With it you can take every bus, tram or train in quite a big area around Darmstadt (e.g. I can reach Frankfurt and move around other university cities). I never had to buy any books (we can download everything) and I can print 50 pages/m for free.

**7 Purchases:** kind of vage category. Everything I *buy for myself* like games, furniture, something for the apartment,..

**8 Drugstore:** cleaning and washing supply

**9 Other:** stuff/services that don't fit anywhere else. E.g. Transportation, medicine, ..

**10 Gifts**

**11 Insurances:** since I got a real job in 10/2015 I have to pay health insurance myself (I was covered by my mother's insurance before)

personalfinance,Parents can't afford my parent plus loan,"Hello all,

About five years ago I took out a parent plus loan to pay for my first year of private university after transferring in from a junior college.

The loan was for about 40k and covered me first year. Obviously, looking back, I would have gone to a different school but I was younger and an idiot and my parents didn't help by going along with it and being fine with the loan.

I knew it was a lot of money so after my first year was done, I offered to transfer out to a state school because I didn't want this loan to become an issue. My parents insisted I stay at the private school and I did.

Fast forward about five years, my parents haven't paid down any principal of the loan. As I understand it, my dad has only paid the interest.

Now, a large chuck of my dads tax return was held back by the Feds to pay for part of this loan. I don't understand how or why it came to that because like I said, as far as I understood he had been paying interest on it.

My parents are not financially smart people at all. They take home about 120k a year and we live paycheck to paycheck. In the previous year, I had to give my dad about $10k to pay for our property taxes because they were over due.

I know I sound like a brat pissing on my parents financial literacy when I coerced them into a 40k loan but I still can't help but feel so pissed off. It seems like every year since I've graduated my family has needed a large chuck of money from me and I can never establish myself.

I've been working about two years full time since graduating and still live at home. I've been feeling depressed lately because of my living situation and this has only worsened it.

Sorry for garbage, I mostly just need to vent, but what do you guys suggest I do?

Obviously I need to sit down with them and figure out the details of what's going on with my loan but is there anyone versed with these parent plus loans that can offer any advice? I feel dumb because I should know this loan inside out.

For the record, I took one parent plus loan that first year of private school. The rest of the way I paid out of pocket or was through my FAFSA loans, which I am paying back now.

tldr;
parents took parent plus loan they can't afford
five years later want to put it on me

personalfinance,Budgeting and I need help,"My wife and I recently moved into our first place together. We both work full-time making decent money. However after taking off for the wedding/honeymoon, we are left without the funds for our next rent payment. We have two credit cards and will use them to pay our rent for next month. (after that we will be working and have enough money to sustain) one credit card has a $500 limit with a 17% interest rate the other is a 500 limit with 0% interest.

personalfinance,Is a 42% effective tax rate unusually high?,"Hi everyone,

My husband and I are 1099 employees. My federal return showed an AGI of $61,469 and taxable income of $40,869. We are able to deduct mortgage interest, student loan interest, property taxes, and home office. We owe $17,131 in federal taxes and our effective tax rate is 42%

Our state return shows same AGI but a taxable income of $46,469. We owe the state $2,851 and our effective tax rate is 6%. 

Our effective tax rates for 2014 were 45% federal/6% state. We had an accountant prepare this for us and he basically said that it's high because we're 1099. I was speaking with some other 1099s in my office who said they were hovering in the 31% range so now I'm concerned that something isn't right. 

Thanks for any/all advice! Also, big thanks to this sub for helping me pay off $10k in credit card debt last year.",finance,1463499331
personalfinance,Received an IRS notice for 2014 tax year: What should I expect?,"I received a notice of proposed changes to my 2014 1040. Specifically, there was a total of $7,248 not claimed on my federal tax return. I'm pretty certain I screwed it up, so not looking for feedback there...

However - I'm trying to understand what I should expect.

SITUATION:
I was the beneficiary of a traditional IRA from my mother that I rolled over into a new trad IRA account. The total was $7,248. This was all completed in 2014, including the distribution of said lump sum of $7,248. I will be filling out a form 5498 and submitting to the IRS - but what should I expect?

Is the contribution to a trad IRA tax deductible? I know the distribution will be taxed at the income level I had in 2014, but not sure how else this will impact what the IRS is proposing: an additional amount due of $2,104. 

Thanks for any detail that might help me better understand. And can add more color as needed.",finance,1463500546

personalfinance,Should I keep our car? Or sell it to downgrade and start tackling other debts?,"We currently owe just shy of $18k on our car. The car is only worth $12-13k according to KBB. It's a 2010 that we bought used. Yes, we were stupid, but we can't change the past. We had/have atrocious credit. Our rate on the car was about 19% (so stupid), we refinanced it down to 15% (better, but still stupid). For the record, I proudly drive a 20 year old, low-mileage, and well-maintained car.

My wife drives the car in question and she was dead set on not getting rid of it. I laid off it and she's come around, and all on her own she told me that she would be okay to get rid of the car if I thought it was for the best.

Our minimum payment is $451, We're going to start paying $1,000+/month toward the car. If we stick to that, we'll owe less than the car is worth by December of this year. I'd like to try to do closer to $1,300/month which would have us up on the car by October.

By those respective amounts and months, we would have paid $1,119.57-$748.99 in interest. If we continue those payments to payoff, we would pay another $1,092.79-$855.45 ($1,000/mo vs $1,3000/mo) in interest.

So, to make things simple, assuming I can stick to $1,300/month. Is it worth the hassle to sell a car, that we do like, for a gain of $855 to buy something in the $2-3k range to get us by until our other debts are paid off? We would still have to save the money to buy a new used car, which would take some additional time.

Or, if we like the car, should we stick to those payments and pay the car off? Which we could have done as early as September, 2017?

The $855 in savings doesn't make me SUPER excited to get rid of it. But, I'm not sure how to factor in the savings on my 2 student loans that I would be able to start paying off sooner if the car payment was gone.

**Private Student Loan** - $13k @ 10% interest Applied once annually? (currently defaulted and in judgement, considering saving a lump sum and trying to settle for half.)

**Federal Student Loan** - $10k @ 5.8%(I think)

Paying the car in full a this rate and then applying those payments to the student loans after that has us debt free within 3 years. I haven't done the math on selling the car, as it's harder for me to get the definitive numbers for that situation.",finance,1463501126
financialindependence,New job doubled my income...confused on trying to set up a path to FIRE.,"Hello there,

So I am 24 and I recently just signed a contract with a new employer and will be starting next Monday. To be honest I have never had money in my life and up until this point was struggling to get out of debt.

Current profile looks like this:

Student Loans : 30,500 (varying interest rate from 4 - 6.8%)
Credit Card : 6,000 (0% APR until May 2017)
Rent: 1,250 (reality its 1584 but my gf pays for difference + utilities)
Car : 150
Insurance : 100
Phone : 115

My gf and I split expenses so I am just going to mention my portion because the car/insurance is technically hers but since I drive the car also I help pay for it in the interim. 

New job:

Base : 100,000/year 
Bonus : Up to 20% (depending on company performance)
401K : Matches up to 3% (100%)
IT Stipend : 100/mo (Not sure what i can use this for as of yet tbh)
Gym : 50/mo (Dont go to a gym currently but hey if they pay for it why not)
Health INsurance : 150/mo

The new job has some cool perks that I think should allow me to save money quicker than most. First off, I work from home. I dont ever have to go into an office (hence the reason why my gf and I share one car) unless I am traveling to a client site. Secondly, I will be traveling about 9 months out of the year to different client sites (which should allow me to save more money because whilst I am traveling I dont have to pay for food, travel, hotel, entertainment etc...)

However, from my calculations it will still take me at least 15 months to pay off all my debt. It is only until  that point (I will be turning about 26 then) that my net worth will finally be ZERO (not as glamorous as most people on here). I dont have any emergency funds because I had little to no budgeting experience until I came onto this subreddit.

My question is...once I finally pay off my debts and get a 3 month emergency fund...what would be the best* (I know this is an obscure term) method for me to achieve FI? My father is stressing about the importance of owning a house before anything or getting into real-estate and I see alot of users on here talking about how they own 3 or 4 units by the time they're 28 (have no idea how they can afford that lol) 

I live in a relatively tax friendly state (FL) so I dont have a state tax but i live in South FLorida where real estate prices are the highest they have been in a while so I am hesitant to purchase anything while prices are so high. Is it a viable option for me to wait until the next housing slump to purchase a property?

I know priority #1 after setting up emergency funds/paying off debt is to max out 401k/IRA but after that I am kind of lost in how to properly take advantage of my income so I can achieve FI asap. I should also mention I dont worry about RE as of now because I genuinely enjoy what i do (I know this could change but for now I love it). 

Apologies if my post is all over the place and asking a bunch of vague questions but it seems like I am getting a bunch of differing advice from family members and am unsure what is the best route to take. 

Some people say just put all your extra money into a Vanguard index fund and just rent...others say there is nothing better than owning properties...hope you guys can give me some advice/clarification on what you think is best.

Thanks for the help.",finance,1463501563

I need to refinance ~$73,000 in student loan debt in a mixture of Parent Plus and Student loans.  When I went to school, my parents took out loans to cover my schooling with the agreement that I would pay them off after graduation.  No big deal.  I can do that just fine and I am able to make my payments, no problem.  It doesn't leave much after debt payments and my expenses, but that's a different issue.  Well, my parent's have decided they want to fund their retirement by buying rental properties.  They've done this some in the past, mostly before I was in school.  Now that they're really ramping this up, they're having trouble getting the necessary funding due to their debt ratio being too high.  

So, I am going to refinance the Parent Plus loans (plus one small loan of my own) into one loan that is in my name.  I realize I will lose deferment options if I do this but I don't have much choice at this point.  My plan is to go with the provider that offers the lowest monthly payment, with the lowest interest rate and take the amount that I'm saving and put it into an emergency fund.  That way, if I lose my job, I can make the payments on the loan without going into default.  Once I have a comfortable cushion, I can return to paying off the loan more at a time. I do not intend to actually pay the loan over the whole refinanced time.",finance,1463509986

Savings: A 2.5% APR with 75% of bitcoins remaining stagnant in the account.
Credit: Either with no credit or a $500 bond, you can have a One Bitcoin credit line (the bitcoin credit line stays the same as the day you received it).  1,2, or 3 bitcoin loan will be available in the future. Interest rates would vary daily but the interest rate will stay the same stay the same as the day you bought it as well as with the credit.

I had not planned on using my entire savings (17,000.00), but it looks like I will need to in order to secure the loan.  I'm already going to be ahead on the house, The purchase price is 169,900 and it appraised for 189,900, with my down-payment my lender has informed me I will be able to avoid mortgage insurance. It is a traditional Mortgage at a 4.25% interest rate. The total loan amount is 152,000.00~


I have very minimal credit card debt. Currently 1200.00 on a 0% APR card that i typically pay off monthly, however I have not yet paid it off due to not being sure what my closing costs were going to be, but I also have minimal amounts of credit, roughly 5,000.00 total available. I also owe about $16,000.00 on a new car i purchased last year.

I have nothing to live on so to speak and will obviously need to purchase furniture, bedding, housewares, towels... etc. Its actually kind of daunting from a monetary standpoint. I had initially planned on using the rest of my savings to furnish it, but my closing costs are about $6,000.00 more than i expected.

The new house is roughly 2,000 miles away from where i currently live and nothing i own is worth the cost to move it that far. 

With the move, I will also be starting a new job in June, making roughly double of what i am making currently going from 47,000 to 104,000.  With the large salary increase coming, would I be in trouble putting things on my cards carrying a balance? I have never carried a balance before until this month.

I imagine there's going to be a few dicey weeks between closing and the first day i get paid from my new job, and things like furniture needs to be purchased utilities will need to be paid, and I'm concerned that with all the new bills/etc that I may find myself in a hole i'm not quite able to get out of in 1 month.

I feel like with my salary increase and my relatively minimal debt... I should be okay? My immediate thought was to pay off my credit card and replenish my savings account asap, but I still need a bed... and things for people to sit on.

personalfinance,I need $30k of dental work done. Not sure how to best pay for it or even if I can...,"So I hit the genetic lottery and my prize was a horrendously fucked up mouth. Total costs will likely exceed that $30k amount honestly. I have Delta Dental insurance but it will only cover a tiny, insignificant fraction of that. 

**Current Situation**

* 25 year old mechanical engineer making $51.5k in the midwest
* $23k in student loan debt from undergrad. Pay $300/month towards this. Could easily pay more but I'm building up savings. 
* Roughly $15k in the bank currently. 
* Monthly expenses (everything included) are roughly 50% of my income. 

**Options I see**

* Put entire cost on Care Credit at suggestion of dental office. Interest rates are fucking insane though. 

* Get work done by students at local university at about half the cost (so I've been told. No official quote yet). This would have to wait until school is back in session in August. 

* Dental tourism AKA get the work done in a much cheaper country such as Costa Rica or Mexico. Not something I put a lot of faith in but hey, not ruling anything out. 

* Use more student loans. I have no idea if this is viable. I've been debating going to grad school (for reasons completely unrelated to this) and I had the thought that I could just take out a ton of extra loans and use them to pay off Care Credit. Yes, I know student loans can't be forgiven or cleared by bankruptcy but the interest rates are a fraction of Care Credit. So far I've had zero issues making SL payments and I personally believe they are very fair and lenient compared to private loans. I take out a bunch of student loans, some go directly to the school and I get the remainder in the form of a check that I use for paying off Care Credit. This is a little out there but its an option I'm willing to entertain. 

**Additional things**

* There is not a *huge* rush on getting the work done but the state of my mouth currently wreaks havoc on my self esteem and self confidence. Its very embarrassing and I'd like to get it done quickly. 

* I have zero desire to purchase a house/car/other-ticket-item in the near future (5 years) so I'm not really saving up for anything like that. 

* I'm terrified the cost of this will cripple me financially for a very long time. I despise feeling trapped and debt is a great way of ensuring I feel trapped. 

* Fuck the cost of dental/medical care in the US. Its insane.

personalfinance,How to pay for Grad School? (MS in Optical Sciences at the University of Arizona),"So, I wasn't on the ball like I should have been when I accepted UA's offer of admission, and I waited until my finals were over to start applying for scholarships and financial aid. All of the internal scholarships have been awarded, and most of the external scholarships are for P.H. D candidates only. I have around 6k saved up and no debt, but I was hoping to land a scholarship for graduate school. Now that almost every scholarship listed on the school's website has already been awarded, I'm more concerned with the most responsible way to pay for school. UA's cost calculator says that out of state tuition is 30k annually and that other expenses bring the anticipated cost up to almost 50k annually.

I live in AL and my university isn't one that allows for out-of-state tuition to be waived. I will not be working while I go to school, as I have already accepted a conditional offer to work for the DOD approx. 10-12 months from now. I am only planning on going to school full-time for 2 semesters and then coming back to AL to work full time. Once I am employed and enrolled in the distance program, school will be free and I will be earning approx. 60k annual salary + govt. benefits.

My only ideas are to look for Intelligence Community scholarships (that is the field I'll be working in in late spring 2017), or to find some fancy way to get out of state tuition waived. I applied for FAFSA and they said that I am eligible for:
""Direct Stafford Loan Estimate - $20,500.00
You may also be eligible to receive other federal, state, or institutional grants, scholarships, and/or work-study.""

I also thought to ask for special consideration, out of state waivers, negotiate with my future employer to start my tuition reimbursement early, etc. but they all said no.

My undergrad major was Electrical Engineering, graduated from University of Alabama in Huntsville, GPA 3.42, GRE was 94th percentile verbal and 75th quantitative, have some really good community service, eagle scout, president of UAH's society of optics students, bilingual/polyglot (English, Portuguese, and working proficiency in German), IEEE honors society. I am also a white, male, age 23. Anyway, I'm just trying to pull a hail mary to avoid massive debt and was thinking that if anyone could help it was r/personalfinance.

Also want to send a shout out to r/personalFIANCE where I accidentally posted this first.

personalfinance,Getting a lower interest rate by paying yourself through paypal? Essentially a payday loan with 3% interest?,"I know that this isn't fiscally responsible by any means, but I'm trying to find a way that this might be a bad decision for anyone in a situation where they can't pay their credit card statement off in full (but expect to be able to the following month), and would thereby incur interest charges (usually at around 30%).  Paypal only charges a 2.9% fee to accept a credit card payment plus $.30.  

Aside from the obvious issue of overspending and robbing Peter to pay Paul, and keeping it from becoming a habit, is there another issue that anyone can see with swiping their card for say, the  $200 they'd be short on their bill and paying the 2.9% on that instead of the 30% interest charge on the full balance of $4500?  Obviously the next month's bill would carry the additional $200 plus the paypal fee, but let's assume that could be paid off with an expected bonus or overtime?

financialindependence,[Investor Psychology/Life Skill] Don't Jump From Dogma to Dogma.,"Length : 949 Words.
Reading Time : ~3min30 (at 275 words per minute).

Today I wanna talk about a massive mental ""bug"" that many of us fall victim to, which is accepting too many things that 'experts' say as dogma without thinking enough for ourselves. 

It happened to be sparked by reading https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/3k4foc/new_look_at_safe_withdrawal_rates/ and the comments, but honestly this kind of bias towards dogmatic thinking is everywhere in life and learning to guard myself against it has helped me in immeasurable ways. 

In personal finance specifically I think it helps a ton because 1) a lot of guys make money from making other people think a certain way and 2) investing is a very inexact science.

____________________________________________________________________________________

Oftentimes when people are deciding on strategies to improve their life, they usually follow one of two strategies :


1) What most of the population is doing. Most of the population is very mediocre, so while this can be the right approach in very basic level decisions (e.g. looking on both sides of the street before you cross), following their strategy will in many situations cost you a lot.


Most of the population for example has absolutely zero clue on even the first step of building a net worth, which is to stop spending money on frivolous things so you actually have something to invest.


2) Following well-recognized content creators for that topic, for example Mr Money Mustache for Financial Independence, as well as the common wisdom on forums/subreddits.


THE PROBLEM :
While Approach 2 is much better than Approach 1, where the vast majority of people make a mistake is when they start to believe that everything in that school of thought is absolute truth and just accept it as gospel. That's probably not a good approach, because just because someone is better than you at something doesn't mean that they know everything about it. 


These experts usually know a lot more than the average person, but they're not necessarily the purveyors of absolute truth. They're just people who spent a lot of time researching things and coming to conclusions, but sometimes they miss important things, or there's a logic error between the evidence and the conclusions, or many other things that lead to a false/incomplete conclusion. 


Example : Safe Withdrawal Rate calculations are usually based on a mix of bonds and a US-centric (e.g. S&amp;P 500) index fund. But is that necessarily an optimal portfolio allocation ? There are many questions you can ask yourself playing Devil's Advocate :


-Why invest only in US stocks ? Wouldn't it be more diversified to invest in more countries ? Is there anything that makes US stocks a better value buy than other countries's stocks ?


-Why large caps (in the case of an S&amp;P 500 index fund ?) ? Are they necessarily more safe in the long run ? Why only stocks ?


-(WARNING : I'm going to commit what seems to be blasphemy to many people) Essentially, is it really true that an individual investor can't beat what is often defined as ""the market"" (which is really... a US-centric large cap index fund) in terms of portfolio allocation for their specific goals ? 

If you had an emotional ""of course you can't beat the market"" reaction to the first sentence, that's exactly what I'm talking about. 

Why do we even define ""the market"" as the S&amp;P 500 ? (Again, is the entire market well represented by *500 large cap companies from a single country???* )


-What if your specific situation/knowledge gave you investments (for example building your own business) that weren't particularly correlated with that benchmark, and also could outperform it significantly on average ?

-etc.


I think what happens here is almost religious thought, as in, our ""caveman brains"" want the world to be perfectly explainable and so we subscribe to the first model/worldview that seems like an upgrade from an older model and accept everything in it as dogma. 


This is super dangerous, because every time this happens and we don't notice it, we seem to be engulfed in it (it's probably the same error that leads to massive cults or people whose political opinions are entirely shaped by the party they are supporting).


I find it interesting that even among the more intellectually curious of us we have this natural bias to jump from dogma to dogma.


SOLUTION :
As with every mental illusion, always acknowledge that part of your brain is very susceptible to bias (in this case a willingness to accept pleasant and clear explanations from people who seem credible as dogma). 


Read every piece of advice with a critical mind (even what you're reading right now) and question everything, ESPECIALLY when it's announced with a lot of confidence, or even as a mantra.


For example, the solution I proposed might not be the optimal. Or it might be completely wrong. Or maybe everything you've spent the last couple minutes reading is completely wrong. Most likely, some of it is right and some of it is wrong. Always think for yourself.


Don't be a slave to your biases. Always ""cross-examine"" everything you read. Just because someone asserts things very confidently (with maybe a couple study results and graphs), or just because you've heard the same thing from many ""experts"" doesn't mean it's necessarily right. 


Even moreso if they have monetary incentive to promote a certain way of thinking (obviously).


What I also found really useful is not to try to label myself. This goes against the bias I attempted to describe in this post and so you probably have to make conscious effort not to label yourself as Left-wing, Right-wing, Libertarian, Paleo, Boglehead, Mustachian, etc. You are just a human being. Accept every perspective with a critical mind - use other people's perspectives as food for thought, not replacement for your thoughts.


All this seems obvious when laid out on virtual paper like this, and yet we too often forget. Why ? I don't know, but I've noticed being aware of emotional reasoning/bias is often a huge first step towards thinking more rationally/optimally.",finance,1463536050
investing,Shorting China,"Here are some of my partially organized thoughts on the world market that I would like to discuss with all of you.

From an undergraduate economics student in the US:

I was traveling in the Middle East a year ago and talked to some business men in Hong Kong who told me that some cities in China in which half of their buildings are empty because the local magistrates keep building to show growth, even though it's not necessary. Local magistrates report to the central government that everything is growing and everybody is happy- investors are happy.

I've been reading the news lately and it's not even a secret that this sort of fake growth is happening in China, which is why their president is attempting to slow down unnecessary production. However, in addition to all of this, China's debt to GDP is around 240% now, which is around where the US was in 2009 (correct me if I'm wrong). Around &lt;60% debt/gdp, I've read anyway, is considered ""healthy."" Extreme levels of debt are indicators of bubbles because the debt is outstripping the growth and if the growth holding it up for so long was inaccurate to begin with= bubble. Go look at the small cap ETFs suffering much more than the large cap indices right now, I.E probably not propped up by government.

Furthermore, futures trading in China is an all time high, commodity prices are up quite a bit, which we all know is a response to market fear. Gold, for example, is up 25% this year according to bloomberg. 

Moreover, the Dow/s&amp;P market averages are near highs with no real catalyst to drive them higher. The s&amp;p 500 has a 0% growth rate between may-october every year since it's inception, not to mention that interest rates are possibly going to go up again in June. Higher interest rates generally drive stocks downward and is a good stabilizer in strong bull trends(not great now). In summation, U.S. summer downturn like last year probably won't help China either, or is in response to China.. not ignoring oil.

I believe that the Chinese government is trying to correctly remedy the situation, but if it doesn't work out, here are a few of my rough thoughts. 

First option: 

Buying into the inverse of  China ETF of indices. The volume on these is super low and I don't want to touch them only because of that.

Second option: 

Buying into commodities such as gold/silver. I'm not sure if buying into indices on this, or actual mining companies/holders is better?

Third option:

Some back story: I've been working for about seven years and am starting graduate school in July. The timing could not be more perfect as I just sold my home. I can breathe easy knowing I can afford to pay my living expenses during this time but really want to make the most out of this good fortune.
 
I have zero savings and/or retirement funds. I received $90,000 in capital gains and will not have to pay taxes on that amount. I've developed a budget for the next two years and even if I have no other means of income I will still end up with about $55,000.

personalfinance,Over 30 and am finally in a place to work on our finances but would like some advice,"Hey everyone. I'm looking for some guidance and it seems a lot of great advice is being given here. That said, here's how I got to where I am...

I graduated from college straight into the recession. Up until the end of last year I never made more than $15 an hour and with a wife and two kids we never had an opportunity to do anything other than live paycheck to paycheck and creep into some debt. I now have a job making $49000+ a year and want to make serious financial progress. My wife works part-time (normally 20-25 hours a week) at $14 an hour.  

Now for some numbers. 

- Credit card debt is somewhere around $30,000. We don't use them at all, just make minimum payments each month. Not terrible interest rates either. 

- Student loans are around $28,000. I actually had a full ride to college but this defaulted to a loan when I couldn't find a job in my field and uphold the promissory note on my scholarship. I haven't been able to pay anything on this but desperately want to. It'll be $500 a month. 

- Rent is $800 a month, childcare is $1200 a month. Car payment is $200 a month. 

- Other than that it's mostly groceries, utilities, and a few luxuries. We just turned off Netflix, Squarespace, and Hulu. We spend a little on clothes (mostly to give a little attention to wardrobes that have desperately needed it for years now); that clocks in at maybe $150 a month for all of us.

- Oh yeah, there's insurance at $200 a month and some medical/dental bills (my teeth got pretty f'ed up during the years I could never see a dentist). Maybe we'll say $300 a month combined.

The strange thing is – I look at the number I can expect to get from mine and my wife's income and it appears I should be able to pay for everything without a problem. Then when we talk about finances it always seems we're behind in some way. We're moving forward – most definitely in a better place than at this same time last year – but I'd like to get ahead in a significant way, maybe even be able to invest and save up for my children's future. 

One more thing I should note: I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and through treatment realized how bad I was at managing budgets or anything like that. My wife has done that stuff for most of our 8 years together (God bless her). So if I sound vague on where we stand financially, understand it's like I'm brand new to this stuff.

I'd like some sort of plan, but it's hard for me to know how to begin.

personalfinance,Paying down debts by transferring balances into a low-interest account. A wise move?,"In a majority of the scenarios that I hear from others, the avalanche method or the snowball method are the way to go. My husband and I are taking a different approach and are transferring our credit card balances from 18-20% interest rate accounts into an 8% interest rate account through our credit union. Free balance transfers. The only catch seems to be that the minimum payment is comparatively high (about $225 a month for a $7,500 balance). This is manageable and will help us to stay on track to pay off our debts.

I don't see this method used very often and it makes me nervous as to why. That is my first concern. 

The other concern I have is that after transferring the balances into this main credit union account, we're closing out three lines of credit and freezing one for an emergency fund until we can get a real emergency fund saved. How bad will it hurt us to close these lines of credit all at once? How long will it take us to recover?

My question is this, though; I just now noticed that Taco Bell hasn't been taking 'federal income' out of my checks and my balance is currently 0 dollars for this year, five months in. I discussed this with our general manager and asked her to fix the issue since I'm relatively poor and I can't afford to pay one lump sum of taxes at the end of the year but I got my paycheck stub back today and I realized that there's still 0 dollars deducted.

Is this going to be a big problem? Should I start looking for another job or am I blowing it out of proportion? For context; I'm 21 and from Tennessee -- last year the tax form Taco Bell gave me to fill out was a W2.

stocks,The Fannie Mae(fnma)/Freddie Mac(fmcc) 3rd Amendment Judge Lamberth Appeal,"The first question the court should answer to reach its decision is, how much power does FHFA have as conservator?  It must narrow down the absolute limits of what the conservator can do to accomplish the goals of conservatorship.  


The government alludes to the power of the conservator as being almost absolute.  They never say ""FHFA can do anything it wants as conservator"", but they come pretty close.  The defendants never draw any lines, or set any self-imposed limits, on the powers of conservator in their oral arguments.  


Shareholder's can argue about what good faith and fair dealing are, but only HERA and FHFA can set the boundaries for when a deal made by the conservator exceeds its authority.  The Constitution and outside laws can also act as barriers on the powers of conservator.  But for the purposes of handling the analysis in a sequential order, those factors should be analyzed last.   


So ignoring, for now, other laws and Constitutional limits on the powers of the conservator, the court should examine if FHFA has ever communicated self-imposed limits on its power as conservator.  If HERA gives FHFA unlimited power to accomplish the goals of conservatorship, the court should assume that its statements about how it will conduct the conservatorships have unlimited credibility as well.  


If the stated public intentions of FHFA as conservator are not consistant over time, and the actions of the conservator materially contradict its stated previous intentions, then FHFA creates the conditions by which a court can find that it wasn't acting in good faith and did not make fair deals.  


If the government argues that HERA only allows challenges of conservator power that exceed its authority, then the test for when its actions may be review-able could be when it directly references other statutes or rules that it will not use its conservatorship power to ignore.  


So now I will show examples of when FHFA makes statements that define the scope of its authority and/or references other legislation and existing rules.  I will go in chronological order starting in 2008.  


""In addition, as conservator, FHFA assumed the authority of the management and boards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the period of the conservatorship. However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to operate legally as business corporations and FHFA has delegated to the chief executive officers and boards of directors responsibility for much of the day-to-day operations of the companies. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must follow the laws and regulations governing financial disclosure, including the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. - Excerpt from 2008 ""history of the conservatorships www.fhfa.gov "" 


http://www.fhfa.gov/Conservatorship/Pages/History-of-Fannie-Mae--Freddie-Conservatorships.aspx""


The above section is highlighted for a number of reasons.   It happens in 2008 just after the conservatorships are initiated.  FHFA states that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac"" must follow the laws and regulations governing financial disclosure"".


So the court should ask the next obvious question.  Has Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed the laws and regulations governing financial disclosure?  Well it stands to reason that if it had followed all disclosures laws that we would know why FHFA has made the decisions it has made on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Securities laws require the companies to disclosure all material information about their operations that have the potential to alter the value of their securities.  


Those laws exist so investors can know what is happening to and at the companies.   Since FHFA is effectively the companies, it has to tell the public the reason it is making its decisions.  And even if it believes that it is not obligated to disclose the reasons for its decision because it thinks HERA allows it to do whatever it chooses to do, it has limited the scope of what it can do by stating to the public that it believes it is obligated to follow already existing financial disclosure laws.


Here are excerpts of statements from James Lockhart that come from his public announcement concerning his decision to place the companies into conservatorship:

1.  ""Second, the Enterprises will be allowed to grow their guarantee MBS books without limits and continue to purchase replacement securities for their portfolios, about $20 billion per month without capital constraints.""

Ok so why is that statement important?  Well because of arguments that the defendants have made in court.  They gave the Enterprises marching orders and the authority to grow their guarantee mortgage portfolio's ""without limits"" and the ability to maintain the scale of their retained MBS portfolio at a rate of ""20 billion per month without capital constraints"". 

1.  With FHFA in power the management of Fannie and Freddie did not have the power to say no to this directive.  Lockhart compelled the GSEs to deploy their capital in a practically unlimited way.  The argument for the necessity of conservatorship cuts both ways.  

If market conditions posed enough of a threat to the GSEs to necessitate their conservatorship, it stands to reason that the decision by the FHFA to have the GSEs increase the scale of their financial commitment in those same market conditions increased the risk to the financial prospects of the Enterprises.  

There are only a limited range of outcomes that could happen because of this decision by the conservator.  The assets purchased and mortgages guarantees provided would eventually show a profit, or the GSEs would lose even more money than they already had and would have an even weaker financial condition. 

 And because the backstop for those potential losses would be the Treasury commitment provided at 10 percent interest, the costs of both that commitment and the commitment made in the third amendment should at minimum be reduced for two reasons.  

The first reason being that the cost of the financial commitment with Treasury made the decision of FHFA to have the enterprises provide unlimited liquidity a bad decision even though the assets were profitable in microcosm.  

Secondly, because market conditions likely made the decision by FHFA to have the GSEs deploy unlimited capital a potentially costly decision, the decision was unlikely to be the optimal path for FHFA to take to assure the solvency of the companies in an absolute sense even if the cost of capital were competitive.  

The defendant's characterize the 3rd amendment as possibly a ""bad business decision"".  They only concede even that point as a possibility.  Which is pretty much the only way they can characterize the 3rd amendment without either lying to the court, or admitting that the FHFA is run by incompetent people.  But no matter how they try to characterize the decision of FHFA to agree to the third amendment, the weight of the evidence supports intent over incompetence very heavily.

Approximately 3 months after HERA passed, the Treasury secretary at the time, Hank Paulson, made the decision in consultation with the president, George W. Bush, to takeover operations of the companies and to place them into conservatorship. In his book 'On the Brink' he characterizes his mentality in making the decision by recalling a conversation he had with the president just before taking control of the enterprises. The quote is ""Do they know it's coming, Hank?"" President Bush asked me. ""Mr. President,"" I said, ""we're going to move quickly and take them by surprise. The first sound they'll hear is their heads hitting the floor."" To read a more in-depth excerpt of the decision: http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/book-excerpt-brink-henry-paulson-jr/story?id=9713451

Wow, guillotine death references by their primary lender, the United States Treasury Department.  Seems kinda adversarial.  It also seriously damages the credibility of the public statement by James Lockhart about conservatorship being the decision of FHFA.  

The history matters because Treasury claims the 3rd amendment was a good faith decision meant to save the Enterprises from a ""death spiral""  But to even arrive at this ""bad business decision"" FHFA had to make numerous other ""bad business decisions"" between 2008 - 2012.  Here they are:

1.  It had to agree to a 10 percent dividend on borrowed funds from Treasury as well as give up 79.9 of the common stock in both GSEs.

2.  It had to ignore the Enterprises AAA credit ratings and 400 billion dollars in unpledged Mortgage Backed Securities that would have allowed the GSEs to pay off the 10 percent senior preferred stock.  This decision alone cost the GSEs almost 100 billion in interest payments and dividends pre-networth sweep.  And another 100 billion post networth sweep.  

3.  It had to make them provide ""unlimited"" liquidity in a risky mortgage market.  Essentially made them buy assets that paid 5 percent interest which ballooned the senior preferred stock liquidation preference at 10 percent interest. 

4.  It had to ignore the GSEs access to the discount window at the FED.  

And it had to do all this over two different presidential administrations and two different conservators.

investing,Thoughts on Dollar Cost Averaging Timeline?,"**tl;dr** For a young investor with a long time horizon and global portfolio, how long a time do you suggest I dollar cost average in over. (Please don't just quote the 1-year Vanguard research). 

I have built a (currently) theoretical portfolio for retirement (which is 40 or so years off for me). The porfolio is, more or less, an all-world portfolio with a slightly stronger bias toward emerging markets and away from Europe. 

With interest rates at such low levels, future US increases imminent, and resultant valuations pricing for low future returns I am not stoked about pumping a lot of money into the plan at the moment, so I think dollar-cost-averaging is the way to go.

However, I can't decide how long a period to do it over. Here is the relevant research I am aware of:
- Vanguard's study that says for one year periods, it is better to buy at the start of the period than to dollar cost average in
- Warren Buffett saying ""if you dollar cost average in to a low cost ETF over a decade you will do better than 90% of investors who start at the same time"" (paraphrasing from memory)
- Benjamin Graham suggests that defensive investors should not wait for the market to become low to buy. Rather, they should put money in when the market is not at an exceptionally high level and when they have the cash to invest. 

Of Grahams tests for market level, central value suggests approximately fair valuation. Trend line analysis which I believe I have been able to improve on (due to using real, dividend reinvestment included returns, my r2 is much higher than his would have been) also suggests about fair valuation. However, his upper limit for a multiple to pay for any company (no more than 20x its trailing 5 year average earnings) is exceeded by the SPY right now if you throw out questionable accounting adjustments.

My thought: follow Warren Buffett's advice and start dollar cost averaging in over the next decade, until such a point as all of Graham's tests suggest the market is at a fair or attractive valuation, at which point I will put the rest of my cash on the sidelines in. 

Do you guys think this makes sense? Can you offer a better alternative?",finance,1463553032
financialindependence,"At the mercy of mortgages. Feeling trapped - looking for advice, please help!","Hi guys. Sorry for the extra-long post. I have a bit of a conundrum hoping you can collectively help me out with. I'm a bit stuck in the decision making process/advice area. 

I'm currently 26, have NW of around 500k, a large chunk of which is in my personal home. I have 4 other rentals(3 SFH and 1 rural 4-plex), with 80% lending on them at average of around 5% interest rate, paying interest only. I spent the past couple if years busting my butt working crappy but well paying jobs(night shifts, 120 hours a week etc) as an industrial electrician, giving up my health, hobbies, friends, social activities and weekends, trying to get ahead. I squandered a large chunk of these earnings trying to buy websites to replace my income(to the tune of 50-70k, the rest is in real estate). Websites were working for a while, but has since stopped due to adsense ban. I actually left my job only for this to blow up in my face and have since been subcontracting, earning an average of 6k before tax/month, give or take. But this work is inconsistent and becoming less and less frequent. 

I have an inadvertent fear of spending or having any kind of remote enjoyment prior to FI/RE, both due to losing as much as I have in websites, and delaying FI/RE further. I drive a crap vehicle (mitsi l300 in terrible shape), all my socks have holes, I wear 3 year+ old clothes(still have some decent clothes though) have a garden, chickens, don't holiday(I don't really care for travel etc by the way, people keep telling me I have to take a trip, but it really doesn't interest me greatly. Maybe later when I reach FI/RE, but I'm not going to work another year I don't have to as an electrician.) , barely eat meat, don't spend anything on entertainment etc. I dislike my profession with intense passion, and see the direction the industry is going, and want to get out asap. Not to mention it is considered 'lowly' in my country(thanks to the media), making it semi-embarrassing to mention to people in certain circles(women esp) and doesn't lend itself well to cross over to other industries either. My dream 'job/life' is buying and selling businesses/real estate and keep the good earners with management staff. I also want to write fantasy novels, and make board and video games. But don't want to throw FI/RE into the wind to pursue that prematurely.

Trying to refine my FI/RE plan and to achieve relative freedom to pursue my entrepreneurial side(without fear of delaying FI/RE as I have so far) and it seems like paying down mortgages is the best/safest path. I anticipate higher interest rates in my country and don't want my primary source of cash flow to be eroded/become negative by factors outside of my control. My country has gone property crazy lately and high cash flow property has all but disappeared, we don't have a great way to legally get creative with financing, you're lucky to find a property that will break even after anticipated expenses.

By my calculations it will take 7-10 years saving 1200/week+investment income(so let's say 10), paying down current mortgages to achieve this IF I can get the contracts or go back to another ""gulp"" job. But not having a job for this long(5 months) has made me despise the thought of 5-6 days a week, 10-13 hours a day making somebody else money. I'd like to run a business at some point that isn't electrical, but don't want to put FI/RE in 7-10 years on the line. At the same time, I don't know if I can be miserable in life for another 10ish years working as an electrician. Theres the option of going back to high hour/nightshift job, but my health has eroded enough and not sure I want to continue down that path after what doing that for 2 years has done to me.

What would you guys suggest to get regularity of/increase in income(side gigs, part time work, flipping), should I use some of the leverage against my rentals(140k LOC) to do something with and fix for 5years @ 5%? Should I try not paying mortages down as much as I plan and purchasing more property as cash and market allows(maybe 60% lending)?
Should I just bite the bullet and get a job, try and dig up more contracting work? Really stuck here and don't have any support from friends or family. Hence why I'm turning to this sub for help. I don't really feel like I can tolerate 7-10 years more of being miserable and having low quality of life to try to get to the point where I can really 'begin' my life.

Sorry again for the long post, really hoping someone wise can give me some guidance. Thanks for reading to anybody who made it this far! Would love to discuss all this with people willing to spare me the time.

Mine are 
Dark Souls 3:
Great game the ability for enemies to smack you straight in the face while you strafed around them really spiked the difficulty. Although I still think last years Bloodborne was better I have to say Dark Souls 3 made me feel like I had come to the end of a 3 game journey and when I finally sat down and finished it I was very happy with it

Ratchet &amp; Clank
This game is just mindless fun, I mean who doesn't love the groovitron. Just great to see the platformer genre come back to life .

Salt &amp; Sanctuary
I actually preferred this to DS3 ( raises defences for onslaught of hate ) The game was fine tuned to hell .... was cheap to buy and is just so much fun. Personally I would pick this over any game I have played this year hands down

Street fighter V
I love street fighter so I could not not like this

Just to mention Games I am looking forward to playing

1. Fire emblem Fates ( All three games )
2. Valkyeria Chronicles remastered ( Never played original release )
3. Bravely second
4. Persona 5 ( Please god release this year in NA &amp; Europe )
5. Final fantasy 15
6. Deux ex mankind divided

Lately I have been receiving my two private (Sallie Mae) loans by paper statement because I like to physically look at statements every month. They are depressing to say the least. What do I mean by this?

Lets say for the sake of numbers I have two Sallie Mae loans.. both for 10k at 7.5%. Essentially I am paying $400 to move my overall balances down about $100 (these aren't exact figures but pretty close)... so of course I'm heated. These loans are barely getting paid down yet costing me a fortune. 

So what are my options? Ideally, is there a way to have my personal bank (Chase) ""buy"" these loans and have them consolidated so that I get one statement with everything laid out, possibly at lower interest rates? I'm just throwing ideas out here because I'm very green when it comes to student loans (being a new graduate and all). 

These are my teeny-tiny loans (the private Sallie Mae ones that is). This post doesn't even include my massive federal student loan... but still these private loans are really making me depressed when I look at what comes out of my bank account versus what it actually takes off the loan itself.

TL;dr very overwhelmed with my two private loans, barely being paid down yet hitting massive chunks of my paycheck. Can I consolidate? Can I lower the interest? Can my bank buy them and I instead pay the bank (Chase). Thank you so much in advance...",finance,1463568532

Elder Lawd here, Welcome to my Secondary Locations Series, if you have been playing Fallout 4 and needed something to stir the motivation to give it a 2nd (or 100th) playthrough, or give you the courage to finally start your survival mode, with Far Harbour out tomorrow... then fear not! I have a solution, below is my series on every unmarked location in Fallout 4, if you think I'm mad... you have a good point! But check out the map below if you doubt that this might be what you have been looking for!  

Also, my uploading schedule is complete and there will be two videos a day until the very last! Any Feedback is Welcome! Thank you for reading this far :)

Here's the link to the map of what I'm doing: http://images-cdn.moviepilot.com/images/c_limit,h_1244,w_960/t_mp_quality/riofs30rjov1o9wgfi9u/stay-safe-this-heat-map-shows-you-exactly-where-fallout-4-s-wild-things-are-744736.jpg

____________________________________

**Why am I doing this?**

Answer - Well as you know Fallout 4 is extremely dense with locations and buildings that take hours to explore and loot fully, although that's just scratching the surface, these Secondary Locations aren't on the map, (as in with an icon), however there are loads of them! The want to do this stems from my pervious experience with New Vegas and Fallout 3, finding these hidden gems where always such a joy, in the middle of nowhere (bar Deathclaw island in New Vegas, though the armour was pretty handy). 

____________________________________

**Who's this For?**


Answer - Well... anyone really, veterans who have sank hundreds of hours into the game so far appreciate my effort, all the way to people who have just stepped out of the Vault, it's all for fun, some of the places have a cool name and perhaps a nice item such as a easy Nuka Cola Quantum (1.17), Nuka Cherry (1.03), Cooking Stations (1.21), Safes (1.23), Terminals (1.30), Protectrons (2.02), even Melons (2.04) There are also Radioactive Swords (13.02)!

____________________________________


**What could you find at these locations?** 

I'll have to admit some places have just ammo or meds, a nasty enemy or two, although with that said every location has a story, which is one of the main reasons I love to explore them! So yeah, thanks for reading this far! Below is a link to several of my episodes; be to sure tell us what you think!

business,Wall Street set to open lower ahead of Fed minutes,,finance,1463577066
personalfinance,Permanently moving to the US in two years and am worried about getting a mortgage. Do I need to worry about improving my US credit score now?,"Of course nothing in certain in life, but I am a British citizen married to an American citizen and we are planning on moving from London to the US, probably Virginia, in about 2-3 years. Ideally, we'd like to sell up our London flat and buy a permanent home there within 6-12 months to minimise wasted rent costs. 

However, I'm worried about the lack of a credit score history limiting our borrowing ability, or increasing our interest rate. I lived in the US for a couple of years about 10 years ago, so never built one. My wife has lived in the UK for a similar time period, but prior to that lived with her parents who have great credit scores. Since then she has a rarely used US credit card. 

Should I be worried about this? Is there anything I can do in the next two years to improve our standing when we get to the US?",finance,1463580860
Economics,"The Federal Reserve is the most optimistic. The Bank of Japan made the biggest mistake. The Bank of Canada is the most accurate, but it's got the easiest job. These are just a few of the findings of Bloomberg's first-ever ranking of Group of Seven central banks",,finance,1463581257
personalfinance,Both Federal and State Tax Refunds were partial?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but couldn't think of another sub to post this.

I recently received my state and federal refunds.  However, Federal refund was short by $1,500 and State (MD) was short by $300.  

I do have an accountant with whom I've been in touch, but haven't heard back just yet.  I'm just wondering if anyone has had similar experience and if so, how did you go about resolving it?",finance,1463581734
Technology_,Feds want to keep child porn suspect locked up indefinitely until he decrypts his hard drive,,technology,1463582456
personalfinance,[Debt] Pay down student loans or buffer my rent?,"As the title might suggest, I'm having a small crisis of strategy.

I have about $16.5k in various federal student loans that I've been paying off for the past few years. I make enough to cover the $220 payments and it's not that big of an issue for me. 

I have some help from my folks with my rent, so at the moment I'm only paying $350 a month for it, but every year I'll need to pay $150 more every month until I'm paying the full $800 rent.

Lately some of my income has been freed up so I have roughly $150 or so to plan with, and as my E-fund shores up over the course of the year, I'll have another $300-400 or so each month.

My question is: Should I be using the freed up money to pay down my loans a little quicker for the short term, or hold on to it so when I have to start paying more for my rent in the following years it won't be as big of a hit because I've been planning for it?
Lately some of my funds have been freed up, so I have an extra $100-$150 a month to plan with.",finance,1463582638
personalfinance,Waiting to refinance until after the election?,"I [26] just graduated from pharmacy school and my husband [27] is a CPA. The timing of life has worked out such that I graduated right around when he is hitting the next promotion level at work, so we went from living comfortably but simply on his income (60-70kish, I had part time jobs that mostly covered discretionary spending) to $200K practically overnight it seems. Our only debts are our mortgage (120K) and my federal student loans (135K at 6.5%) We also have about $45K in retirement savings and almost $10K in an emergency fund. We are very aware and cautious of lifestyle creep. Eventually when we have kids, I would like to go part-time, so our big goal is to pay off my loans, and we want to find the smartest way to do it. I'll still contribute to my 401K, but the lion's share of my income would theoretically go to the loan while we continue living off of and saving from his paycheck. 

We had some financial planners come to school and give a one hour talk (not enough!), so I asked about refinancing through Sofi. The one planner told me I shouldn't do anything until after the election. I don't have any plans to do IBR or any loan forgiveness programs, so I can't see an advantage to waiting for new policies to be passed.

personalfinance,Student loans deferred. Should I be paying private or federal loans first? Higher interest vs. tax benefit.,"I'm currently in grad school pursuing a PhD and have had my student loans deferred. I've decided I'd like to try to pay a bit on the loans, but I'm not sure which loan I should focus on. The private loan has a higher interest rate, but my understanding is that paying off the federal loan can give me a nice tax return next year. 

I'm leaning toward focusing on the federal loan to make sure I get the tax benefit. Is this the best course of action? 

I'm aiming to make payments of about $100-$200 a month, so nothing huge.

personalfinance,"Home needs repairs and updating soon, how to pay for them?","Hello PF.  My wife and I have lived in our home for almost 2 years now.  This house was never intended to be our permanent home.  Ideally, we only want to be in this house for another 5 years, maximum.  Unfortunately, to get a good price when selling it, and also to make it a nicer home for us, it needs quite a few repairs.  List of home repairs in order of importance before we sell are:

1. Replace all windows.  Many are cracked and they are original to the house which was built in 1953.
2. Remodel bathroom.  It is very outdated and there is some minor water damage.
3. Refinish hardwood floors.  They are pretty worn and scuffed up.
4. Replace/repair walls and ceilings going to basement.  Previous owner destroyed walls by gluing posters to them.
5. Replace basement walls.  Same reason as #4.
6. Replace basement flooring
7. Replace kitchen appliances.  All still technically work, but they also all have their issues, Dishwasher, Stove, and Refrigerator.

My question is the best way for us to pay for these repairs.  Obviously we will not be doing them all at once, but they should be done before we move.  Is the best option a home equity load or HELOC, or should we just spend some time saving and pay cash?

Here are our current fiances.

Combined we take home ~$5200 after taxes per month.  After bills and some recreation, we can probably realistically save $600-$700 per month for repairs if we stop putting into our emergency fund.

EF: ~$12,000

New Car fund: $3500 + $500 per month.  Hoping to buy 2-3 year old car in about a year.

So PF, should I keep building my EF and get a Home equity loan or HELOC, or would it be better to leave EF where it is at for now and switch over to saving for repairs and pay cash for repairs?",finance,1463585456

personalfinance,Is there a way for me to lower my Student Loan Interest Rate?,"Hi Everyone, thanks in advance for the help!
I have about 30k in total student loan debt, and wanted some opinions on how I can potentially lower my interest rate. 

I have 20k in federal loans, all of which have interest rates well below 5%. I have been making the minimum monthly payments on these since I went into repayment. I’m really not too concerned about these at the moment. 

The remaining 10k is from a private loan from Wells Fargo. I needed this money to pay for one of my last semesters at school, and taking a private loan was the best option at the time. 

Unfortunately, my mom had to co-sign (dad isn’t in the picture). My parents divorced when I was in HS, and left my mom supporting 4 kids on her own, and we didn’t have the best financial situation. That being said, she isn’t an ideal co-signer, and I was stuck with a 9.99% interest rate. I have since lowered it by a whopping .25% by enrolling in automatic payments. 
Since the interest rate on that loan is so high, I have been attacking it as my primary priority. 

Since I went into repayment in November, I have paid it down from 10k to 8.7k. I make the monthly payments and also try to throw money at it whenever I can. I would have it paid off more, but owed a lot in taxes this year, since I was an independent contractor with my first job out of school. 

Since I have an actual job now (was a student when I took out the loan) is there a way for me to have them lower my interest rate now that I am less of a risk and have a salary? I currently make 50k/yr. Additionally, my BF (live together, going on 5 years together) has offered to help in any way he can. He makes less than my mom (75k/yr), but has a better credit score, is there a way to make him the cosigner?

personalfinance,"What is the smartest thing I can do with my money right now?(25, single)","Hi PF! I stumbled upon this subreddit today and have been reading top posts for almost 3 hours now! There's so much more I could be doing with my money that I never even realized! I'm having a hard time figuring out what exactly would be the best use of my current assets, so I'm hoping you could help me out. Here's a rundown of my situation:

I'm 25 years old with a B.S. of Computer Science. I make a little over $87k/yr w/o bonus(1-10% potential bonus), full benefits, including medical/dental/vision, 100% up to 5% 401k match(fully vested), and life insurance(I've also opted for a large additional policy for around $10 extra per pay period). I'm in a great field of comp-sci and am very confident in my job security, as well as my job prospects.

My only debt currently is $4,600 that I owe on my car, which I bought for $25,000 2.5 years ago. The interest rate is 4.35%.

I currently live in my parents old house which they still own, however I pay the mortgage/insurance. The house is worth around $100k conservatively. The mortgage is around $770/mo. My parents still owe ~$80k, and are willing to sell it to me for that amount. I have two roommates who pay me $750/mo. in rent.

My liquid assets include around $2,000 worth of bitcoins, $9,000 in my savings account, and $3,500 in cash that I keep in case of emergencies. I just started contributing to my 401k this past September and have around $4,600 in it. I was contributing 5% just to get the match, but when I realized today that there is an annual limit on elective deferrals, I bumped it up to 20% which should bring me just up to the 18k limit(although I will still need to make up for the first 5 months of low contribution).

So here I am, trying to figure out what to do- up until now I've been content just paying my car down as fast as possible, but I'm not positive that's the best use of my money anymore. I'm torn between buying the house, paying the car off, opening an IRA, or going heavier into bitcoins/traditional investments(my initial bitcoin investment has grown around 2,000% at this point). Another option might be helping my parents pay down their credit card debt, which is around $15,000; one day I'll be inheriting their assets so that sort of makes sense anyways, right? My credit score is somewhere around 750-800 so I'm not positive it needs to be much better than that... I know I have a pretty thin file(just two credit cards, 10k, 2k limits, and the car loan), but I'm still pretty confident in my ability to secure new lines of credit.

So there it all is... are the potential investments that I'm not seeing? I've always wanted to be in business for myself, but I don't think I'm ready financially to try and start a small business yet, and I think planning for retirement is a much bigger fish to fry atm.

- I received my bachelor's from Loyola in 2009, graduated INTO debt during an economic recession
- I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in Physical Therapy, went back to school, did all of the prereqs while working, now I'll be applying to DPT programs in July and the thought of the mountain of potential debt after 3 years is mind numbing.
- I want to start saving/investing as much as possible, but I feel that the hindrance of my student loan debt overrides the need to save money because the interest rates on my unsubsidized loans are 6.5%.
- I had been in deferment for the past 2 years but was still accruing interest on my unsubsidized loans, and just recently put ~5k into them, but still have $20k left and very little money saved.

The cost of education in the country drives me insane. In hindsight, I should've just taken a gap year and went to a community college instead of going away to a private university without knowing what the hell I wanted to do with my life. I was financially unstable throughout my 20s (I'm 29 now) while I was still figuring out what I wanted to do as a career. I finally found a career that I feel passionate about and could see myself doing, but it comes with an astronomical amount of more debt to pile on. 

I'm not one of these people who could rely on mommy and daddy; my parents are of extremely little financial help to me. If they had any financial savvy at all, they probably would've advised me to wait off on college until I developed my interest instead fukking myself over. What would you do in my situation?

Our current forums for discussion and workflow all have good qualities of their own whether it be daohub, reddit, slack, github, gitter etc.  But, ultimately, there needs to be one place where we can gather all our collective ideas and gnaw on them together.  Creating software to function as our collective body and metabolize these ideas seems like a daunting task (at least to me) but if we are truly to be the virtuous group of people who wish to open doors for the future of decentralized collectivism we need to think big and fast.  I think of the men sitting on the scaffolding high atop of the Empire State Building here.   

Decentralization and the (true) wisdom of the crowd:  *We need a centralization of ideas, a decentralization of natural power, and a irradiation of unnatural power.*

There is a certain exclusivity to all these particular venues that is an obstacle for letting our collective ideas/proposals/etc rise organically in a decentralized manner.  A lot of this comes from our demand for an elaborate white paper written up about each and every idea in order for that idea to have validity.  With our *collective power*, why not put these ideas through of process (software, algorithms, etc) and let the whitepaper come out  the other end?

There also needs to be a *radical acceptance* of all ideas/suggestions/proposals.  No idea is bad.  They all should get fed upon and inform each other.  This is the way an artist thinks.  *We can be one artist together.*  If we do it right from the bottom up, then the compensation (that gets focused on too much - i confess for myself aswell) will definitely come but that should not be our ultimate reward or the ground come from underneath us quickly.

There also needs to be an ‘ease of voice and participation’ so that nobody feels their idea is unworthy of consideration. After all, ‘their’ idea is ‘all of our’ ideas.  TheDAO needs a more fluid, inclusive, and efficient cultivation of ideas.  Think of mimicking nature and *evolutionary biology*. Why not let proposals come from within, organically?  Why not take in outside proposals and send them through our rigorous collective fire. These processes should be visuable to the users like in a game of slither.io or agar.io.  Ease of access and visablity.  Gamification of workflow?

We are a *new organism* that can give birth to other virtual (even real) organisms. [I know this sounds very lofty and unachievable but look how far we have come] !


In conclusion, I truly feel the first order of business for theDAO is to seriously invest in a collective workflow that matches the futurism and grandiose nature of our new paradigm. 
I would like to ask the Ethereum community, Are there current projects or software that aims to capture the continuity of ideas and the collective intelligence of a hivemind?  Do you think these lofty ideas for organizing (organism) the collective intelligence of token holders of TheDAO are worth working towards?

Please discuss thoroughly.   The future is at stake.",cryptocurrency,1463605099

personalfinance,Just got out of prison and owe SO much money...,"I went to college and graduated but went to prison soon after about 18 months ago.  I just got out on parole and am looking at the aftermath of my finances.  I'm getting so many letters and calls from so many different companies I don't where to even begin... 

I know I had 3 credit cards, two from wells fargo and one from capital one.  Apparently capital one sold off my debt a while back but wells fargo still has mine? Student loans are all over the place. I know I took out some personal loans through discover but I'm lost as who are all the companies (or just one company) that holds all my regular student debt from the university.  I know at some point my loans started coming through another federal company cause of some changes in law but I'm completely lost. I just got a big ol pink letter saying my student loans are about to default.

While I was in prison, some student loan company found me and sent me a letter and I was able to defer it for a year but that time has passed a few months ago. Right now I'm jobless and am crashing at a friend's house but I'm aware of how serious a student loan default is. 

This is all beyond what I'm mentally capable of handling right now. I just went through a stock pile of letters that were saved in the past year and am too overwhelmed to even know what to do first.  What can I even do? Even if I had some crappy job (I'm engineering by education...) my first concern is a roof over my head and food. I don't even know what to tell these people when I figure out the mess of who the hell a actually owe and what. Please help me... I stayed out of trouble in prison and continued studying and try to study programming to maybe get a web dev job on the side. I want to do the right thing and get out of this endless black hole.

----

EDIT: I spent the last hour reading through every comment here and I think getting a free credit report to see who I owe since I haven't really had an address or phone would be a good first step. I should have said my debt is mainly student loans (80k public, 20k private...best guess...) and my credit card debt is about $6-7k so I'm really iffy about declaring bankruptcy but I will at least talk to a lawyer and learn more about the best route to take.

Lastly, I got a lot of positive PMs and comments and even that small boost from a message from an internet stranger gives me hope when I let something like this bring me down. I hope one day I can post an update saying I got a great job, beat the statistics, and give hope to other felons who are trying to do the right thing. It was definitely a life changing experience and has changed my views about the prison system in general. Thank you very much.",finance,1463605580

personalfinance,Higher Salary! Can I Now buy my parents a house?,"I finally have a well paying job! Went from ~50k (in North Dakota) to  ~100K in California! 

Its great money and now, it has always been a goal to give back to my parents by buying them a house so they can retire in San Diego. However, I been running the numbers and I don't think it's possible unless I make severe cutbacks on my end. 

First, here are my numbers:

**$4500** - after taxes, estimated income per month (biweekly paychecks) 

* ($300) - Student Loans (4k left) (2.25% interest rate)

* ($660) - Car Loan (40k left) (2.25% interest rate)

* ($1000)- Rent (not bad for the bay area)

* ($150) - Utilities

* ($200) - Gas

* ($350) - Health supplements and gym (gym, classes, protein powder)

* ($600) - Food 

* ($350) - Work parking

* ($400) - Dates/Social Life

**$490** Take Home

Not bad but not great. I contribute 7% of my pretax salary to my retirement and despite my numbers showing I take home around $490 if I spend my money to the X. I tend to take home around $800-1000.

I can make cutbacks such as cutting back on my exercise classes but its my expensive hobby (i could save $150 a month). I'm unable to take public transportation to work (a 15 minute drive turns into 2 hours by bus, train, and bus. And I do like having a social life and going on dates (I'm getting to the 3-0 age). 

I wish I bought a cheaper car! 

So I've been looking at homes in San Diego and I think the best price I would be able to get for a 1 bedroom would be, at most, around $200,000. Trying to save for a 20% deposit like that would take me around 5 years but I would limit myself to creating a savings emergency account or other spendings. 

Would investing be a viable option? I'm running out of ideas.

Overall, I'm coming to the conclusion that I could either make tremendous sacrifices like my parents did or find a different way to help them. 

Any advice?",finance,1463607370
personalfinance,"Credit Cards finally paid off, where do we go next?","5/18/2016 marks a major accomplish in my household as I made my final payment on our credit cards today.  Over the past 38 months we can climbed our way from -$32k net worth to 94k.  Our goal this whole time has been to pay down our credit cards.  Now that we have gotten past that we are going to 
build our emergency fund a little more (currently at $7.5k). During the CC elimination phase I knew the next step, but now I'm wondering where to go once we are happy with our emergency fund, so I have come  here to see what you guys/gals think.

Last year we made $163k (101/62), we both contribute enough to get our company match on 401k's and we have been putting $3.3k into our HSA.  We still have 13 months left on our two car loans (2.4% interest rate), $41k left to pay on my student loans (avg of 5.1% interest) and $120k on our mortgage (15 years left at 2.875%).

A guy I work with brought up maxing out my HSA to lower my tax bill.  I started looking into it and to get the max ($6650 - $1500 company contribution) it will cost me $1848 more but my take home pay will only drop by $1377.31, so I'm getting about a 34% return on my money just by taking Uncle Sam out of the picture.  We have been saving receipts and paying out of pocket to use this as a Super Roth when we can.

Long term our goal is to retire at 55 (currently 33/34) as we have four kids who will need us until about that time.  The HSA (Super Roth) made sense to me since I can get to the money by paying myself for our out of pocket costs, but I'm not as sure about upping my 401k.  

I have started looking at my next step (once we have reach our emergency fund goals).  My wife has brought up the possibility of buying a rental property, maxing out our 401k's or hitting the SL debt harder.  I'm kind of at a loss on which of these options will be better.  I have no problem fixing things so that wouldn't be that big of a deal (I fully understand the life of a landlord as my best friend runs 5 units and I help him out when I can) but I'm just not sure long term which is the right way to go.  Right now Uncle Sam takes such a chunk out of my back pocket I'm wondering if it is smarter to minimize my tax bill (upping 401k, or being able to deduct the costs associated with a rental) or worry about lower interest rate debt (SL).

personalfinance,Using a Balance Transfer Card to Pay Off Non-CC Debt,"First time poster so please be gentle. Lately I've been looking into using a balance transfer credit card to lower the interest rate on some of my debt. 

Here is my current debt situation:

CC @ 14.49%: $1900
Credit Union Line of Credit Account @ 9.7%
Student Loan @ 4.004% mixed: $23,765.

$500/mo currently budgeted to CC. Will waterfall to other accounts. 
Playing minimums on other two accounts

The issue in having is that I've gotten conflicting information on what accounts I can use with the balance transfer card. It was my impression that you can use the card towards any type of account (setting aside for a minute if it is even wise to do so on something like a student loan).

However, when I was preparing to apply for a particular card (Chase slate because of the 0% transfer fee) the customer service representative told me I couldn't do that. That, ""It has to have a 15 or 16 digit account number like a credit card to be able to transfer a balance from an account."" 

I feel like that the info the rep gave me was incorrect but I'm not sure. I would prefer to be able to use a balance transfer card on my line of credit as well and possibly a small portion of my student loan. Has anyone else been told this before? Am i right in my perception that the card can be used on any account not at the same institution?

personalfinance,How much house can I afford?,"I'm getting destroyed in rent costs down in Maryland (32% of income) so I am thinking of buying. I have the option to ""go remote"" at my job and move into a cheaper region, and this is what I am considering.

Quick facts: I make $84k a year before taxes. If we account for permanent income, I have not yet hit the salary cap in my field. Excellent FICO score (800+). Student loan balance of $9k at very low interest, but I can immediately dump this if it's a requirement to get a mortgage. No CC debt. Only other debt is a car payment.

A property I'm looking at in rural Pennsylvania is listed at 3 acres for $359,000. I am also part of Navy Federal CU, which seems to offer an unbelievable conventional 30-year mortgage for just 5% down and no PMI. Now, I'm not that well-versed in property values, but 3 acres for that price seems like a steal. A quick calculation I did on their site for the amount I can put down on the house and the current interest rate reveals a mortgage cost of around $1475 a month....which is exactly what I'm paying in *rent* now.

personalfinance,Just graduated and got a job with a pension. What should I do?,"I am 22 and recently graduated with student loans amounting to ~$25,000. My current salary is $50,000 with a 401k match of 50% up to the first 6%. I am currently contributing 6% to maximize the match.  

I also contribute to the pension fund and will be vested in the pension in 5 years. I contribute 11.1% of my salary to the pension, the company contributes 19.3%. I fully intend on sticking with the company for my entire career. I like my job, and, if for some reason I change my mind, there are opportunities to move horizontally and vertically within the company. The job security is pretty unheard of -- I'd pretty much have to lie my ass off or steal to get fired. Nobody has been fired for any other reasons. I also have scheduled raises, so I will be making $82,000 in 2 years.  

I have also been contributing to a Roth IRA, but I am wondering if my unique situation would be better served by investing elsewhere. My thought process is that I have a solid retirement set in place as it is through the pension. Because I have that and the 401k to fall back on, contributing to a Roth IRA seems overly conservative, and I am wanting to invest in something that is higher risk while I am young and do not have many financial obligations.  

Is my thought process clear? Should I forgo maxing out my Roth IRA and invest in higher risk funds? Should I continue to max out the Roth IRA until I am employed 5 years and vested in the pension? Should I not invest any extra income at all and just put it all towards my student loans? I also, realize that I can tailor my IRA to higher risk investments, but I am considering even riskier investments (options, buying single stocks, etc.). As I see it, I am fairly 'set' for retirement, but, if I have the opportunity, I'd like to take the chance to really get ahead and potentially retire early if I can get lucky with other investments.

I applied with my mom as a cosigner and was approved but at higher rates than my pre approval rates. (My mom was declined as a cosigner because of her income and my rates went up because they factored in the fact that I'm adding new debt.)

I declined the offer because the interest rate was higher than what I was currently paying. I re applied with my dad as the cosigner (his income is double my income) after a few months. 
I just found out I was declined this time because of my income to debt ratio. In the past few months I've paid off approximately an additional $6k in debt. I'm not sure why I would be declined the second time after adding a cosigner. 

The representative I spoke to said my dad might have brought additional debt into the formula. If the original loan is in his name already though I'm not sure why that would be a problem? We aren't adding new debt, just refinancing debt that is already there.

Thanks!  Please let me know what other information might help explain my situation.

EDIT:  for people wondering why I would do this/think this would work -- it has to be honest about ten years since I had filed taxes -- my student loans are in default -- I was sloppy with my payments way back when -- so my Federal return always went straight to the collection agency which now owns my loan (which I intend to pay back later in life when I actually have an adult job). 

Before then, when I used to file, making about the same less-than-30k, I had always gotten my full Federal back.  So I assumed that would still be the case.  So I have been in the habit for a long time of filing as ""exempt"", seeing as the extra $100 or so per paycheck does me quite a bit more good at my income level than the prospect of ""doing the right thing"" to an extent and having it sent on to a collection agency -- a situation I plan to handle in a couple years with better information on how to do so.

personalfinance,Recent college graduate with a new job across the country (USA) around the corner with budget questions,"Hello /r/personalfinance, I am a long time lurker in need of some advice concerning my planned budget and how to handle my money going forward. I believe I have a firm handle of my plans but having some other eyes rip my budget apart to make sure I am being realistic would be a massive help. 

**Back Story** 

I just graduated from college with a BS in Mechanical Engineering with $34000 in Federal Student Loans. These have an average rate of 4.5%. I also have a car loan for $13500 at 4%, payments of $250 monthly. Additionally, I have $2000 in CC debt to pay off. 

In mid June I will be moving from Colorado to the east coast for a job as a civilian engineer for the DOD with a starting salary of $62000. My parents are supporting me until I am fully settled out east and am stable on my own feet financially. I would love to get on my feet as fast as possible to stop being a burden on them.

What I need help with is my planned budget once I am settled out east. Unfortunately many of these numbers are estimates and are based on best guesses. I am trying to pin them down more and more without the costs eating all of my money.

**Current Budget**

All amounts are in terms of monthly amounts. I will be paid bi-weekly. I currently have no emergency fund built up, but I will use the 6 months of grace from student loans to build this up. I plan to attack all of my loans using the snowball strategy. Most of the student loans are for a few thousand dollars each and I would prefer to knock them out quickly. There is no early repayment penalty on any of my loans. I plan to use any remaining funds at the end of each month towards paying off debts, rebuild emergency funds, or cover other unexpected events. 

*Monthly Income*

Item | Rate | Amount
---|---|---
Monthly Income | | $5166
Federal Tax Withholding | 25.47% | $1315
Local Income Tax After Federal (I think)| 6% | $231
TSP (6% matching) | 6% | $310
Health Insurance Withholding Estimated | 4% | $248
**Monthly Take Home Estimate**|  | $3062


*Expenses*

 Item | Percentage of Take Home Pay | Amount
---|---|---
Rent (1 Bed 1 Bath Apartment) | 39% | $1300
Utilities| 6.5% | $200 
Groceries| 8.2% | $250
Transportation| 3.3% | $100
Car and Renters Insurance (Estimate) | 6.5% | $200
Software Subscriptions (Google Play, Audible, Prime)| 1.6% |  $50
CC Min Payment ($63 + $X to get to $100) | 3.3% | $100
Car Loan| 8.2% | $250
Student Loan (Standard Repayment Plan)| 11.4% | $350 
**Remaining/ Slush Funds**| 8.5% | $262 

**Questions and Thoughts**

So given my budget and situation here are my main questions/ thoughts:

1. Am I way off in left field with my estimates or does this seem reasonable?
2. How can I shave more expenses to use towards killing off my debts? I think I have gotten many of the low hanging fruit, but not sure what is left.
3. What are some of the better methods of tracking how much is in the budget vs. actually spent? I currently use YNAB but I want also track my projected budget for the month vs. what I ended up using. 
4. For any one with experience with TSP, what are the better funds or any tips/ tricks on how to best use the accounts?
5. Again for any Federal employees, are there any of the insurance plans available that are really great or should be avoided? 
6. Does PF want updates once I get going out there?

Some notes for context: I live quite frugally, but I live in an area with high rent costs. During the school year, I have a well-paying job that covers my expenses well, but over the summer I'm more limited with a lower-paying part time position (not able to take on more hours/new job right now except as a last resort).

Before the end of this month, I will be receiving around $5000. Aside from paying off my CC, what is the best thing to do with the remaining money? Should I put some in a TFSA? Should I use it to pay off the whole LOC right away, and borrow what I have to (I will probably have to use it at least a little) against that to pay rent for the next few months?  

Another note, I get a cheque for $1500 in September as part of a scholarship, and this money is also available to be spent on any of this debt as well. Should I hold off on completely paying off the LOC till I get that money, and put more of the inheritance in savings?

personalfinance,Have had a mortgage for 1 year. Should I refinance?,"Despite being a long time homeowner (long, irrelevant story) I've only recently aquired a traditional mortgage. Other than mortgage my spouse and I are debt free. 

We bought a(n awesome!) new home just about 1 year ago. Current interest rate is 4.25% on a 30 year fixed rate loan. We do not pay mortgage insurance but with homeowners insurance and property taxes (escrow) our total monthly payment is about $1200. Actual mortgage payment is just under 1K the rest is insurance and tax.

We got a promotional letter from the bank encouraging us to consider refinancing to a 20 year fixed rate loan at 3.669%. (Or a 30 year at a lower rate then we currently have)  This would save us over 50K in interest over the lifetime of the loan if we followed the standard repayment schedule (we expect to pay off early regardless of what loan we have). 

I know there will likely be closing costs associated with refinacing. I can't seem to  find a good source of just HOW much that will be. I'd love some feedback on whether or not refinancing so soon makes any sense? Using some standard online mortgage calculators refinacing at a lower interest rate for a shorter term *seems* to result in significant savings over just making extra payments on our current mortgage.

I'd love to get thoughts and input from anyone who has refinanced or is more familiar with mortgages/refinancing.


**Edit:** I decided to call in a pro. I've got a mortgage ""guru"". He's crunching some numbers: 

Refi at the lower rate (factor in in closing costs)=what will the overall saving in interest be

Vs.

Applying Whatever the  closing costs would have been as an extra payment to principle on the current loan without refinancing and continuing our current repayment plan and mortgage.

Vs.

Continuing to follow our current plan without refinancing which includes some extra paid to principal every month without making an additional large lump sum payment anytime soon (Which has, so far, resulted in us paying over 12K of the **principal** down in just under a year. (Our guru guy says this is *really* good)

I don't know much about ""catastrophe bonds"" yet, and I'm not sure what their significance may ultimately turn out to be.

But I do know that every derivative, including a ""catastrophe bond"" (or ""cat bond""), is basically a financial ""bet"" between two parties.

So this means that AXA is now in the business of actually *helping companies place ""bets"" on climate change and other major disasters.*

Of course, AXA will tell you that they're merely doing this to ""mitigate risk"".

But remember, every bet has a winning side and a losing side.

So AXA is now offering financial ""betting"" instruments allowing one side of the ""bet"" to [*make money off of ""large mortality events, such as a pandemic outbreak, regional or world war, nuclear explosion or disaster, or terrorism event"".*](http://www.artemis.bm/blog/2014/10/21/axa-reported-to-be-readying-new-mortality-catastrophe-bond/)

Do you want a company like AXA, [the insurance company with the biggest derivatives exposure](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4k1r7v/the_insurance_company_with_the_biggest_exposure/), which now also offers ""catastrophe bonds"" to let investors profit from global disasters, to also be [influencing Bitcoin development by paying the salaries of Blockstream developers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=axa+blockstream&amp;ia=web)?

I know I don't.

The vast unregulated $2.1 quadrillion global derivatives casino is so sprawling and complex and opaque that nobody even knows anymore who owes what to whom.

Seriously. According to Forbes magazine, even the Fed is no longer able to figure out if a US bank is bankrupt or not - because of derivatives:

And in the shadowy world of shell companies and the Panama Papers, it's impossible to tell who owns what anymore.

People who closely followed CDOs (collateralized debt obligations, which were one of the main culprits in the 2008 financial meltdown) may have heard about Magnetar Capital - a hedge fund which Goldman Sachs used in order to bet against its *own* toxic derivatives:

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=goldman+magnetar+site%3Anakedcapitalism.com&amp;ia=web

Meanwhile, [Bitcoin is the opposite of derivatives](http://www.businessinsider.com/all-of-worlds-money-in-one-chart-2015-12). Bitcoin has no counterparties. Bitcoin is transparent. 

And Bitcoin is about ending the tragic misallocation of capital caused by our current corrupt system of central bankers who print up their fantasy fiat money and hand it out to their friends so they can misallocate it on waging wars and destroying our environment.

The real ""killer app"" of Bitcoin could be to restore rational capital allocation to our irrational capital markets.

And this is the aspect of Bitcoin that is most terrifying to our fiat money masters. They want to be able to keep getting rich off of misallocating capital to destroy our world - and placing bets on the whole thing, while the planet burns down around us.

Bitcoin would put an end to their genocidal, ecocidal gaming and gambling.

Bitcoin is solid money with no counterparties, while derivatives are fragile instruments involving counterparties playing fast and loose in an unregulated casino which almost destroyed the world's financial system in 2008, and [could do so again in the near future](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2013/01/08/five-years-after-the-financial-meltdown-the-water-is-still-full-of-big-sharks/#43930ad45474).

personalfinance,23 Y/O military Looking for some feedback,"Hi PF,

I'm a recently commissioned officer in the USMC, and looking for some feedback.  I'm single, but getting married next march.  My fiance is working for around $2500 after taxes per month and will live at home until we're married.  The wedding will not cost us anything.  She has no debt.  We have no intention of buying a house anytime soon, and will be renting for the next several years until we know I won't be moving, or I get out of the military. Here's an outline of my finances.  I'm considering a new car.  My BMW is expensive to maintain, and at this point, a luxury car is not prudent for me.  I want something reliable, cheap to maintain, and capable of lugging my life across the country many times over the next 10 years.  I'm considering a Tacoma (used or new), 4Runner (used), or maybe a Mazda CX5.

Assets:

-Currently I make **$3740**/month after taxes.  This includes my housing allowance. 

-2011 BMW 328i, KBB 13-15k which I own outright.

-30k in a brokerage account on vanguard.

-10k in my roth IRA on vanguard. Maxed for 2015, but 0 for 2016 so far.

-5k emergency fund

-10k liquid cash which is 95% profit from playing poker.  This is how I spent my time in between military schools starting.  I don't have the same time as I did in the past, and my new station doesn't have the same casinos available that I used to frequent.


Liabilities:

-Rent+utilities+internet: **$600** /month

-The vanguard investments listed above are entirely from a 36k ""career starter loan"" from USAA which is at a .75% interest rate.
  
-I owe $30,100 on the loan and have payments of **$620** per month on it.

-For 2016 I have started a contribution to max my roth IRA as an allotment from my pay.  I forgot to start this in march, so it's beginning in June and will be **$647**/month.

-I contribute 12%/month (**$448**) to my Roth Thrift Savings Plan (Essentially a government 401k for those not in the know).

Summary: 


Pay-Liabilities = $1,425 which is plenty to cover food, occasional dining out, gas, car insurance, cell phone and any work expenses.

I really like the idea of a new Tacoma.  The issue is the price, 30k.  Does it make sense to sell the BMW, and purchase a new Tacoma? Essentially I would use the trade-in value + 10k cash, and take out a 5-7k loan to pay for it.  These cars hold their value so well, and you hardly get a discount getting one used.  It also fills all of the notches I listed above (cheap to maintain, reliable, ect).  Does this make sense?  Or should I find something cheaper?

personalfinance,"How much is an additional $60,000 in student loans, really?","Hi, thanks for reading. I am 23 years old and have been accepted to a couple of medical schools. My two options right now have a fairly large tuition difference - one school is $14k cheaper per year than the latter. School #1 costs ~$38k /year and School #2 costs $30k per year and has offered me a $7k/year scholarship.

Without getting technical, I really prefer going to school #1, if money was not in the picture, as it is a highly respected and well-established school, and if I go to that school and perform well, all doors will be open to me when I choose my field.

School #2 is a new school, and is EXTREMELY well-funded, but as a new school it has it's drawbacks and limitations in that I would have a harder time getting into specialties than I would at school #1.

I'm fortunate in that my non-direct expenses will be covered, so I will be taking unsubsidized Stafford loans (current interest rate is 6.21%) to fund the entirety of my direct expenses (tuition being the biggest one).

Now, the reason I'm posting on /r/personalfinance:

School #1 is 15k/year more expensive. Over 4 years, that means my degree from school #1 will cost me an additional $60k/year in unsubsidized Stafford loans with an interest rate of 6.21%.

After graduation and moving into residency, I am going to live as cheaply as possible and start paying off my loans. As a resident I will have an income of $50-60k per year, with a highly variable COL depending on where I end up. I haven't any idea what my salary post-residency will be because it will depend on my specialty. Additionally the length of residency is also specialty dependent, anywhere from 3-7 years, and possible additional postgraduate training after that.

**So my question is this** - if I choose to school #1, what will be the real long-term implications on paying off my debt? How many additional years might I spend paying this off?

Tl;dr - choosing a medical school, what does an extra $60k in loans at 6.21% really mean in terms of how long it will take for me to crawl out of debt?",finance,1463673939

I'm a 22 year old student from the Netherlands and I'd like some outsiders' perspective. I've just finished my Bachelor's at the university of Amsterdam with 10k in debt. Seeing as tuition is only around 2k per year it's quite affordable. I borrowed the money for 3 years tuition and the rest I used for living costs. I've always had a job as well which I used to pay for fun stuff, vacations etc and I've got a little bit of money put aside (around 4K). My current situation isn't all to bleak I'd say. 

However, now I've been accepted to a Masters degree in Paris. The program is one of the best in Europe and generally I believe I'd have great chances of finding a job afterwards. (It's a master in management). However, it'll cost my around 30k for the 2 year degree and I'll also have to be able to live in Paris during that time. I won't have time to work on the side, as it'll be a very intense program. That'll be 24 months and I'll probably have to borrow about a thousand a month so that'd be 24k. This totals everything around 65k at the end. 

The good part is, I'm borrowing the money from the Dutch government and the current interest rate of 0,01%! That's not a typo, it's really that cheap for students to borrow money. The interest is fixed for five years and after that they might revise it. It's never been more than 1,8% though. Since the interest is so low, I'd probably even pay back less than I borrowed due to inflation. Regardless, 65k is still a large sum of money that ll take years to pay off.

personalfinance,$11k in universal life policy which is surprise! not that great. What to do with it?,"Long time lurker, first time poster under a new user name. I've read the wikis, and was hoping for some advice. Apologies for the post length, I'm hoping more information up front is better :)


**Backstory**

In November 2008 after the birth of our child, my ex-husband and I were talked into a variable universal life policy, which is a 'first to die' type life insurance coverage ($250,000, expiring 2079). My much younger and naive self understood it to be an investment fund I could pull from once it 'matured', and all the while keeping a life insurance policy till I was 100. Pay in for *x* years, and after *y* years, I no longer need to make payments, and it serves as life insurance *and* retirement. Sign me up!

My husband and I divorced in 2012, and in the paperwork he signed off any value of the policy to me - I continued to make the $150 a month payments. Shortly after that I saw a financial planner, and he recommended that I get term life... but did not recommend what to do with the current policy.

Today (yes, it took me a while to get around to this) I spent a long time on the phone with the provider trying to understand the dark underbelly of this product, and I'm pretty cheesed at my younger self. I've heard and read that universal life policies aren't a good deal, but my younger self was convinced this one was different.

Maybe this information is of no surprise to financial gurus, but I was surprised to learn:

* In order to have the insurance till age 100, the policy must cover the 'cost of insurance'. The cost of insurance is currently $50 of my $150 monthly payment, and will go up each month as I get older. I'm pretty damned sure this was not addressed during the sale.
* I can 'stop payments' whenever, so long as the continued monthly cost of the insurance is covered by the total policy. Which is tied to market performance. So it's not really a retirement fund, as it'll pull every month to cover the cost of the policy, and if the market tanks, and my policy value runs out, I would have to start making payments again in order to keep the policy + insurance rider. It is entirely possible (but not likely) that I will have to make $x payments forever in order to keep the policy going.
* There's no real number on performance or % value earning rate because of all the various places this policy is invested in (""Federated Govt Money"", ""Fidelity GrowOppor"", ""VirMultiSectorFxdInc"", etc)

I am now remarried, in a pretty well-to-do dual income family. We both have a few term life policies through our excellent employers, including disability. I'm not really worried about having life insurance at age 80, as I'll be leaving behind some kind of estate. Obviously I want term life, as if I die before my daughter is 30, I'd like her to have some support.


**The Short**

This policy is currently valued at $11,300. Surrender charge is $1680, leaving net surrender value at $9600.
Over the past 7.5 years I have paid ~$13,500 into the policy, of which ~$4500 was the $50/month 'insurance cost'. Meaning that I've actually put $9000 into the investment side, and it's grown $2300 over the past 7.5 years. 
I suspect I could be getting much better investment value elsewhere, without having to pay $50/month to do so, when I already have term life.


**The Questions**

The surrender charge disappears at the 10year mark - November 2018.

* Do I surrender this now, take the $9600 and stash it elsewhere? And if so, where?
* Given the surrender charge as a percentage of the value, do I wait the two years to surrender this and *then* invest it.
* Or am I missing something entirely and this is worth keeping forever? The bonus is that I'd have life insurance on my ex-husband as well, to help support our child if something happens, as he doesn't have any other kind of life insurance (but he is leaving this entirely up to me).

personalfinance,Budgeting for home improvement questions.,"We have recently purchased a home and while we got a great deal for our area (comps are ~50K higher) we have some dead trees to deal with, a roof to strip and re-shingle, and a driveway to have redone.  My wife and I both work full time and likely will want pros to do all of this work (warranties, insured, etc).

We keep a sizable amount in savings as an emergency fund, doing the pretty liberal math we have about $8,000 more than 6 months of emergency funds (assuming a sudden loss of BOTH incomes), but we're looking at $22,000 in total improvements.

My question is, what should I be thinking about to either finance the home improvements (roughly $22,000) or make it more manageable?  We have pretty exceptional credit, so I was thinking I could put it (or a lot of it) on a new card (hopefully earning cash back or another reward) with 0% APR for 15 months, pay it down over that time, near the end of that 15 months see about a balance transfer to my ""regular card"" if I get my normal reward from a balance transfer to ""double dip"" on rewards and then immediately pay off the balance before making paying any interest.  Doing this I don't see us ever depleting our savings lower than a safe point, but I've never done anything like that before.

Other ideas seem like a home improvement loan, but I don't like the interest rate/finance charges that I've found.  Seems like I could get a better interest rate with a home equity loan, but I'm not sure how much more my home would appraise for (if at all) so soon after purchase, or if the cost of a new appraisal would be worth it.

Anyone have ideas I haven't thought of or insight?  Did I provide enough information?  We could outright afford all of the improvements, but it would raid our savings and leave us with a solid $6,000 left in the bank (seems like a bad idea).  Lastly, we don't HAVE to do anything now except maybe get the trees taken down before they fall (~$1300), we can just save up for a roof, and then a driveway, but we would like to have our home squared away.

personalfinance,Should I refinance for 20yrs or 30yrs?,"My wife and I are considering rolling an 80/20 mortgage into a single loan now that we have equity in the house. I was offered a 4%@30yr and a 3.75@20. We refinanced 5 years ago to take advantage of the interest rates, but couldn't roll the 20% in yet. We took another 30year. We've lived in the house 10 years.

My primal brain tells me I should take the 20yr, get the lower interest rate and be ""back on track"". My pragmatic brain says take the 30yr and take on the debt accrued on credit cards for home repair.

I ""think"" it makes more sense to have a lower payment, have flexibility to pay more on principal once my debt is gone and learn not to worry about the ""length"" of the loan. Paying down my debt, even though it's on low interest credit cards, seems the prudent move.

personalfinance,"I'm making enough money to care, but I'm uninformed; need a heads-up. (US-SC)","Hello finance people. I just accepted a position from a California company at a yearly rate of $80,000 and will be working from home in South Carolina. By my best 30 minutes of research I estimate I'm going to get $4,666.67 a month, out of the $6,666.66. My previous pay was $65,000, and before that $40,000. While I'm excited to see my gross pay go up, I'm noticing that the take home doesn't really seem to be shifting quite as drastically on a bi-weekly basis as I had hoped. 

I understand nothing about taxes. I've been a ""plug it in TurboTax!"" guy since I joined the military and I've never really had a care about it. I'm older now, several kids, and I haven't been able to make any decent contributions towards retirement in years. I have 3 children, 6, 7, 11 years of age, they are either naturally mine or adopted step-children (therefore, all are legally my children). We're SC residents.

personalfinance,Where do I even start?,"I'm trying to get my house in order, so to speak. I've read quite a bit on here, including the entire wiki article on Debt and Credit Repair, but I'm still not quite sure where to begin. For anyone reading this who has not yet begun college, pay close attention, I made nearly every mistake available; try not to do what I did.

All debts in question are related to a private university in VA, but they were all borrowed and cosigned under NC addresses. As such, my tuition for 3 semesters (before I finally realized what I was doing to myself) hit roughly the $18,000-$19,000 mark. These were all federally insured.

I also let myself get talked into approximately $26,000-$27,000 total in two ""Tuition Answer"" loans during my 2nd and 3rd semesters. These were both private loans. 

All loans were borrowed through Sallie Mae. I attended spring and fall in '05, and spring in '06.

When I realized how badly I was messing up, I moved back home, enrolled in the community college here, and went back to work. Well, at least I tried to go back to work. This was the beginning of a long period of being severely underemployed. The only time I have managed full-time work since then was as a car salesmen for a dealership that bankrupted after working there for 6 months; and business was so bad that it ended up being a minimum wage job for all but 1 month I was there.

I ended up leaving the community college as well and moved to another even closer school, that did not qualify to keep my loans in deferment or whatever the grace period is called while you are still a student. 

My loans came due in, if I remember correctly, around June of '07. I made what payments I could, but in short order I managed to default on every one of them.

Later on, through a combination of windfalls and being a complete tightwad I managed to pay off 2 of the federal loans totaling about
$7,000. The rest of those landed me on the tax offset list. I managed to get into the rehabilitation program and those loans have just been bought by a new creditor.

The private loans on the other hand have barely been touched. I'm not even sure who really owns them anymore. 

I received a collections notice pertaining to one of them that explicitly states the loan is beyond the SOL for them to pursue legal action against me. It also offered a settlement for $9,000, which is less than half of what the loan amounts to, *if* it is even legitimately my loan. The company also called me, trying to collect, at which time I told them I needed any paperwork the had about the loan before I could speak to them. They called again a couple of days later, honestly harassing me, and asking ""What are your plans in relation to this debt?"" I tried to remind them of our previous conversation (same guy) but he got rude and I got angry. While I acknowledged that I owed ""a loan""  I told them I could not make any deals related to that loan until they sent me ""any and all paperwork they have pertaining to that loan, so that I can be sure it's actually mine."" I have at least one of their calls recorded, but unfortunately I don't have that one. Regardless, that was over a month ago and I have received no further calls or correspondence from that company.

Further background. My grandmother is my cosigner. Long story short, I and my family live with her and I am her caretaker. Other than a couple of cousins, one of my sisters, my parents and my family, everyone else has abandoned her. She has been very good to me and I want to do anything I can for her. About 4 years ago I had enough saved up that I was able to settle her last credit card. Now her only remaining debts are tied to her house. She started having memory issues and I had to step and kill my savings again to prevent one massive mistake she made from causing her house to be foreclosed; afterward her doctor told her she needed to pick someone to handle her finances. She picked me, and since then (other than a brief period where one of her children tried and nearly succeeded in taking over her entire life and selling her stuff) I have been responsible for that. I have been able to help her nearly get rid of her primary mortgage, it's down to about $10,000-$11,000. She has a second one though that is still close to $20,000. The second one though, seems to have some serious issues. They have screwed up the paperwork so that her address is no longer the one listed as collateral; and I'm pretty sure they have failed to record some of her payments (I'm trying to find paperwork to prove that). I'm wondering if she has legal grounds to have that debt canceled.

Lastly, I have a significant windfall of a bit over $20,000; in addition to my work situation finally improving after all these years. I'm on the verge of being able to make payments toward something beyond basic utilities and food (which has honestly  been mostly EBT for the last few years) and want to get all this straightened out as best I can.

I am listed to inherit my grandmother's house, so even beyond removing the burden from her it is in my best interests to make sure it's payed for; I and my family are homeless if anything goes wrong there. Past experience has taught me how tenuous a hold we really have on anything, and I do *not* trust the market to keep a job for me.

My plan (before I started learning about SOL's on loans) was to try to settle both private loans, specifically with a deletion for as little as possible (hopefully $7,000-$9,000 apiece) and to hold the rest in reserve to make continuous payments on the federal loans I consolidated. I was hoping this would clean up both mine and my grandmother's credit enough to allow her to consolidate both her mortgages, under a lower interest rate with the credit union I helped her join. I was also planning to have my name added to the loan in order to remove any chance of the bank trying to bypass me and hold a fire sale if she passes before I can get her house paid off.

Is this a decent plan? Knowing that at least one loan is beyond the SOL should I just ignore it for now? How do I find information about these loans and yet also be sure I don't reset any SOL's? Should I just jump ahead and pay the primary mortgage off? Is it possible I have a chance of forcing them to remove the secondary mortgage? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1463693214

personalfinance,Huge debt causing major depression and anxiety... please help!,"I know this subreddit is forgiving, so I'll just spill the beans:

Honestly, don't know where to begin. All I can ever think of most of the day for the past few years is the huge chunk of change I owe. I graduated from college with a graduate degree and managed to rack up about $100,000 in student loan debt. I've paid back here and there, but I've always just put my loans on forbearance, and so now the amount is currently at $107,000, for whatever reason. I've never consolidated the loans, but today I considered consolidation under an IBR plan... just as a measure to take a step forward. To make matters just a wee bit worse, I owe roughly approximately $30,000 in credit cards, which I have not been paying for about 6-7 months now... because of the ridiculous interest rates which make the minimum payments completely unaffordable. On top of that I have scattered medical bills, IRS tax bills, and miscellaneous bills. I have the typical daily/monthly expenses that almost deter me from making any payments toward my debts.... but I try to keep them as low as possible. Tried bankruptcy and the attorney said it was not possible because I bought a new car recently (my old car was basically useless).

Well, this is all the reason for my post. Since I've graduated I have felt insufficient, lost, and straight up incompetent at anything I do. It's almost as if I'm paralyzed, this is so debilitating. Had to see the psychiatrist and now I'm on meds to help reduce anxiety and make my life a bit happier. NOT GONNA LIE, since I've stopped paying my credit cards and student loans, I've had a good amount of money to actually live life with, which has made me somewhat happier. But the fact that my loans aren't going anywhere doesn't reassure me at all.

I make approximately pre-tax $45,000 income a year, which usually leaves me with an AGI of $23,000 after business expenses. I'll try to break down my situation / budget below and include interest rates, amounts, etc.

I currently have $7k left on my student loan (4.75% interest rate). I started with $42k total (+ $7k credit card debt and $4k in car payments, which we have also paid off -- we live way below our means) and my husband and I have been able to knock that down in less than two years with a combined income of $105k last year (July 7 will be exactly two years since I started working as a nurse).

I've been putting 20% into my 401k. I have about $16k in there now, but I am already 28 years old (so, yes, very behind). My husband is in nursing school, but works part-time (so we're making a lot less this year than last), and has about $10k in his (also 28 years old).

Would it make sense to decrease my contribution to 10% or even 6% (what my employer matches) to pay off my loan sooner? I was able to pay of $4k of it just this month alone (April was a 3-paycheck month and I picked up a lot of overtime, which hasn't been possible this month).

I am debating whether or not I should use what I have saved up to pay off my loans. I have three options:  
1. Pay as much as possible toward debts now, and get that monkey off my back ASAP.    
2. Pay a large amount off, but leave enough in so that I'll have a balance of $18.5k two years from now. (I'll be eligible for a grant for that amount at that time)  
3. Make minimum payments for 7 years, have the entire balance forgiven   

I've already paid in 15k so far. I'm just trying to find the most cost-effective way to do this. At one point, I had calculated out that I would save about 40k by going the full forgiveness route. Now I don't trust my math. Here's what I owe currently:

UPDATE: This thread was basically dead to begin with, but I wanted to update it in case anybody else is in this situation in the future. I decided to go with option two, and just paid off the loan with the highest interest rate. I decided to go with option two because the sooner I pay off the loans, the sooner my debt-to-income ratio becomes more bearable.

personalfinance,"Dropped out of college, massively in debt. What to do now?","Hi personalfinance,

Right now, I'm massively in debt and have no degree or anything to show for it. I've put in about 4 years or so at a private college (which honestly was a huge mistake), but last year it finally hit me just how *much* money I owed. I never borrowed more than I needed, but this was a private school and I did live on campus. Right now, I'm sitting on top of about 68K worth of student debt, divided into two loans that are about 34K-ish each. Realizing how much debt I had and how poor my job outlook was like, I panicked and dropped out before I had to go back for another semester to finish my bachelor's.

Right now I'm working full time at a little retail store making minimum wage ($8.50/hour). I'm 25 and still live at home, so my bills outside of the student loans aren't massive. But even if I did start putting the brunt of my income towards my loan, it would take years just to pay off one of them. My family is okay with me living at home, but in my mind I know it's not ""socially"" acceptable to be in this position, so I'll have to move out eventually.

I guess my question is this: do I take on more debt (about 11K-ish) to finish my bachelor's in hopes that I can find a better job, or keep my nose to the grindstone and keep making loan payments, hoping that a better, non-degree job comes along? I've been looking for other part time work but haven't been having a ton of luck. 

Also, it's probably worth noting that I was one of those kids that should have never gone to college, but was fed the ""you'll never be successful without college"" propaganda and did anyway. I started with an art major, which then changed to Japanese studies, because I was told to pursue ""what interests me"".

financialindependence,Need some military RE strategy advice,"So here's where I'm at. I've been active duty enlisted for 17 years and I'm looking to RE in 6 years at 23 years of service at the age of 40. There are a number of reasons I've picked 23 years as a target, and they mostly have to do with deployment/assignment schedules that can't be changed (If I stay beyond 23 years I will be in a bad spot for another set of deployments). 


I was in a fairly good financial situation when I discovered FI two years ago but since then I've been 
very driven to make this happen. So here's where I am at.


Married, wife works as a teacher. Two kids who are 6 and 3 now. As of this month I/we have just clawed our way out of a pretty good pile of consumer debt and car payments. I am proud to say that the only debt we now hold is a mortgage on our primary residence of 194k (house appraised at 260k, 20 year mortgage at 4% just refinanced to that rate this month), and a mortgage on a rental property of 89k (worth 155k, 15 year mortgage at 2.65% 10 years remaining). 


Current assets are
Residence      260k
Rental house  155k
TSP                  70k
403b (wife)     35k
IRA (wife)         37k
CDs                  11k
Prosper acct.    2k
Money Market   9k (This is my E-fund. Artificially low because I took money out to close on the refinance.) 


Not listing cars, collectibles furniture for this. Net worth passed through 300k a little while back and is steadily climbing. 


The question I have now is... Now that the credit cards and car payments are gone I've freed up about 800 dollars a month in my budget. My ideal situation would be to pay off the rental house the month that I retire and turn the current situation (1000/mo mortgage, 1300/mo rent, 300 cash flow) into 1300/mo income to supplement my estimated 2300/mo (after tax) pension. This level of income will be more than sufficient to replace the 4600/mo (after tax and all investments) that I take home now as other bills like my 600/mo daycare bill will be gone when I RE. My wife plans to keep working (even though she won't have to), and I plan on working at my leisure fixing old BMWs for a friends shop. 


I already calculated that it would take me adding 650/mo to the mortgage to make that happen. However I hate to put that money towards the mortgage with such a low interest rate. 


I've got about 500/mo I could put into my TSP now 
that would max it out, but I kind of need that rental paid off from a cash flow point of view. What can I do with this money to grow it, but then be able to use it to get rid of the rental mortgage? 


I don't plan on touching my TSP money or my wife's IRA or 403b for a long time. I plan on our financial situation getting better and better on its own as the primary mortgage gets paid off, we collect SS, and we monetize the TSP, IRA and 403b.

financialindependence,Help: Does going down the RE(FI) route make sense for my situation?,"First, let me apologize for the wall of text below. I have read the FAQ and will try to follow the posting guidelines.

A bit about my situation first:

* 27, M, Greater NYC Area (not inside city limits)
* Savings: ~230k USD in savings accounts
* Investments: Old 401k with 25k. Current 401k with 20k.

Income:
&gt; * Salary only. Total comp (all cash, no stocks, pretax) was 225k last year. Should be 240-250k this year. I think I can increase this by ~15-20k per year on average if I keep performing and don't get fired.
&gt; * Misc interest/dividends: 100? Should be on DRIP. 

Expenses:
&gt; 
&gt; * Rent: 2300 all included for a 1bdrm.
&gt; * Gym: 100.
&gt; * Phone: 75.
&gt; * Internet: 60.
&gt; * Groceries: 250.
&gt; * Eating out/Entertainment: 300?
&gt; * Commute: 100
&gt; * Random online purchases: 400?
&gt; * Travel: 500 (This is a yearly average and something that I don't want to compromise on for my own sanity).
&gt; * Total: ~4000

I don't have a car and paid off student loans from internships, so I think I've been very lucky so far.

With the various FIRE calculators I've found online, I think I can reach FI comfortably with 1.5M of liquid assets, which at my current savings rate is attainable in ~7 years. 
Also, the 230k in savings accounts seems weird, but I've always worked in an industry with very restrictive personal investment options, so I'm trying to figure out better ways to park the 230k of savings instead of letting it bleed from negative real interest rates in savings accounts. My current employer has less restrictive rules, so I can perhaps move them to fixed income products. I don't really want to get into commodities or fx, which I have no restrictions on. I'm wary of the unusually long bull market we've been in though, so I have no problem sitting on cash for another year or two.

Ok, so now for my real question. I realize that I've been very lucky and fortunate to be in this situation. It was a lot of hard work and also a lot of dumb luck. My problem is that I don't really know what I want to do with my life. I certainly don't enjoy my job and can get very stressed out from it. However, if I were to find 1.5M on the street today, I'm not sure what I'd do with myself. For those of you that are further down the FI path - is this something you figured out when you started out, or did you only figure it out after reaching your FI goal?

While I don't think I'm doing a great job at saving, I think I'm doing a decent job at keeping my expenses reasonable. However, I am not really enjoying life right now. It's just a lot of work, stress, interrupted by occasional boredom. Now, I don't think I could spend myself happy, but I think I might become happier if I move to e.g. Manhattan. This could push my rent above 3000, and would likely triple the amount spent on my commute and double the eating out/entertainment expenses. That would bring my monthly expenses above 5000. Add city tax to that and it'd get close to 6000. I'm having a hard time deciding if that's worth the chance of having a somewhat more interesting social life and thus making life more ""enjoyable"" if you will.

One alternative for me is to buy a car. That'd extend my choice of things to do where I live by a lot. I live in a decently suburban area, but haven't bought a car yet since I live very close to the train station and can take the train to work. This would be a lot less expensive than moving to Manhattan.

The other choice that I have is to continue down my current road, work hard, and hopefully become FI and find something less stressful to do when I'm 34. Somehow that doesn't sound so enticing as it's 7 (boring) years away. 

Please poke holes in my thinking and show me the light. Is there something I am missing? Am I missing an obvious third option? I'm having a hard time ""thinking outside the box"". Any general life advice would also be highly appreciated!

personalfinance,How To Improve My Wife's Credit In 3 Years,"edit: I see that someone else made a very similar post a few hours ago, but I'll clarify that mine is different because we're already here in the US and have done the typical joint mortgage/credit card thing and am looking for other ways to improve.

We want to sell our current home and buy another home in about three years, need to do whatever we can to improve her credit.

She's Japanese (with a ""green card""), so she has a very short credit history. We only moved back here to US a few years ago, I'm an American citizen.

- My FICO score is 814, my Wife's is currently 691, was around 650 when we applied for our current mortgage.
- We currently have a joint mortgage for ~$380,000
- We lease cheap vehicles, currently one year left on both leases (both under $200/mo)
- We have 2 joint credit cards, one with a ~$30,000 limit and one with a ~$5000 limit (fairly new account, 3 years old)
- Total credit usage is consistently less than 5%


We have no other debt and no credit problems, but when we applied for our mortgage a couple years ago we were declined by our bank and went with a private mortgage company, for which we did not qualify for the absolute lowest rate, not a terrible rate by any means at 3.8%, but if her credit was better we could have qualified for ~3.4% according to the lender.

What can we do over the next three years other than make payments on time? I think for our next car leases I'm going to do a joint-application so the payments can go on both of our reports. But what else can I do? Should we open some kind of new accounts for her? Or avoid opening any new accounts altogether?

Any advice would be appreciated, our next home purchase is going to be a big one and likely our ""forever home"", so getting the lowest interest rate possible is a big deal.

worldpolitics,Corrupt government officials are using Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to funnel billions of taxpayer dollars to their cronies in Wall Street banks,"The U.S. Government Is Quietly Paying Billions to Wall Street Banks

By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: May 20, 2016 
http://wallstreetonparade.com/2016/05/the-u-s-government-is-quietly-paying-billions-to-wall-street-banks/

Wall Street On Parade has learned, by piecing together the SEC filings of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and previous Federal Reserve studies, that these two companies that have been in U.S. government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis, continue to pay out billions of dollars to the biggest Wall Street banks on their derivatives contracts.

This raises multiple red flags, not the least of which is how much does the U.S. public really understand about the 2008 financial crisis and what appears to be a continuing taxpayer bailout. It is well known at this point that AIG had to be bailed out because it owed over $90 billion on its derivative and security loan contracts to Wall Street and foreign banks. Now, it’s looking like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also Wall Street’s derivatives patsies – or “dumb tourists” as author Michael Lewis might say.

According to Freddie Mac’s first quarter 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this is how much it has paid to its derivatives counterparties in just the past four years: $2.1 billion in 2015; $2.6 billion in 2014; $3.46 billion in 2013; and $3.8 billion in 2012. Fannie Mae’s payouts have been smaller than Freddie Mac’s.

We could not find comparable data for Freddie Mac for the crisis years but its 10K for the first quarter of 2011 shows total derivative losses (declines in the value of its derivatives portfolio plus payouts to counterparties) as follows: $8 billion in 2010; $1.9 billion in 2009; and a stunning $14.95 billion in 2008.

Both the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis have conceded in separate studies that placing Freddie and Fannie under U.S. government conservatorship was critical to stemming the bleeding of the big Wall Street banks because of their derivatives counterparty status. The New York Fed’s staff report of March 2015 noted the following:

“Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held large positions in interest rate derivatives for hedging. A disorderly failure of these firms would have caused serious disruptions for their derivative counterparties.”

A 2010 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis backs up the New York Fed’s more recent assessment, noting:

“The failure of Fannie and Freddie would have led to a winding down of large quantities of swaps with the usual systemic consequences. The mere quantity of transactions would have led to fire sales and invariably to liquidity funding problems for some of Fannie and Freddie’s OTC counterparties. Moreover, counterparties of Fannie and Freddie in a derivative contract might need to re-intermediate the contract right away, as it might be serving as a hedge of some underlying commercial risks. Therefore, due to counterparties’ liquidating the existing derivatives all at once and replacing their derivative positions at the same time, the markets would almost surely be destabilized due to the pure number of trades, required payment and settlement activity, and induced uncertainty, and the fact that this was taking place during a crisis.”

Why do we believe the derivatives counterparties to Freddie and Fannie are the big Wall Street banks? Because according to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s 2015 fourth quarter report on derivatives, the following Wall Street banks are holding over 90 percent of all derivatives: JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley’s bank holding company.

On May 11, we asked Freddie Mac’s media relations department to provide us with its three largest counterparties in terms of payouts. It responded: “We do not make this information public.” We responded to that communication as follows:

“Freddie Mac is currently, as you know, a ward of the taxpayer with a lifeline to the taxpayer’s pocketbook via the U.S. Treasury.

“I’m a member of the press who is keeping the taxpayer informed about the continuing Wall Street bailout.

“Both the taxpayer and the press have a right to know which Wall Street firms are receiving these massive sums from Freddie Mac.

“You have offered no legal basis to justify your refusal to provide this information.

“Upon information and belief, each of these key counterparties to Freddie Mac are publicly traded and the investing public has a right to know exactly how these publicly traded firms are earning their profits.

“It could, potentially, be a violation of securities law to withhold this information from shareholders of Freddie Mac and the shareholders of the counterparties that trade publicly.

“If you won’t supply this information, it will require me to file a FOIA with FHFA, which will burden me and the taxpayer further.

“On March 19, 2009, under President Obama’s orders, the Attorney General’s office issued detailed guidelines on how Federal agencies were to respond going forward to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.  The guidelines instructed the agencies as follows:

“ ‘The key frame of reference for this new mind set is the purpose behind the FOIA. The statute is designed to open agency activity to the light of day. As the Supreme Court has declared: ‘FOIA is often explained as a means for citizens to know what their Government is up to.’ NARA v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 171 (2004) (quoting U.S. Department of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989)…The President’s FOIA Memoranda directly links transparency with accountability which, in turn, is a requirement of a democracy. The President recognized the FOIA as ‘the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring open Government.’  Agency personnel, therefore, should keep the purpose of the FOIA — ensuring an open Government — foremost in their mind.’

“Since Freddie Mac is a ward of the government, I think you should also place a high priority on the ‘national commitment to ensuring open Government’ and provide me with this very basic information.”

As is typical with our “transparent” government, we have heard nothing further. (See related articles below.)

This is all starting to sound very similar to Wall Street’s other heist of the century: selling derivatives known as interest rate swaps to states, counties and municipalities that locked the taxpayer into paying Wall Street banks tens of billions of dollars as a result of Wall Street cratering the U.S. economy and driving down interest rates. As we previously reported in 2012:

“In March 2010, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) issued a report indicating that from 2006 through early 2008 banks are estimated to have collected as much as $28 billion in termination fees from state and local governments who were desperate to exit the abusive interest rate swaps.  That amount does not include the ongoing outsized interest payments that were and are being paid. Experts believe that billions of abusive swaps may be as yet unacknowledged by embarrassed municipalities.

“In 2009, the Auditor General of Pennsylvania, Jack Wagner, found that 626 swaps were done in Pennsylvania between October 2003 and June 2009, covering $14.9 billion in municipal bonds.  That encompassed 107 of Pennsylvania’s 500 school districts and 86 other local governments.  The swaps were sold to the municipalities by Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.

“In one case cited by Wagner, the Bethlehem Area School entered into 13 different swaps, covering $272.9 million in debt for school construction projects.  Two swaps which had concluded at the time of Wagner’s investigation cost taxpayers $10.2 million more than if the district had issued a standard fixed-rate bond or note and $15.5 million more than if the district had simply paid the interest on the variable-rate note without any swaps at all.”

Which brings us to the final question: when is a sharp-eyed financial expert with no ties to Wall Street going to carefully evaluate why Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have not unwound these derivatives. According to Freddie and Fannie’s own SEC filings, they are already managing interest rate risk by issuing short and long term debt while also making various amounts of the debt callable and non callable.

When there are 6,000 banks in the U.S. but only five of them are compelled to hold over 90 percent of hundreds of trillions of dollars in derivatives, it’s time for the American people to demand and receive cogent answers. That is unlikely to happen without the political revolution that Senator Bernie Sanders is calling for.",finance,1463759526

personalfinance,Received Summary of Adjustments for 2013 tax return,"I just received in the mail from the VA Dept. of Taxation a ""Notice of Proposed Assessment"" on my 2013 Virginia individual income tax return.
It states that they compared my state return with my federal return and they did not match, and attached a listing of adjustments, culminating in a new amount due, in contrast to the original refund that I had received.

I filed myself via the state free file fillable forms, and think that the issue may stem from the fact that mid way through FY 2013, I moved from DC to VA (my work was consistently in VA). So my W2 shows two entries for ""State wages, tips, etc"" one for DC, and one for VA, basically splitting my income.

I entered the value for my VA state wages tips etc, and similarly for my VA state income tax witholdings, on my VA tax return. However, in the adjustments that this notice shows, it ""corrects"" my Federal AGI and Virginia Taxable Income by raising them to my total income for FY 2013 (which is, of course, what my federal return shows).

So, while I'm not ruling out the possibility that I mis-filed somehow, I do feel like I should not be paying VA back for taxes on income that I actually paid DC for. The notice says that I should either pay, or send IRS documentation in support of protests to the assessment.

Can I send in my W2 and point out that my income was indeed supposed to be split between DC and VA?",finance,1463761826

personalfinance,[AUS] Should I buy an apartment?,"**My situation**

I am 25 years old and have had quite enough of living with my parents at home. I'm looking at options for moving out, and wanted to get some input of the considerations I should be weighing up from a personal finance perspective.

Generally speaking, my options are to rent or to buy. Rent in the areas I'm looking at, in a one bedroom apartment, is somewhere in the region of $400-500 a week. The purchase price of those same apartments (not including fees, taxes, etc) is $380,000 - 480,000.

I currently earn $65,000 (before tax). This is my first job, and I'm expecting that to increase in the coming years (barring major shocks to the economy causing me to lose my job).

**Reasons to buy**

* Parents have offered to gift me $80,000 for a deposit

* Rent is extremely expensive (up to $2,000 a month) and that is money ""thrown away""

* Security of owning your own place

* Historically low interest rates with banks predicting further rate cuts in the coming months / years.

**Reasons to rent**

* Uncertainty about the property market in Australia, especially the apartment market. Recent figures suggest that there are an enormous amount of new apartment constructions expected to be completed in the next two years which could leave as much as an 18 month overhang in supply. I would hate to take on $350,000 in debt only to have the value of my apartment drop by 30%.

* I'm young, and I don't necessarily want to stay in the city I'm in long-term. I'm wondering whether it might still be worth buying and just rent the place out if I choose to leave?

* Extra costs associated with ownership - body corporate fees, rates, etc. are as much as $4,000 per year in some of these apartment complexes.

ethereum,Federated Ownership,"So, for the longest time, I've been rather wranckled by the fact that I have to pay rent. I literally hate moving, and just wish I could do anything to get out of having to piss my money away. I want to join a federated investment/payment/rule based all-across-the-states investment venture. Here are the would be goals:

  * I want to be able to pay a payment, and be able to have a spot in most major cities

  * When I move, I want what I've accumulated in payments to go with me

  * I pay some extra to be able for the system to have a surplus

  * New people are added on based on consensus and a contractual obligation to keep paying, be neat, and do their part to maintain the property

  * Violators that do not do their portion will lose a portion of what they have paid in before being ejected from the system

  * Sales &amp; Purchases are negotiated based on consensus and
  
  * People can inhabit one of the units that have been adopted

  * People can pay more than the monthly minimum, but what they pay is reflected as a portion of ownership. 


There can be more added to it, but I hate the housing market, and the whole way that it works and almost everything about it. From mortgages run by greedy banks to the whole bubble... I don't want to be a part of it honestly, and I've been agonizing over the fact that it's one of the biggest investments of an entire career. I don't want to participate in the greed.

ethereum,Federated Investment and Banking Services,"Suppose one were to join what would otherwise be a bank today, but instead of them investing your money, keeping the profits and charging you a fee as well as locking up your money, the investment service were partially mechanized by an ethereum. Certainly somewhere a human will make analysis and perform operations with other people's ether - but only their behalf and with consent.

Why is this better than normal banking? Because you can see what people are doing with the money, and alter micro operations in the event that you don't want a particular direction to be taken. In addition, they can't fundamentally freeze your money or penalize you, and there would be required consensus on advice of investment prior to it occurring. Lastly, I think one thing that's really valuable here is the elimination from other people profiteering off of *your* money almost entirely. The people that should gain are those than put the money in. Not the banks, right? Imagine if banks had paid their profit to those that held investment or mortgages in them.

But there has to be some level of exchanged promise that each member of the collective gives to the whole. In particular, limits may be set at which monies and investment amounts are *mechanically slowed* prior to being extracted, still allowed, but intended to provide time to those on the other end of the movement.",cryptocurrency,1463788469

I didn't really give it any thought and I knew I was grandfathered into this low-payment plan so I stuck with it. They were charging me like $80 to $150 per month, I had maybe 30-40k in loans and it wasn't anything I couldn't handle, so there it went. 

I finally took some time 15 years later to look at my loans and it looks like everything's current and all is good. I owe maybe $10k for the payoff now, and it shows when I do the payoff calculator that I owe another $5 in interest, if I pay it off now. 

Average interest rates are between 2 and 3 percent. Knowing what I know now about amortization (which is pretty basic), I figure at this point I've paid off most of the interest that it doesn't really make sense to payoff early, except to maybe to just get it done.

Since January of 2015, I have managed to bring my outstanding balance down to $10,500. I would like some opinions about whether or not my plan of attack is in my best interest. Below are some more details about my income and expenses. 

I bring home $2600 in take-home pay per month. I receive health and dental insurance through my work. Last month I began a Roth 401k through my employer. They don't begin matching contributions until 6 months from now, and I am contributing a very modest 3% until I pay off my student loan (I have a grand total thus far of $150). 

I have the following expenses: 

- $400/month in rent, utilities included (I rent a room in my friend's town home; I know this is a total gem, especially in Southern California)
- $75/month for my cell phone 
- $130/month for my car insurance 
- $250/month for my car payment (this is to my dad, and I'll be done in 14 months)

What I do, essentially, is pay all of these bills, set aside about $150 every two weeks for gas, groceries, and miscellaneous expenses, and then throw literally everything else at this loan. My question is, then, is this the best plan of attack? I have no savings but have unfortunately become complacent knowing my parents 1) live in the same city and 2) would be willing to help in a crisis. Should I increase my 401k contribution? Set aside some savings? Take it easy on my student loan payments?

ONE HALF of a decent duplex in the blue collar side of town (not suburbs), runs about $1.2m. That gets you roughly 1500 - 1800 sqft (both top and bottom). Buying would swallow the majority of our savings for down payment, and the mortgage would still be $1m! At today's interest rates, that works out to roughly $4.5k a month for a 25 year amortization period. I'm guessing another $1k a month for property tax, home insurance, maintenance etc. Currently, we can service this debt and still save for retirement. However, the concentrated and highly leveraged exposure feels incredibly risky to me. If I were to lose my ability to earn a decent income, or if interest rates return to historical norms, we would be in financial ruin.

personalfinance,"Wanting a fresh start, need advice on next steps (NZ)","Hi guys. I x-posted this in /r/personalfinanceNZ but I'd also like to hear from everyone here. I hope you can help me decide what to do. I'm in my late twenties and have recently come to realise how terrible I have been with regards to my finances in my earlier working years. I have been reading through old posts here, PF NZ, /r/YNAB now for a few months which has given me a really good perspective on my spending and my financial goals. Now here's the thing, I would like some advice with regards to paying off some of my debt using the meager savings I have at the moment or should I just leave it as is right now. P.S. English is not my first language so apologies if some things will be unclear.


Here are some details:

* Just started a new job that pays NZD 55k annually, gross. This is a step up from my previous job that paid me 40+k annually. Rent is pretty expensive (I live in Auckland with a flatmate) and expenses come down to around NZD 400+ weekly including utilities.


Debts: 

* Personal loan at my bank of NZD 20k which I have now down to 16k. I pay 220 a fortnight for this. 17.95% interest. OUCH.

* Car loan of 9k (16% interest) which I pay 110 fortnightly

* Another personal loan of 4k (which I had to take out some months ago due to an emergency and now regret terribly, I should've just used my savings) at 15.99% interest

* No credit card debts and no student loans


Now all of the payments are really hitting me hard and every payday I end up just allocating everything to utilities and debt repayments. I make sure to allocate a percentage to my savings account as soon as my pay comes in. 


What I've got in the bank now is
* In my current account, enough for my rent for the next couple of weeks and other utilities so around 1,500

* I've got 7k in a high interest savings account

* A tidy amount in KiwiSaver but not touching any of it (KiwiSaver = long term savings plan for retirement here in NZ, I'm at 4% employer-matching)


My question now is, should I pay off the personal loan debt of 4k now using my savings? And start chipping away at the rest of my debt. Or should I consider debt consolidation and take the stress out of paying off at different times and take advantage of a lower interest rate compared to the 17.95% one.


Right now I'm leaning towards paying off the 4k one to at least pay off one debt, and add the 100 or so fortnightly I've been allocating towards it to my savings and start rebuilding it. I'm just scared that since it brings my savings back down I might have another emergency that will make me fall back into taking out another loan to cover for it :-( But hopefully not. 


And also does anyone have some advice about what I can do regarding the 17.95% interest loan I've got which I'm paying off for another 4 years. Would it be possible for me to talk to the bank and negotiate a lower interest rate? Or would a loan transfer be possible? It is so disheartening paying 220 a fortnight and see the interest take back another 200. But that's what I get for borrowing aye.


Any thoughts for me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks very much in advance.",finance,1463825929

personalfinance,Figuring out 'forgiveness' with government loans,"xposted to /r/StudentLoans 

Hi there, I have about $70K in William D Ford Federal Direct loans acquired during 4 years of undergrad and 6 years of grad school. I managed to luck out and graduate during the very low interest rate days of the early 2000's.

*     I have two loans (I consolidated at some point) with 2.1% and 2.6% interest.
*     I have been paying the minimums on both consistently for about 12 years, since getting my final grad degree. I'm currently in IBR and it's very manageable.
*     I have been working in a variety of jobs in private research labs and public Universities (in the US).

At times over the years I've called the student loan info numbers and asked about loan forgiveness and I've gotten so many different contradictory and confusing answers, I don't really know where I stand anymore.

*   Some (but not all) of the places I've worked have been considered eligible for the 10 year forgiveness programs. Others have not.

*  5 years ago when my loans were still being serviced by the main government loans department, I was told by one worker to get paystubs and contracts from all of the places I'd worked dating back to my PhD research assistant positions. I did that (it took me weeks). I scanned and emailed them, and sent in hardcopies. They were supposed to look them over with me and tell me where I stood in terms of forgiveness timelines.

*  However at that same time, my loans were transferred to Great Lakes for servicing and no one there ever received any of those files. Great Lakes is less willing to help me look over piles of documents to figure out where I stand in terms of forgiveness and various months of payments made when employed at this University or that one.

*   I am now working at a University that I'm told by colleagues does qualify for the accelerated forgiveness, but when I try to sort through the various information about my past employment history and which employer qualified and how many payments I made while working there, I get totally lost.

*  I have read all of the information on forgiveness of loans, but there are years of my employment history that fall between the cracks and aren't cut and dried.

Does anyone have any advice for me, or perhaps know the name of a great rep at Great Lakes who might be patient enough to walk through this with me?

I am a rising sophomore at an ""okay"" state school. This summer I will be interning at a company making $8,000 a month for 3 months. My apartment, transport, and food are paid for so I have virtually no expenses. Because of financial aid my mom is able to help pay for school, but she expects me to start pitching in with the money I earn this summer (which I agree with). I am 18 years old and have no debt aside from federal loans. 

What I'm concerned about is financial aid in a year from now (for the 2017-2018 school year). Since the money I earned this year has increased significantly, I know that my financial aid for my Junior year will be significantly smaller. Of course, I'll try to get an equally (or greater) paying internship for next summer, but there is no guarantee of that.

My questions are:

* Should I pay off my existing loans so they don't pile up, or use everything towards paying my tuition for this school year?

personalfinance,Need help figuring out savings/student loans/spending money split,"I'm feeling a little overwhelmed with my budget (or lack thereof) and I’m looking for help figuring it all out. I graduated college in May 2015 with about $30k in student loan debt, all federal. Last June, I got a freelance job working for a market research company, and was making about $2,300 per month - since it was freelance, taxes weren't taken out so I was saving pretty significantly because I knew I would have to pay taxes later on and because I'm currently living with my parents and trying to save up to move out. This past April, the company hired me full-time, so now I'm taking home $35k/year, or $2000 per month after taxes. I can open a 401(k) with my company starting in October, and I plan to do that even though they don't match contributions. I have $13,600 in my savings account right now and have no plans to stop saving, but now that I'm making a set amount I want to get more concrete in how much I put away each month. 

My loans entered repayment in January, and I've been paying more than the minimum each month since then. What I've done in the past is move 60% of each paycheck into savings as soon as I get paid, and then use the money in my savings account to pay my loans. The loans themselves break down like so:

* $3,379.06 with 3.15% interest
* $4,418.93 with 3.15% interest
* $7,730.87 with 3.61% interest
* $3,075.36 with 4.41% interest
* $3,532.87 with 4.41% interest

I had two additional loans, each originally $2,000 with 6.55% interest each but I paid each of those in full already. I feel really overwhelmed with these numbers, because I want to pay off my loans aggressively but I'm not sure how much to put away, and I dealt with that the last few months by paying off my two highest-interest loans in full all at once. 

As for expenses, I don't pay rent, and I only pay for food if I'm buying only for myself - my parents are the primary grocery shoppers, and occasionally if I need to go to the store I'll pay with my money but that doesn’t happen often. My biggest expenses outside of loans are my car and fitness classes – I had a beater car for a long time but this past fall I had to get rid of it, and to replace it I’m leasing a 2015 Subaru Crosstrek – my parents put down the down payment, and maintenance is free/included since it’s a lease, so my monthly car expenses are just paying for the car (monthly payment of $224) and gas (~$50/mo). The gym I take classes at is another expense – I have a class package that cost me $400 for 40 classes, but after I’ve used those classes I’ll probably switch to a monthly membership ($125/mo). I’ve been keeping track of my finances with Mint and I’m working on trying to cut back on things like coffee shops and going out to lunch, since I’ve gone over my budget – but I don’t do either very often, so I feel like there might be a way to reorganize how much I’m saving/paying towards my loans to still let me buy things for myself occasionally. I’m just looking for advice, and I’m also unsure of how much money I’ll need to move out – I’m pretty sure I’d be okay with my current savings account but I can’t help but feel a little guilty every time I touch my savings money.

Also, side question to anyone familiar with Mint – I set up paying off my student loans as a goal today, and it’s telling me to pay extra towards my smaller loan with 4.41% interest first, and then when that is paid off to start paying off the bigger 4.41% interest loan, but I’d like to work on the bigger loan first – is it possible to switch the two in goals?

BMW has set the residual value for the calculation to 50% @ 10k miles/year, 36 months. It's a $53,000 car.

However, I only just realized there's a maximum depreciation for writeoffs (seems like $3160 first year, then goes up after that)..

I currently own a house that I'm renting for $1100 (mortgage is $750 and 7% management fee) the current tenants have expressed interested in purchasing the house in 2 years when their last daughter graduates college and I want them to do that since I've owned the house for nearly 10 years and the value has only increased by 2%.  

All the excess money I make from rent goes into principle on the mortgage up until about 5 months ago when I decided I was tired of renting then I just put it away in saving towards a downpayment.

I've got no credit card debt and no car payment.

I want to buy a house between $200 and $250 and have been prequalified for $250,000 at 3.25.  As long as I finance under $215k my payments will be less than my current rent; that is a target I really want to hit.  Right now I have enough in savings to pay about $20k at closing.

I'm thinking about borrowing an additional $15k from TSP over 4 years at a 1.75% interest rate and applying it towards closing and a down payment; that keeps my TSP loan payments at around $300.  I will use in rental income I make towards paying off my TSP loan and when the tenants do buy the house I will use that money pay off the remaining TSP loan debt (I already don't see that money).

i don't care about interest rates since i can't save money at the moment, but i would like to be able to have one or many savings accounts, no overdraft fees (i'd rather just get declined), and have it be compatible with paypal. i've been looking into simple, but they don't seem compatible with my business paypal.

are there any banks in the area that are suitable for people with very little money?

MachineLearning,seq2seq RNN in Tensor Flow: sampling without Teacher Forcing,"The [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html) for the seq2seq library in Tensorflow states in a matter-of-fact way that it is common to train with Teacher Forcing but test without:

    In many applications of sequence-to-sequence models the output of the decoder
    at time t is fed back and becomes the input of the decoder at time t+1. At test
    time, when decoding a sequence, this is how the sequence is constructed.
    During training, on the other hand, it is common to provide the correct input to
    the decoder at every time-step, even if the decoder made a mistake before.
    Functions in seq2seq.py support both modes using the feed_previous argument.

So far, I have called `embedding_rnn_seq2seq` with `feed_previous=False`, (i.e. the default) for use during training, wherein I explicitly provide a value of `decoder_inputs` to be used for training the model.

However, since the embedding is constructed *inside* of the `embedding_rnn_seq2seq` method, it does not make sense to simply construct another copy of the seq2seq model with the same encoder inputs, decoder inputs and LSTM cell while setting `feed_previous=True` for use during testing/validation (since the embeddings would not be copied).

I'm currently using an adapted version of [the code](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/43fw8s/simple_seq2seq_example_in_tensorflow/czi0ilp) by /u/sherjilozair, but since his model is a sequence autoencoder, the decoder input is the same as the encoder input, it is not applicable to my use case (decoder output =/= encoder output).

I could not find any examples where the library has been used to build such a model.

Bitcoin,The wilkelvoss are trying to make bitcoin legit according to esquire magazine,"Every idea needs a face, even if the faces are illusory simplifications. The country you get is the president you get. The Yankees you get is the shortstop you get. Apple needed Jobs. ISIS needs al-Baghdadi. The moon shot belongs to Bezos. There's nothing under the Facebook sun that doesn't come back to Zuckerberg.

But there is, as yet, no face behind the bitcoin curtain. It's the currency you've heard about but haven't been able to understand. Still to this day nobody knows who created it. For most people, it has something to do with programmable cash and algorithms and the deep space of mathematics, but it also has something to do with heroin and barbiturates and the sex trade and bankruptcies, too. It has no face because it doesn't seem tangible or real. We might align it with an anarchist's riot mask or a highly conceptualized question mark, but those images truncate its reality. Certain economists say it's as important as the birth of the Internet, that it's like discovering ice. Others are sure that it's doomed to melt. In the political sphere, it is the darling of the cypherpunks and libertarians. When they're not busy ignoring it, it scares the living shit out of the big banks and credit-card companies.

It sparked to life in 2008—when all the financial world prepared for itself the articulate noose—and it knocked on the door like some inconvenient relative arriving at the dinner party in muddy shoes and a knit hat. Fierce ideological battles are currently being waged among the people who own and shepherd the currency. Some shout, Ponzi scheme. Some shout, Gold dust. Bitcoin alone is worth billions of dollars, but the computational structure behind it—its blockchain and its sidechains—could become the absolute underpinning of the world's financial structure for decades to come.

What bitcoin has needed for years is a face to legitimize it, sanitize it, make it palpable to all the naysayers. But it has no Larry Ellison, no Elon Musk, no noticeable visionaries either with or without the truth. There's a lot of ideology at stake. A lot of principle and dogma and creed. And an awful lot of cash, too.

At 6:00 on a Wednesday winter morning, three months after launching Gemini, their bitcoin exchange, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss step out onto Broadway in New York, wearing the same make of sneakers, the same type of shorts, their baseball caps turned backward. They don't quite fall into the absolute caricature of twindom: They wear different-colored tops. Still, it's difficult to tell them apart, where Tyler ends and Cameron begins. Their faces are sculpted from another era, as if they had stepped from the ruin of one of Gatsby's parties. Their eyes are quick and seldom land on anything for long. Now thirty-four, there is something boyishly earnest about them as they jog down Prince Street, braiding in and out of each other, taking turns talking, as if they were working in shifts, drafting off each other.

Forget, for a moment, the four things the Winklevosses are most known for: suing Mark Zuckerberg, their portrayal in The Social Network, rowing in the Beijing Olympics, and their overwhelming public twinness. Because the Winklevoss brothers are betting just about everything—including their past—on a fifth thing: They want to shake the soul of money out.

At the deep end of their lives, they are athletes. Rowers. Full stop. And the thing about rowing—which might also be the thing about bitcoin—is that it's just about impossible to get your brain around its complexity. Everyone thinks you're going to a picnic. They have this notion you're out catching butterflies. They might ask you if you've got your little boater's hat ready. But it's not like that at all. You're fifteen years old. You rise in the dark. You drag your carcass along the railroad tracks before dawn. The boathouse keys are cold to the touch. You undo the ropes. You carry a shell down to the river. The carbon fiber rips at your hands. You place the boat in the water. You slip the oars in the locks. You wait for your coach. Nothing more than a thumb of light in the sky. It's still cold and the river stinks. That heron hasn't moved since yesterday. You hear Coach's voice before you see him. On you go, lads. You start at a dead sprint. The left rib's a little sore, but you don't say a thing. You are all power and no weight. The first push-to-pull in the water is a ripping surprise. From the legs first. Through the whole body. The arc. Atomic balance. A calm waiting for the burst. Your chest burns, your thighs scald, your brain blanks. It feels as if your rib cage might shatter. You are stillness exploding. You catch the water almost without breaking the surface. Coach says something about the pole vault. You like him. You really do. That brogue of his. Lads this, lads that. Fire. Stamina. Pain. After two dozen strokes, it already feels like you're hitting the wall. All that glycogen gone. Nobody knows. Nobody. They can't even pronounce it. Rowing. Ro-wing. Roh-ing. You push again, then pull. You feel as if you are breaking branch after branch off the bottom of your feet. You don't rock. You don't jolt. Keep it steady. Left, right, left, right. The heron stays still. This river. You see it every day. Nothing behind you. Everything in front. You cross the line. You know the exact tree. Your chest explodes. Your knees are trembling. This is the way the world will end, not with a whimper but a bang. You lean over the side of the boat. Up it comes, the breakfast you almost didn't have. A sign of respect to the river. You lay back. Ah, blue sky. Some cloud. Some gray. Do it again, lads. Yes, sir. You row so hard you puke it up once more. And here comes the heron, it's moving now, over the water, here it comes, look at that thing glide.

The Winklevoss twins in the men's pair final during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
GETTY
There's plenty of gin and beer and whiskey in the Harrison Room in downtown Manhattan, but the Winklevoss brothers sip Coca-Cola. The room, one of many in the newly renovated Pier A restaurant, is all mahogany and lamplight. It is, in essence, a floating bar, jutting four hundred feet out into the Hudson River. From the window you can see the Statue of Liberty. It feels entirely like their sort of room, a Jazz Age expectation hovering around their initial appearance—tall, imposing, the hair mannered, the collars of their shirts slightly tilted—but then they just slide into their seats, tentative, polite, even introverted.

They came here by subway early on a Friday evening, and they lean back in their seats, a little wary, their eyes busy—as if they want to look beyond the rehearsal of their words.

They had the curse of privilege, but, as they're keen to note, a curse that was earned. Their father worked to pay his way at a tiny college in backwoods Pennsylvania coal country. He escaped the small mining town and made it all the way to a professorship at Wharton. He founded his own company and eventually created the comfortable upper-middle-class family that came with it. They were raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, the most housebroken town on the planet. They might have looked like the others in their ZIP code, and dressed like them, spoke like them, but they didn't quite feel like them. Some nagging feeling—close to anger, close to fear—lodged itself beneath their shoulders, not quite a chip but an ache. They wanted Harvard but weren't quite sure what could get them there. ""You have to be basically the best in the world at something if you're coming from Greenwich,"" says Tyler. ""Otherwise it's like, great, you have a 1600 SAT, you and ten thousand others, so what?""

The rowing was a means to an end, but there was also something about the boat that they felt allowed another balance between them. They pulled their way through high school, Cameron on the port-side oar, Tyler on the starboard. They got to Harvard. The Square was theirs. They rowed their way to the national championships—twice. They went to Oxford. They competed in the Beijing Olympics. They sucked up the smog. They came in sixth place. The cameras loved them. Girls, too. They were so American, sandy-haired, blue-eyed, they could have been cast in a John Cougar Mellencamp song.

It might all have been so clean-cut and whitebread except for the fact that—at one of the turns in the river—they got involved in the most public brawl in the whole of the Internet's nascent history.

They don't talk about it much anymore, but they know that it still defines them, not so much in their own minds but in the minds of others. The story seems simple on one level, but nothing is ever simple, not even simplification. Theirs was the original idea for the first social network, Harvard Connection. They hired Mark Zuckerberg to build it. Instead he went off and created Facebook. They sued him. They settled for $65 million. It was a world of public spats and private anguish. Rumors and recriminations. A few years later, dusty old pre-Facebook text messages were leaked online by Silicon Alley Insider: ""Yeah, I'm going to fuck them,"" wrote Zuckerberg to a friend. ""Probably in the ear."" The twins got their money, but then they believed they were duped again by an unfairly low evaluation of their stock. They began a second round of lawsuits for $180 million. There was even talk about the Supreme Court. It reeked of opportunism. But they wouldn't let it go. In interviews, they came across as insolent and splenetic, tossing their rattles out of the pram. It wasn't about the money, they said at the time, it was about fairness, reality, justice. Most people thought it was about some further agile fuckery, this time in Zuckerberg's ear.

There are many ways to tell the story, but perhaps the most penetrating version is that they weren't screwed so much by Zuckerberg as they were by their eventual portrayal in the film version of their lives. They appeared querulous and sulky, exactly the type of characters that America, peeling off the third-degree burns of the great recession, needed to hate. While the rest of the country worried about mounting debt and vanishing jobs, they were out there drinking champagne from, at the very least, Manolo stilettos. The truth would never get in the way of a good story. In Aaron Sorkin's world, and on just about every Web site, the blueblood trust-fund boys got what was coming to them. And the best thing now was for them to take their Facebook money and turn the corner, quickly, away, down toward whatever river would whisk them away.


Armie Hammer brilliantly portrayed them as the bluest of bloods in The Social Network.
When the twins are questioned about those times now, they lean back a little in their seats, as if they've just lost a long race, a little perplexed that they came off as the victims of Hollywood's ability to throw an image, while the whole rip-roaring regatta still goes on behind them. ""They put us in a box,"" says Cameron, ""caricatured to a point where we didn't really exist."" He glances around the bar, drums his finger against the glass. ""That's fair enough. I understand that impulse."" They smart a little when they hear Zuckerberg's name. ""I don't think Mark liked being called an asshole,"" says Tyler, with a flick of bluster in his eyes, but then he catches himself. ""You know, maybe Mark doesn't care. He's a bit of a statesman now, out there connecting the world. I have nothing against him. He's a smart guy.""

These are men who've been taught, or have finally taught themselves, to tell their story rather than be told by it. But underneath the calm—just like underneath the boat—one can sense the churn.

They say the word—ath-letes—as if it were a country where pain is the passport. One of the things the brothers mention over and over again is that you can spontaneously crack a rib while rowing, just from the sheer exertion of the muscles hauling on the rib cage.

Along came bitcoin.

At its most elemental, bitcoin is a virtual currency. It's the sort of thing a five-year-old can understand—It's just e-cash, Mom—until he reaches eighteen and he begins to question the deep future of what money really means. It is a currency without government. It doesn't need a banker. It doesn't need a bank. It doesn't even need a brick to be built upon. Its supporters say that it bypasses the Man. It is less than a decade old and it has already come through its own Wild West, a story rooted in uncharted digital territory, up from the dust, an evening redness in the arithmetical West.

These are men who've been taught, or have finally taught themselves, to tell their story rather than be told by it.
Bitcoin appeared in 2008—westward ho!—a little dot on the horizon of the Internet. It was the brainchild of a computer scientist named Satoshi Nakamoto. The first sting in the tale is that—to this very day—nobody knows who Nakamoto is, where he lives, or how much of his own invention he actually owns. He could be Californian, he could be Australian, he could even be a European conglomerate, but it doesn't really matter, since what he created was a cryptographic system that is borderless and supposedly unbreakable.

In the beginning the currency was ridiculed and scorned. It was money created from ones and zeros. You either bought it or you had to ""mine"" for it. If you were mining, your computer was your shovel. Any nerd could do it. You keyed your way in. By using your computer to help check and confirm the bitcoin transactions of others, you made coin. Everyone in this together. The computer heated up and mined, down down down, into the mathematical ground, lifting up numbers, making and breaking camp every hour or so until you had your saddlebags full of virtual coin. It all seemed a bit of a lark at first. No sheriff, no deputy, no central bank. The only saloon was a geeky chat room where a few dozen bitcoiners gathered to chew data.

Lest we forget, money was filthy in 2008.

The collapse was coming. The banks were shorting out. The real estate market was a confederacy of dunces. Bernie Madoff's shadow loomed. Occupy was on the horizon. And all those Wall Street yahoos were beginning to squirm.

Along came bitcoin like some Jesse James of the financial imagination. It was the biggest disruption of money since coins. Here was an idea that could revolutionize the financial world. A communal articulation of a new era. Fuck American Express. Fuck Western Union. Fuck Visa. Fuck the Fed. Fuck the Treasury. Fuck the deregulated thievery of the twenty-first century.

To the earliest settlers, bitcoin suggested a moral way out. It was a money created from the ground up, a currency of the people, by the people, for the people, with all government control extinguished. It was built on a solid base of blockchain technology where everyone participated in the protection of the code. It attracted anarchists, libertarians, whistle-blowers, cypherpunks, economists, extropians, geeks, upstairs, downstairs, left-wing, right-wing. Sure, it could be used by businesses and corporations, but it could also be used by poor people and immigrants to send money home, instantly, honestly, anonymously, without charge, with a click of the keyboard. Everyone in the world had access to your transaction, but nobody had to know your name. It bypassed the suits. All you needed to move money was a phone or a computer. It was freedom of economic action, a sort of anarchy at its democratic best, no rulers, just rules.

Bitcoin, to the original explorers, was a safe pass through the government-occupied valleys: Those assholes were up there in the hills, but they didn't have any scopes on their rifles, and besides, bitcoin went through in communal wagons at night.

Ordinary punters took a shot. Businesses, too. You could buy silk ties in Paris without any extra bank charges. You could protect your money in Buenos Aires without fear of a government grab.

But freedom can corrupt as surely as power. It was soon the currency that paid for everything illegal under the sun, the go-to money of the darknet. The westward ho! became the outlaw territory of Silk Road and beyond. Heroin through the mail. Cocaine at your doorstep. Child porn at a click. What better way for terrorists to ship money across the world than through a network of anonymous computers? Hezbollah, the Taliban, the Mexican cartels. In Central America, kidnappers began demanding ransom in bitcoin—there was no need for the cash to be stashed under a park bench anymore. Now everything could travel down the wire. Grab, gag, and collect. Uranium could be paid for in bitcoin. People, too. The sex trade was turned on: It was a perfect currency for Madame X. For the online gambling sites, bitcoin was pure jackpot.

For a while, things got very shady indeed. Over a couple years, the rate pinballed between $10 and $1,200 per bitcoin, causing massive waves and troughs of online panic and greed. (In recent times, it has begun to stabilize between $350 and $450.) In 2014, it was revealed that hackers had gotten into the hot wallet of Mt. Gox, a bitcoin exchange based in Tokyo. A total of 850,000 coins were ""lost,"" at an estimated value of almost half a billion dollars. The founder of Silk Road, Ross William Ulbricht (known as ""Dread Pirate Roberts""), got himself a four-by-six room in a federal penitentiary for life, not to mention pending charges for murder-for-hire in Maryland.

Everyone thought that bitcoin was the problem. The fact of the matter was, as it so often is, human nature was the problem. Money means desire. Desire means temptation. Temptation means that people get hurt.

During the first Gold Rush in the late 1840s, the belief was that all you needed was a pan and a decent pair of boots and a good dose of nerve and you could go out and make yourself a riverbed millionaire. Even Jack London later fell for the lure of it alongside thousands of others: the western test of manhood and the promise of wealth. What they soon found out was that a single egg could cost twenty-five of today's dollars, a pound of coffee went for a hundred, and a night in a whorehouse could set you back $6,000.

A few miners hit pay dirt, but what most ended up with for their troubles was a busted body and a nasty dose of syphilis.

The gold was discovered on the property of John Sutter in Sacramento, but the one who made the real cash was a neighboring merchant, Samuel Brannan. When Brannan heard the news of the gold nuggets, he bought up all the pickaxes and shovels he could find, filled a quinine bottle with gold dust, and went to San Francisco. Word went around like a prayer in a flash flood: gold gold gold. Brannan didn't wildcat for gold himself, but at the peak of the rush he was flogging $5,000 worth of shovels a day—that's $155,000 today—and went on to become the wealthiest man in California, alongside the Wells Fargo crew, Levi Strauss, and the Studebaker family, who sold wheelbarrows.

If you comb back through the Winklevoss family, you will find a great-grandfather and a great-great-grandfather who knew a thing or two about digging: They worked side by side in the coal mines of Pennsylvania. They didn't go west and they didn't get rich, but maybe the lesson became part of their DNA: Sometimes it's the man who sells the shovels who ends up hitting gold.

Like it or not—and many people don't like it—the Winklevoss brothers are shaping up to be the Samuel Brannans of the bitcoin world.

They heard about it first poolside in Ibiza, Spain. Later it would play into the idea of ease and privilege: umbrella drinks and girls in bikinis. But if the creation myth was going to be flippant, the talk was serious. ""I'd say we were cautious, but we were definitely intrigued,"" says Cameron. They went back home to New York and began to read. There was something about it that got under their skin. ""We knew that money had been so broken and inefficient for years,"" says Tyler, ""so bitcoin appealed to us right away.""

They speak in braided sentences, catching each other, reassuring themselves, tightening each other's ideas. They don't quite want to say that bitcoin looked like something that might be redemptive—after all, they, like everyone else, were looking to make money, lots of it, Olympic-sized amounts—but they say that it did strike an idealistic chord inside them. They certainly wouldn't be cozying up to the anarchists anytime soon, but this was a global currency that, despite its uncertainties, seemed to present a solution to some of the world's more pressing problems. ""It was borderless, instantaneous, irreversible, decentralized, with virtually no transaction costs,"" says Tyler. It could possibly cut the banks out, and it might even take the knees out from under the credit-card companies. Not only that, but the price, at just under ten dollars per coin, was in their estimation low, very low. They began to snap it up.

They were aware, even at the beginning, that they might, once again, be called Johnny-come-latelys, just hopping blithely on the bandwagon—it was 2012, already four years into the birth of the currency—but they went ahead anyway, power ten. Within a short time they'd spent $11 million buying up a whopping 1 percent of the world's bitcoin, a position they kept up as more bitcoins were mined, making their 1 percent holding today worth about $66 million.

But bitcoin was flammable. The brothers felt the burn quickly. Their next significant investment came later that year, when they gave $1.5 million in venture funding to a nascent exchange called BitInstant. Within a year the CEO was arrested for laundering drug money through the exchange.

So what were a pair of smart, clean-cut Olympic rowers doing hanging around the edges of something so apparently shady, and what, if anything, were they going to do about it?

They mightn't have thought of it this way, but there was something of the sheriff striding into town, the one with the swagger and the scar, glancing up at the balconies as he comes down Main Street, all tumbleweeds and broken pianos. This place was a dump in most people's eyes, but the sheriff glimpsed his last best shot at finally getting the respect he thinks he deserves.

The money shot: A good stroke will catch the water almost without breaking its seal. You stir without rippling. Your silence is sinewy. There's muscle in that calm. The violence catches underneath, thrusts the boat along. Stroke after stroke. Just keep going. Today's truth dies tomorrow. What you have to do is elemental enough. You row without looking behind you. You keep the others in front of you. As long as you can see what they're doing, it's all in your hands. You are there to out-pain them. Doesn't matter who they are, where they come from, how they got here. Know your enemy through yourself. Push through toward pull. Find the still point of this pain. Cut a melody in the disk of your flesh. The only terror comes when they pass you—if they ever pass you.

There are no suits or ties, but there is a white hum in the offices of Gemini in the Flatiron District. The air feels as if it has been brushed clean. There is something so everywhereabout the place. Ergonomic chairs. iPhone portals. Rows of flickering computers. Not so much a hush around the room as a quiet expectation. Eight, nine people. Programmers, analysts, assistants. Other employees—teammates, they call them—dialing in from Portland, Oregon, and beyond.

The brothers fire up the room when they walk inside. A fist-pump here, a shoulder touch there. At the same time, there is something almost shy about them. Apart, they seem like casual visitors to the space they inhabit. It is when they're together that they feel fully shaped. One can't imagine them being apart from each other for very long.

They move from desk to desk. The price goes up, the price goes down. The phones ring. The e-mails beep. Customer-service calls. Questions about fees. Inquiries about tax structures.

Gemini was started in late 2015 as a next-generation bitcoin exchange. It is not the first such exchange in the world by any means, but it is one of the most watched. The company is designed with ordinary investors in mind, maybe a hedge fund, maybe a bank: all those people who used to be confused or even terrified by the word bitcoin. It is insured. It is clean. What's so fascinating about this venture is that the brothers are risking themselves by trying to eliminate risk: keeping the boat steady and exploding through it at the same time.

It is when they're together that they feel fully shaped. One can't imagine them being apart from each other for very long.
For the past couple years, the Winklevosses have worked closely with just about every compliance agency imaginable. They ticked off all the regulatory boxes. Essentially they wanted to ease all the Debting Thomases. They put regulatory frameworks in place. Security and bankability and insurance were their highest objectives. Nobody was going to be able to blow open the safe. They wanted to soothe all the appetites for risk. They told Bitcoin Magazine they were asking for ""permission, not forgiveness.""

This is where bitcoin can become normal—that is, if you want bitcoin to be normal.

Just a mile or two down the road, in Soho, a half dozen bitcoiners gather at a meetup. The room is scruffy, small, boxy. A half mannequin is propped on a table, a scarf draped around it. It's the sort of place that twenty years ago would have been full of cigarette smoke. There's a bit of Allen Ginsberg here, a touch of Emma Goldman, a lot of Zuccotti Park. The wine is free and the talk is loose. These are the true believers. They see bitcoin in its clearest possible philosophical terms—the frictionless currency of the people, changing the way people move money around the world, bypassing the banks, disrupting the status quo.

A comedy show is being run out in the backyard. A scruffy young man wanders in and out, announcing over and over again that he is half-baked. A well-dressed Asian girl sidles up to the bar. She looks like she's just stepped out of an NYU business class. She's interested in discovering what bitcoin is. She is regaled by a series of convivial answers. The bartender tells her that bitcoin is a remaking of the prevailing power structures. The girl asks for another glass of wine. The bartender adds that bitcoin is democracy, pure and straight. She nods and tells him that the wine tastes like cooking oil. He laughs and says it wasn't bought with bitcoin. ""I don't get it,"" she says. And so the evening goes, presided over by Margaux Avedisian, who describes herself as the queen of bitcoin. Avedisian, a digital-currency consultant of Armenian descent, is involved in several high-level bitcoin projects. She has appeared in documentaries and on numerous panels. She is smart, sassy, articulate.

When the talk turns to the Winklevoss brothers, the bar turns dark. Someone, somewhere, reaches up to take all the oxygen out of the air. Avedisian leans forward on the counter, her eyes shining, delightful, raged.

""The Winklevii are not the face of bitcoin,"" she says. ""They're jokes. They don't know what they're saying. Nobody in our community respects them. They're so one-note. If you look at their exchange, they have no real volume, they never will. They keep throwing money at different things. Nobody cares. They're not part of us. They're just hangers-on.""

""Ah, they're just assholes,"" the bartender chimes in.

""What they want to do,"" says Avedisian, ""is lobotomize bitcoin, make it into something entirely vapid. They have no clue.""

The Asian girl leaves without drinking her third glass of free wine. She's got a totter in her step. She doesn't quite get the future of money, but then again maybe very few in the world do.

The future of money might look like this: You're standing on Oxford Street in London in winter. You think about how you want to get to Charing Cross Road. The thought triggers itself through electrical signals into the chip embedded in your wrist. Within a moment, a driverless car pulls up on the sensor-equipped road. The door opens. You hop in. The car says hello. You tell it to shut up. It does. It already knows where you want to go. It turns onto Regent Street. You think,A little more air-conditioning, please. The vents blow. You think, Go a little faster, please. The pace picks up. You think, This traffic is too heavy, use Quick(TM). The car swings down Glasshouse Street. You think, Pay the car in front to get out of my way. It does. You think, Unlock access to a shortcut. The car turns down Sherwood Street to Shaftsbury Avenue. You pull in to Charing Cross. You hop out. The car says goodbye. You tell it to shut up again. You run for the train and the computer chip in your wrist pays for the quiet-car ticket for the way home.

All of these transactions—the air-conditioning, the pace, the shortcut, the bribe to get out of the way, the quick lanes, the ride itself, the train, maybe even the ""shut up""—will cost money. As far as crypto-currency enthusiasts think, it will be paid for without coins, without phones, without glass screens, just the money coming in and going out of your preprogrammed wallet embedded beneath your skin.

The Winklevosses are betting that the money will be bitcoin. And that those coins will flow through high-end, corporate-run exchanges like Gemini rather than smoky SoHo dives.

Cameron leans across a table in a New York diner, the sort of place where you might want to polish your fork just in case, and says: ""The future is here, it's just not evenly distributed yet."" He can't remember whom the quote belongs to, but he freely acknowledges that it's not his own. Theirs is a truculent but generous intelligence, capable of surprise and turn at the oddest of moments. They talk meditation, they talk economics, they talk Van Halen, they talk, yes, William Gibson, but everything comes around again to bitcoin.

""The key to all this is that people aren't even going to know that they're using bitcoin,"" says Tyler. ""It's going to be there, but it's not going to be exposed to the end user. Bitcoin is going to be the rails that underpin our payment systems. It's just like an IP address. We don't log on to a series of numbers, 115.425.5 or whatever. No, we log on to Google.com. In the same way, bitcoin is going to be disguised. There will be a body kit that makes it user-friendly. That's what makes bitcoin a kick-ass currency.""

Any fool can send a billion dollars across the world—as long as they have it, of course—but it's virtually impossible to send a quarter unless you stick it in an envelope and pay forty-nine cents for a stamp. It's one of the great ironies of our antiquated money system. And yet the quark of the financial world is essentially the small denomination. What bitcoin promises is that it will enable people and businesses to send money in just about any denomination to one another, anywhere in the world, for next to nothing. A public address, a private key, a click of the mouse, and the money is gone.

This matters. This matters a lot. Credit-card companies can't do this. Neither can the big banks under their current systems. But Marie-Louise on the corner of Libertador Avenue can. And so can Pat Murphy in his Limerick housing estate. So can Mark Andreessen and Bill Gates and Laurene Powell Jobs. Anyone can do it, anywhere in the world, at virtually no charge.

You can do it, in fact, from your phone in a diner in New York. But the whole time they are there—over identical California omelettes that they order with an ironic shrug—they never once open their phones. They come across more like the talkative guys who might buy you a drink at the sports bar than the petulants ordering bottle service in the VIP corner. The older they get, the more comfortable they seem in their contradictions: the competition, the ease; the fame, the quiet; the gamble, the sure thing.

Bitcoin is what might eventually make them among the richest men in America. And yet. There is always a yet.
What seems indisputable about the future of money, to the Winklevosses and other bitcoin adherents, is that the technology that underpins bitcoin—the blockchain—will become one of the fundamental tenets of how we deal with the world of finance. Blockchain is the core computer code. It's open source and peer to peer—in other words, it's free and open to you and me. Every single bitcoin transaction ever made goes to an open public ledger. It would take an unprecedented 51 percent attack—where one entity would come to control more than half of the computing power used to mine bitcoin—for hackers to undo it. The blockchain is maintained by computers all around the world, and its future sidechains will create systems that deal with contracts and stock and other payments. These sidechains could very well be the foundation of the new global economy for the big banks, the credit-card companies, and even government itself.

""It's boundless,"" says Cameron.

This is what the brothers are counting on—and what might eventually make them among the richest men in America.

And yet. There is always a yet.

When you delve into the world of bitcoin, it gets deeper, darker, more mysterious all the time. Why has its creator remained anonymous? Why did he drop off the face of the earth? How much of it does he own himself? Will banks and corporations try to bring the currency down? Why are there really only five developers with full ""commit access"" to the code (not the Winklevosses, by the way)? Who is really in charge of the currency's governance?

Perhaps the most pressing issue at hand is that of scaling, which has caused what amounts to a civil war among followers. A maximum block size of one megabyte has been imposed on the chain, sort of like a built-in artificial dampener to keep bitcoin punk rock. That's not nearly enough capacity for the number of transactions that would take place in future visions. In years to come, there could be massive backlogs and outages that could create instant financial panic. Bitcoin's most influential leaders are haggling over what will happen. Will bitcoin maintain its decentralized status, or will it go legit and open up to infinite transactions? And if it goes legit, where's the punk?

The issues are ongoing—and they might very well take bitcoin down, but the Winklevosses don't think so. They have seen internal disputes before. They've refrained from taking a public stance mostly because they know that there are a lot of other very smart people in bitcoin who are aware that crisis often builds consensus. ""We're in this for the long haul,"" says Tyler. ""We're the first batter in the first inning.""

The waiter comes across and asks them, bizarrely, if they're twins. They nod politely. Who was born first? They've heard it a million times and their answer is always the same: Neither of them—they were born cesarean. Cameron looks older, says the waiter. Tyler grins. Normally it's the other way around, says Cameron, grinning back. Do you ever fight? asks the waiter. Every now and then, they say. But not over this, not over the future.

Heraclitus was wrong. You can, in fact, step in the same river twice. In the beginning you went to the shed. No electricity there, no heat, just a giant tub where you simulated the river. You could only do eleven strokes. But there was something about the repetition, the difference, even the monotony, that hooked you. After a while it wasn't an abandoned shed anymore. College gyms, national training centers. Bigger buildings. High ceilings. AC. Doctors and trainers. Monitors hooked up to your heart, your head, your blood. Six foot five, but even then you were not as tall as the other guys. You liked the notion of underdog. Everyone called you the opposite. The rich kids. The privileged ones. To hell with that. They don't know us, who we are, where we came from. Some of the biggest chips rest on the shoulders of those with the least to lose. Six foot five times two makes just about thirteen feet. You sit in the erg and you stare ahead. Day in, day out. One thousand strokes, two thousand. You work with the very best. You even train with the Navy SEALs. It touches that American part of you. The sentiment, the false optimism. When the oil fields are burning, you even think, I'll go there with them. But you stay in the boat. You want that other flag rising. That's what you aim for. You don't win but you get close. Afterward there are planes, galas, regattas, magazine spreads, but you always come back to that early river. The cold. The fierceness. The heron. Like it or not, you're never going to get off the water—that's just the fact of the matter, it's always going to be there. Hard to admit it, but once you were wrong. You got out of the boat and you haggled over who made it. You lost that one, hard. You might lose this one, too, but then again it just might be the original arc that you're stepping toward. So you return, then. You rise before dark. You drag your carcass along Broadway before dawn.

All the rich men in the world want to get shot into outer space. Richard Branson. Jeff Bezos. Elon Musk. The new explorers. To get the hell out of here and see if they—and maybe we—can exist somewhere else for a while. It's the story of the century. We want to know if the pocket of the universe can be turned inside out. We're either going to bring all the detritus of the world upward with us or we're going to find a brand-new way to exist. The cynical say that it's just another form of colonization—they're probably right, but then again maybe it's our only way out.

The Winklevosses have booked their tickets—numbers 700 and 701—on Branson's Virgin Galactic. Although they go virtually everywhere together, the twins want to go on different flights because of the risk involved: Now that they're in their mid-thirties, they can finally see death, or at least its rumor. It's a boy's adventure, but it's also the outer edge of possibility. It cost a quarter of a million dollars per seat, and they paid for it, yes, in bitcoin.

Of course, up until recently, the original space flights all splashed down into the sea. One of the ships that hauled the Gemini space capsule out of the water in 1965 was the Intrepid aircraft carrier.

The Winklevosses no longer pull their boat up the river. Instead they often run five miles along the Hudson to the Intrepid and back. The destroyer has been parked along Manhattan's West Side for almost as long as they have been alive. It's now a museum. The brothers like the boat, its presence, its symbolism: Intrepid, Gemini, the space shot.

They ease into the run.",cryptocurrency,1463911395
personalfinance,"Pay off $11,000 student loans at once, gradually, or periodically?","Hi Redditors,

I've often read posts on personal finance, but this is my first time posting. For the last couple years, I've had my federal subsidized Stafford load deferred while I finished grad school. The interest rate is 5.032% and the balance of the loan is roughly $11,000 ($10,000 in principal and $1,000in interest). This is the only debt I owe. 

With my grad school stipend, I've managed to save up enough money (about $11,000) so that I could actually pay this loan off in full right now. I do have a job for the next year, so I'd still have a steady stream of income. 

My question is, when it comes to paying off this loan, what is my best course of action for future financial stability? 

To pay off the loan now would mean the absence of any emergency fund, and I would have to start rebuilding my savings from scratch. Furthermore, I wonder whether steadily paying off my loan by paying the minimum payment each month (or perhaps slightly more) is attractive to future creditors, as it may indicate reliability, trustworthiness, and stability on my part.

Or is it better to just pay it all off as quick as possible? Perhaps it's better to have more cash in hand and no debt when, say, applying for a mortgage.

Although I don't know my credit score, one thing worth noting is that I have missed a few student loan payments in the past. I do know they were reported to a credit agency. I also had some trouble paying off a credit card about 7 years ago. It was only an amount of 500 dollars, but I was late with three payments. I eventually paid the thing off. (I signed up for this 'Juniper' credit card offered by apple to help me buy a macbook, only to discover later that not paying the full balance of the card each month, not just the minimum payment, resulted in a hefty penalty of $50 or something like that. Any one else fall into that trap?)

Any advice you would be able to offer is greatly appreciated! And if there's any more info you need that might useful in providing a better answer, please let me know!

EDIT: Thank you all so much for your constructive advice! And especially in such a short amount of time! The consensus seems to have an emergency fund of about $5,000, while putting the rest towards my student loan debt. My deferment period ends in August, and I'll likely do just that and then try to pay the rest off as quickly as possible. I especially like the thinking that paying the loan off ASAP is a guaranteed return of 5%, and in the last few hours I've also checked my credit report for the first time. There are some blemishes, but I hope I'll be in a better position within the next few years.",finance,1463918988

personalfinance,I am a first-time home buyer who is putting 30% down on a house. I have the ability to put down more - is that a good idea or not?,"I am a first-time home buyer.   I live in one of those crazy U.S. cities where real-estate prices are sky-rocketing.

I am purchasing my first house for $1,000,000 .    Please note that this house is an extremely modest house - not what you would think of as a million dollar house.  It is because real estate prices are extremely high in my area.

I have been renting for the last several years at below market rent.  (Which is ending shortly).  Because of that, and a good job, I have been able to save up a decent amount of money for downpayment.    On my new house, I am planning to put a down-payment of $300,000 and borrow the rest : $700,000 .

Interest rates are currently very low and we have gotten a very good rate on the mortgage. (~3.8%)

My question is - I have the ability to put probably another $50,000 - $75,000 in downpayment.   Is this a good idea?     I need help thinking through the problem.

On the one hand, interest rates are historically low making ""renting"" the money cheap.  Real estate is appreciating rapidly in my town.   On the other hand, the money that I would use toward downpayment is currently invested in index-funds.

The extra downpayment money would lower my monthly payments by about $150 / month (and probably $20,000 over the life of the 30 year loan).   But of course, money put towards downpayment gets ""locked away"" in the equity of the house and is not liquid, whereas my existing invested money is liquid.

Any thoughts? Many thanks for helping me think through this process.

Edit: Just a note - I am contractually required to put 30% down (or more) as a condition of sale, so I can't go lower than that.",finance,1463935487

personalfinance,Ensuring my US tax liabilities are covered after the messy distribution of the parent's estate,"First of all, I've been a resident of Florida when all of this ultimately was/will be distributed to me. From what I understand, all tolled we're not worth enough for the estate to have paid tax at the time (2001) my mother died and her assets transferred into it. I also am pretty sure I don't owe anything for the sale of the house I just now completed (2016). Finally there's a taxable investment account that wasn't part of the estate that we're about to get our grubby mitts on.

When mom died there were some retirement accounts, life insurance payouts, savings and checking accounts, the house, and a car. From what I remember, I had to wait to buy my sister out of her share of the house in 2006 for her to come of age. So that would be the year I inherited the house, or at least my half of it. I'm not really sure what the order of operations were for that one, which entities conducted which transactions when between me, my sister, and the estate. If I assume the worst and I just owe taxes for the full amount of money received and the value of the house I still didn't take in enough for inheritance tax to take effect.

I sold the house at less than the amount I bought my sister out for. That's a loss, so I should be able to claim as such federally. I had been paying FL property taxes on the house, so I should be in the clear on that one.

At this point I've exhausted the cash I didn't owe taxes on, I'm still paying the tax on the RMDs I take from my mom's IRA. Now we're both going to split up a couple of investment accounts that came to our attention a few years ago. The brokerage contacted my sister and we've been trying to comply with whatever was needed to get them to hand over ownership. Finally I hired a lawyer and it'll be handled shortly. I probably will owe tax on this, but only when I make a sale and only on earnings as capital gains if I'm understanding correctly.

Even if you totaled everything up and used the estate tax limit from 2001, I'm still pretty sure the estate shouldn't have owed anything. But I'm looking at something that wasn't accounted for in probate. Then the issue of the transfer of the house is pretty murky, but again I am pretty sure I don't owe inheritance tax, I paid the property tax, and I lost money on the sale even if you consider the initial value the price I bought my sister out for.

How do I make sure they can't come back at me for any of this? Can they at this point? I think I've kept everything above board but the history of this is really messy and confusing. Does the IRS know I took possession of the house when I did and will they buy that I sold it at a loss, or am I going to have to furnish them evidence next year? And taxes on the investment account I'm about to get, even the lawyer thought I'd have to pay taxes on inheritance of it even if I didn't cash it out. Will they be able to say we're trying to hide our liabilities for the estate by spreading out the distribution over a decade and sidestepping probate with some assets? Even these new accounts aren't going to bring the value of the estate to taxable values for 2001, and for sure not if you consider the current year.

personalfinance,$25k Sitting in bank. Pay off 4% student loans? or Invest?,"Hi,

I know this has been addressed multiple times, and I've done my research via the wiki and search function. I understand this decision is basically up to my assessment and tolerance of risk, but would still love feedback from the PF community.

I currently have $25,000 sitting in the bank from federal subsidized loans I took out during my undergrad, they start accruing interest in August 2016. The interest rates vary with the lowest being 3.2% and the highest being 4.6%. The average is about 4%.

I have an emergency fund saved up separate of the $25,000, i've already maxed my Roth IRA, and I'm contributing up to the match at my work's 401k. 

My question is Should I quickly pay off all my loans before the interest starts accruing? 

OR

Should I put all $25,000 in a investment account like Wealthfront/Betterment and invest it while making minimum payments + claiming student loan tax deduction.

If i'm understanding this correctly, the 2nd option would be better because inflation effectively brings my interest rate down around 2%? Coupled with the tax deductions, it seems like a great deal.

6. Other living expenses: 25$ monthly phone bill, 200$ eating out and grocery, hobbies: Reading and interneting (so no cost). 

I know I am very fortunate and I feel like I am in a very good position. But, now, for the first time ever, I am ""grown up"", having to manage my own money, and, even...do my own taxes next year... this all feels very daunting. 

Do I even need to worry about retirement since I would have an awesome pension? As for purchasing a house, my parents will assist me in that area. 

I guess, in general, I want to achieve a state where:

1. Debt free

2. Be able to travel, eat, do, whatever I want. 

3. Be able to invest my income, make it grow instead of just stagnantly using it and earning it with my own personal time. 

4. Do I NEED an emergency fund? Since my job is very stable, and provides great benefits. And if I DO need one, how much should it be? I currently have about 8K in savings. 

5. How should I divide my income? Should I simply save a good chunk of it? OR should I divert it right away to pay down my student loans (which is collecting about 5$ interests a day, at around 7% rates?) -- OR invest?",finance,1463953310

Lets call it 3.82 bitcoins returned from a 4 bitcoin investment, a 5.5% loss over over the entire course of investment.

My investment strategy was pretty good I felt. I invested across about 80 loans, read each loan proposal carefully, avoided terrible ideas (cloud mining, digital currency trading, other types of gambling, poor grammar, half assed loan requests, etc) and tried to invest in actual reasonable ideas like business loans in developing countries, personal loans, etc. I did not use autoinvest, as I did not want to simply blanket invest across all loans with a decent proportion of them being bogus.

My final judgement is that while BTCJam is not a scam, it is also not a good investment (right now). You simply cannot give out loans to people who can offer little to nothing in terms of collateral. Additionally, the interest rate at which most of the loans are given are high to the point where I don't think they are benefiting the honest borrowers in the long run.

This doesn't mean that the concept is a complete failure (yet).

I am 26/F and married.  Between my husband and I we bring in $105K (gross). After graduate school I had about 20K in student loan debt and in 2 years have gotten it down to about 15K. The interest rate is currently 6.8% on a Direct Unsubsidized loan (federal). 

Currently we put at least $500 a month towards the loan but the interest accumulates at about $3 at least a day and it drives me crazy and I would love to get that down. We are currently on track to have it paid off in less than 5 years. 

I have looked at some options and will continue to explore them further (SOFi, DRB, Citizens bank , &amp; Earnest). 

I guess my main concern is 1. Get a lower interest  rate and 2. Make sure there's no penalties if we are able to pay off the loan more quickly than the refinancing period.

personalfinance,"Rare opportunity: ""Gifted"" student loan payoff and taxes [US]","---If anyone could answer about taxes if the family friend was giving me the money through a loan (not gift) that would be fantastic as well, that's under u/ARealRocketScientist reply---

Hi everyone so a rare opportunity. A family friend has offered to pay off my Student Loans (~30k), and I will subsequently pay them off at a lower % interest rate (or fixed). 

Before I accept, I first want to confirm how taxes will work for both them and myself based on varying possibilities. 

1. If it is possible for them to pay directly to my student loan account (ie the money never enters my bank accounts), what would this mean for my taxes and theirs based on Student Loan payoff/deductions? 

2. If (1) is not possible, then they would give me the money (money enters my bank acocunt) to pay off my student loans. How would that effect my taxes and theirs differently for Student Loan payoffs/deductions AND my total annual income?

What I'm really trying to understand is how the IRS will define this gift (eg ""income"" or ""gift""). Then based on their definition of that money, how will that effect my taxes next year for the loan. I know you get tax deductions for paying off student loans month-month, but what I don't know is how that will play out for me in this case. 

Technically I will have paid off my student loans, but from a gift of income. 

I think this is what I should be looking at: https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch04.html

gaming,There will never be a 'perfect game' ever so just get over it!,"I have noticed something recently that has gotten me kind of fed up with how certain people think about games nowadays. After seeing the release of the newest game Doom, I couldn't help but feel like people's expectations of video games have gotten astronomically high over the last fifteen to twenty years. Sure, there is always going to be someone who will never be satisfied by what ever is put out there but goddamn people. 

Let's take the new Doom for instance. My general impression from the gameplay commentaries that I have seen is that it is a good game for what it is, namely a bad ass first person shooter with plenty of monsters and demons and customizable weapons to unlock and equip to your character. Still I hear that people don't like it and that's fine it's your opinion. But then I hear really half ass answers for why people say they don't like it. ""The graphics aren't that great"" or ""There isn't much of a story..."" Two things, you can compare the graphics of the original game to the next gen one and of course there is no real comparison. Secondly, games like Doom don't need a Halo like story line to get you immersed into what is happening. 

Sometimes I get the feeling that some people just like to pick apart something because they can't allow themselves just to sit back and enjoy it. Whether or not a game lives up to your expectations is one thing but to bitch and moan about it to everyone else is something entirely different. Think about all the time and effort put into making something for you to enjoy and because it didn't turn out exactly as you would of wanted it to you write it off and call it a 'bad game.'

In our state, Louisiana, the state has a program where they match the credit from the fed. government on their state returns. So, the $15,000 donation would get a $5955 credit from the fed. gov. and Louisiana would give another matching $5955. 

I know the team is based in New York, but I also know in baseball there is a ""jock tax"" that they have to pay in each state they earn money in.

personalfinance,Using Federal Student Loan to Payoff Private Student Loan,"Hello all!

Without going into too much detail, several years ago I made a mistake and enrolled into a expensive private university. Being essentially on my own when it comes to college, I was forced to finance the year with a private loan of roughly $10,000 from Wells Fargo. 

Quickly I realized the absurdity of attending that university and dropped out due to it not being fiscally sound. I then subsequently attended a community college where I completed my GE's and now I am on my way to attending a state university that will cost me nothing due to the CalGrant (should have gone this route originally, I know). Being in school and supporting myself meant that I wasn't really able to put a lot into the loan, though I have been making minimum payments on it.

So now to the question, should I take out the federal student loan offered to me in my Finical Aid Package from my new university at the lower interest rate to payoff the private loan? Also to add, my aunt co-signed the private loan and I really want to expunge her from responsibility, so that is another incentive of mine to pay it off early.

It's my condo in my name so I would not ask him to help pay it off, I only mention it because I'd have a bit of a cushion should something tragic happen.

Is there a benefit to paying down some of my mortgage? I could pay $15K down and I think I could replenish that in about 6 months if I'm really frugal. I own a car that's paid off but I pay $400 a month in parking/gas and insurance. I can also just cut out parking and park on the street. I am not super frugal, but I'd be willing to make those cuts if paying off my mortgage sounds like a good idea. I live in a big city where a car is NOT necessary. Just...I have it so why not.

Here is the simple situation of my life right now: I am European, thinking about marrying an American girl soon. I am 28 years old, she is 34. We know each other for three years, and we are thinking about making our life together. The big deal which will come very soon is the desire of getting a child. Here is the main financial situation:

- she is a student in a PHD, earning about 900$ per month. Hoping to earn not very comfortably her life after her PHD, but not so bad (she is not a doctor or financial analyst..)

- she has around 160K$ of student loans debt. And she plans to stay one or two more years, so we will definitely reach 200K$

- I worked for almost five years in Europe, and saved around 45K$

- If I'm joining her there, I won't be able to work for 5/6 months, waiting for the visa. And then not sure to get a good job in the area. I'm graduated, and able to work in big corporations

- We are paying around 1.300$ monthly for the apt. It's cheap because it's owned by the school. But we are living in the Bay Area, which is very expensive

- Her brother is living in Cali, has a basic job, but not so great. Not poor either

- Her parents are getting old and will need soon to get helped. Not sure how it will impacted our financial situation



Few things popped in our mind:

- I disagree that she stays two more years in her PHD (it's actually up to her, as she has to write a final document), because students loans are growing very fast.

- As I read in different threads, students loans don't look very dangerous. Gvt seems pretty cool to let people reimburse at their own pace. It's also low interest loans. Do I have to be scarred of it?

- She is in a public University, and told me that if she works for 10 years in a public administration, reimbursing her loans, Gvt will give up the rest of it. Is it right?

- I am not totally scary of looking for a job, and reimburse loans. But everybody in the US told me that getting a child is very expensive (compares to Europe). Do I have to pay more attention of the real cost of it? If she is still at the University when she has the baby, she will have the public health insurance of it.

- I don't have a lot of money (45K$), but she has a lot of Debt in my opinion. Is it useful to get a prenuptial marriage agreement, in case of something goes wrong? Or the lawyer will be too expensive?

- I still don't know if we have to repay student loans very fast. Some people say that Gvt will give up part of the debt soon. Also, interest rates are low.. Do I have to be concerned about it and reimburse very quickly?

However, insurance is currently screwing me over.

I've been thinking of getting a personal loan to pay off the vehicle, and reduce the insurance coverage to reflect a more reasonable price. The monthly amount of the vehicle will go up, but the insurance will go down substantially.

personalfinance,How to most effectively pay for the certification required by my job,"Hi PF! I just wanted to start by saying that the tips and guidance here has helped me make some really difficult financial decisions and, to be honest, has helped me get myself in a financially secure position for the first time in a very long time. 

So here's where I need help. I currently have a teaching position in NJ (making $51,800 a year) and am required to get my ESL certification (18 credits) within the first 3 years of employment. I just finished my first year and have to start registering for the Fall Semester to be sure that I can finish in time. Each class costs between $1500 and $1700. My district offers full reimbursement (minus roughly $100 in fees) after the class is completed. I don't make enough to cover the costs of the classes out of pocket (I'm making roughly 3200 a month and expenses are roughly 1950 a month). 

As I see it, I have two options. 

Option A: I take out a credit card and pay for the classes one at a time on the card and use the reimbursements to cover the cost of the classes. My concern with this option is that I will only have the credit line to cover one class at a time, which will leave me very close to the 3-year deadline. 

Option B: I attempt to take out a loan for the cost of the semester (most likely private as I am currently $47K in federal loan debt that I am steadily paying off). My concern with this option is that I am accruing more debt at one time rather than taking it on one class at a time. 

I certainly want to stay with the district. The pay is fantastic and I love working here. After 5 years in this district, I become eligible for $17K in loan forgiveness and after finishing the 18 credits, I will also be eligible for a $4K pay increase. I was wondering which option sounded best to you all. If you need any more information, I will be more than happy to provide it.",finance,1464097558

We are contemplating refinancing the house and taking an equity loan for the 250K so my Uncle is able to take his share and then place my name on the title along with my Father's. We may also look into dropping my uncle's name off the title so it will be under me and my father and he can maybe place a lien on his share of equity for a loan.

It is a single family residence that i will be occupying. If you guys have any knowledge you'd like to share that would be wonderful. I am mainly looking for the best way cost-wise to handle the transfer. To complicate things further, i have 70K cash that can be used to lower the loan amount if necessary. I figure if the interest rate is really low, I don't have to use all 70k and can do something more beneficial with it (invest) while i pay off the main loan. Thanks guys!",finance,1464100375

- I own my car outright

- Experian says my credit score is 744.

- I have two credit cards. One is a cash rewards credit card I use for everything, a USAA AmEx, and pay it down completely each month. The other is a Discover card I didn't actually mean to get, and never use (first CC, didn't realize 'applying' for a CC meant 'getting')

- Only recurring payment is rent+utilities+cellphone, is about $560/mo
- I will max my TSP this year ($1,570/mo) and currently have ~$26k in it (L2050 fund)
- I maxed a Roth IRA for 2015 with Vanguard and currently contribute $300/mo to the Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund
- Contributing $450/mo to Betterment account with 75/25 stocks to bonds, current balance of $3,700 (idea being downpayment for a house in ~10 years)

  I realize this is long, but I'm a little overwhelmed and really appreciate your time, as well as any advice you might have.

**UPDATE:** Talked to my father. He plans to retire in January, and can accept either a ""partial lump sum of $30k or 15k/yr for a couple years"" that he intends to use to pay down  He says he has to see what makes more sense from a tax bracket perspective. Since my father will be continuing to make the minimum payments, my current strategy is a bit of a hybrid.

Step one: Cutting out Betterment, so that frees up $450/mo. 

Step two: Other investments. If I cut out Roth TSP/IRA, that would be another $1870/mo. I'm a little hesitant to cut them both out altogether. My instinct is to stop paying into the Vanguard IRA and reduce TSP to roughly $200/mo. Ups my take home from $3,329/mo to ~$4,799.

Step three: Use the $450 from Betterment to pay off the $440 loan.

Step four: Cash out my checking and savings with the exception of a $1500 emergency fund. That's $5,600 I will use that to pay off the $2,358.40 (6%). That leaves $3,241, which I'll put toward the $4,073 (5%), leaving $800 on that loan. Cutting out the Vanguard and reducing the TSP will cover that, so that loan will also be gone within a month. That drops it from 14 loans to 10, total balance from $128,411.91 to $121,540.51. After that, I'll focus on paying down one loan at at time while he continues to make the minimum payments, starting with the $17k loan (6%)",finance,1464101578

personalfinance,(US) Any reason to pay off student loans in specific order if you can just write off interest anyway?,"Hi everyone,

I started with around 30k in student loan debt and am about to drop below 10k in a few months. My question is the following:

Given that I am making below the MAGI limit (80k) and that even at 10% interest, 10k is only going to spawn around $1000 in interest a year. (Max you can write off is $2500)

Is there any reason why I should focus on the avalanche method vs. snowball method rather than just pay my set amount $500/month and let the loan company split that payment up however they like (which is what seems to be happening currently).

Original I wanted to pay off the higher interest rate loans first. But its a bit of a hassle organizing the payments to specifically take out certain loans. Then I realized that if my interest if less than $2500 overall does it really matter how much I am paying in interest? Since I get to write it off of my taxes anyway?

Thoughts?

**EDIT:** Ok I see now. So I only lower the amount of money I have that is taxable at a specific level. Then based on my actual tax I am only saving what would have been taxed of that $X amount of money deducted.

He is more frugal than I am but we are both pretty money conscious. He rarely goes out and spends money, and I'm constantly trying to save every loose bit of change I find. We had originally planned to buy this year, but between where our jobs are and the price of homes in the areas that are reasonable for our commutes, we would have been throwing away money for one extra bedroom and a not so nice neighborhood. So we're going to wait a couple years and re-assess.

The minimum on my loans currently adds up to about $150/month.
We have 65k cash in the bank that we have set aside as a down payment on a future house, and every month we add at least $2300 more. Any bonuses or other payments (sometimes I teach and get some bonus cash) goes into that account. I just put it in there and in the 6 years we've been married the only time we touched it was to buy my car last year. My parents are incredibly proud of what we have saved and have never once asked for help paying the loans. 

Should we take a portion of our down payment and pay off my student loans? One of the student loans? (one is about 8500, the other about 6500, interest rate is 11-ish%, and I hate the thought of my parents paying so much when I'm capable of paying them off with a few swift clicks of my keyboard. In the time it's taking me to write this post, I could pay them off.) 

Thinking we were going to purchase a home (we've been on the fence for about 3 years now), my parents took a huge tax refund (a conglomeration of refunds due to a retroactive change in the tax code) and paid off the largest 15k loan last year. They probably would have done it anyway, as that loan had the highest interest and, but they specifically mentioned us buying a home as a reason for paying it off, as it was dragging down what we could qualify for.

Should I start paying into the student loans? Or should I continue to let my parents pay for them as they have offered since I was little?

My brother is also in college and will graduate in 2 years, at which point my parents will have to start paying for his loans. I feel like we should help in some way? Maybe we contribute $150 per month in addition to what my parents are paying to help pay down the principal and at least save them the money? Maybe we can get them paid off before my brother's loans need to be paid?

My mom is confident that she can pay off the smaller one by the end of the year using a few of my Dad's bonuses, but that still leaves them with 8500 to pay with that nasty interest.

I recognize that this is a more personal issue, my parents would never ask me for help with the loans, but I can't help but feel like I owe them something. We're also planning on kids (which my mom is going crazy for and my dad is almost ready for), so maybe I just hand them a grandkid and we call it even?",finance,1464114308
personalfinance,Help with first home financing decisions,"I am new to Reddit personal finance. I have read many articles over the past year and I have decided to make my own post for some specific help. 
My wife and I have taken the big step getting pre approved and putting a bid on a house. It was accepted, we had written in a few options for lenders on our contract. Now is time for the tough decision of choosing a rate. 

Our family income is ~$100k and with very little debt. Our bid was accepted at $191,000 with 5% down, $500 earnest money and they will pay $6000 for closing. Our rent currently is $1200 a month. Monthly taxes are $205 per month and $56 Hoa fee. 

We have been quoted a few options for interest and mortgage rates. I would appreciate some advice for choosing what works best for us in the short and long run. 

For home insurance is getting a high deductible  with a lower rate a decent option? $2000 deductible  at $135 per month vs $5000 deductible at $93 per month. It is a 2009 home outside of any flood zone in a relatively low claim area. 

For financing we can only put 5% down, but we can manage cash needed at closing vs monthly payment. We are financing $181450. For 3.85% we only need $9050 at closing after earnest money; $849 p&amp;i. For 3.75% we need $10200 at closing; 838 p&amp;i. For 3.5% we need $12400 at closing; $813 p&amp;i. 

We are dipping into our savings to put 5% down; but we have been offered help from our parents to make things easier on decision making if we do come on hard times from being house poor. That knowledge makes things less risky for us to put more down. I just don't want to put us in a situation where we may need to take a handout. 

Right now I am leaning toward the high deductible insurance option and the highest interest rate loan. This is purely to keep money in my pocket now; because it will be years until the break even point. At that point we will be in a position to refinance if need be.",finance,1464114634

personalfinance,Wondering if this is worth the payout? [Maryland],"I got an offer letter from a local bank, telling me if I opened a checking account with them, and left it open for at least 90 days (three months) I would receive $250. The catch is I have to deposit $2,500 between the time I open the account...and I think August 31. That's not a problem for me at this time. I can write them a check for that amount on the spot from my current checking account, and leave it there for three months. I just wonder if it's worth doing so. Checking accounts aren't getting great interest rates anyway, which isn't what I'm after, but after taxes and so forth next year, would I even have that $250, or would the IRS just take a good chunk of that, negating all my efforts?

I realize this is probably a tactic just to get me through the door to sell me stuff I don't need, but the $250 is very tempting!

personalfinance,Advice on budget w/ promo period credit card,"Hi /r/PersonalFinance.  I need advice on two things that have been plaguing me for awhile.

1.  How to deal with 10k of credit debt that has a 0% promotional period until May 2017 (will go to 18.99% after that) when other debt exists with interest rates...
     * I pay $300 a month toward this 10k credit card.  I could pay more toward this but since it's 0% I've been putting the extra money ($100-200 depending on month) toward loans with an interest rate (the highest % first).
     * I'll have a bonus come February 2017 that will be in the $8,000 to $10,000 range, which I would put toward this debt.  So 8-10k, after taxed, say 5-7k I get.  Couple 5-7k bonus with the $300/month = 8 to 10k toward this debt in a year period. Any gap I would just pull from my savings (about $10k in my savings).  There is some risk here in the off chance I wouldn't get a bonus or something happens where my job is compromised.  I have a pretty secure job so I'm not really worried about that.
     * I have a few other loans ranging in interest rates of 2-6.5% , all in the $2000-5000 range.  I pay the minimums.  

But couple point 1 with the following and that's why I'm not sure what to do.

2.  I also was looking into consolidating some of the above debts (10k credit, ~11k school debt) 
     * So $10k in 0% credit card debt + $11,347 in school debts (4.8% to 6.5% rates) = $21,347
     * Monthly expense on the above is $580ish  ($300 credit card, $56.78 loan1, $95.87 loan2, $128 loan3)
     * I can get a 5 year, $25,000 loan at a fixed rate of 11.67% with monthly total of $551.95
     * This would spare me $30 a month for 5 years, which totals $1,800 as well as some level of sanity knowing all that debt is consolidated


So I'm hung up on should I keep doing what I'm doing and plan to conquer the 10k in credit card debt sometime early next year.... or take a loan, bang out the credit and school loans and lower my monthly expense by $30.  I guess I'm just not sure how to deal with the potential that I don't clear the credit card debt then get hit with 18.99% interest.

Any advice would be fantastic!  I can provide more information if it would help make the decision easier.  I have other debts too in addition to what's above.",finance,1464122170

- I'm doing the bare minimal health care accounts at about $25/month. 
- Is there a bank I should be working with to get these loans lower? Citizensbank is one that comes to mind, but I want to hear if there's better banks that can take those 6.8% interest loans and decrease it to a smaller size. In general, I want a bank with minimal fees, and that actually want to help me progress in life.. not just be another account #.
- How much money should I be putting against these loans? I want to pay them off ASAP which means 1-2 years.
- How do I balance my loans with life? When would it be a good time to look into investing in a car? Or how do I start saving for a car, while paying off my student loans. Or is it better to just slam dunk the student loans, and freedom will pursue? I was looking at the Tesla Model3 as my ""first big purchase"" as an adult.. Is that something that is doable on my salary and my current loan amount?
- How do I invest any left over money in something meaningful. I want to feel like I have power over how I'm investing, and want tips on how to make the most of my paycheck. I'm trying to cut back as much as possible on take-out, and simply grind out until I have no student loans left.

Additionally, I just recently won a NASA Fellowship that will fully cover my tuition, travel, and summer expenses, and will provide me with a $36000/yr stipend. With that said, the more time that I spend here on r/pf, the more scared I'm becoming of my student loan debt from undergraduate.

I plan to move to Baltimore or DC (hopefully DC). I'm majoring in Finance, so i'm not sure how long it'll take me to find a job, but once i do, i'm leaving my hometown, which is about 30 minutes from Baltimore.

I do plan on living at home for a little to pay down my student loans(I'm anticipating about $35k), but I want to get out on my own as soon as possible. My dad lives in ATL and has personal problems that i think may become bigger problems. My mom isn't very good with her finances. The good news is she just got a pretty good new job after making only ~20k for the past 3 years as a sub teacher(lost her job in 2009).

My Dad was recently supposed to help my brother get a car but he basically bluffed. My mom is trying to get my brother to finance a car with a down payment.

I know she would probably want me to do the same, but i don't want to have to deal with that stress of an extra payment.(My mom has also fallen back on car payments twice within the past 3 years...most likely because sub teaching doesn't pay well. As of right now she doesn't have a car and her credit is so bad she cant do anything...I don't want to risk that.)

Originally, my plan was to save up about $1500-$2500 for some shit car to last me. I was gonna do that this summer. The likelihood of this car malfunctioning would probably be high. My dad *might* help, but he flaked on my brother. My mom *might* also help, but they're both wildcards to me right now, so its safer to plan without any help.

What i thought of today was would it be a better idea to just buy a used 49cc moped off of craigslist? The chances of it failing are low, the gas millage is high, and in a city area like Baltimore or DC, there are plenty of buses/rails to take to and from work. With this plan, i wouldn't have to worry about the car failing on me, monthly car payments/car insurence along with student loans, and i could save up $5,000-$7,000 for a reasonably nicer car and just pay up front.

The only cons i can think of are rain...if it rained riding a moped would be a bitch....well and the fact that i wouldn't have a car, but whatever...

**TL;DR:** I plan on moving to a city after i graduate and buying a moped rather than a car to save costs, and hopefully save up for a not shitty car.

financialindependence,Wife has chance to recommend retirement account for non-profit where she's sole employee. What move is best for FI/RE given for us? Others?,"*sorry about the odd subject line, was posting too early in the morning for me! 


Life Situation: Married filing separately (due to her student loan debt and PSLF plan), 0 dependents, Midwest state, early 30s.

FIRE Progress: Hoping to FIRE in &lt;10 years, $1M target, 20% there, savings rate of 43% last year.

Gross Salary/Wages: Combined income $150k, 100k (me) and 50k (her)

Yearly Savings Amounts: $22,200 annually in 401k (me, it's okay it's over 18k, trust me looked into it) $12,500 Simple IRA for her, no HSA, maxing FSA, max backdoor roth IRA for me, about ~20,000 into taxable accounts

Only income is salary

Expected ER expenses: $40,000k (willing to move)

Assets: 90/10 for 200k invested

Her: large amount of student loan debt - PSLF would put us ahead by $20,000 vs repayment plans, interest rates are ~6% Me: minimal loans (could pay off in a month but have low rates)

My wife works for a non-profit that is putting in place their first retirement benefits plan for her, the only employee. The plan will need to be approved by the board but she can suggest the plans that will work best. She's VERY committed to the non-profit and would sacrifice her own best interest for its best interest. That said, if her best interest and the non-profits align then all the better.

Our FIRE plan benefits from any amount of her income we can sock away into pre-tax accounts since it lowers her income and her PSLF payments while not affecting our spending since we're already socking away into taxable accounts. Do you have any advice about what kind of 401k/403b plan she should recommend to allow us to maximize the amount going into pre-tax accounts? Icing on the cake is if anyone has recommendations for companies to set these up with that offer low fees and startup costs for a single employee.

We'd plan on doing a Roth Conversion Ladder leading into FIRE and once we're there, so having large balances in 401k and 403b aren't concerning to us.

Thanks /r/financialindependence I appreciate helping us come up with a plan that helps her and the organization!",finance,1464177238

MachineLearning,Applying Adversarial Network To Natural Language Generation,"Hey Guys,

Lately, I have been trying to applying a adversarial network to generating sequences of words. Right now, I'm just trying to get a toy task to work eg(""learn learn learn learn learn pad pad pad pad"")

The problem is that the discriminator ends up just crushing the generator, and the generator can never beat it. I have tried:

* Changing learning rates (adam 0.0001 and beta2 0.005)
* Perturbing the generator's weights so it will settle on a different local min
* Changing RNN architecture (GRU, LSTM, Vanilla RNN)
* Different initializations

Currently, I have the generator produce a softmax distribution for each timestep which is fed directly to the discriminator. For the real data, I ""fake"" a softmax distribution where the selected word has a 50 to 80% and the other words are random noise all summing to 1.0 in the end. The generator always learns something. Specifically, its weights and outputs change but the generator always learns the repeat the wrong word. 

I know Goodfellow commented that applying adversarial is harder to NLP because words are not continuous real data. Rather, words are discrete. I'm thinking of instead of passing a softmax distribution, passing the embedding. On generation time, you could take the cosine closest distance from the embedding space to a word. In this way, each word is more like a continuous real data, where the embedding can be altered slightly. 

Don't mean to write a book, but I thought I would run all of this by you guys for feedback. Thoughts?",technology,1464181473

personalfinance,401k vs. Student Loans Questions,"Hi PF I’ve been watching this subreddit for a little while now and I’ve learned a lot. I’ve recently gotten into closely watching my finances and taking some of the advice mentioned here. I’ve just a couple questions that pertain to my situation. 

To introduce myself I’m 25 and I just started working for a company that provides health insurance, 401K and all those other benefits about 3 months ago. So I’ve really just started budgeting and watching my finances. At the moment I’m slated to make about 35k a year. My monthly take home is about $1700 a month. Out of that take home, I pay out about $450 dollars a month towards student loans. 

The one loan is a parent plus loan that I’m paying off that’s in my mom’s name it has about $7000 left on it currently at close to 6.5% interest. The other payment goes towards 9 of my subsidized and unsubsidized loans with interest rates ranging from about 3% to 6% with a total balance of about $29,000. 

I’ve got my budget made, I live at home, so no rent, and the only real monthly expenses I have are my student loans, car insurance, cell phone, gas, other minor expenses and less than 500 dollars of debt on a credit card(No Interest at the moment) that should be gone in the next few paychecks. I have about $2000 put aside in an emergency fund which I contribute about $50 a month too. I’ve got about $8500 in savings at the moment as well.

I’ve been at this new job for almost 3 months now and I’ve been contributing to my 401k which is through John Hancock. My company is employee owned and they have an ESOP(Employee Stock Ownership Program). The company will match what I put in to my 401k up to 8% of my paycheck, of which I contribute 5% right now and will have that at 8% in another month or two, but they will match it in stock of the company. The company’s stock price is currently around $750 a share. So if I put $500 into my 401k they will match with $500 worth of our companies stock. This is my understanding of it. Does anyone have any thoughts or experience with this kind of deal?

My ultimate goal is to subdivide a piece of my parents land and build a house on it. They won’t charge me for the land or anything they’ve already suggested I do this, so I’m kind of trying to save up for that a bit. I would ideally like to start building in the next 3 years hopefully. 

My question is kind of what should I be prioritizing as far as my loans and 401K? Should I be using my extra income or any extra money I may come across to build up my 401k further or should I put it towards my student loans? My student loans are at a relatively lower interest rate and I’m paying the minimum payments every month. I’ll probably start putting another $100 dollars into the parent plus loan a month to try to get rid of that one a little quicker and hopefully make a $2000 lump payment at the end when it gets down to it to pay it off in 3 years or so. I guess I just want to know should I be prioritizing my student loans over my 401k with any extra money I come across monthly?

Another question I had, I’ve been reading the investing articles and such on here and I’m still very new to it all, but does it make sense to think about starting investing if I’m not even close to maxing out my 401k, which is $18,000 a year correct? From what I’ve read a little bit of, it seems like I should try to max out my 401k before investing in any other stocks or bond options is this good thinking?

Sorry for such a long post just wanted to make sure I had as much relevant info as I thought might be helpful to answer.

personalfinance,"Which is more advisable? Paying off student loans ($50k), putting money toward financial investments, or both?","I am currently attempting to weigh the benefits of paying down my student loans and/or seeing my money grow through investments.

I've recently spoken with a coworker about the benefit of loan (student/home loan/car loan/etc) repayment versus the benefit of applying funds to an investment portfolio (non-401k) while making the minimum monthly payment on the loan.

His stance is: While it may feel better to be debt free, the funds used to repay the debt will not be providing you the same financial benefit down the line when compared to an investment; as in, the negative aspect of compounding interest is outweighed by the money to (likely) be made by investing.

While I follow that train of thought somewhat, I'm uncertain what the ""best"" option would be if repayment of loans and minimum investments are held constant. 

Do I:

* Continue to make minimum monthly payments on my $50k student loan (6.05% interest, daily compounded) and more than ""minimum"" (for my situation) installments into my investment portfolio

OR

* Make additional payments on my student loans and minimum installments to my portfolio (taking what I would have invested and put it toward the student loans)

**Loan payment:**  *$407/mo*
**Loan amount:**  *$50,000*
**Loan interest rate:**  *6.05% daily compounded*

This post is ignoring the rest of our finances and looking only at retirement savings. Assuming we plan to put away exactly 18k gross each into retirement savings(split between 401K and Roth IRA), should we max out our federal 401k contribution limit or max out our Roth IRA limits and put the remaining into our 401k? 

My opinion is that we are in the 25% bracket and investing all of our money in the 401k allows us to decrease our tax liability the greatest currently. However, my counter thought is that we will likely always be in the 25% bracket and should invest in the Roth IRA for future tax diversification.",finance,1464192090

Fast forward to today and I've come to the conclusion that I'm paying too much in interest rates and the simplicity is just not worth it, and I should just get a better system to manage the balance transfers. Since the loan company doesn't accept credit cards for payment, I need to use those checks that come with the statement every month. BoA calls them Access Checks.

The plan is to basically use one of these checks to pay off the personal loan, then split up the credit card into a couple of 0% apr balance transfer cards. However I don't have much experience with these checks and the internet is full of warnings about using them.

personalfinance,Should I invest my house down-payment savings?,"I have around $20k that I wish to grow to around $35k for a house downpayment.  I'm going to contribute to it monthly but I'm wondering if I should pursue investing it in ETF index funds (S&amp;P 500, etc.) instead of just letting it sit in the bank with a low interest rate (0.01%).  I already experimented with a smaller bucket of money ($3000) and currently have fairly good returns ($300 in unrealized gains) and would like to replicate to some level a 6-10% annual increase from investing in equities (80%) and bonds (20%).

[Brief snapshot of my financial situation](http://i.imgur.com/05bGdfN.jpg) according to the flowchart posted in other threads.

Most of my interest-bearing debt will be paid off within the next month or so, and my non-interest (0%) debt is budgeted in.  I have an emergency savings built up that covers around 1.5 months of current expenses.  The money in the down payment fund is something I don't plan on using for any other purpose.

The timeframe that my wife and I were looking to use the down-payment money would be next year, so we both plan on aggressively saving and hustling money into the fund.  If I choose to invest it I would likely follow a similar pattern of 80% equities and 20% bonds in a DRIP portfolio until we need to pull it out.

Is this a good idea, or should I just keep the down-payment fund in a bank account?

financialindependence,"Retiring cheap - What are the tax rates like, costs of health insurance, etc.?","So let's say I want to retire fairly frugally with $500k, split 100k/400k between pre-tax (401k or IRA) and post-tax (non tax-advantaged) dollars. (Not my real numbers, but a hypothetical scenario with easy numbers).

Say I'm planning to withdraw about 30k/year. If I was going to do this, I'd withdraw from non tax-advantaged first, then switch to 401k/IRA withdrawals if the regular brokerage account runs out, right? So my income would be 30k, putting me in the 15% marginal bracket, giving me an effective tax rate of something like 13-14% (single, no kids, easy situation). I'd do 72(t) distributions from the 401k/IRA if the taxable account ran out. 

So after federal tax I'd be getting ~$26k (then let's say another 10% of that 30k for state tax as well, just as a made up number, which brings me down to $23k). Is my general math right here? I'm assuming renting, taking the standard deduction, either a paid off house or renting an apartment, etc.

What about health insurance? Assuming I'm 35 and healthy, what are my options and costs for basic health insurance?

personalfinance,Low-income graduate: consolidate and REPAYE or IBR (or nothing at all)?,"Cross-post from /r/studentloans but revised with added information. I'm trying to get a better grasp on the pros/cons of opting for student loan income-driven repayments in my situation. The **tl;dr** is I *think* I have a good course of action laid out but I only spent the past week or so reading into this stuff so there's a cloud of 'what did I miss' hanging over my head. If anyone is willing to look at my situation and offer any advice, or just explain some of the terms I'm dealing with (but failing to understand) -- it would be greatly appreciated!



**My living situation**: 

* Soon-to-be-26-year-old who graduated in May of 2012 and has mostly been on a standard repayment plan for undergraduate loans since--a total which now stands at roughly 49k. My only non-standard move was receiving a year of unemployment deferment two years ago (on federal only); I have been in full standard repayment on privates since graduation and on federal since the deferment's end (has to be 14 months +).

* My AGI last year was roughly $15.5k and this year it so far projects to be the same. I will make more, though; I have no other choice.

* My ~$740/mo. payments were manageable at this pay mostly because of low living expenses under my parents roof. I live rent-free, bike to work, am still under my mother's health insurance, etc. The problem now is I expect to start paying more and more for myself in the near future, and at least in the short term I know I can't afford that with my current student loan payment.



**My loans**:

* http://i.imgur.com/HNUv7sk.jpg 

(A copy of my private group, Federal group and some totals at the bottom along with my projected weighted interest rate for the federal group according to the [Federal Repayment Estimator](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action) -- though I hand calculated the FEEL subgroup rate below and it came out to 6.4993%)



**My questions**:


**Does applying for an Income-driven plan make sense in my situation?** 

The short-term relief would absolutely be a major help, and as I don't have any clear, sudden paths to a major increase in pay, I may not be able to afford the standard payment soon anyway. I also feel kind of exposed without much ability to build up emergency funds. 

And If I do create more income in the future, wouldn't it make more sense to pay off the high-interest private loans first? Having less go toward the federals (especially with the first three years of interest benefits) would allow me wiggle room to pay off those private loans if I do come into more money. The REPAYE interest benefits seem very attractive in this regard. 


**Should I opt for consolidation and REPAYE, or stick with what I have now and go with IBR?**

It seems like REPAYE is a better option with a shorter, 20-year period (undergraduate only); better interest benefits (gov pays full-sub 3 years plus half-sub thereafter and half-unsub throughout vs. only full-sub 3 years for IBR); and a smaller monthly max (10% vs 15%). 

As I understand it, two of the bigger drawbacks are no monthly payment caps (I could end up exceeding my standard monthly payment) and something to do with marriage (which seems pretty distant to me at this point in my life). The lack of a monthly max doesn't bother me--I figure I can work around 10% of a much larger income if it ever came to that (but that's coming from someone putting almost every earned penny into student loans now).

What it seems to boil down to, then, is if consolidating my Stafford FEEL loans (**or all of my federals, if that's preferable?**) is worth gaining access to REPAYE over staying with how it's grouped now and opting for IBR or IBR/REPAYE (as the Directs qualify for the latter). From what I understand, consolidating will make the selected grouping one loan with a weighted interest rate ROUNDED UP to the nearest 1/8th of 1%. Calculating the weighted average of my FEEL interest rates, I come to 6.4993%, which would only round up to 6.5% under a consolidation (confirmed by finaid.gov loan consolidation calculator). 

Isn't that well worth the additional interest benefits of the REPAYE plan, or **am I missing something?** I understand accrued interest on an unsubsidized Stafford Loans is capitalized upon consolidation, but looking at my most recent statement, I have only $95 unpaid accrued interest for my Federal grouping, and I don't even know if that's from the Staffords. It could be $0.

**My thoughts now:**

* Coming from my shitty, Googled knowledge of finance, consolidations, loans, etc, it seems like consolidating my FEEL subgroup THEN applying that loan AND my other, already-qualified Direct federal loans for REPAYE is the best course of action.

* I'll get roughly $400/mo. relief now with the added interest benefits of REPAYE over IBR and the only 'cost' of the pre-requisite consolidation is the initial 0.0007% round up in interest. I don't believe the loans offered any special benefits. 

Of course extending my pay period will cost me, but isn't that the price of any income-driven plan? Is it best to stick with standard repayment even if I have to worry every month about making enough for the payments? Making more money would allow me to stay on standard repayment, but even then $740/mo. seems like a lot for someone coming into the expenses of an adult, independent lifestyle. I don't know, I still feel like I'm missing something here.

Anyway, thanks for any help. If anything it felt good doing the necessary research and kinda throwing this all together for a couple hours and thinking it through.",finance,1464201431

If anyone is good with this type of thing and has some free time to give some advice, I would really appreciate it. Happy to answer any questions for clarification/more details. 

Because of an amazing scholarship during undergrad, I am currently debt free and preparing to enter a 3-year doctorate program. The tuition for that will be $115k and I have another $150k (50k per year) scholarship. I guess my question is - how much should I take out in federal loans to cover my remaining living expenses, and when? I don't have any money saved currently. 

A follow up, sort of unrelated question would be, what should I do about saving for retirement?  I won't have a full-time job for another 3 years, but could I (and should I) open a private retirement account of some sort?

Possible relevant information
- I currently have one credit card with a $1,000 limit that I have paid in full for the past year. No loans for anything. 

- My rent + utilities are $1,000 per month

- I am able to borrow the max ($20,500 I think) amount per 2-semester-period, but I know I don't need that much

personalfinance,"[Taxes] I somehow owe almost $600 in state taxes for 2014, but I only earned 17K that year. Help please!","This year was the first that I did my taxes by myself. Before that, my grandpa handled the whole family's taxes. This post is about taxes for the year 2014, when I was a college student. I had a couple of internships and a part-time job at a mall store. I earned a little over 17K. 

I graduated early in December 2014, then withdrew about $15K from my college savings account (which is managed by an investment firm) to pay off my student loans so I could graduate debt-free. That was my Christmas present to myself. The college fund was recently transferred over to my name when I turned 21. The money would have been used on the fourth year of college, but I worked hard so I could get out of there early and save some money.

Come March 2015, my grandpa sent me the materials for my federal and state taxes. According to that, I should have received a $275 refund from the feds, and I owed about $120 to the state of North Carolina. I wrote a check and mailed everything off. I double-checked with my bank and the check to NC cleared.

I didn't hear anything about it until about two months ago when my mom (who lives in Texas) got a collections letter from the NC IRS claiming that I owed them almost $600 from 2014. I immediately called them to see what was going on. Someone there told me that I needed to get my federal tax transcript and send it to them, so I made that request online and waited.

Well, it turns out that the federal IRS never received my 2014 tax return. I don't know if it got lost in the mail (does that still happen?) but nobody ever told me that it didn't go through. I'm absent-minded and bad about money so I didn't notice when the refund never came. I know that's awful and I need to be better about that. 

I called up my grandpa and got all the paperwork for 2014 that he had prepared, and sent copies of both my federal and state taxes to the federal IRS mailing address in Kansas City with a cover letter explaining the situation and apologizing. I asked specifically for someone to contact me to make sure everything was settled. That was three weeks ago, and I haven't heard anything from them. I know that's par for the course, but I need that information now. I've tried calling the IRS but I can't get a human being on the line despite waiting for 60-90 minutes several times.

Today I got a letter that said I have 30 days to pay the $600 to the NC IRS or it would be sent to collections and probably destroy my credit score, if it hasn't already. I don't know what to do. I could pay it, but I would be dipping into my (meager) savings and I don't think I actually owe this money. What should be my next step?",finance,1464210191

so now the total on the card owed is about 1250$

my question is, for my bill that's due in about a week, if i pay the 250$ that it says i owe, will it charge me interest on the other 1000$ that i didn't pay so far yet? 

or will it only charge me interest if i go past the due date on that for next month?

i can pay all 1250$ now, but then that leaves me very little money for stuff until i get my next paycheck.

i could instead split it up into 2 payments of 500/500 over my next 2 paychecks (before the next due date) and it would be much easier

But if I take like the total amount paid over the life of the loan, then subtract starting principal, I get the total interest spent on the loan.  
  
But then if I, for example, divide that total interest paid over the life of the loan by the initial principal, it doesn't equal the interest rate.  Dividing that number by the # of years in the loan doesn't get me the int rate, nor does dividing it by 12 (months), etc etc.  
  
I can't logically understand what ""amortization"" means.  What the formula suggests, and why it is used.  
  
Logically, if we had a 36 month loan of 10,000 at 5%, I would think that (10,000 * 3 * .05) would be sufficient...  But it's not.

Backstory: fresh out of engineering school, land a salaried job and I being to think about buying a new-used car to replace my old faithful 2001 Honda CR-V. It's about 4 months into my new gig, and I have enough to place a decent down payment. I know I shouldn't go all out (I've seen people drown in auto loan payments) so I decide to wait for as long as I can. Unfortunately, Helga the Honda didn't make it very long (rest in piece old girl) and I was in a position to locate a car and a loan within a few days. I found the car (2013 Hyundai Elantra, 52k miles, clean title, 2 owners) for only $11,200 off the lot! Since this was my first loan (and I was in a tight spot) I decided to finance my vehicle through my bank, Wells Fargo. I only needed $9K, since I could afford a $2,200 down-payment for the car. WF approved me for 63 months, 7.43% APR fixed and my minimum payment came to $171.55/month based on me having a 732 Transunion c.s. and 100% on time payments, in full, for my two years of credit history. I thought ""hey, it's my first loan ever. I shouldn't be surprised the rate is high.""

I picked up this loan in October, and I've already paid +$400 in interest. However, I made a $1500 principle payment along with my first minimum payment and I'm currently sitting a just under $6,500 left. I'd really like to get my rate down, so I'm considering refinancing with Coastal Federal (who advertised a much lower rate.) I talked briefly with customer service, and they estimated that I can get a rate as low as 3.4% for 66 months, and estimated my monthly payment to be ~$140.

It sounded good, but a voice in the back of my head reminded me that WF told me in the beginning that I could get a rate as low as 3% for 5 years too... my question is, is it worth to refinance an auto loan this small? I don't want to go through the effort of applying, putting a hard inquiry on my credit report only to figure out the CF will only give me the same rate. I realize that banks make money off the interest and for a small amount they want the most interest possible.



tl;dr: I've got $6,500 left on a 63 month loan, 7.43% APR, $171.55/month. Is it worth looking into refinancing for a lower rate?

Private Loan 1: $11,500 @ 10.5%, $133/month

Private Loan 2: $12,250 @ 8.5%, $160/month

Federal Loans: $30,000 @ 4.3%, $280/month

All three loans are deferred, with accruing interest, for 6 months. I have no other debts besides these.

My income and expenses are as follows:

Monthly income after tax and 401(k) contributions (5% company match): $3,157

Rent/Utilites: $1000

Food: $300

Car/Gas: $100

""Fun"" Money: $400

Which leaves me $1,357 per month to pay off loans. Currently the plan is to use some of the deferment period to create an emergency fund of 1-2 months. After that I will immediately start paying down the private loans while making no payments on the federal loans until after the 6 month deferment. After the deferment period is up I plan on following the avalanche method until the rest of my student loan debt is gone. 

Recently, I have become aware of refinancing through SOFI. I have been pre-approved to refinance my two private loans into one $23,750 loan @ 7%. If I choose the 7 year repayment plan I would get a rate of 6.5%. 

Some additional information: I'm currently making $57,000 a year. I am earning my Master's part-time for free (company is paying for it), and will have that four years from now. Once I do I can expect my salary to be around $85,000. Along with that, I have strong job security (federal job in an in-demand field) so I would be comfortable with a riskier, shorter term loan. 

So here are my questions:

What is the likelihood I am not approved for this new loan even though I was pre-approved?

Are there any downsides to refinancing those two loans?

Is SOFI a reputable source to refinance through? Are there other lenders out there that are better for what I'm looking for?

If I do choose to refinance, should I wait until I have my emergency fund in order to take advantage of the deferment period? If so, would I still get approved in a couple months down the road?

Are there any other issues that I am overlooking?

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinance Help,"Here are the specifics of my current student loan. I initially had 3 different loans with 2 different lenders when I graduated from college and I refinanced them 2 years ago into a single loan with a single lender. Term is 15 years. The initial interest rate was 5.87% variable. The lender gave me a .25% discount for having auto pay and another .25% for having the money drawn from a checking account with their bank so for the first year in a half my interest rate was 5.37%. In January of this year they upped the rate from 5.37% to 5.62%. They will be upping the interest rate from 5.62% to 5.87% in December. My minimum monthly payment is $285.95, but I pay an additional $150 a month so my payments are $435.95. I've made additional monthly payment every month since I've refinanced. 

I've been looking around and there's a lender who is offering a few different options to refinance. The first is a fixed rate of 4.79% on a 10 year loan. My minimum monthly payments would increase by roughly $8 a month. The second is a fixed rate of 4.74% on a 5 year loan. My minimum monthly payments would jump by roughly $250 a month. The third is a variable rate of 2.44% on a 10 year loan. My minimum monthly payments would actually be lowered by roughly $23 a month. The fourth option is a variable rate of 2.19% on a 5 year loan. My minimum monthly payments would jump by $ roughly $200 a moth.

If you were in my position, which option would you choose? I am leaning towards the 10 year, 2.44% variable rate loan. My minimum monthly payments would be lower and in the event of an emergency, I could easily scale back any additional payments on the loan. I figure I could pay the loan back well before the 10 year period. I ran some amortization schedules and with making my current payment ($435.95) I could pay the loan off in under 6 years.

investing,Why doesn't Lending Club offer CDs or savings accounts and use the deposits to fund loans?,"They are given out a fairly large amount of loans; getting a small banking license, similarly to what a regional bank has, can't be that expensive? How do all these small banks do it otherwise?

LC could offer CDs with 2% or 3% interest rates and then use the funds to originate more loans. They could bank the difference of 4% - 5%, seems like a no brainer? 

They could go even so far as acquiring a small regional bank and have their assets invested in it. Wouldn't that be a viable way to bridge the credit crunch?",finance,1464248387

personalfinance,"Weird way fedex bills credit cards -- used a prepaid mastercard, still received an invoice with a due amount despite card having plenty of money on it.","So apparently the way fedex bills when using a credit card (shipping online yourself) is a bit wonky.  I've seen this when using my personal CC, pay for the package/sticker online but the charge doesn't actually appear on your card till about 1 to 1.5 weeks AFTER you ship it.  

I recently sent a package using a prepaid $100 master card I received from work. Transaction went through just fine only weird part under the ""name"" when paying via CC (mastercard) is I put the name on the card ""A gift for you"".   Everything went smooth, package was delivered just fine. The cost to send it was 38 dollars (card had 100 on it - yes I checked)

About 2 weeks later I get a paper invoice from FedEx addressed to ""A gift for you"" at my address, and basically it says ""yeah there was some weirdness with the card, you now need to pay us $43 dollars for that package""    uhhh wtf?

I don't have the prepaid card anymore because I used up the remaining 60 dollar balance and everything in life was great. Now I get a bill saying ""pay us"" despite zero error on my part. I don't feel so should fork over another 43 dollars to them.  

**My Question** since it's not specifically addressed to me  but to ""A gift for you"", can I just ignore this?  Or are they going to try and come after me in some respect? I don't want my credit rating, name or address on some sort of blacklist due to their errors. 

In the past it's been annoying when I use my personal CC, because I'll see the charge for X amount from Fedex sometimes 2 weeks after I've shipped something, I'll have to go back and make 100% sure it's a legit charge because I rarely ship things.

personalfinance,Is it wise to refinance to a 15y fixed rate mortgage to save 1.125% in interest and pay off 5y earlier?,"Many thanks to the wisdom of this sub, we've paid off all debt except for our 30y 4.125% fixed rate mortgage, which we have paid into for a decade. We were looking to refinancing into a 15y 3% fixed to get the lower interest rate and pay off the loan five years earlier. My question to you all is: does this make sense? Or would it be wiser to maintain the lower monthly cost, set aside the $447 in a solid, conservative investment, and pay it off all at once down the road? I ask because my spouse and I are self employed, and though we have 3 months emergency savings set aside, I am nervous about the risk of the higher monthly expense - if we go a while in between gigs, we could tap into that conservative investment to pay the mortgage without fear of falling behind in payments. Which is the wiser move?

EDIT:  My apologies - there is a lot of info I didn't provide!
First - this is for an owner-occupied two-flat in a very desirable Chicago neighborhood; one floor is rented out at $1400; could bump that up to $1500-1800 but the spouse is desperate to take over the whole building for more room, or move. (That would entail the argument of whether to keep &amp; rent or sell, when we live in Chicago, which is hemorrhaging residents.) The mortgage started at $415k. Our payment is $2165 which includes an escrow of $735 for taxes &amp; insurance. The remaining principal is $277,000. If we refinance the $277,000 into a 15y fixed at 3% (no fees; with $1800 in fees we'd get 2.875%), our monthly payment would be $1913/month plus the $735 escrow for a total of $2648 - $483 more than we pay now. Why we hesitate is all the uncertainty: will we continue to get clients that will allow us to maintain our budget? What will happen with rents - so much new construction (SFH's selling for $800k+ down the block) but data shows people leaving? CPS schools crumbling, pushing us toward leave (do we keep &amp; rent or sell?) It's the uncertainty that makes me wonder if we should lean on the side of paying less in the short term and more in the long term in the hopes that we can save up a payoff that we never need to dip into. 

EDIT 2:  Those who say the numbers didn't add up, you were right - the *purchase price was $415k, I had forgotten about the money down (unfortunately, we got the place with ""no money down"", listening to terrible advice from a mortgage broker and instead taking a HELOC that we refinanced into a second mortgage that we finally paid off. So, so stupid. That's why I'm so grateful for the wisdom of this sub. You all are seriously amazing.

So SINCERE thanks for the input - I'm reading it all and getting a great education! I'm leaning towards not refinancing, stuffing as much as we can away in an investment as a bigger e-fund until we build up the payoff amount, and pay it all off at once. Hopefully that strategy will balance my desire for a paid-off property, flexibility, and security - with, thanks to you all, a clear understanding of what those values cost in real dollars!",finance,1464263183

personalfinance,Help with Refinancing Student Loans,"Hey r/pf, I have a few questions about possibly refinancing my student loans. I graduated this past month with the following loans:

Private Loan 1: $11,500 @ 10.5%, $133/month

Private Loan 2: $12,250 @ 8.5%, $160/month

Federal Loans: $30,000 @ 4.3%, $280/month

All three loans are deferred, with accruing interest, for 6 months. I have no other debts besides these.

My income and expenses are as follows:

Monthly income after tax and 401(k) contributions (5% company match): $3,157

Rent/Utilites: $1000

Food: $300

Car/Gas: $100

""Fun"" Money: $400

Which leaves me $1,357 per month to pay off loans. Currently the plan is to use some of the deferment period to create an emergency fund of 1-2 months. After that I will immediately start paying down the private loans while making no payments on the federal loans until after the 6 month deferment. After the deferment period is up I plan on following the avalanche method until the rest of my student loan debt is gone.

Recently, I have become aware of refinancing through SOFI. I have been pre-approved to refinance my two private loans into one $23,750 loan @ 7%. If I choose the 7 year repayment plan I would get a rate of 6.5%.

Some additional information: I'm currently making $57,000 a year. I am earning my Master's part-time for free (company is paying for it), and will have that four years from now. Once I do I can expect my salary to be around $85,000. Along with that, I have strong job security (federal job in an in-demand field) so I would be comfortable with a riskier, shorter term loan. My credit score is ~630. I have no derogatory marks, but I have not used a credit card in the past. I have recently been approved for a Discover It card and will be using that to help raise my credit score.

So here are my questions:

What is the likelihood I am not approved for this new loan even though I was pre-approved?

Are there any downsides to refinancing those two loans?

Is SOFI a reputable source to refinance through? Are there other lenders out there that are better for what I'm looking for?

If I do choose to refinance, should I wait until I have my emergency fund in order to take advantage of the deferment period? If so, would I still get approved in a couple months down the road?

Are there any other issues that I am overlooking?

personalfinance,Borrowing from retirement to put a down payment on a house?,"I'm considering purchasing a house in the next year or two, and I'm trying to weigh the pro's and con's of borrowing from retirement to make it happen. I'm hoping to get advice and see if there's options or rules that I'm not aware of.

If I've done my research correctly, as a first time home buyer, I can take $10,000 out of my Roth IRA, assuming I've had it for 5 years (which, sadly, will not be until 2018) as well as up to $50,000 from my 401(k) or 1/2 of my vested balance, whichever is lower.

Right now, I have:

* 10,000 cash in savings
* 25,000 in non-retirement investments
* 75,000 in a 401(k), fully vested
* 15,000 in a Roth IRA
* 11,000 in debt on a car, interest rate is 3.45%

In this area (Denver), houses pretty much start in the $300,000 - $400,000 range, so I'm looking at a solid $60,000 down payment to avoid mortgage insurance. Should I keep saving, or does pulling significantly from retirement make sense?

The card had 1 year no interest, however, this month I received my first interest charge (around $230.00) and my minimum payments are $400.00 a month.


Paying off the card it going to take a hell of a lot longer than expected.  I had previously planned to get the card down to $10,000 before the interest kicked in, but my plans changed after some bad living situations and moving expenses.


Right now my interest rate is 17.12%.  Not bad, but not great.  I'm spending $400.00 a month to pay off $170.00.  I'm not very happy with this, so I was considering talking with a bank to apply for a Debt Consolidation loan and this begs a few questions:

* Will applying for a Debt Consolidation Loan affect my current credit score?  If not, will it be affected if I accept the loan?

* What sort of interest rate should I expect on the loan with a 673 Credit Score?

* If I get a good deal through a loan, should I first call the Credit Card company to possibly get a better deal?  I think they would try to keep my business as I've never missed a payment.

personalfinance,Financing Home Renovations/Short Term financing options,"Just bought our first house - in need of some renovations before we move in.  The good news is we were able to get it for about $55k less than we were preparing to, so mortgage payments are looking great. The bad news is that it will probably need about $55k in renovations and we've only got about $35k in savings after that down payment budgeted for renovations, so we're looking to finance the other $20k over the next 2 years or so since we have about $1500 of monthly budgeted for this purpose.

Obviously, we could just save up for the next 18-24 months and then pay for the renovations as the house is livable. However, this is an all concrete house in the tropics (that's how they make them in PR!), and nearly everyone here has told me that you do not want to be living in this type of house when you're doing these kinds of renovations (new floors, moving concrete walls, etc) because of the amount of concrete dust that is created. 

So, I've heard that some CC offers may be able to give us 12 or 24 months which sounds pretty ideal, but I have to look into that a little more closely. Wife and I both have 401ks from previous jobs, but apparently can't take a loan against one of these if you don't work there anymore, so I guess that's not an option. Personal loans seem like they might not be the best option right now with interest rates around 8 or 9%?

Since this is r/personalfinance, I should probably mention that yes we are maxing out our retirement contributions annually and already have an emergency fund :)

Our money is basically losing value the longer we keep it in a savings account. Interest atm is about 1% and I'm assuming inflation is higher, so what can we do to invest and earn money? I'm hoping for 5-8% return per annum. Is that too optimistic in the current market? We used to earn 5% p.a. in an Australian savings account a few years ago, but it looks like interest rates in both Aus and US have dropped since then. We were thinking of buying an investment property either in Sydney or the Bay Area, but both areas are pricey, and I'm not sure where we'd get better value for money and what would be wiser in the long run. Currently we live in the Bay Area so we could manage the investment in the short term, but if we move back to Aus or somewhere else, then we face taxation issues from not being citizens, and also won't be able to manage the property anymore (but we could outsource that). I was also considering investing in the stock market or a managed fund. We already have shares in a large Tech company through his job, so that is a valuable investment too but we won't be selling those unless we absolutely have to.

personalfinance,Advice on my situation for medical debts?,"Hey everyone, I was wondering if you all could give me some perspective on my current financial situation. 

As it stands right now I have a situation with my debt. I have approximately 48,000 in student debt. I've started out with 60K last year, and thanks to a combination of my dad paying a smaller loan, and my desire to pay it off asap I have paid down 12K. In order to do this, give half my take home pay, and most of the bonuses that I get towards paying off my student debts. Right now I've got $7,400 left on a nasty 11.75% Sallie Mae loan and then I get started on the federal loans. I pay just under $1,600 a month towards my student loans. My expenses are around $950/month and I have about $500 extra to play with each month for groceries and miscellaneous expenses like gas and car maintenance, household stuff. It usually gets spent, any leftover goes to loans.

Last year I had an unfortunate accident and had to take a very long amberlamps ride to the Emergency room. Courtesy of these worthless high deductible health plans I was stuck with the bill, all in all I have around $3,000-$3,500 in medical debts. I had a supplemental accident insurance that paid out $2,200 for the accident. Initially, I figured I would pay the two highest in full (ambulance/ER) and deal with the rest later. As of right now, at least two of the bills have been sent to collections agencies, the ambulance bill is one of them. I have to check on the ER. 

I also have about $800 in doctors/PT bills as well. 

The three major bills are $650, $550, and $1600 respectively. 

My options at the moment as I see them are: 

Option 1: Pay collections agencies using $2,200 of insurance money. Throw small payments at the other ones. 

Option 2: Pay all the medical bills which have not gone to collections yet in full using the $2,200 from insurance. Play hardball with the collections agencies until I pay off my student loans, or they accept less than full payment. I'd be looking at paying these realistically in about two and a half years (if nothing changes, this is my expected student loan payoff at my current rate of paying.)

Option 3: Pay insurance money to help dump Sallie Mae loan, then once Sallie is paid, cut back student loan payments for a few months and pay off medical debts. 

Option 4: Let all debts go to collections, keep $2,200 in insurance money and negotiate with collections agencies to settle for an amount that would let my pay all debts with the insurance money.

I am leaning towards option 2 at the moment. This seems like a prudent option to minimize the number of debts sent to collections. The ones that are already there are damage done. I can pay them after I'm done with student loans.

My goal here is to maximize the benefit of my $2,200 in insurance payout, minimize out of pocket expense. I am absolutely not willing to reduce my student loan contributions until the loans are paid off, I'm going to be saving $22,000 in interest paying off my loans at this rate. 

I am following a slightly modified ""debt snowball"" type of plan. The modification is where I prioritize those debts by cost (interest rate) first, and then by size. So I'm paying off the highest interest first, then once that's gone I will move on the the 6.8% loans and pay them from smallest to largest etc... These medical debts are 0 interest, and I figure I'll just add them to the pile I have to pay and deal with them according to my plan. To be honest I'm not really worried about my credit score. I figure paying off $60,000 in debts in 3 years will boost it much more than a few collections will hurt it and I'm not going to be in need of a loan for anything for quite some time anyways. I have an old car in good shape, and no desire to buy a house anytime soon.

Personal finance people, give me your wisdom.

P.S. I still have the $2,200 and I will want to spend it on the medical bills, as that's what I got it for.

     25%	$75,301.00 to $151,900.00
     28%	$151,901.00 to $231,450.00

In our scenario, we'd be looking at the following:

     First bracket	10%	$18,551.00
     Second bracket	15%	$56,749.00
     Third bracket	25%	$76,599.00
     Fourth bracket	28%	$53,101.00

**To total $205,000**

That would mean that we can expect to pay **$44,385.48** in federal taxes for 2016.  Regarding state taxes..CO has a flat 4.63% income tax or **$9,491.5** ($205,000*.0463).

So for federal and state..that brings us to **$53,876.98**

Lastly, medicare + social security.  If that uses 7.65%..I'm assuming we'd be looking at **$15,682.5** gone there.  The new total would now be **$69,559.48**

That is roughly 34% of our gross income in taxes.

That all being said, I understand that because we fall into the 28% tax bracket, every additional $1,000 we were to earn would be taxed at the 28%.  I do understand that if I were to donate $1000 to charity, I would be eligible to receive $280 in tax deductions.  

But..I just spent a $1000 dollars to save $280..


I guess no one really saves money by contributing to his or her 401k (aside from this money being non-taxed RIGHT NOW), what is the benefit of maxing out one's 401k annual contribution?

personalfinance,Marriage - Would it really save us this much?,"Hello, 

I am in a long-term, committed relationship and will eventually marry the girl that I am with now.  Neither of us have been in a rush to tie the knot b/c of personal (school and long-distance) and financial (student loans, saving for a house down payment, etc.).  Our initial thoughts were to perhaps get engaged this year and then married in 2018 when she finishes grad school.  However, I did a quick calculation to see how much we could potentially save in federal income tax if we got married.  I am currently making around $155k, while she is unemployed since she is a student in a rigorous program (2 years left).  

My taxable income is $155k - $10.3k (std deduction and personal exemption...no house yet so not itemizing) - $20.5k (maxing 401k and $2.5k into HSA) = $124.2k, which when filing single has a federal tax bill of around $27.8k.  Hers, like I said, is $0 with her being unemployed.

If we get married, the taxable income drops by an additional $10.3k (due to the larger std deduction and extra personal exemption).  If we file married, the federal tax bill comes out to be about $20k, thus saving us around $8k (for this and next year while she still is a student).  

We'd also save a bit being able to have her on my health insurance plan (maybe about $100/month) and by deducting the $4k for her student tuition (=$1k b/c of the 25% marginal rate).  Our MAGI would be too high to qualify for the Lifetime Learning Credit (has to be under $130k and I believe ours would be $155k - $20.5k = $134.5k...if I'm missing something and we would qualify, that'd be a credit of $2k instead of the tuition deduction).

She requires student loans, but fortunately, none of them are need-based, so marriage would not affect that.  

Is there anything I am missing?  Financially-speaking, it seems like a no-brainer.  Thanks.",finance,1464285508

I've been reading over about the various percentage housing should make up in a budget and have seen various viewpoints. Realistically, are we better off buying a starter home ($250k-350k) to start, or less if possible, and sell it and upgrade to a more expensive house later after building equity and doing some upgrades or should we go for a more expensive home/payment initially ($350k-450k or more) and not have to move?

I am a foreign student currently finishing up my Ph.D. in USA. I have racked up around $5000 credit card debt between medical bills (ACL surgery) and travel back home (Sister's marriage). The problem is the debt is divided between multiple credit cards and is difficult to keep track of. I have come across some post in this subreddit and it seems sometimes it may be a good idea to take out a personal loan and pay off credit card debt and just keep paying off the loan amount. This keeps everything consolidated and easier to track. Currently I get $1400 every month as a salary after tax and paying for my 2001 year used Toyota Camry (which I need to drive to places for job interviews).

Is it a good Idea? Where can I avail such loan at a good interest rate. Thank you in advance.",finance,1464289243

Why don't I put my EF into 6 month CDs?","We are a self-employed income household, so have 6 months of savings for emergencies. I hate staring at it making only nominal interest, even as we continue to build up funds in other areas. 

Wouldn't it be smarter to start a CD ladder? Essentially start to deposit into one months expense 6 month CDs and gradually transition to 1 year CDs. 

I only had one CD in my life when I was 18, and it was really just a counterbalance against a secured credit card, so I don't remember the details of how I cashed it out, but it was a teller job at that time, so there may be some fine tuning necessary. I don't know how hard it is to cash out a CD online, but there must be EFT?

Still, I hate my savings account with all that money sitting in there earning way less (35% on a one year CD, 1.35% versus 1.0% in savings account) than it could. Interest rates are abysmally low on savings, so doing it this way I could potentially earn about 30% more (on a 12 month CD), and build a 12 month EF of household expenses, with the idea that if something came up we could use credit to cover sudden expenses and simply skip the next monthly expense deposit (to CD) to cover. We'd keep a much more modest savings account (say, one month) at that point. 

If I seem stupid saying ""gee, of course higher rates are better,"" it's just because I've been sitting on the emergency fund for awhile agonizing to get some more money from it, and have been extremely reluctant to increase it due to that fact. Truth is, though, should a real need for the emergency fund arise (self-employment goes kablooie or **knock on wood** a health emergency) we should probably have more than 6 months of household expenses in reserve. It's a bear to save at these rates. 

Our monthly expenses are pretty steep (mortgage, self paid health insurance on family of 4, insurance for cars, business expense, and student loans, no car loans though), and doing it this way would cost us several percentage points on the loans, but fewer than the way we're doing it.

personalfinance,In the process of finalizing an FHA mortgage loan for my first home...,"**Background Info:** So I recently decided to buy a home, and my offer of $109k (with seller help of $6k toward closing costs) was accepted. My head is spinning as far as paperwork and signing. I have a settlement date of 7/20, my interest rate is 3.375%, and this weekend I have my home inspection. I had to opt for the FHA loan because I didn't have 20% to put down on the loan, so of course there is a mandatory inclusion of insurance protecting the lender in the instance of a defaulted loan. I have escrowed my home insurance into my monthly payments in addition taxes and other miscellaneous things. I just want to get a couple things clear.

**Questions:**

1. Once I have 20% equity in my home, will I be able to refinance to a mortgage that is not an FHA? Or could I even do this prior to  having 20% equity (like are there exceptions?)

2. Is there still insurance of this kind protecting the lender on traditional mortgages, and if so is it typically significantly less? My monthly payment is calculated to be $779 per month which I can swing, but obviously I would prefer a lesser payment in the future so I can put back more money/apply more to my student loans that are currently deferred as I'm still attending (but I still make payments despite nothing being due yet).

3. Given that I am still in escrow, if a deal breaker comes up during the home inspection, can I walk away unscathed? Will I have all of my money back (with the exception of the home inspection cost)? 

4. If something comes up during the home inspection and I *don't* want to walk away, can I revise the original offer and request that the seller make the repairs/reduce the amount of the offer to cover repairs?

5. I also will have to have the house appraised, so kind of the same question as #4... if the house is appraised for less than the asking price, can I then revise my offer? I have my doubts that this will be the case, but I would like to have my ducks in a row going into this.

personalfinance,Question regarding recent truck refinance.,"Okay, so I'll try to go into much detail as I can and honestly it may be simple questions for some. So here is the deal, I bought a vehicle in 2013 with my mother as the owner and myself as the co-owner. Yes, you read that correctly. The reason for this is because a few weeks prior to me getting my truck she got one of her own and her credit took a pretty good hit so whenever it came time for me to get my truck it had to be the other way around for the loan to work. It was a screwed up situation at the time but I honestly didn't care because ignorant me just wanted the truck. Plus I was only making $25k per year at the time. Credit score around 700. 

Fast forward till early May of this year 2016. Been making full payments plus starting this past December I've been paying extra towards the principle and decided it's time for a refinance because of my high interest rate, 7%, and my high payment which was around $471.

In short, I re-applied for the loan for myself and was successful. Got the interest rate I wanted and lowered my payment significantly. Started a new job 6-months ago making more. Life is good. Now, my mother and I still have some questions. Oh, and for the record I still live at home for the time being. 

I'm still on her vehicle insurance policy for the main reason for it was cheaper for us to do it that way rather than myself getting my own. I know the insurance gets cheaper when you get older and with me being 24 I think it still would be a little more. My mother is stating that because her name is on the title as well as my name she can have the vehicle under her insurance. Now that I've re-finance the loan myself I was told by Chase that my name will be on the title and not hers. 

So my first question comes: Can I still be on my mothers auto insurance? Remember I still live at home if that matters. I'm also in the state of Missouri.

For the record, If I need to start looking for my own policy I can start doing so if that would be a smarter thing to do. Figured it would be just as smart to stay on her policy and wait till I'm old enough to have a decent insurance rate myself.

1) They're reached the age of retirement and are worried if they have property and end up with serious financial debts such as hospital fee's they don't want to lose the house to debt collectors 
2) Because they're retired they're no longer working and feel that since I'm currently employed having a house under my name would benefit me for tax deduction reasons
3) In addition to getting tax deductions I would also be building my credit

My father has gone to a mortgage broker and the broker arranged the following term:

Lets call this: [option A]
My dad will be gifting me a gift of equity for $50k. He's going to sell me the house for a purchase price of $250k. I will be taking out a loan from the bank for $200k with a 3.625% interest rate 30 years fixed (I have a credit score of 777, does this seem right?) It seems like the total monthly cost as a result of this will be around $900/month or a net cost of $329k/30 years with the ability to pay off the debt all at once if I'm able to without a penalty. 

There's an [option B]
If we change the 30 years fixed loan to a 15 year fixed loan, the interest is somewhere around 2%  resulting in a total net cost of 246k (or about $1400/month). The only reason I mention this option is because it saves $83,000 of cash ($329k - $246k) I would otherwise be losing to interest paid to the bank in [option A] and I feel bad to have to pay this much out in interest. My parents like the 30 years fixed because we feel like we can afford a commitment of $900/month as opposed to $1400/month

A final option is [option C]
My dad might have enough funds to fully pay off the house in a few years, however, he's arguing that it makes more sense to have me keep the house under my name now in order to reap the benefits of tax deduction. Sounds like it makes sense, but isn't the tax deduction we pay on a house still lost money in interest? In other words, isn't it the optimal case where if you could pay off a house immediately it's better to do so, rather than keeping a mortgage on a house for tax deduction reasons?

I have a salary of $62k/year so i'm not sure if I'd even be saving that much from getting a tax deduction. Reddit, between [options A, B and C] how would you rank these options as the most optimal for net gain (or minimal loss)?

Not sure if it makes any difference but the house is in California by the way. Thanks so much for reading and offering any advice you can! :(",finance,1464317659

personalfinance,Debt settlements and taxes,"I'm not sure if this will be the correct sub, but since this sub has been helpful in the past, I'll start here. 

I understand that most of the Wikis regarding student loans and taxes state the options but don't explain the fall out of each option.... And it's recommended pay your debts instead of avoiding them for a decade but that's what I did....here's a little bit of back story.

I graduated in '08 from a big art school with a ton of debt and work prospects that drowned in the economy along with my hope of having the American Dream.  I'm pretty sure there were a bunch of people drowning with me, but the water was pretty muddy so I don't know.  

At the time of graduation I was self employed, which I had been on and off for the last 8 years as well as holding ""real"" jobs. After school, I looked and found some work but come peak season, people were canceling jobs instead of booking them. As I listened to millionaires watch their nickels and dimes, I took it as a sign and did the same. I decided to spend my money on something bills would not give me. I traveled. On what little money I had, I got on a plane and watched the economy tank from a different-going-bankrupt-country. I later returned ""home"" to start another career in corporate contract work, which was not related to my art major and was for less money than I made before I went to school. Although it was never what I expected after a handful of long and short contracts, I now work corporate and have a non-contract full time job (with job stability if I keep my head down, not exciting but ok).  After nearly ten years, I am finally in a situation to deal with my debt and possibly  live the American Dream of owning a tiny house in a few years. 

I have about:

$15k or less - in government loans and am currently on an income biased payment plan for this @$242/ mo. I expect that this will go up, when I update them On my new job. (I plan on paying this back in the payment plans) interest is around 2-7%. 

The issue is with my $74k in private school debt. This figure is after interest and fees. I believe it was originally about $50k. I have a settlement offer for 15k and they will take it in either a lump sum or 12 payments. I maybe made one payment in 2008 or '09 and then allowed them to default after realizing (or reading in an article)  that if I paid the minimum after 3 years, the amount owed would double with interest rates ect. So these debts have been in default for almost the entire last ten years. I mention this because, I'm really happy with the offer but I wonder if I should counter for even less. 


&lt;b&gt;My question: &lt;/b&gt;

Will I be taxed on the forgiven amount as though is was income, which is what happens when you settle other debt??

If yes, is this taxed at a fixed rate like investment interest or in a flex rate like income?  This would potentially put me in the $130-$210k tax bracket for a  married person (maybe if I maxed out my 401k investment I could stay in the lower tax bracket) I would be on the cusp.

If I took the payment option, would I be taxed only this year, since that's when the offer would be signed or spread out over both years?

If I am going to be paying 26-28% on $60k (~16k) in taxes in April, Is there any way to invest/give to charity/pay medical bills, this year to help counter this? I don't know that I can put away another $1400/mo by April since I do need a newish car and will need to move this year. 

I've tried to research this but I don't know where to begin with tax code... If someone knows where to find this information on the IRS.gov site, I'll take it. I'm also considering calling my Fidelity person since they might be able to assist with ""financial planning"" which I I'm not sure if this will be the correct sub, but since this sub has been helpful in the past, I'll start here. 

Any information on what I should expect from I take a settlement would be appreciated. If I missed something important, I can add more info if needed.",finance,1464333378

personalfinance,Eliminated all of my ~$40k student debt in &lt;2 years. Some advice I have.,"I apologize if this is not helpful enough and too much of a brag post to warrant its own discussion but I figured I'd share anyway.    

&amp;nbsp;
 
Graduated in May of 2014 from a private engineering college with a B.S. in Computer and Systems Engineering and about $40,000 in mixed private and federal loans. I had a job lined up for after I graduated and started that June.    

&amp;nbsp;
 
Thanks to philosophy of r/personalfinance and Mr. Money Mustache, I made it my mission to pay down this debt as fast as possible. It became almost like a game, several times a month I would look at my Mint trends tab and see the debt balance graph getting lower and lower. It was exciting to me whenever I got more money than I expected for the month and put it right to my loans. My drive to get rid of my debt even got my girlfriend on board with this ""debt blasting"" attitude that we hope to continue for the long run.    

&amp;nbsp;
 
I started post-college as a Systems Engineer at $59k salary moving to about $62k and eventually raising to $71.2k a couple of months ago due to a promotion. I contributed 6% into a 401k set up by my work which matched 75% of that contribution.    

&amp;nbsp;
 
During that time I lived in two apartments (a year for each) with a roommate with my share of the rent being $575 a month and $375 a month. This helped contribute to a relatively low housing expense as a percentage of my take-home pay (about 1/6th). The second apartment ($375/month) was not in the best area but saving that extra 200 a month really helped put more toward my loans. Other than buying a nice TV after I graduated, any extra money I got including things like tax refunds, went directly to my loans. I was dumping about $1500-$2000 a month in them. Starting with the highest loan amount and interest rate.    

&amp;nbsp;
 
Another thing that helped contribute to lowering my expenses were that I was covered under my parents health insurance. They also payed for my portion of my cell phone and auto insurance (I would give them about 200 a month to cover some of the expenses). Safe to say they helped me out as well.    

&amp;nbsp;
 
Here is what my efforts boil down to that I am really proud of: http://imgur.com/CWPTt3I
(Those two months where the debt spiked was the result of me having to front money for my grad school program before my work would reimburse me).    

&amp;nbsp;
 
**Some random advice I have to save money and pay debt down faster (this might apply a little more for new college grads):**
 
* **Avoid the debt to begin with.** (This only applies for people who have not incurred student debt yet) I was fortunate enough to live near a community college that had an excellent engineering program. I was able to attend for two years and earn an A.S. in Engineering Science all while incurring next to no debt. The program was well-known and accepted enough that I was able to transfer to my 4 year college with full Junior status. Doing this allowed me to avoid the private student loan debt for my first two years and get merit aid scholarships which helped put a dent into how much I would eventually owe.
 
* **Live with a roommate wherever possible.** in as cheap a place that you can stand (for me it was a place that had electricity, heat, and quiet place to sleep, anything extra was a bonus). The costs associated with living by yourself greatly affect the amount you can put toward the loans.
 
* **Do not buy a new / newer car.** It may be tempting to plunk down money for (or lease) a new car as an ""I deserve it"" reward for graduating, but that shouldn't be a priority when you have debt hanging over your head. There will be plenty of time for a nicer car sooner than you think. I found my car on craigslist ('06 Elantra), paid cash for it (~$4800) and have been driving it for 4 years. I personally would have continued to purchase used cars like the one I have going forward but I have another passion which is Tesla and I dropped $1k to reserve my Model 3 as an ultimate gift to myself for paying off my debt :).
 
* **Credit Cards.** Take advantage of the benefits that credit cards have to offer, **if you use them the right way**. I used to think they were terrible things to have, but the extra cashback / miles are wonderful and the ability to separate your money from companies and entities you pay for goods and services is a great thing to have and has helped me in a number of occasions. Going back to what I said before about credit cards, you need to use them the right way. Never spend more in a statement period than you can pay off before it is due. For me, I never spend money just because. I usually have my set expenses for needs and then if I want to make a larger purchase, I always sit on it and think about it for a couple days before making the purchase. This naturally allows me to be responsible with a credit card and I think use it in a safe way.
 
* **Live close to work and avoid buying individual meals.** Depending on the cost of living in your area, live as close to work as possible. Unless you are working in a major city or other area where rent is expensive, the savings on commute time add up to extra cash in your pocket and less frustration in dealing with traffic. Secondly, I got into the habit (though i'm guilty of not doing this on occasion) of preparing my breakfast and lunches for the work week on sundays and eating them throughout the week. The savings really add up when you don't have to purchase breakfast and lunch everyday.
 
* **Take advantage of your advantages.** One last thing that I think applies differently to different people are the random advantages that happen to be available in your life. For me it was living within an hour of my parents (and girlfriend's parents) house and being able to see them a fairly frequently. This had several small advantages like free haircuts from Mom and being able to do laundry for free. I was also lucky enough to know that I could move back in with them if I ever lost my job or needed a decent amount of cash for an emergency. This allowed me to be a little fast and loose with my emergency fund (which was essentially nothing) and be more aggressive toward my loans.
Another big advantage I was lucky to have is related to the company I work for (other than free coffee haha). I was able to get a full tuition reimbursement to continue my education and get a Master's degree online while working. This helps further my career prospects and it doesn't add to my debt. Coupled with this is me getting the opportunity to go on work travel to several locations in the U.S. where I generally am paid more than normal and get per diem. I get to see different parts of the country for free and add more money to my savings all while doing a job that I enjoy :).
 
Anyway, that is my ""story"" for now, i'd appreciate any feedback or any questions/clarifications you may have. Thanks for reading!

personalfinance,Looking for advice on credit scores and planning to buy a house in a few years,"NOTE: Please feel free to offer advice however you see fit: budgeting, planning, saving, building credit, etc.  I'll take all the advice I can get.  Sorry for the wall of text.

For a while, one of my long-term goals has been to buy a house sometime in the 2018-2019 time frame, and I'm looking for some advice to help me achieve that goal.  I'm currently in my early 30's, but most of my 20's were a complete and total loss from a financial perspective.  I have made some really significant progress over the last couple of years by being better organized, learning to track my spending, and getting a 40% raise followed by an 11% raise in two consecutive years at a new company after leaving a job where I was very severely underpaid.  I recently completed my MSEE, so I wouldn't be too surprised if I got another significant raise at the end of this year, but I'm also not counting on it.  I have been lurking for quite a while in this sub, so I have built up an emergency fund and last year I opened a Roth IRA and maxed it out based on the PF money flowchart.  At this point, I'm looking for some more specific advice to make sure I stay on track.

The last couple of years were pretty tough, but I'm finally in a pretty good position financially.  I make about $86,000/year and have no credit card debt.  I've been paying off my student loans (especially the ones with 7% interest) as aggressively as possible without compromising my emergency fund.  Working full time during grad school made my life pretty miserable for a few years, but it was worth it since I've already managed to pay off all my grad school loans, and I finally have less than $10,000 left in loans from undergrad.

The problem I'm encountering is the high cost of living and expensive real estate market where I live.  It's definitely not as bad as the SF bay area, but it's still much more expensive than most places.  After doing some initial research, it seems like I won't find a house for less than about $350,000 that isn't completely falling apart.  I have some experience with renovation, so I don't mind putting a fair amount of work into a house, but I also don't want it to become my second job, either.

I currently live in a place where my rent is really ridiculously low ($500/month) for the area, but unfortunately it's also really far from where I work, so my commute is fairly expensive.  Where I'm currently living is also close to my friends and family, which makes the long commute a bit more worthwhile.  Since January I've been working on getting a new job (possibly even with the same company) closer to where I live, but so far that hasn't really worked out.

**My annual budget:**

Amount | Type
- | -
$49,000 | Take-home pay from primary job (after subtracting taxes, social security, health insurance, 401k, etc.)
$1,400 | Take-home pay from secondary job
-$5,500 | Car payments
-$1,500 | Car insurance
-$6,000 | Commute costs (Gas, tolls, tires, maintenance, repair)
-$6,000 | Rent
-$5,500 | IRA contribution
-$6,000 | Food, entertainment, travel, etc. (this number is meant to be a maximum and actual costs are hopefully less)
-$2,000 | Student loan minimum payment
~~~~~~ | ~
$17,900 | Remaining

In the past, the remaining amount was smaller because my salary was lower, and I had to use all of it (plus more!) to pay for graduate school.  Now that I've graduated and paid down my highest-interest loans, I'm trying to decide on the best way to use the ""extra"" money.  As I already mentioned, I'd like to buy a house within the next 2-3 years, but there are also other options like increasing my 401k contribution from $8,600/year (10%) to the $18,000/year max or paying off my remaining student loans.  If I save all of the money for a house, I could have a 10% down payment in two years.  20% would obviously be better, but that would take 4 years of saving, and I'd really rather not wait that long for a variety of reasons.

Until recently, my plan was simply to pay off all of my student loans ASAP and then start saving every penny for a down payment on a house.  Now I'm not so sure.  A few weeks ago, I paid off one of my student loans, and my credit scores (both TransUnion and Equifax) dropped by 12 points a week later.  They had been extremely stable for a long time before that, so I wasn't really too worried about my credit scores until they dropped.  After looking through the info in CreditKarma, it looks like paying off that loan decreased my average account age, which caused my scores to drop.  My credit scores are still pretty solid (768 and 755) since I have a very favorable payment history, but I'm concerned that if I pay off more of my student loans, my average credit account age will drop far enough that my credit scores will go below 740, which is not good if I want to get the best rate on a home loan.

I think a big part of my problem is that I never got a credit card until a year and a half ago.  I had seen other people ruin their finances with credit card spending sprees, and I didn't want to make the same mistake.  Then last year I realized that I've become a responsible adult, and having a credit card is necessary for establishing and keeping good credit.  The one credit card I have right now has a $25,000 limit, I pay the entire balance every month, and it is usually around 2-5% utilization.  I really only have it for the rewards and to build better credit.  For reference, here's a list of my remaining loans.

**My Liabilities:**

Amount | APR | Type | Age (years) | Payoff Date
---------|-----|------|--------------|-------
$1,700 | 2.3% | Student | 11.75 | 12/2018
$4,700 | 5.6% | Student | 6.75 | 04/2024
$2,500 | 4.5% | Student | 5.5 | 04/2024
$14,000 | 0.9% | Car | 2.5 | 12/2018

My plan with the car loan was always to make minimum payments since the interest rate is so low, and that plan hasn't changed.  I was also doing pretty much the same thing with the first student loan since the interest rate is so much lower than the other loans.  I had been planning to pay off the other two student loans within the next 6 months, but now I'm concerned about what that will do to my credit scores.

**Summary:**
* My biggest concern is that I might not buy a house until 2019, and by that point, my only open line of credit will be my credit card, which will be ~4 years old at that point.  How badly is that going to hurt my credit score?  My current average account age is 5.5 years, which includes 5 active accounts.  If my score drops another 12 points for each account I pay off, I'll definitely drop below 740.
* Should I keep one or both of the other student loans open until I buy a house, since their normal repayment schedule ends in 2024?  I would end up paying more in interest, but that would keep my average account age up and potentially prevent my credit score from dropping further.
* Recently, I had been thinking about getting a second credit card for better rewards, but now I'm thinking that might make the account age problem even worse.  Thoughts?

I work 249 Days a Year - (52 Weeks - 2 days - (8 Federal Holidays + 2 floating Holidays+ 2 Company Holidays)) and these will no longer be paid time off for me.

I ran a quick Calc but I'm wondering if someone can help me on figuring out whether this makes sense. 
Also whether it is worth it to negotiate.

personalfinance,Trying to start life again and now I'm overwhelmed by the amount of debt I carry and I feel I have handcuffed myself for years to come.,"Hello redditors on PF, long-time poster on various other subs but due to the embarrassment I have 

regarding my finances I've created an alternate account (to protect my identity).  
.  
I'm not sure if anyone here cares for the backstory on how I amassed so much debt and for me its 

painful to tell it. In short I was involved in an abrupt bitter break-up a few years ago which 

forced me out of his apartment and left me homeless with nothing to my name except for some 

credit cards, clothes and a few hundred dollars. I was desperate to get on my feet again so I had 

to couch surf for awhile until I found employment to where I could afford my own place. During 

this my cash funds were dwindling down, and I had to start using credit cards but thankfully I 

was able to find a job that paid pretty well. I decided to take out a personal loan for $5500 

which allowed me to do three things: set aside some money for an emergency, use the money to pay 

for security deposit/first month/last month rent, and also purchase a used car. Maybe I made a 

mistake in doing this, but I couldn't think of any alternatives to get cash as soon as possible.  
.  
So once I got the apartment, I had to buy a bed and a microwave. I was able to get a TV and an 

old computer donated to me from a friend. The other things I've had to purchase was a toothbrush, 

cleaning supplies, work clothes, bed sheets, trash can, a vacuum and of course food. I haven't 

spent any money on anything that's not essential.  
.  
But reviewing my debts I am terrified I have ruined myself for the next 5 years if not longer. 

Redditors I am in desperate need of your expertise and advice. I've gone through the section on 

the site on how to handle $$$ but I can't even hit step 1 yet with building an emergency fund. 

Saving and putting money in a 401k/retirement is obviously out of the question for now. Here is 

the list of debts I have.

personalfinance,How Badly Are My Credit Cards Hurting my Credit Score?,"I have seen my credit score from from ~780 to 730 in the space of a year and I am concerned. I currently have four credit cards: 2 that I pay in full every month, and 2 more that have a combined current balance of about 11K. That debt was mostly incurred when I was out of work for several months and was forced to float myself with them. Fortunately, the two latter cards have relatively low interest rates and I have been making regular payments on them. 

I am currently paying a total of approximately $600 a month towards those two cards. One will be paid in full by December while the other will take at least another year. 

Other than avoiding adding to that debt and continuing to pay down the principle on them, is there anything else I can do to slow them from dragging down my credit score? On my current path, am I in danger of seeing my credit drop below 730? (I have no other debts and an otherwise spotless credit history). Does anyone have any particular sage advice on this topic?

personalfinance,Where should my down payment savings be? (2-3 years to buying),"I am an immigrant with a very short credit history and no real history or relationship with any US bank. I do most of my banking at a local credit union. I have a few credit cards which get paid off monthly, no car loan, no other things that involve credit. My credit score is currently 700ish but my average age of account is only around a year.


I've got around $20k to play with which is a pretty good starting point for a down payment in my LCOL area. However I was thinking that fucking around trying to find the best rates on online saving accounts and the like to maximize the value of my $20k might be being penny wise and pound foolish, the rates difference would be negligible and my far bigger problem is my lack of credit history and the potentially higher interest rate on a mortgage. A 10 basis point improvement on the down payment I save for a few years isn't worth a 10 basis point increase on the balance of the mortgage for 15 years.

Should I instead be walking into a branch of some national bank with my $ and buying CDs through them with a view to building a relationship with them for when I want to buy?",finance,1464370573
personalfinance,"How do I prioritize saving vs. things I need/want, like home repairs, etc?","I need some advice. Patience and savings are not my strong suit.

I feel really conflicted about how much money I should be saving vs how much money I should be budgeting for things I occasionally NEED, like clothing for work or a new winter coat. Then at the bottom of the priority list is things I'd like to buy in the next few years (like several hundred $ home repairs, etc.).

I'm almost 30, just to give some context. It seems like by the time I budget everything out (I use YNAB) making about $28,000 annually, I have a very tiny amount of money left over each month for things like work clothing. Occasionally we all need to replace wardrobe items. 

In addition to this, I'd also like to put some money aside for bigger home purchases. We bought our house 3 years ago and have done some major repairs that were vital: new roof, waterproofed the basement, those were big items. It's right around 30 years old, so things are starting to need updating and replacing. Things like replacing our front door that doesn't latch properly, eventually new carpet, putting up curtains in the few remaining rooms that never got them when we moved in.

My husband makes significantly more than I do, we have a mortgage, his car is paid off, I have about 3 years left on my car loan, but no other major debts (praise the Lord!). We budget together, but our money stays separate and he pays a much higher percentage of the mortgage and the rest of our monthly bills. We also have a toddler, which has increased our bills, but we use cloth diapers and almost all of her clothing and toys are purchased secondhand.

If I put some money into each of the categories I have after bills, it ends up being about $5 every month or two in a few categories. This includes things like haircuts, holidays, contact lenses, vitamins, clothing, occasionally going out for dinner. I feel like we live pretty frugally, but my budget is still so tight every month. 
I'm almost at the point where I have a buffer of a month's bills and some savings, but I can't even buy a new pair of work pants.

TLDR: If I only have a few dollars left to put into a bunch of budget categories, I'll be 100 by the time I can afford anything.

personalfinance,22 years old paying way too much for a car that I hardly drive. Need advice for my next steps.,"Back in August of 2014 I finance a Subaru under 18% interest rate because I didn't have credit history and no co-signers. Stayed in that for 9 months and got into a Jeep Wrangler at 3.49%, ended up taking $8,000 negative equity into the new loan. It has been about a year since then and I am now realizing I do not need to have such an expensive car. (paid $39,500 for it) My payments are at $600/month plus insurance is another $300. I hardly drive it so the heavy monthly price tag is no longer making sense to me.  Since Wranglers do hold their value really well, I can trade it in for about $35,000 right now, and I owe $45,000.

personalfinance,Need help with home buying mortgage process!,"Hi /personalfinance,

I'm currently in the process of buying a condo and need help with the mortgage process. Our agent referred us to a lender but their interest rate for a 30-year fixed is 4.0% which seems a bit high. I've searched around and it looks like the going rate is closer to 3.5% given my credit rating, down payment, and loan amount.

Questions for group:

1. What's the process to start ""shopping"" for loan with a different lender? Do I simply call them up and give them all of the info (down payment amount, loan amount, etc.)? How do I ensure we'll get a capable loan officer since it seems like this is an important factor when choosing a lender?

2. Any other things I need to look out for besides the interest rate? It seems like the only other cost is the closing cost. Do any banks offer a reduced closing cost?

3. Looks like the best rates come from lenders that I've never heard of (Aurora Financial, Sebonic Financial, etc.). What's the harm in going with these lenders / would you recommend it? Seems like they have great ratings from other users on Bankrate.com

My mother has a couple credit cards and pretty average/low credit ~650 and she recently had to have dental work done that put her near her limits. She wants to know if she should get a debt consolidation loan to pay them off and put some extra money in her bank account. I told her it was a bad idea, but I'm not savvy enough to be sure so here I am. Here's the situation:

Credit Card #2: 23% APR and a balance of $2500 out of $3300.

Credit Card #3: 29% APR and a balance of $700 out of $1000.

The consolidation loan would give her a $6000 or $7000 with an interest rate of 26%. To me, it seems like getting a loan for a higher interest rate is a terrible idea, but I might just be biased against loans in general. The lady she talked on the phone with gave her all these facts about how credit is revolving and with installments you can pay it off faster, but to me it just sounded like a sales pitch. I don't know if that's actually the case or not so I figured I'd ask you all. Is the loan a bad idea like I originally thought or is it actually a good idea?

So I have 5 Federal loans and 1 private loan (Private loan is about 8% and is sitting at roughly $14,500 currently)

As these student loan people change hands every year it seems like I wanted to know if for the private loan would it be an advantageous idea to take out another loan at smaller percentage lets say I find one lower than the 8% on the private and I take out $15,000 and get that private company paid off so now I just owe the bank instead of owing a loan place. Is this a bad idea at all or should I just negotiate terms with the loan company and not set up something with the bank (That is pending they give me a lower interest rate over the 8% I have right now with the student loan place)

These people have called my mother, my elderly grandparents and my sister repeatedly -- even though they had my email address (where they were sending me statements and notices). I can't afford to pay the full amount, so I wrote to them, asked them to stop harassing my family as it's illegal, and told them I would like to settle the debt.

They responded that because it's a Federal Perkins Loan, the debt can't be settled. I'm not sure if that's true, but I responded and said that if there's no option of settling, then I can't help them.

1) post the 2013 on Craigslist for market value, and sell it for say 27k, and cough up 5k from somewhere to free up the title and pay it off.

2) post the 2013 on Craigslist for what I owe on it (32k) and lower it each month as I pay it down, i.e. lower the price to the loan payoff value, and eventually sell it. All the while, driving it.

3) take it to a car dealer and trade it for a bitchin camaro  (this is what the mid life crisis part of me would like to do).

4) take it, and my older suv, to a dealer and trade them both for one 4wd pickup truck that is actually more practical for my uses. (I'm more of a pickup guy than an suv guy). And if so, will a dealer trade ""down"" to a less expensive truck??

I'm pretty sure the answer ain't number 3, lol. What do you guys think I should do?

personalfinance,Building credit w/secured card. Same company has now offered a (bad) unsecured card. Do I take it?,"EDIT: I got [chumped!](http://i.imgur.com/khpnj1T.jpg) As you can see from the photo, these pigf***ers (can I swear in here?) ""CreditOne Bank"" make their logo look just like CapitalOne's. Pretty sleazy, and it almost worked.

I was looking at other options online and noticed that CapitalOne's Platinum card has no annual fee. ""Huh, that's odd,"" I thought, ""The one they offered me sure did."" Then took a closer look at my ""offer"" and got wise. 

Props to /u/kristallnachte who guessed more about the letter through the Internet than I could when I was holding the damn thing in my hand.

ORIGINAL POST: My lurking has not found this particular issue, apologies if its been done recently.

Here's the deal: I have a CapitalOne Secured credit card, with a whopping $200 limit. To create a credit history, I've been buying something once a month for $15 or $20 and then Autopaying the full balance each month. (Lessons learned from /r/personalfinance, BTW!) 

This has brought my credit score from [undefined] to a still-crappy 615 in about 5 months.

I'm watching my (probably simulated) FICO score using the CapOne's ""CreditTracker"" app, which breaks down your credit factors into things like ""On-time payments,"" ""Length of credit history,"" and so on.  

One of the traits is ""Available credit."" Mine is usually around $175, which they report, unsurprisingly, as ""poor."" 

Now, however, I'm pre-approved for a CapitalOne ""Platinum"" card with a ""credit line of (\**cough* up to \**cough*) $1500!""

It's a horrible card. The annual fee is $75 (billed up front) for the first year, and $99/year billed monthly after that. (The interest rate is also 24%, but I have no intention of carrying a balance on this or any card.) 

But $75 won't break me at this point in my life, and I feel like this card might be the next hoop I need to jump through to rebuild my credit.

OR... is this card the scam CapitalOne was setting me up for when they first offered me a secured card?

Monthly bring in is about $3400, and all inclusive outgoing money is around 2250-2750 given unexpected expenses.

The ultimate goal is to take care of the smaller card, and try and negotiate a lower interest on the personal loan (that is the big ticket winner). The loan itself eats almost 300 a month. I have decent credit, as of the beginning of the year it was hovering around 700-720.

personalfinance,Take out a personal loan or max out credit card to pay for the rest of college?,"Hi, /r/personalfinance. I'm a 23 year old in a post-professional healthcare program.

I graduated with a BS that's not landed me any type of job, and I carry about $25,000 in student loan debt from that in a mix of private and federal loans. I decided to go into this healthcare program the summer after graduating with the knowledge it would be covered by a scholarship from the school. I was wrong!

Apparently, I owe about $6000 in order to finish the program and my clinical time. I was supposed to graduate in August. Now, if I don't pay the $6,000, I will end up graduating in December.

The clincial portion of the program also runs three more months (I'm more than halfway through that) and that would also delay me. 

I don't have $6,000--I have $3500 in my savings account and $800 in an account I can't touch unless I take a hit on (my 401K I think or something like that). 

I tried for a student loan but the school rejected me. They told me take out a personal loan, pay in installments or just wait and continue on in the fall instead of graduating with my current class this July. 

***The issue:*** the personal loan I applied for with a 720 credit score was $6,000 @ 11 % interest with a 72 month repayment plan. Or, I take $3,000 from my savings and take out $3,000 on my credit card by asking them to raise the limit. The credit card interest rate is about 14%.

***The problem***: I don't want to live paycheck to paycheck. I also am afraid of taking out MORE loans. The details of my bills are below.

Rent: $700

Food/gas: $200

Car insurance: $70

Utilities: $140

Medication: $45 

Student loan, private: $50 a month, $5000 left at 7%, 10 year repayment or so

Student loan, private: $110 a month, $7000 left at 8% I think, 10 year repayment or so

Student loan, government: $81 on income based repayment, 4% interest rate and $13,000 owed, currently delinquent 

Total bills: $1300

Take home pay: $1500-1700 based on work available


So, what should I do? What's the best option for me?

financialindependence,Comprehensive FI Calculator/Model/Spreadsheet? + Expected Expenses for IBD Analysts in NYC?,"Hi,

(This is a throwaway)

I'm a lurker on /r/financialindependence, and now that I'm 22, soon to be graduating and starting my job, I realized that I have to actually start planning for FI now. 

I'm going to be an investment banking analyst at one of the bulge brackets everyone loves to hate.

Base Salary: $85k
Signing Bonus: $10k
Year-End Bonus: Uncertain obviously but $45-65k is the usual range at my firm, depending on the firm's performance, but unless we're hit by huge losses, it is largely dependent on my performance.
Analyst pay on WS at the BBs has pretty much leveled out at $150k for most 1st year analysts, and I'm expecting around that, if not more.

Expenses are pretty up in the air
$2,200 for an apartment in Midtown close to my firm. Not willing to do roommates, and if you try to tell me I shouldn't be living in such an expensive area, the hours of my job literally require me to have the shortest commute possible, otherwise I would get basically no sleep.

Otherwise, I have no idea how much I'm going to end up spending... A rule of thumb I've been told by more senior banker friends is ""spend your salary, bank your bonus"", but IMO it should be more like spend most of your salary and bank the rest + bonus, especially since the banks have recently increased base salaries ~$20k and decreased/held bonuses.

Any other Manhattan bankers have any experience with average expense numbers? I'd like to think I'm fairly frugal, but quite honestly I'm not going for RE, just FI mostly. Plus, since I'll be moving to the buy-side in two years (most likely PE or a Hedge Fund), I'm expecting my total compensation to rapidly increase, barring a financial crisis. I'm in no rush to get FI either, and would like to have a nice lifestyle. Luckily, since I'll be spending so much time at work, that gives me fewer opportunities to spend in what little free time I'll have.

I have ~$30k in federal student loans. Additionally, I've promised to pay my parents back in full for what they paid for me to go to graduate, which comes up to ~$230k. What would be the most tax-friendly/efficient way for me to go about paying back my parents? 

Additionally, I'm expecting about $200k in costs for business school when I'm 28. That's not including the vacations I'll probably end up taking thanks to not having to work for two years.

So, my main question is that, is there a calculator, model, or spreadsheet that includes rapidly increasing income (preferably that I can input manually by year), and fluctuating expenses? I'll be spending enough time monkeying around in Excel soon enough that I'd rather not build this from scratch if somebody's already done something similar that I can adapt.

Additionally, I'd love to hear from other financial-services FI'ers, about their experiences, career progression, advice for the job, and what I could expect for expenses and being FI/frugal when most of my analyst class will be out dropping hundreds of dollars on a night out.

I attempted to refinance through Chase (the lender) to add her, but they turned us down. I tried talking to them over the phone explaining the situation to not avail. I searched online as well for potential lenders who can buy out the contract. My question is, what reputable lenders can you guys recommend that would match or be at the approximate interest rate I am currently at (2.09%), with 22,399 left to go and 50 months, and accept my niece as a co-signer? I would still be on the loan obviously. Thanks to anyone that can help me.",finance,1464467925
personalfinance,How can we go from $0 and low credit to buying a house in 2-3 years? Lots of details with a TD;LR,"**TL;DR** My husband and I both have really bad credit (mid-500s credit stores). We have ~$2000 in debt (all collections) with no likely way to get the bad stuff deleted from our credit. Most, if not all, are due to fall off our reports in mid-2018. My husband and I both recently started new jobs. Our household income is ~$4,000 (before taxes) with $2,000 of that being self-employment income. Our expenses are ~$1,600/month.

**What should we do now to work towards being able to get a mortgage and buy a house?**

#More details:

**My job:** Self-employed contractor position for a large website. I have a contract with the company. I'm paid just over $2,000/month once a month on a net-30 basis. I just started in mid-May.

**My husband's job:** CCA (city carrier assistant) with the United States Postal Service. He is paid $16.06 and hour and he's been there since mid-April. His hours have been all over the place - some weeks as low as 6 hours and some as high as 40 hours. But they're going into the heavy vacation time and as a CCA, he'll be helping to fill in where needed. In orientation, the new CCAs were told to expect 50-60 hours a week. We know it's not reasonable to expect that all the time so we're budgeting based on 30 hrs/week which is approximately $2,000/month (pre-tax). We have not signed up for health insurance yet (have until mid-June to decide) but it's $195 bi-weekly for both of us so that would drop his net income quite a bit. We also have the choice to insure him only for $35 bi-weekly.

There is a chance (albeit relatively small) that he may lose his job. USPS has been known to let go of CCAs at the drop of a hat but his supervisors seem to like him. He's halfway through probation right now.

**Our expenses:**

Category|Amount|
:--|:--|
Rent|$505|
Electricity|$150|
Car Insurance|$66|
Renter's Insurance|$18|
Internet|$35|
Phone|$29|
Fuel|$50|
Groceries|$300|
Entertainment/Restaurants|$110|
Debt|$100|
Household Goods|$40|
Pet Expenses|$40|
Web Hosting|$20|
Clothing|$15|
Laundry|$15|
**TOTAL**|$1493

We typically have some additional expenses each month so we add a $100 buffer category so we never run low in our bank account. We have been considering adding a small ""blow money"" budget for each person but haven't decided whether to do that at this point.

**Debts:**

* Collection #1: $81
* Collection #2: $601
* Collection #3: $584
* Collection #4: $700 (sued and settled on payment plan, included in budget above)

Collections #2 and #3 have sent offers in the mail to settle for ~20% off but they stipulate that they would be marked as ""settled"" on our credit reports and I've heard that's bad. I'm trying to negotiate a pay for delete but it's way harder than you'd think and I don't think it's going to happen. FWIW, the statute of limitations on these end in April 2017 so I'm planning on using that as leverage to get a PFD but I'm not overly hopeful on that actually working. Either way, I do plan on paying the debts, I'm just trying to figure out how to pay the least and get the most for what I'm paying.

**Assets:**

* Money in bank accounts: $1,700
* Vested money in 401k: $6,500
* 2007 Ford Taurus: not much, maybe $2,000

I bring up the 401k so you can see how much we have towards retirement. I would *never* consider pulling money out of retirement accounts.

**My question:**

What should we be doing right now to improve our chances of being approved for a mortgage in the next few years? Our credit is awful. We had to buy a car in 2012 and the best (actually, the only) loan we could get had an interest rate of 17.99%. 

**What should be our priority right now? What should our plan of attack be?** 

Also, FWIW, house prices in our area are fairly low, according to various sources, the average home price is $70,000-90,000.",finance,1464468482
personalfinance,My wallet was stolen. The police refuse to investigate. What's my worst case scenario for identity theft and what steps do I still need to take?,"**TL;DR Wallet stolen by a pro, police won't investigate, trying to navigate the steps to protect myself, what do I still need to do or be aware of? See list of what I have done and questions I have. Thank you for any help you can offer.**

I live in MD. I'm traveling in CA right now. Wallet was stolen here in a place with high tourism. I wasn't there as a tourist, I used to live there and was just hanging out. Most likely pickpocketed by an expert. I didn't see or feel it happening. This happened yesterday night.

The thief first went to a FedEx where they probably tested the card and then made copies of everything in the wallet. Then they went on a shopping spree. They got away with $200 worth, but tried to charge another $700+ on a card with no more credit. Based on their pattern, I'm assuming they're a pro.

The thief has my name, cell phone number, email, passport card, now-former CC numbers and bank number, and health insurance card. It is also possible that they have my bank account and routing number. I had a folded up check in my wallet until midday yesterday. I took it out at the place I'm staying and I believe I left it with my things there and did not put it back in my wallet, but haven't found it yet.

The email the thief has is one I don't use in any relation to bills/financial information. If they tried to use that to confirm my identity, it wouldn't go anywhere.

**Here is what I have done so far:**

* Started an Excel document to track everything - all calls, charges, reports, actions, etc.
* Called my bank and two credit card companies and reported fraud. All three companies flagged the fraudulent charges, said I would not be liable, closed down and reopened my accounts and mailed new cards out to me.
* Went in person to local and called home police departments, filed a local police report on theft of wallet, was denied further reporting/investigating.
* My passport card was in my wallet. I attempted to report it stolen through the State Department's online form. The process resulted in generating a PDF for me to apply for a new card, with zero information or confirmation that my card was reported stolen. I called their stolen card number, and went through the automated system to report. I got a message telling me it was critical to report right away, followed by a message that no representatives will be available until Monday am. (Note: My passport BOOK is safely at home.)
* Called Equifax to place an initial fraud alert for 90 days that will be sent to Experian and TransUnion also. They gave me a confirmation number and started to read me my rights, then their auto system suddenly said it was transferring me to an agent, then hung up on me. I called to try to reach an actual agent and the auto system told me to call back Mon. am.

**Questions:**

* What are the worst repercussions here in terms of them using my health insurance, attempting to open new credit accounts, etc? What does it mean for me that someone has my passport card?
* I feel stuck that this happened coming into a weekend when no one is available but the police. Have I done enough to wait till Monday, since I reported it and closed down my cards, and no one is available now for me to take more steps?
* My old health insurance card was in my wallet. I have a new card but the member number is the same. What do I do about this? What are my risks? 
* I'm in a job search right now. If I put a freeze on my credit, any employer who checks my credit won't be able to without me paying a fee. Should I do this? Any experience with this?
* I need to get a new cell phone next week. My current phone is in bad shape. Is my credit involved in any way here?
* I'm also starting a small business and was about to open a new credit card to track purchases for my business. How should I navigate doing this?
* If I locate my folded-up check, is my bank account number safe, given that I've already reported the fraud to my bank?
* I have to fly back home without ID. I have TSA Pre. I also have a copy of my TSA Pre enrollment letter. What should I expect?
* Should I even bother going back to local police? 
* Anyone who's gone through this before: What am I missing here? What do I still need to do?

**What happened with the police:**

On the way to the police station, I dealt with closing down all my cards and reporting fraud. 

The local police took a report on the wallet theft, but refused to take a report on the actual credit card theft. I had information from the CC companies on the charges that gave me an investigative trail on exactly where the thief went---I actually visited the FedEx. 

Local police told me they would take down the wallet theft but would not allow me to report the specific charges, would not investigate, and told me I had to report that to my home police because I was not a resident, and to report identity theft to my home department. They gave me a copy of their ""investigative report"" and told me to call back in two days for a DR (daily report) number. (I have a temporary DR but I reported at the police station by where the fraudulent purchases happened, not at the station where the initial wallet theft happened, and they told me they have to send the case there, and it will get a final DR there.)

Called my home department in MD. They told me we can't investigate a crime in CA. If the crime happened here, they said, we would investigate. We would take down the fraudulent charge information, call the stores, and request security footage. They said I couldn't report this crime to them in any way, because it did not happen in MD. I asked what I should do and they said to go back to the local police and ask to see a supervisor. 

I suspect the local police don't give a shit about investigating because it's a common crime in this area and they have better things to do.

personalfinance,Surrender Whole Life Insurance to Pay Off Student Loans?,"Hello everyone. I'm looking for some advice about surrendering my whole life insurance. The face value of the (3) policies are $100k and with paid up additional insurance the total death benefit is around $150k.

My parents purchased the original policy around 35 years ago when I was born. The two subsequent policies were purchased about 20 and 10 years ago respectively. 

Presently, the cash value of all three policies is around $17k. The cost basis for the most recent policies exceed the cash value, so there is no tax if I surrender those policies. I believe they are about $10k of the total cash value. 

About half of the cash value of the original policy is taxable. I'm not sure if it would be taxed at the long term capital gain rate because I've held it over a year - which would probably make the tax around $600.

I'm still waiting to here about any surrender fees that I may incur.

If I cash out, I should be able to retire the rest of my student loans, which are at a 6.88% interest rate.

My thought process is that paying off loans with those rates is wiser than holding a conservative instrument like whole life insurance.

I presently have about $600k in 30 year term life insurance - with about $750 in total death benefits including the whole life policies. I would be fine with buying another $150k of term life, which would likely be much cheaper than the $90 I pay in premiums for the whole life insurance.

I have a wife who stays at home with our one young son. We live a fairly simple life, but I'm open to beefing up the term life if advised.

I plan to use the savings from the eliminated student loans payments and whole life payment to contribute to my IRA. I presently contribute enough to get the max match for my 401k.

Please let me know if there are risks or considerations that I am ignoring is implementing this strategy. I would be happy to provide additional information. Thanks!",finance,1464475896

investing,"Investing in a world gone mad. Or, how to preserve capital in a world gone mad.","Debt at the federal and state level in the United States is out of control and unsustainable.  Our creditors will soon stop loaning us money.  The federal debt will default, or inflation will rise to the highest level in our history.

Given that, how to invest?  If the coming inflation is hyperinflation, I'm not sure how owning assets will help since no one will be able to afford them, but the U.S. dollar will be devalued so my cash will become pennies on the dollar.  If inflation is merely extremely high, then maybe owning hard assets like real estate is the answer.  I have my doubts about TIPS in either scenario.

personalfinance,How do I finally start to deal with long-defaulted student loan debt?,"Backstory: After high school, about 10 years ago now, I started attending one of those awful, extensive, for-profit colleges. Fuck it I'll just tell you it was DeVry. I used student loans entirely, only a couple of which were cosigned by my parents. Some federal loans, some private through Sallie Mae (now Navient). I attended for a few years, but eventually dropped out due to just generally hating being there. A couple years after that I went to a local community college for a couple semesters where I paid upfront. I ended up with only around two years worth of valid credits, never got any degree.

The debt amassed at DeVry was astronomical. Like, 100k+ after interest. A used a series of deferments and forebearances early on to keep it at bay for a while. But right now, much of that debt has been given over to collections agencies. I get letters all the time from them offering deals to close everything out for like half the balance, but that's nothing I can come close to achieving. I make $14/hour. 

There have been intermittent times over the past several years where I've set up payment plans, but then something would happen forcing me to stop. Right now I'm paying around 70/month to Navient as part of some program, and it's stopped the calls directly from them. But I know collection agencies are still out there with lots of my debt.

The main thing stopping me from really tackling this has just been the seeming hopelessness of it. Like I figure even if I live well below my means and start paying hundreds a month, it'll take decades to get rid of it. Decades of spending huge portions of my income for basically nothing (DeVry is horrible). Plus I've always been basically depressed and suicidal so I kinda always figured I'd be dead by the time I had to deal with it. Ya know?

Anyways, my main questions are, first of all, what's the best way to get a good look at what debt I have out there. Because my debts been shipped around so much, I don't really understand where it all is.

Second, how do I best consolidate it? I see ads for this kinda thing online all the time, but I never trust them. It'd be really nice to be able to make one monthly payment and know that It's all actually going into bringing it down.

And lastly, is there any legal recourse for getting any of this debt removed due to DeVry being a horrible garbage dump of a school?",finance,1464511085
personalfinance,Protip: Federal Student Loan Repayment/Mortgage Qualification Overseas Tax Loophole,"I am an expat working overseas. I wanted to flag something for you guys who paying student loans and/or trying to qualify for various loans (e.g., mortgage) that are based in part upon monthly debt payments. 

**Federal Student Loan repayment programs (IBR, PAYE, etc.) are based upon your AGI, and not your MAGI**

The significance of this is that an individual overseas is able to apply the foreign earned income exclusion of $105,672 to reduce their AGI and qualify for much lower student loan repayment plans, and also their mortgage application will take into account this lower payment. Their MAGI (AGI+exclusion) will still prevent them from taking some nice tax breaks (e.g., child tax credit or earned income credit).

**EXAMPLE**: I am married with two kids. I earn $175,672 overseas in Saudi Arabia working for a foreign oil company. I owe $350,000 on my student loans. I file jointly and apply the foreign exclusion. My AGI would be $70,000. For purposes of Federal Loan IBR Program, I would only need to pay $376 per month. If I had not taken advantage of the foreign exclusion, my AGI would have been $175,672, and I would have to pay $1565 per month on IBR or $4118 on the standard payment plan. Also, I now get to apply to mortgages and other loans with only a ""$376/month"" payment being held against me (and not the total size of the loans).

**Conclusion**: Leveraging this earned income exclusion loophole (that probably came as a result of sloppy drafting in the student loan repayment code). Will lead to drastically lower student loan payments, and an ability to qualify for mortgages and other loans in the U.S.",finance,1464512383

We have $550,000 in student loan debt combined (professional school) and have a current yearly income of $150,000 expected to increase to $400,000 a year in the next couple of years. We have been paying off smaller private student loans and we own our cars outright. We have a mortgage on a $115,000 house with ~$45,000 in equity. We have a $20,000 emergency fund, our current monthly expenses are only about $3,000 a month, and we are using the rest of our income to pay off the remaining small student loans (""small"" means in the tens of thousands of dollars range). We are in a great place right now, except that our retirement fund has not been built because we've focused on debt.

We will be moving out of state in the next couple of years, and are looking at a $750,000 or so mortgage. We will not have an issue with the down payment.

There are a few concerns:

First, should we take on such a large mortgage while still in massive amounts of student loan debt? The alternative is to live in an apartment or buy a smaller house, but we'd prefer not to move school districts once we get to this new location, and the area we are looking at has no houses cheaper than $600,000 or so. It's the only good public school system in the area, and we're not big fans of private schools.

Second, our current retirement fund is about $60,000 through mandatory retirement with my employer (matched), plus whatever social security my wife has paid into. We are behind because I'm still in training, and she has no employer match, and our debt seems more important. Should we be saving for retirement before paying off the small student loans? What about the bigger ones?

Third, assuming we were to get a large mortgage, should we get a longer duration mortgage in order to pay down the student loans (higher interest rate) quicker? Or should we pursue the best situation from an interest standpoint with whatever further debt we decide to add on?

~$900k purchase price for an apartment in NYC. Monthly taxes come out to $700 and common charges are $600 per month.  
Other assets:  
$1 million in a Merrill Lynch wealth management account. It's invested in stocks, bonds and commodities.  
A $800k house in NJ, fully paid for.  
A $800k commercial building in NJ with a 10 yr mortgage at a 4.5% rate. $400k is paid for. 
A $300k commercial property in NJ, fully paid for.  
The reason I'm looking into using margin is that I can get access to a better interest rate (although I understand it can go up in the future). Additionally, I won't have to liquidate any of my current holdings. Finally, I believe I can save some money on the purchase by making an all cash deal and not paying closing costs. Another advantage is that I can ""pay off principal"" by reducing margin debt as frequently as possible and that if I ever feel like partially pulling out of stocks for a bit I'll save a bit on interest. Also, if I plan on upgrading to a better apartment in a few years it would be easier to do than with a regular mortgage. It just seems like massive win vs a traditional mortgage given that I'm able to bear interest rate risk and would only be borrowing a small chunk of my total assets.

personalfinance,Very long-defaulted Student Loans the US Navy didn't pay off when I enlisted,"I enlisted in the US Navy when I was 19 back in 2006.  When I enlisted, I had two options: Enlistment Bonus or Student Loan Repayment Program.  I picked the Student Loan option as I owned like $7,000-$8,000, and my enlistment bonus was less than that... so yea, easy choice.  

As per my enlistment contract (which I still have), the US Navy was suppose to pay off all of my student loans over a one year period, after i was in for one year.  They were also suppose to take over the loans, defer them for the first year, until they started making payments.  

Well I got out in 2011, with not a single payment made.  Sallie Mae had some huge financial issues, and I ended up not having to pay them like $3k.  But I still owe my school ~$4k from my federal loans.  They have never had a single payment done to them as I was told if I make any payments, the Navy will not reimburse me, etc.. and have been told time and time again, keep deferring until the Navy pays them off.  

Well now I'm 29, with very shit credit because of this.  The Navy still hasn't made a single payment and now that I'm out I've been informed it's whatever now, they aren't going to do anything.  I have a contract that says they were suppose to, but the contract also keeps me from suing the Navy for anything.  

What do I do?  Do I just accept that the US Navy broke the contract with me, and pay it off myself... or what?  I can't get a car loan, well really any loan now because of my credit.  The Navy has completely destroyed my financial life because of this.  I 'm not sure what my next step should be.",finance,1464551017

It doesn't really matter what type it is or what my business plan is, just know that it's happening and there's about $40-50k of immediate costs involving lawyer fees, patenting, and prototyping.

As a quick background: I'm 30, married with a kid (10 month old), and am 2 years into a 15 year mortgage on a 190k house of which I put 20% down. That is my only debt. I make $85k a year and my wife does not work.

Our assets include about $55k in checking/savings, $20k in my wife's retirement, $5k in my child's college fund, and about $15k in my 401k. 

While there is the initial $40-50k, also note that I may have to quite my job to pursue this business full time in 1-2 years. My wife could go back to work making $40k/yr. Also I have family who is willing to let me borrow about $20k.

Now to the real question: based on the increase of value in my house, I can get a 30 yr cash out refi on my house. My interest rate will go from 3.5 to 4.25%, my monthly payment changes from $1500 to $1400 (including ESCROW), and I lose about $6k in closing costs, but I get $40k cash.

Should I avoid the debt and spend out of my checking/savings/retirements or stockpile the cash and take the refi? Is there an easier/cheaper way to get $40k in cash?

personalfinance,Can my wife (26) and I (28) afford to buy my MIL a house?,"Hi,

My wife and I have thought about buying my MIL a house for some time now. My MIL just recently got out of a bad relationship.  She is on her own, and while she works as a house cleaner, she does not make anywhere near enough money to save for any resemblance of retirement at her age (50).  The wife and MIL came here as war refugees some years ago.  

My wife and I think that buying her a house would be a nice thing for her and will give her a place to live for the rest of her life without having to move in with us. We would charge her mom rent for what she can afford with being 100% okay making up the difference, if she has to miss a payment, etc.  

We will have to take care of her one day and I figure we might as well lock in a low interest rate loan and start paying down the 
mortgage of a house now for her.  

The expected house purchase price is ~$150,000.  We would put probably 5% down. 

My wife and My's Stats:

**Total Income:** $225,000

**Debts:**  

Student Loans: $1200 a month ($60K left - 4 years remaining on payments)

Car: $333 a month ($6K Left)

Rent: $1350 a month

**Assets:**  

$50,000 in 401K

$22,000 in IRA

$25,000 in Other

$15,000 in Savings


I know we need to save more and pay her student loans down, but those are all being worked on.  I expect interest rates to rise .25% this year and substantially more in 2017 and 2018.  Buying the MIL a house will happen, so we might as well lock in 3.5% over 30 years vs waiting to save a bit more and have to pay 5-6% rate over 30 years.

I had a phone conversation with a potential investment adviser the other day and when I casually mentioned that I might be buying a house in the next year or two he suggested getting started on the process as soon as possible to avoid potential interest rate increases in the coming year. Is this sound advice? Are there any indications that interest rates will go up in the next year, and if so by how much?

If it is the case that I should begin the process sooner rather than later, am I financially ready? How much could i comfortably afford? The online calculators are saying as high as 370k!!!

Basic Information:
-Mid 20s in my second job as a software engineer.

-Salary before taxes: 75k.

-No debt.

-Currently saving about 1/2 of my take-home pay despite living in a 2 bedroom apartment in one of the more expensive areas at 1200/month before utilities.

-~40k in savings but would like to keep 20-30k as an emergency fund. 

-Local credit union that I have been with forever has a first time home-buyer mortgage option with less than 20% down and no mortgage insurance, no closing costs and still low fixed (4.6%) rates over 30 years.

The houses that I would be most likely to buy are anywhere from 150k with some renovation required to 280k perfect and move in ready.

personalfinance,$80k student loan $52k salary. How is my budget?,"Wanted to share, partly to celebrate progress and partly to ask advice. 

I'm 23 y.o., graduated last May ('15) w/ B.S. Chemical Engineering and 80k debt from state school. Moved in with parents, first 2 months unpaid shadowing, next 3 months $18/hr, then 52k salary job (7 months till present). Parents provide me food, shelter, cell phone, utilities and first car (bought $2600 car with cash since then). I maintain one month income buffer in the bank and a $1500 emergency fund. 



Current monthly budget:  
$533 Private student loan payment (Sofi)  
$142 Federal student loan payment.   
$100 Gasoline on a CC paid in full every month.   
$25 LA Fitness     
$400 All spending.    
$500 save for big investment.   
$1087 Additional payment to highest interest debt.  

Current loan breakdown (total 59k owed now):  
$7566 @6.8% Fed.   
$2089 @4.66% Fed.  
$5488 @4.66% Fed.    
$36,943 @4.57% Sofi private loan refi 7-year.   
$2150 @3.86% Fed.   
$5595 @3.86% Fed.    




All my bills are set to get paid automatically within the same 2 days every month. I set my lower interest fed loans to 30 years graduated so I have lowest minimum payment and can apply the most extra money to the highest interest loan.  

I am saving $500 monthly (in the form of buying stocks and mutual funds) to use towards an investment in 4 years. (Either a business or rental property)

I split up any windfalls I recieve proportionally to my monthly budget among the loan payment, saving for big investment, and spending. 

I feel accomplished to have paid over $20k towards my loans in 1 year and feel in control of finances due to following the guidance of r/PF. 




Questions: 

-Once I pay off the 6.8% Fed loan, should I pay extra to the 4.66% Fed loans or the 4.57% private loan? Fed loans have much more protections than private in the case of job loss and disabilities among other misfortunes. 

-Is saving 500 a month smart compared to paying it to debt? Currently I'll pay off my loans in 4 years but if I applied another 500 to my loans I'd be done in 3 years and could just save after that. In the current way I am gaining experience at the stock market and one of my mutual funds is actually growing faster than my highest interest debt. This category also serves other purposes in case of problems; E.X: I plan to use up to 2/5ths of it to pay my bills after buffer and emergency fund in the event of long term unemployment before requesting forbearance. 

-I want to marry my girlfriend who wants to get married within 2-3 years. This would take me off my plan due to $$ needed for a ring and wedding and monthly costs of moving in together. She has no debt, makes 55k and is ready to support me while I pay off my loans and will support us to try business/investment risks together. Any thoughts on this, and can it be easier to achieve my financial goals after getting married due to dual income?

PF has been great guidance so far, and this budget was developed in great part by its ideas. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Thanks",finance,1464589535

personalfinance,(CAN) What to do with newly discovered savings while paying off student debt?,"Hello all,
Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm in need of some assistance after recently discovering that when I was born, my grandfather bought stock for me that my mom has kept an eye on until recently, when I asked her for the physical stocks to transfer them onto my account. Please note this is all in Canadian dollars.

Long story short, I now have ~$65,000 in one stock to my name. I just graduated from a graduate degree and have around $23,000 in student debt. It is on a line of credit, which I have a good interest rate on for the next year (prime+0.5%). This will last for one more year until the grace period ends and they jack up the interest rate. As of right now, my interest payments are about $75 a month.

I also have a job lined up starting in August. This lasts for 10 months with a chance at being hired back after, and pays ~$850/week.

I plan on travelling for a month before my job starts. My dad covered by plane tickets as a grad present, and I expect to spend another couple thousand during that month, which I can put on my line of credit.

My question is, what should I be doing with my stock money? It currently pays me about $750 quarterly in dividends and easily covers my line of credit interest, so my plan was to keep that money invested and use the dividends to cover/pay down my line of credit for the next year. I would also take any extra money from my pay checks once I start working to pay down my line of credit. Then, in a year from now, pay off my line of credit completely with my stock money before the interest rate shot up. Is this ideal? Is there a better place for my money to be invested to provide more of a revenue? 

Summary of $$ info:
stock money: 65,000 (750/quarter dividends)
student/travel debt: 25,000 (77/month interest)

personalfinance,Emergency fund size,"Hello Reddit PF! I am a recent college graduate and was fortunate enough to land a very nice job which I start on Tuesday. I currently have no emergency fund and after reading PF I've learned the importance of creating one.

My original plan was to save about $7k over the course of June to October (about 3 months expenses) and then start to tackle my student debt in November (6 month grace period ends). My total debt balance is about $38k which I plan to repay over a 10 year period. My federal loans have a balance of $32.5k @ 4.5% interest. However, my one private loan is $5.5k @ 11% interest. 

Since the private loan is at such a high interest rate should I save a smaller emergency fund and start to pay off the balance before the grace period ends?

For any that wonder, my monthly available amount for savings/debt is about $1.4k. Thanks everyone!

Edit 1: Income is $63k with take home with monthly take home of about $3,300. I've budgeted about $450 of ""fun"" money for myself and my girlfriend per month which includes things like going out for dinner, getting some drinks, or making a few discretionary purchases.

Notes:

We currently have 4k in CC debt, and while we have decent rates, we are planning to pay this off immediately. 

Our two biggest drains are currently my truck and her student debt:

$38,231 in my auto debt. This is my work/personal vehicle. While I did not need a new vehicle, I saw this as, ""any down time with a used truck is money lost."" Was it the best decision? No, but I am stuck with it and it is incredibly upside-down (1 year old, 30k miles). I am currently paying $594/monthly on the payment. 

*Here in lies one of my bigger decisions, do I start throwing all of my money at it and pay it off ASAP? Pay some and refinance? What's the best choice?*

Her auto debt is $14,7xx.

Her student loans amount to: $11,784 (3.92%), $2,941 (6.55%), $3,463 (5.75%), 3,444 (5.35%), 3,326 (4.25%), and 2,800 (6.55%). It seems reasonable to apply the snowball method here, as many of her lower loans have higher interest rates. 

Savings? We hover anywhere from $6k to $9k. She also has nearly $7k in an Roth/401K.

Credit? We both have excellent ratings, nearing the 800's.

Alright Reddit, we are ready. Ready to tighten our belts and heed the advice of those who are wiser than us. Ready to get out from this rock and start down the path of financial responsibility.

personalfinance,Finally financially independent from my parents! But where do I go from here?,"I actually get to type this with much, MUCH excitement: As of July 1st, I will be financially independent from my parents, with no help from them. Took me long enough at 25, and I'm ashamed it took so long. It would also be sooner, but my mother insisted on helping me out one more month, because ""I want to make sure you're okay, and you've made positive steps"". I can't really argue against her, so I figure it'll be okay.

Here's the thing - to be completely honest, when I joined /r/personalfinance a year and a half ago, I never though I could make it this far. I hemorrhaged money and made some piss poor choices (example: car was dying, but not dead. So let's go out and finance a used WRX, because I want it. Shit). I've tapped that pretty much under control, and I've set strict budgets. I use my credit cards wisely, and they're paid off in full every month. My score has hit 750 area once again. So now... I'm lost. And my budget is still kind of sad.

To start: I make a paltry $12.50 an hour as a CSA at a bank. Sweet. This is about $1440 per month, after a $10 direct deposit to savings (tiny bits of emergency fund planning), and a 1% 401k contribution (company will match up to 4%, and I'd like to work my way up there).

Here's what I got (these are all already split with my boyfriend, so for example our total rent is $1075/mo):

* **Rent and heat/hot water** - $537.50/mo (down from $750 thank god)
* **Electric** - ~$15/mo (thank you hydroelectric dam!)
* **Apartment Insurance** - $18.27 every 3 months
* **Private Student Loan** - $201.02/mo (thanks Discover.)
* **Federal Student Loans** - $58.16/ mo ( Pay As You Earn Plan)
* **Car Payment** - $350/mo (Actually $322, little extra has been thrown at it to help close it out 10 months early)
* **Car Insurance** - $56/mo
* **Comcast** - $27.47/mo
* **Food** - $80/ mo (boyfriend helps a bit here)
* **Vehicle Gas** - $80/ mo ( I use a motorcycle predominantly during the summer months to cut costs, so during the summer it's more like $50-60/mo)

**All together: $1423.42/mo.**

(Also, motorcycle insurance for the year is $75, so I pay that upfront and I'm good until March of next year.)

Am I cutting it close? Oh hell yes. Here's the thing - I really, REALLY didn't think any farther than this. I didn't think for emergencies. I thought of financial independence, and being able to have my parents save for their trips and retirement. It took me far too long to hit this point. It wasn't fair to them at all. And I can't thank them enough for it. What's funny and somewhat sad to me is that I'm the next most financially savvy to them out of all 6 of their daughters.

I'm looking at a possible raise at the end of June as I move up within my company, and my boyfriend makes a decent chunk more than I do, and his debt-to-income ratio (The **magical word!** in our household and he thinks its hilarious) is way smaller than mine, so he's offered to help out in terms of food to give me a little more wiggle room. Bonus Checks (2 months of the year, I get one extra paycheck) go immediately towards standing medical bills and then directly into savings.

Have I annoyed you guys enough? You're still reading? Oh sweet god you're a saint then. Now the thing is - where do I go from here? Do I focus on building up the emergency savings (at $200 right now, with about $500 hitting it in a couple of weeks to be $700 from a security deposit return) and get to at least enough for a month's worth of bills? Do I focus on putting money into my HSA, which I haven't used so far? Do I try and up my 401k contribution to start building retirement? Focus on now, or later? And when I do get disposable income (that exists?), how do I budget that as well?

I know, I have a lot of questions. Mostly, because I'm excited. This is the first time in my life that I've done positively in my financial world. I consolidated my loans and went on a payment plan. I picked out a tiny, dirt cheap apartment for my boyfriend and I that, while no where near as nice, means I have independence. We cut cable. And I can still keep my car and motorcycle, my pride and joys. 

If you're still here... go grab yourself a treat or something, because I rambled. Thanks for the love and Kool-Aid, PF. I can't thank you enough for planting the seeds and teaching me how to sow them.",finance,1464633430
personalfinance,"25 (M) that received a $23k windfall, trying to make an informed decision","Hi, I've lurked r/personalfinance for almost two years, and have been employing at least a few of the common principles in my own life. For example, I have an emergency fund, I have been paying down student loans, I'm saving in a 401k and HSA, etc.

Long story short, my grandfather just recently decided to sell off some municipal bonds that were in my name because they were poised to start losing money, and allow me to decide what to do with the check. The total amounts to just over $23,000. I don't exactly consider this MY money, as I didn't really earn it. He saved it up for me and bestowed it upon me. We transferred the accounts to my name years ago and I sat on it during that time, pledging not to use it unless I really needed it, so long as it was still in that account.

Now the account is closed, and I have a check ready to be used, but I'm not sure how to use it.

A little background about myself and my finances: I still live at home, I work full-time ($44,100 salary), no car payments, car insurance still covered by parents, emergency fund of $7,800, savings to return to school at $2,000, and then there is the student loans...

I still have about 26k left in student loans. My biggest loan left is 20k, and also has the highest interest rate at 6.8%.

However, I know it would also be financially prudent of me to learn more about real investing and play with this money.

What REALLY confounds all of this is the fact that my employment is set to be terminated the end of October 2016, as my company is eliminating our positions. However, I would still be due to make a large bonus in March 2017, which could also be used towards paying off the loan if I decide to reinvest the 23k check. I'm also set to receive severance should I not earn another position with the company.

Given these criteria, what would be my best course of action PF?",finance,1464633459
personalfinance,Emergency Fund Size Question,"I have paid off all of my mid-to-high interest debt, and I currently have a $1000 EF as well as a one month buffer (I use YNAB), so over one month's expenses as EF if needed.  I have $1600/mo to put toward debt or savings.  I read the wiki and flowcharts, and I think the direction from them would be to build a 3-6 month EF at this point.  My debts right now are:

7000 to IRS at 3% (currently paying $86/mo)
15,000 on 401k loan (current payroll withdrawals of $103/wk)

Here's why I'm nervous and would like to pay off the debts rather than build up EF right now.  IRS payment plans sometimes get screwed up, and then they demand full payment immediately, possibly freezing my accounts.  Or at least so I've heard from Dave Ramsey.  And the 401k loan is payable in full immediately upon my termination from my job (something that I view as extremely unlikely), or I would have to pay taxes and 10% penalty.  So, both of these debts carry risk beyond just the interest rate.

Am I overthinking this?  Under thinking it?  Should I build up EF, or continue to wipe out the debts?

I appreciate any advice, as well as all the great content that has gotten me this far...

Edit:
Also, forgot to point out:  paying off the 401k loan would have a significant positive cash flow impact.",finance,1464636976

personalfinance,Rule of 70 to know how long it takes for your money to double with a given annual growth rate,"The other day I discussed this with my boyfriend, who couldn't believe that it could be this simple. So we both checked it, and the rule of 70 is a good appromixation. 

So the general rule is: if you want to know how long it will take for your money to double, with a given annual growth rate *and* compounding, then the number of years it will take is 70 divided by the interest rate (so for a 7% interest rate, it's 70 divided by 7: it'll take ten years). 

Some examples: so if you put $1000 in a savings account at 1% interest rate, the rule of 70 says it will take 70/1: 70 years for the money to double. According to a compound interest calculator online, putting $1000 in and waiting for 70 years with 1% interest rate, gives you $2006 after those 70 years. So it doubled, plus a few bucks. 

For 2% interest rates, the money should double after 35 years, and this one is spot on. After 35 years the calculator tells me I'll have $2000 from $1000 original input.

For 7% growth, after ten years you've got $1967. So it's a little bit less than $2000. 

For 10% growth, after seven years it's $1950. So again, just a little bit less than the expected $2000, but very close. 

So it works as a rule of thumb. How often will you need it? Maybe not so often, but maybe now and then...",finance,1464642248

personalfinance,"PF, when is the right time to refinance a car?","I bought a used car last October and wound up with a very high interest rate. At the time I had only had a credit card for about 2 months, and when they checked my credit they said I had no score (Equifax and Trans Union were about 610 or so,  the fact they didn't see anything was a bit of a mystery to me).

The total amount financed was about 10,500. In short, my APR is 11.9% (yikes, I know), with a loan period of 5 years. 

I have not missed any payments on the car ($211/month), and have kept my credit cards at less than 15% maximum credit allowance (both are cash back cards with introductory deals waiving interest until the end of the year). My credit score is 700 +/- 4 or so points across all credit bureaus.

Initially I was planning on refinancing after a year of payments, but I received an unsolicited letter from a shady looking loan agency that wanted to refinance me.

These are all fixed-rate UNSUB loans. Currently they are on an income driven repayment plan based on a minimum wage job so the monthly payments were $0 and interest has accrued and not been paid off. 

Starting in June, that minimum wage job changes to a full-time position with benefits making $40k (gross) per year. I want to start paying these loans off with every bit of income I can spare.

My main questions are: How should I begin? Can I consolidate into one loan and make payments that way or should I try to avalanche the high interest rate loans? Does it matter that all of these loans have unpaid interest? If I don't consolidate should I be making payments on interest for all the loans or focus on just one loan at a time? Can I even do that? 

I think I have more questions but I want to see how this post does before I ask further and I'm sure the answers to these questions will answer my other questions.",finance,1464670835
personalfinance,I need some advice,"I guess I will start with my situation.  I recently bought a house in January 2016. I won't go into the down payment details because I didn't put down much so I have a high mortgage on a $180,000 house that my girlfriend and I live in. I bought it in January of this year (just my name is on the house). I am 27 and work full time as a computer programmer. She goes to school full time and works part time.

I make $55,000 a year and she makes about $20,000 (she's a waitress so this is an estimate).

Anyways, here is the predicament.  We made the mistake of racking up about 12,000 of credit card debt when moving in to get things we THOUGHT we needed for the house. After taxes, benefits, etc... I bring home $1450 every two weeks. Her pay fluctuates based on tips and shifts she gets but I don't want to have to rely on her income even though she does help a much as she can.

Long story short, one of my paychecks goes to mortgage ($1350) and the other paycheck goes to utilities, bills, and credit card payments. Which leaves us with close to nothing every week.  We are completely broke all the time and have no money in savings (however I do have a little over $10,000 in my 401k account). We do manage to make all payments on time but have no money left over. I need to do something soon because it has been very stressful, extremely depressing, and becoming a burden on our relationship. 

I think I need to consolidate debt so I can make lower monthly payments so that I can start a savings account, emergency fund, and eventually refinance the house.

My question to you guys is this. Should I dip into my 401k since I am only 27, or should I take out a loan to consolidate debt. My credit score is in the high 700's. I really need to do something this week because I can't keep living this way. Please don't preach to me on a mistake I made by buying a house with little down payment or being stupid with credit. I know I messed up. If it helps, I have cut up all credit cards and haven't used any credit in the past month.

A follow up question for the loan route would be what kind of APR and interest rate should I look for with a $12,000 3 year loan? My main goal here is to one low monthly payment as opposed to paying 10 different credit lines.

Please help get out of this financial depression. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks in advance.

personalfinance,"My parents are against renting and want to help me (23, F) buy a house. Can I afford it? (Europe)","Dear PF

I’m 23, live in Belgium and graduated last year. I’ve been working full time since November 2015. When I started studying, my parents bought a house in our college town for me and my sisters to live in. It had some extra rooms that we rented out to pay for the loan, which is now payed off. Both me and my sisters are now graduated so my parents want to sell the house. I’m still living in it now, with one of my sisters, since we work in the college town. I don’t have to pay rent for my room.

My mom is obsessed with me and my sisters buying our own house. She is absolutely against renting. Now, I feel like I’m very young to buy. It’s not that I don’t see the advantages, but I just feel like no one my age could ever afford a house by themselves. I’ve only been working for seven months, so it’s a bit insane. But now, because my mom is so much against renting but will also sell the house I’m currently living in for free, she will give me (and my sisters each) €100.000 for the down payment for a house. Yes, my parents are very well off and can definitely afford it. There are a few conditions though. If I don’t buy something before they sell the house I currently live in, I need to move back home (free). My parents also like to give some input on what house I’d buy. I don’t really mind that, because they have a lot of experience in the housing market so they know what a good deal is.
Anyway, I’ve been looking at houses, and I’ve been looking at the numbers, but I’d like some advice to see if I can afford it. I’ve found a house that’s very much to my taste, but I’m just unsure if I have looked at all the costs I’ll have.

Current financial situation:

Money saved: €7.500

Income: +- €1.850/month (netto)

Expenses (on average per month, based on my spending in the last 6 months):

- Car:  €120

- Clothes: €50

- Entertainment (eating out, movies, travel, …): €80

- Groceries: €150

- Treat yourself: €20

- Other (phone, gifts, …): €90

- Debt: €250/month (car, til December 2017, no interest since the loan is with my parents)

TOTAL EXPENSES: €760

I do feel like I can save some more on food and clothes though.

The house I’m currently looking at is €217.000. There would be €20.000 in extra fees (attorney, closing costs, etc.).
If I get the €100.000 from my parents, I’d still need to loan about €140.000 (I want to keep the money I saved myself as emergency funds). I should be able to get a loan at maximum 2% fixed rate according to a simulation by my bank, which would result in me paying off €710/month for 20 years. (Realistically it would probably be a bit less, since I’ll try to get a bit off the asking price for the house and since my parents are also members of that bank with a lot of money, they can definitely put some extra pressure to get a good interest rate).

I have a tough time calculating my extra costs, but I would think the following would definitely be enough:

- Insurance: €150 (fire, homeowners, …)

- Tv, internet: €100


I have an extra €1000 that I won recently that I would use to buy the first necessities for my house. The house I was looking at included furniture, so I could avoid spending money on that in at least the first year. I definitely don’t mind “camping” at my house for a while.

Possibly I would rent out a room to one of my sisters, but I don’t really want to count on that extra money.

According to this calculation I’d have about €100 left every month, which is not exactly much. I know that if there were emergencies, I could postpone paying off my car, but still.
However, I feel like it might still be worth it if the alternative is never getting the €100.000 from my parents.

What do you think?


TLDR: My parents are giving me €100.000 if I buy a house instead of ever renting. If I calculate all my expenses when paying off a nice house I’ve found, I’d have about €100 a month left over. Can I afford this?



EDIT:
Thank you everyone for the responses. I got way more input than I expected! :)

I've been thinking since yesterday, mainly about what I want. I do want to buy my own place (otherwise I wouldn't have posted at all), but what I want most of all is live alone. So buying a house to then rent out some rooms isn't exactly what I want. I don't want to NEED roommates, because it's a risk (what if I can't find anyone, etc.) and I don't really want to live with anyone else anymore. So I'm going to look at cheaper places. Probably an appartement then, since houses at €100.000-€170.000 are dumps that I would have to pour more money in. A nice small appartement that I'd have to pay a €400-500 mortgage on would be perfect, since I'd have to pay at least €500 if I had to rent anyway.

So thank you all for your advice! It was very helpful! And for all the people worried about the relationship between me and my parents: as some people said I'm probably the best judge on that. And believe me, I wouldn't do this if  I doubted that aspect of it. When I said that my parents would like some input in the house, I didn't mean that they'd make decisions for me, they just know way more about real estate, so I like to get their advice. It would be my name and my name only on the deed :)",finance,1464690473

personalfinance,"Need help deciding how much of a student loan to take out for grad school. (24, no debt)","Hey PF. Apologies ahead of time if this gets long because of my formatting.

First time poster going to in-state graduate school in August. I was lucky and my parents and grandparents paid for most of my undergraduate degree. Because of that, I have no idea how loans work and need some help figuring out how much I need to take out. Below you'll find my cash/savings/awards, what school thinks I need to pay for the year, and what I spent on average every month.


**Cash, savings, awards:**

* Savings: I moved home and saved $10k which is now in a 529.

* Savings: My grandparents are going to contribute $7.5k, also in a 529.

* Savings: I have $2k in savings (depositing 20% [currently $125] per paycheck) and $1k in emergency funds.

* Cash: I work for AmeriCorps full time, which pays $483 biweekly, and a small business part time 6 or 13 hours a week for $10/hr. Searching for a better part time job. AmeriCorps ends before school starts.

* Award: AmeriCorps will provide $5.5k toward school before tax. I also extended my service, so I'll receive a cash stipend for my extra month and a half, but I don't know how much. Probably a couple hundred.

* Award: I received a grant from my school for $5k for the year

* Award: I received a scholarship for $2k for the year

* Award: I've applied for 3 need-based state scholarships. Two are $200-19,000 and one is $400-9,700. I won't hear back for a while, but my chances of getting them are good. Not a lot of people know to apply for them, a friend gave me a good word, and I'm pretty poor these days. :P


**Loans:**

* Federal Direct Loan Unsub: $20,500

* Federal Direct Grad PLUS: $16,674

* Total: $42,174


**Cost of Attendance:** (direct quote of numbers from the school, with my comments)

* Books and Supplies: $1,351.00

* Fees: $1,807.00

* Grad PLUS Loan Fees: $857.00

* Hospitalization Insurance: $3,600.00 (not sure I'll have to take this, I'm covered by my dad's insurance and waived the school insurance)

* Living Expenses: $19,350.00 (*see below*, pretty sure I won't spend this much)

* Malpractice Insurance: $27.00 (waived?)

* Stafford Loan Fees: $214.00

* Transportation: $2,000.00 (no idea if this is what they're charging me to use their bus or an estimate of what I'll spend to get there. I am walking/biking distance from campus already)

* Tuition: $12,944.00 (tru)

* Vaccines: $24.00 (doing this myself while I have AmeriCorps covering my copays)

Total: $42,174.00


**Living expenses:** (what I spend with one roommate)

* Rent: $515

* Utilities: $10 for water, varies from $25 to $75 depending on the month

* Internet: $25

* Car insurance: about $100

* Food: currently on SNAP at $194/month, trying to stay that way but I'll need at least 4 hrs/week of part time work if they accept my 16 hr/week internship.

* Gas: extremely variable but on average $70 a month

* Flex spending: $393, just under 30% of my income. I break this down further into budgeted categories on Learnvest, including eating out, bars/alcohol, Uber/Lyft/travel, unnecessary and necessary shopping, health spending, entertainment, gifts, charity, etc.

Total: $1138-1188/month, which is 13656-14256 a year. Less than the 19k my school estimated.

---------------------------------------------------------

**SO, my big question is: how much should I take out in loans?** Avoid the Grad PLUS altogether? My COA with the edits above comes out to $32,572. $18,316 of that is school tuition and fees payable through scholarships, AmeriCorps and 529. **The remaining $14,256 is living expenses - I assume I can only use my loans and savings for this. Everything else is meant for tuition and fees, right?** I'll only have $2750 in savings when I finish my job in August.

$18,318 - 5000 grant - 2000 scholarship = 11,318 to cover through AmeriCorps and 529 until I hear from other scholarships",finance,1464703549

I'm looking at putting my resignation notice in today, and moving back home ~6 hours away to a much smaller job market. Given the situation, I could do the standard/minimal two-weeks notice, or drag it out to July 1. Dragging it out to July 1 (or July 5, free paid holiday) gets me various insurance benefits for the rest of July and better continuity of my resume. I wouldn't be surprised if my employer wanted to keep me on as a part-time sort-of employee once I separate, due to how small this market is, steep learning curve, and mission critical nature. 

I'll be moving myself into a family member's guest bedroom ($0-400/mo contribution) in the meantime while I decompress and look for another job in my home area.

What sort of things should I consider before I put my notice in this afternoon? I'm posting this because I didn't think it would be such a big deal until I saw the COBRA insurance rates were $800/mo instead of the $120 I'm paying now. Expect a storage unit to run ~$100/mo or so. 

Are there any other surprises I should expect?

personalfinance,Pay off federal student loans or save/invest with inheritance?,"I (25M) will be coming into a small inheritance from my grandparents that more than covers my outstanding debt. 

I plan on paying off my higher-interest debt ($1k credit card @ 20%, $15k private student loan @ 8.3%) and top off a 4 month emergency fund ($1500/mo expenses). After that I'm not quite sure what to do about my lower interest federal loans, thus I turn to you PF community!

A. $2700, 3.4% Sub
B. $2300, 6.8% Unsub
C. $2600, 3.8% Sub

I guess I'm stuck in regards to the time value and not sure where to investigate this further.

In the past, I dealt with the FSA Ombudsman over some payments that were, in my opinion, not applied in an ethical manner, and I found that there was not the sense of urgency that exists with the CFPB. The FSA Ombudsman simply directed me back to Nelnet customer service, whereas the formal CFPB complaint has resulted in my problem being resolved -- and, at least I was told today, a refund of about $2,000, to be issued by the Department of Education, as a result of the servicer being forced to spend quite a few hours analyzing my payments.

I think the servicers are genuinely intimidated by the CFPB, because they are planning to regulate the servicers in the future.

So, again, if you are truly exasperated by the behavior of your student loan servicer -- for me, the worst part was their customer service never providing a straight answer to questions and never following through on complaints or requests -- I recommend contacting them here and filing a complaint: http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/

personalfinance,35-Year Old Starting a New Job - What Should I Do with 401(k)?,"Let me preface by saying that I am an IT professional with limited knowledge of how 401(k), IRA, etc. work, so please forgive any mistakes I make.

I currently have a balance of $52,500.00 with two outstanding loans totaling roughly $14,500.00.  The new position pays significantly more.  I am able to set up a loan continuance payment option to automatically deduct from my outstanding loan amount from my checking account.  I also have about $20,000.00 in credit card debt.

If I were to take out the balance of my 401(k), I would be hit with 20% in federal taxes, ~7% in state taxes, and 10% early withdrawal since I’m under 55 (or whatever age), leaving me with about 32,000.00, which would finally make me debt free, which sounds exiting.

I’m 35 years old and will probably work until I’m 55-60.  On top of that, my new job pays substantially more and does 401(k) matching up to a certain percentage, so I feel that taking it all out to pay off debts and starting over would not be a major setback (if a setback at all).

My question is, is it worthwhile to just take my money out and pay off existing debt and pay off my loan through the continuance program?  Are there tax implications come next January/February when I file my taxes?  Will I owe an absurd amount from my 401(k) withdrawal, or does the initial % removed cover that?

What would you all recommend?

personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage,"It's been a life goal of mine to pay off my mortgage since I bought my first house. A couple years ago I got a significant pay pump and I've used this influx of cash to save, save, save. As of a month ago I have enough money in savings to pay off my mortgage (a significant amount). Now I'm sitting on the cash and asking myself the question of whether or not I should pay off the loan. A couple considerations.

1) After paying off the loan I will still have enough money to live off of should I lose my job. Its not as much as I'd prefer (which is 50k) but its enough to cover several months of unemployment, and chances are very unlikely I'd ever been unemployed for several months.

2) I have 3 cars, 2 are paid, 1 is not (owe about 50k on it). My thought process of why I haven't paid off the remaining car. First the loan is 0.9% so its very cheap money. Second, its an asset that I can quickly turn to cash. For instance, if I were to lose my job I could just get rid of this car and thus the loan would disappear. I am not upside down on this loan payment. Third, this is a weird one but paying this car off would be cheating. My wife let me buy my dream car, and the monthly payment of $1000 is something I like to see each month so I feel the pain of purchasing this car. If I pay it off I don't feel like I have learned the lesson of buying something that expensive. This may be weird for you but its an important thing to me.

3) Student loans. I have two sets of Student loans. My wife, who's in her doctorate, will graduate with about 60k in loans. I am currently in a masters program that cost 80k. I've been paying half of each semesters tuition out of pocket, my employer has taken care of 15k which leaves me with 25k in dept when I graduate. 25k is no big deal to me. If I really wanted to I could pay this and my house off but I prefer not to because should I die this debt will be covered within the loan agreement itself. Whereas my wife would be left with the house. Also, its just not rewarding to pay off a student loan debt. As far as my wife goes, we decided a while ago the 60k loan is hers to pay off, I've been paying for everything in the house hold for going on 10 years. She will be excited to cover her own debt when she finally has a job after all these years of school.

I know many of you will say I should invest it, however my investment decisions are just inhernatly crap. Seriously, if you want to make millions ask for my investment advice then do the exact opposite. I invested in banking before 2008. I bought Twitter at $40 a share. Don't listen to me on investment. Even my ""safe"" investments double digit negative. I have been slowly moving my long term investments to Index funds due to my completely worthless investment choices. Regardless, I have a very healthy long term investment portfolio so there is no need for me to take my short term money (the money I have to pay off the mortgage) and put it in long term. These are two different discussions, so just consider the money I have right now short term money that I can use however I want.

Finally, I'm a saver, its who I am. Many people may get a kick buying some new toy. Me. I feel great when I save 10k. Paying off my house has a massive value to the part of my brain that loves saving. I love the idea that should anything happen to me the house is not a problem for my wife. I love the idea that if I lose my job my house is paid for, I could flip burgers and keep my kids fed. There is a great sense of accomplishment and relief that will come to me in paying off my house. But I'm still questioning if that's the right decision. House interest is 3.5% I think or 3% something like that. I  really like the idea of paying it off but want to at least hear the pros and cons from this community first.

But when I realized it wasn't an ""investment"" like I'd been told at the sales presentation, and that the maintenance fees were increasing by 4-5% every year, I wanted to get rid of it.

My dad is definitely very caring for the family. He works 3 (close to) minimum wage jobs and makes about 40k or less a year but is always in debt. My mom is also very loving and works as housekeeping but donates most of her money to church. She'd rather give it away to use it for herself and us. Other then regular utilities, phone, and cable bills, we end up short. Around my 10th birthday, i began to take care of most bill payments processes and phone calls because they speak slight English. A while back i read *Rich dad Poor dad*, and it definitely opened up a whole new perceptive to me on the world, i am currently in community college studying business and accounting, with the help of my dad, we pay for at least 3 classes per semester and cannot obtain any federal loans because of our immigration status even though I have been here almost of my life (1 year old), which sucks, but i am slowly making it through because that's life and life hits hard.

I work at a retirement home, part time during school and almost full time in the summer and recently i went up to my boss and asked if i could review his accounting records because he has a business degree and i would love to see the business world site of accounting compared to my school books i bought. After our conversation he offered me a raise and set up a meeting for yesterday and didn't even show up to work because it was a holiday (lol). I know he most likely won't bring up the conversation back up unless i go to him first. Before minimum wage was 10$ in Massachusetts, i used to get $9.50 and there was a time i was going to leave to work with friends at another job but, he told me ""Normally when someone is going to leave i just say Goodbye to them. You are a great worker and ill give you $10.17 raise if you stay."" Needles to say, i stayed but only last week i asked HR where i could see my pay stamps and i only recently noticed i never got that $10.17 raise. When minimum wage went up to 10$, i only then started to receive $10.20. I definitely feel that i deserve more and get surely get more. I am a great asset to the company because i have a lot of experience doing all different kinds of jobs and i work any time and day of the week unless i request it off. I am friends with all the employees ( around 30) and i always help them out when falling behind, my boss sees it from time to time and he gets complements for having hired me, he tells me all the time. What i want to say is i was thinking i could ask for 10% raise ~ $1.02, that seems fair to me but i am unsure and any advice or tips would be awesome!",finance,1464718352

In 2006, I never filed for state or fed. I had a full time job and did consulting on the side and didn't get around to doing all the expenses correctly.

In 2007 my SSN was wrong, CA didn't figure it out but the IRS did, so only CA is worried about 2007.

We're planning on putting ~30% of our assets in bonds. First maxing out our Roth IRAs with BND, then allocating the rest to either BND or MUB in our taxable account. The rest of our assets in the taxable account would be a split between VTI and VTUX.

A little over a year ago I had switched my Credit Card to my banks low interest rate card as I had racked up a ~5k debt. Over the past year I've payed this down and have no balance owing. I have a good credit rating and stable employment. Never missed a payment in my life, even when carrying the balance I always made well above minimum payments. 

Now that I have no more debt, I'm looking at switching my Credit Card to something with benefits, such as cash back. Moving forward I will be putting every purchase on the card and paying the balance in full every month.

I also now have a line of credit with a lower interest rate, should I ever need to transfer a balance from my credit card (not expecting to do this at all)

Basically I have two options:

1. Product Transfer - Just do a simple transfer of my current card to the new rewards card
2. Apply for new card - Apply for a 2nd credit card with rewards. Stop using my low interest card. 


What would be the most beneficial to me? I recently had a credit inquiry on my account when I opened the line of credit, so a new credit card would be the second inquiry in less than a month. However, opening a new card would increase my available credit, and lower my credit utilization.

My wife and I make a combined total of ~$125k/yr.  We both contribute into our 401Ks up to our employer's matches, but do little with our money otherwise as we've been saving up for a down payment on this house.

Given that interest rate, it seems like it makes the most sense to put all of our excess income towards paying off that mortgage (we would, of course, keep investing up to our employers' matched 401K contribution).  I don't see how we could get a more effective and/or reliable return than reducing the principal on that mortgage.

I managed to avoid any sort of debt.

I don’t pay IRA, as there are horrible conditions for that here, like I’d have to be around 80+ years old to even touch the interest on that. Secondly, I feel that there are better options to manage my savings in the mean time.

During this time, I've had a savings and checking account with the bank that I used to work as a teller for, but it finally occurred to me that their interest rates/maintenance fees suck relative to the competition, so I'm looking to move to a different bank.

After looking into a bunch of choices for a savings account, I decided to move my savings over to Capital One (which is where my credit card already is, so that's convenient).

The question now is the checking account.  As I mentioned before, I use my credit card for basically all purchases, so I'm not going to be making many transactions with the checking account.  I've been wondering if a checking account is even all that necessary given the way that I'm handling my finances.  With my previous checking account, I basically only used it for paying my student loans, transferring money to my investments account, or paying bills.

Anyways, I'm looking for advice on if a checking account is really even necessary in this situation, and if so, your advice on different checking accounts/a good way to compare them.  The three I've really been looking at is Capital One (which would be easy since I'd be keeping all my banking under one roof), Chase (sign-up bonus and I could set up the direct deposit to avoid maintenance fees), and Discover (seems that there's zero or very few fees involved and some cash-back on my limited purchases).

Are there nontraditional options that will allow me to refinance at a lower interest rate?,"I think the title sums it up relatively decently. I owe ~$300k in student loans. Currently they're sitting at around 5.5%. My cash income is not high enough to service this debt right now, and I am barely able to keep up with the interest payments, let alone pay down principle.

However, I own a significant portion of a relatively valuable private company - enough that my ownership is worth several times what I owe in student loans. The company is currently growing at a rate that far exceeds the 5.5% interest I am paying on my loans, meaning that extracting the value of my ownership as some sort of cash payment or by selling my interest is not a wise financial decision. Moreover, the company is not organized as a passthrough entity, and there are other stakeholders, meaning that just paying myself is not a realistic option even if it were a sound financial decision.
