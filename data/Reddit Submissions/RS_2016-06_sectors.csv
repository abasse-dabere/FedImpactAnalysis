personalfinance,[Retirement] Additional compensation opportunities 457(b) vs Annuity vs IRA ?,"Some Background:  
Male 25 California  
Software Developer  
82k Salary Before Tax  
5K Emergency Fund  
13K Savings (Planning to buy a home within 5-9 Years if possible)  
Just paid off my students loans, no debt. :)  
i'm pulling in about 40K annually after all my bills and fees.  
***  
Currently applying 10% Pre Tax into a Retirement Pension  
but my work also offers additional retirement things:  

I. 457(b) as far I as I understand there is no match and this is pre-tax payroll deduction, it is equitable.  
II. Annuity Plan (contribution is post tax payroll deduction and locked in at a 7.5% interest rate, non-equitable, 60 year age minimum, 10% max contribution per paycheck) does this seems too good to be true..? I've been researching annuities but I see its not so clear cut.   

When I asked about the 457b plan the rep I talked to was extremely belittling. He kept asking me why I was taking so long to read through the paperwork and he told me I should just put everything in an ultra-aggressive profile. I was even laughed at when I went to the retirement department to plan for it because they said I was too young to ask for a planner. It really broke my spirits and I felt really embarrassed. I'm still new to this personal finance things and a lot of things aren't clear to me but I was under the impression that the risk/reward ratio is not 1:1 so it seems kind of pointless to dump my retirement fund into something I don't understand. I'm not sure how much control I'd be given in my portfolio.
  
Should I just go with my own IRA? Annuity? My pension seems to be quite substantial but I see so many other people worrying about these things. Everyone tells me to start young, so here I am. I read the entire sidebar and i've been lurking for a while. It seems so strange planning for something that will take longer than I have been alive. Any advice is appreciated.

personalfinance,Still can't decide - should I sell?,"Hi all,

You guys are the best.  Here's my situation:

I live in a townhome that I bought at the right time - I owe 115,000 on it and the value is about 200k right now (the market is extremely hot in my city due to growth and interest rates only compound on that).  I have no problems with my house and don't have a reason to dislike it.

I've been considering selling, taking the money I make and using it for a downpayment on a single family home between 250k-300k.  This would be an investment decision - I don't NEED to be in a SFH (no kids, no pets), but I worry that my townhome won't continue to appreciate (at any fast pace anyhow) but a SFH will.  

My takehome is about $3,400 a month after taxes - my current mortgage is an ARM that is currently at 2.25% interest (yes, I can't believe it either, but when I got it, it was 4% and it's gone DOWN twice).  That means that my current payment, including my association dues, is about $1000/mo.  If I move, i'll be looking at around $1300-$1400.

I really can't decide - any advice?  I've also got a car payment of about $500/mo and my student loan payment is about $225/mo.  These are my only debts other than my house (I have no credit card debt or any other loans).  I've got $10k in my emergency fund.",finance,1464744836
financialindependence,Advice to pursue private or public sector job (biologist),"I did a B.Sc., a diploma in Geographic information systems, and a master of resource management degree with a couple of years off in between to reduce debt.  I have since scored a (previously ) coveted federal government position which is more or less permanent. My pay is low ($65k) but benefits are good (defined benefit pension) and the top for managerial position would realistically be around $95,000. To be competitive for this position I spent a lot of time in school, obviously, with the end result being that I'm 35 years old with only about 3.5 years under my belt. Not to mention that 6 months before I got my job the government increased mandatory years of service from 30 to 35 meaning I'd have to work to 68 to receive a full pension with very significant penalties for early retirement. Many I've spoken to said they've highly valued these positions, some saying as much as a 1.4x more to account for good pension and security. Plus the public sector pays substantially more than private sector for biologists / GIS. Anyway, I have 12k loan debt, no house (I live in one of the most expensive cities in north America) no family or kids. Already I'm feeling I can't do this job till I'm 68! My question is would you recommend trying to leverage my secure position to start a small side business (e.g. business loan) or do something else entirely to achieve financial independence? One final note that a mentor once told me that the only remaining secure jobs are in government and as such, government workers are preferred small business loan candidates, so that could be a factor.",finance,1464744941

personalfinance,Refinance Options - Opinions,"I've been shopping around over the last couple of week to refinance my student loan. Here is my current loan:

Principal: $28,475.49
Period: 13 years left on a 15 year loan
Interest: 5.62% variable (rate capped at 29.5%)
Minimum Monthly Payment: $285.95

The lender sent me a letter informing me that in December my interest rate will be increasing to 5.87%. 

I have been pre-approved through SoFi and they have presented several different options. My goal is to cut my interest rate and also cut the term down to 10 years or less. I am willing to spend up to $575 a month.

There are only 2 options at a fixed rate which would see my interest rate drop below 5.87% - a 5 year and a 7 year. The problem I have with those is that the minimum monthly payment is $540.84 on the 5 year at 5.375% and $411.49 on the 7 year at 5.750%. 

They are offering a 4.690% variable at 10 years, a 4.440% variable at 7 years and a 4.315% variable at 5 years. My first thought was the 10 year would be a good option because the minimum monthly payment is lower than the other 2 variable options by at least $100 which means if I had to cut back on expenses in the event of an emergency, I would have more flexibility while still making my minimum monthly payments. 

The maximum rate on their variable loans is 8.95%.

I am looking to get opinions on which option I should go with. I should be able to pay the 10 year variable off in under 7 years.",finance,1464746932

personalfinance,Too many revolving accounts and considering consolidation.,"Hey everyone. So my wife and I are really in a financial pitfall these days and I'm hoping to begin digging us out, but I'm wary to not fall deeper. I've browsed for a while and couldn't find a straight answer for our situation. 

Our credit card debt is out of control. I don't have the details at the moment, but the short story is we have about 9 separate revolving accounts, and all of the interest rates seem outrageous (14-20%). We have never missed a payment on anything in our lives, but our credit score is low because of a low debt to income and virtually no available balance. We stupidly used credit cards to escape the small town we lived in, and have relied heavily on Amazon credit for even food at times.

We are now making decent money, but our rent keeps climbing and we can only afford minimum payments on the overwhelming debt we've grown. I'm thinking there is a solution that would result in a lower interest rate and less payments heading out. I want to pay down the debt as soon as possible but I'm not sure what the best path would be. We've explored the snowball and avalanche methods to repay the debt, but by the time the minimum payments are made, we're searching couch cushions just to survive.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1464747852

personalfinance,MFJ W-4 Question,"Hey all



I have a W-4 question for you. My wife and I (No kids) moved and are both starting new jobs and will be filing taxes jointly. I'll be making around $71k and she will be around $35k. When I go through the top section of the first page of the W-4 for both of us, we both end up with 1 exemption. I then skip to the multiple earners section. That section ends up telling me to put 0 exemptions on Line 5 on page 1, and then withhold an additional $188 from each of our paychecks... Does this seem correct?


I tried to use the IRS withholding calculator online, but it asks for the amount of federal income tax withheld from my last paycheck, but we both have to fill these forms out before we start work, so I don't have that information. If I put 0 for those amounts, it says to claim 2 allowances for one job and 3 for the other for a total of 5. This is quite different than 0 with an additional $187 take from each check right?

I'm a 25 year old male with a tremendous amount of college debt. However, I've been fortunate in the fact said college debt has placed me in a field where I'm earning a decent amount of money despite only having a B.S. 

I'm trying to figure out the best way to lay things out... I guess I'll start with the negatives. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uJY_FoIflRccwKMB68UNd_nijj2PmdByA3eoS6PUMDE/edit?usp=sharing

Obviously a lot of debt to handle. Fortunately, I've found myself in a job where I'll be making 60k/yr in base salary plus an additional 40k/yr bonus. This bonus could be variable but 40k/yr is a reasonable expectation. Furthermore, I'll be living out of a hotel for a year so the only living expenses I'll have is my personal cell phone bill (~100/mo). Additionally, I'll receive $250/wk per diem allowance which should cover food, entertainment, etc. Paychecks, after 10% 401k deduction which is matched dollar for dollar, come out to $1332 bi-weekly. Quarterly bonuses should yield no less than 5k. 

I understand that I'll have a lot of left over money, but any insight/suggestions as to paying off my credit cards/student loans would be greatly appreciated. I understand the benefits of paying down the highest interest rate loans first, but is there a point where a much higher principal with slightly lower interest rates outweighs the alternative strategies? 

I apologize in advance if I haven't provided enough information. This is my first post on PF and will be following it closely in case I've neglected to provide enough information.

I am finally to the point of starting to save for an engagement ring for my girlfriend. I have paid off all student loans (about 100K, woohoo!) and have reached my personal goal of having $10K in savings/checking. I am looking at what the best investment option is to put a couple thousand into that will give me the best return option over the next year (we decided to wait a little bit).

-Age: 23
-Yearly income: $57K (3533/month after tax) and as long as I don't eff up, then I should expect about a 10% increase in October (haven't heard of anyone getting denied this)
-Checking/Savings: around $10K (.15% interest rate)

-Car: 310/month
-Car insurance: 78/month
-Rent/utilities: about 750/month

I know this is a very personal situation that many people would never find themselves but....

What if you are never in a situation to fund retirement?  As in not that you can't afford to, but you aren't allowed to? What if you never work for a company that gives you eligibility to 401ks/Pensions and are legally not allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA anymore?     
    
I live in the UK and am in such a situation. I can not fund any 401k/pensions because I am not eligible. I can not fund my roth IRAs because I am ineligible and the US taxes the British version of Roth IRAs(Cash Isa) and doesn't recognize them. So I can fund the one type of British Roth account (cash with low interest rates) but not stocks and shares. Any interest from this account is not taxed by the British Government but would be taxed by the US government. I am not allowed to hold foreign stocks due to US tax implications and I have been wondering for some time, just how I am supposed to be saving up for retirement exactly.

personalfinance,"Resident physician with ~400k medschool/grad school debt, about to graduate into well-paying position. I wanted to ask PF's thoughts on my financial plan going forward.","Hello!  So I know the title sounds scary, but honestly it is the cost that I've invested in myself to become a physician, and I have no regrets.  I have no undergraduate debt (I was a commuter and went to a great state school with low tuition).  All of my debt comes from obtaining my MPH and medical school degrees.  Unfortunately, my parents made too much for me to qualify for financial aid and too little to actually pay for my schooling, so I did what I had to do. 

**THE DEBT**
So the breakdown of my debt is: 380k in federal loans, and 20k in private loans.  The 380k is currently consolidated, under the PAYE repayment program with average interest rate of 6.8%.  I am also currently enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program as being in residency qualifies (3 years down, 7 more years to go).  The private loan is currently accumulating interest at 1.8%.  I have no credit card debt, and pay off everything at the end of the month.

**PERSONAL STUFF**
I am not married and have no children.  I drive a paid off car with 107k miles, and is still running great.  I don't have any expensive hobbies, just hiking and occasionally camping.  I really don't spend money on expensive clothing, and have been wearing pretty much the same clothes as when I started out residency (shout out to /r/frugalmalefashion).  My major ""fun"" expenditure is that I love to travel and will go on an international trip once a year (usually I spend no more than 2k per trip including flights).  

**THE JOB**
I received a 2 year contract for 250k base salary, with a 15k signing bonus in a low cost of living area, in a state with low state income tax (PA). 

**THE BENEFITS**
The position is at a non-profit hospital, therefore it offers the current investment options: 

* 401(a): employer invests 2.5% of compensation the first 6 years, and increases after that.  100% vested after 3 years.  Annual fee of 0.14% on all mutual fund assets.
* 403(b)
* 457

**THE PLAN**
This is where I was hoping for a critique of my plan: 

1. I plan on paying off my private loan in the first 2-3 months.  I will be using my sign-on bonus and first few paychecks to do this. 
2. I am going to continue on with the PSLF program for my federal loans.  I know some people are worried that it may be discontinuing, but we won't know for sure until the first forgiveness occurs in 2017.  If it is indeed discontinued, there is hope that people who are already enrolled may be grandfathered in...who knows.  My monthly payment under the PAYE plan will increase to approx 2100 per month the first year. 

3.  Participate in the 401(a) and then roll $5500 into a backdoor Roth IRA.  The remaining will stay in the 401(a).

4.  Participate in the 403(b), and contribute the max: 18k per year

5. Participate in the 457, and contribute the max: 17.5k per year

personalfinance,What are the cons of refinancing my auto loan?,"In September 2015 I replaced my old car that was breaking down on a monthly basis with a 2010 Toyota Corolla with 9,000 miles using a $12,050 @ 13.49% auto loan from USAA. I had just graduated from college and didn't really have a credit history at that time (besides ~$26,000 in Stafford loans) so I assumed that the high interest rate was just part of the game and I didn't question it or shop around. In retrospect I'm pretty sure I'm paying a generous amount of stupid tax for my lack of vigilance. 

I've spent the last several months building my credit with a Discover It Miles card (never carrying a balance) so that my current FICO score is somewhere in the neighborhood of 741.

personalfinance,I have enough in savings to pay off my student loan. What should I do?,"Hello all. I finally have enough in my savings and checking to pay off my student loan in full. Currently I owe 8k in student loans. I have 10k in savings and 2k in checking. 

My rent is 1500 a month. I make 75k a year. Would it be smart to just dump everything I have in order to eliminate my student loan forever? Or should I continue to pay the 300 a month I have allocated to pay for the loan? I believe my interest rate on my loan is 7%.

I grew up fairly poor so having money in the bank is comforting. However, having a student loan on your back sucks. 

Any advice would help!

personalfinance,Investing/tax help for a widow,"Hi all,

Throw away for obvious reasons. My husband passed away 4 years ago. He was heavily invested in stocks, and while successful over the course of his life, towards his later years his investments suffered.  

As we have been unwinding poor performing positions over the years, we added to the losses that existed at the time of his death. As a result, I am left with a nearly $500,000 capital loss carry-forward. I have no idea how I can use this during my lifetime. It's not as though one can ""create"" capital gains.  And dividends of course are treated as ordinary income. 

I have approximately 1.2M in investable assets. Roughly half of this amount is  in tax deferred or tax exempt accounts.  How can I allocate my assets to secure a retirement and take advantage of the capital loss carry-forward?  Investing in stocks, even in something such as an index fund, may not be great because stocks have been performing so well over the past few years and I feel like a drop is going to be right around the corner.  Alternatively, bonds, traditionally the ""safe-haven"" are maybe not so safe because interest rates may be moving higher. 

Any ideas on how to best allocate these assets? Are there any other ""subreddits I should post to? I am also somewhat leery of using an investment advisor as I think they are likely to use my account to generate fees and might possibly take advantage of me as a widow.  Maybe those fears are overblown but I just don't feel like I would have any power or control if I turned my assets over. 

Summary: 500k of capital loss carryforward, 1.2M in investable assets. Age 62. How do I use the capital loss carryforward?

personalfinance,"Recently out of College, financially clueless, and trying to get a grasp on how to deal with student loans/living expenses in general","Hello! I'm 22 years old and this past December I decided that college wasn't for me anymore. In 2014 I graduated with my Associate's in Culinary Arts but had absolutely no interest in pursuing culinary, especially because of my sometimes crippling anxiety. If any of you have worked in the restaurant industry, you might know why having anxiety doesn't really work in that enviornment.

Anyway, after I decided not to continue my bachelors in Culinary, I decided to enroll in another college for Special Education. All of this was funded by Sallie Mae loans that my parents cosigned and federal loans that I was given through financial aid. So basically after failing miserably for a year and a half, partly due to my mental health issues that I had no grasp on, I decided to quit college and focus on working and figuring myself out.

I've worked part time all throughout school but all that money just went towards living expenses, I haven't made enough or used my money responsibly enough to gather a great savings. So I have virtually no savings.

I currently live in the state I went to school in, and I work part time as a dog bather for a big box pet store making minimum in my state (which is $10 an hour, averaging 250-275 a week). In August they are sending me to grooming academy which lasts 4 weeks, but upon finishing I will be promoted to fulltime. I'll still be making about $10 an hour bbut I'll get 40 hours a week until I complete my first 100 dogs (about 4-6 weeks), then I will make 40% commission on each groom. After another 100 dogs (another 4-6 weeks) I'll be an official groomer and make 50% commission on each dog.

As far as my loans go, I owe $39000 from 4 seperate Sallie Mae loans, all with about 9-10% interest. I'm still in grace period until 7/13 but I have no idea what my minimum payments will be. I also don't know if I'll have to make seperate payments on each loan or if its just one payment towards the 39,000 total. I'm not sure where to get this information.

For my federal loans I owe 17,500 with an interest of 4.6% and a minimum payment of $190 per month. It says I'm still in grace but I'm not sure sure when that starts. I'm guessing it starts in July because that's when my Sallie mae starts but I'm not sure.

My living expenses are pretty much budgeted, I'm still not great with budgetting as I'm often impulsive with my buying. I'm getting better with the help of my bf but still not where I want to be. But my other big expenses are $500 a month for rent utilities included for the apartment me and my bf share, and $219 a month for my car. I don't have any credit cards because I honestly don't trust myself. And my credit is crap due to my past habit of paying my bills late.

So all in all, I really need help making sense of all this and advice on repayment and also how I can better save my money. I'm in a weird spot in life because I'm only part time right now, but so close to getting full time and making commission. Please help, I'm so new to all this ""being and adult"" stuff and I'm just so clueless.


p.s. I have a feeling that some may suggest moving back home and living with my parents but that is really not an option for me so keep that in mind please.",finance,1464796099

personalfinance,"Should I refinance a car that I own outright, in order to get a low interest loan to pay off credit card?","Hi personalfinance,
I've learned SO MUCH from this subreddit but haven't found the answer to this particular question. I own a 2011 Corolla, don't have plans to sell it, and don't owe any money on it. Due to some unexpected circumstances, I've racked up about $10,000 in credit card debt.  I have good credit (~800), always make payments, have a steady income, and can and will pay off my debt. However, that will take a while, so I'd love to save some money on the interest.

Someone has asked me why I don't re-finance my Corolla through a local credit union that offers 1.75% car loans, and use the money to pay off most of the credit card balance. Then I would just pay off the car loan instead and save buttloads on interest. The credit union also offers debt consolidation loans at 12.99%, which I had been looking into doing originally. 

In theory refinancing the car sounds great- I'd basically be reducing my interest rate from 18% to 1.75%. I've read online that this route is not recommended, but usually because the person looking to do this is in a tough financial position and at risk of losing their car to the bank- which I am not, I've never missed a minimum payment so I'll be paying the credit card company or the credit union for sure either way.

personalfinance,Interest Hike on Fixed Rate Student Loans,"I received a note from my private student loan lender, Discover, that the interest rate on my loans were increased. Each of my 5 loans received a 0.25% increase (originally 2.5-3%, now 2.75-3.25%). In the grand scheme of things, this is just a couple of dollars a month. But my loans are not variable rate loans. These loans were disbursed in 2005-2006, I believe, my first year of undergrad.

I found a website stating that the Federal Reserve increased interest rates which would increase variable rate loans, but again mine has been fixed for the past 10 years. I have been focused on paying off my grad school loans (6.5%) even though they are federal loans.

Haven't had a chance to contact Discover, but curious if anyone else experienced this? All the email stated was ""The interest rate on one or more of your private student loans has changed due to either a change to the associated pricing index or due to a change in a borrower benefit.""

This is what it says about the TCA account:

The MetLife TCA is a settlement option offered by MetLife  for the payment of claims. A MetLife TCA is not a checking, savings, or money market bank account. **Since your MetLife TCA is not a bank account, it is not insured by the FDIC or any government agency.** Instead, MetLife guarantees the full amount in your MetLife TCA, inclinding all interest earned. MetLife's guarantee is further backed by your respective state insurance guaranty associatation. Maximum guarantee limits vary from state to state and may change over time. 

The MetLife TCA offers you a minimum guaranteed annual effective interest rate, meaning that MetLife commits to pay you at least that specified rate of interest on the money in the account. You begin earning interest the day the MetLife TCA is created. Interest is earned daily, but is not credited until the last day of the month. The interest rate offered on the MetLife TCA may be better or worse than the prevailing market rates. The MetLife TCA is a product offered by MetLife on which the company may make a profit. You pay no monthly maintenance fees on a MetLife TCA.

You have complete control of, and access to, the entire amount of the money of your insurance proceeds. **You can withdraw the full amount from the MetLife TCA at any time.**

I have been sitting on undergrad student loan debt since graduating college just over 5 years ago. I've been super dedicated to saving since I was in high school and have just about $41k in my savings right now. 

Here is the breakdown of my current financial life:

Salary: $44k
Rent: $900/month
403b: 5% (which my employer matches)
Other expenses (cell, internet, public trans, insurance): around $400/month

My student loan debt is at about $23k right now, at a 6% interest rate. I've been meticulous about paying it every month, but the amount I've been able to pay has varied; currently, I pay about $300 a month. 

My question is: should I take the $23k from my savings and throw the entire amount at my loan? That would only leave me with about $18k, which would be a pretty significant loss. I'm not saving for anything in particular at the moment (although it would be AMAZING to be in a position to consider buying a house...) but am very comforted by the $41k in my savings. I have about $3k in my 403b (haven't been contributing for that long, and only just upped my contribution to 5% to match my employer), which I consistently seem to forget counts as savings, as well.

Suppose that:

 1) you believe that the market is due for a bad run broadly, a global recession; and

2) you are bumping up against the maximum contribution limit in your 401(k) - currently $18,000.


Wouldn't the following strategy make sense?

1) Take out a loan for the maximum allowed by your 401(k) plan/provider

2) Deposit the loan in a high-yield savings account and earn a meager 1.0%

3) Pay-back the 401(k) loan as required, buying the market all the way down as you repay, and contributing more than $18,000 because of the interest payment required.



I am aware not all plans allow a loan for no reason, and that the term and interest rate vary.  But suppose you could get a 2-year loan and you anticipated a bear market for the entire 2-years.

I have $500 a month to address my overall debt of 6158.59 and basically my question is; how do I split those $500 now that both cards are going to have interest charged.

Bonus: Are there any cards that I could take advantage of and transfer any balances to? Would I benefit from a loan? My credit score is at about a 620 because my cards are practically maxed out; Citi has a $2800 credit line, $2500 for Quicksilver and $1000 for Chase Slate and I have no balance on a $2500 credit line at Nordstrom for their Retail Card.",finance,1464815309

personalfinance,Tax credits and qualifying for them,"I'm looking at a scenario where I may have goofed on something.  Looking to seek clarification on whether or not I have shot myself in the foot here.

The government is offering 30% tax credit on solar panel installs.  So, I ponied up and got the install done.  I also have a reservation in for a Tesla Model 3.  In reviewing posts on /r/teslamotors a lot of folks are mentioning that the tax credits are based on tax liability, and as such not everyone will qualify for the tax credits.

Being that I now have a 10k incentive on the line, I dug into it more to gain a better understanding.  In doing some searching online I was able to find the following:

https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2719896-what-does-tax-liability-mean-is-that-the-amount-i-still-owe

Which states which line on your tax return from the previous year indicates your tax liability, and what I presume is what the tax credit will refund from.  Problem is that when I look at line 39 from my 1040A tax return from last year, it says that my ""total tax"" is about 1500.

Based on that information, am I correct in assuming that I will not see the 10k credit from the solar install?  Additionally, that I would not qualify for the full $7500 from buying the Model 3?

If I'm reading this correctly, the education tax credit I qualify for since I'm in school, and the child credits I get for having kids basically ate up the bulk of my liability.

tl;dr:  Line 39 of my 1040A says my total tax was around $1500 last year, does that mean I can receive a max of $1500 in tax credits?",finance,1464820609
personalfinance,The trick to credit,"A thing people mistake about credit is, it's about people who can pay it back. Well, yes, but. That's a really big ""but"".

A credit company is in business to make money, of course. It does them no good if you always pay the bills on time. They want you to pay the bills but, they also expect to clip their cut out of it.

There are two rules to getting a good credit history, so that they'll be happy to give you more credit.

One: have a credit history! (There are places that will loan you money at outrageous interest rates, to get you started. Try Fingerhut!)

Two: use credit! Lightly! They will be somewhat alarmed if you use any substantial amount of what they said they'd be willing to loan you. Still... use what you need, but ALWAYS PAY AT LEAST THE MINIMUM ON TIME.

Credit companies love this. It means you're a reliable customer who is making them money. Eventually, you will want to try to avoid using credit but, you establish it by creating a credit history that loses you money, which is fine by them, because that's their business.

As you develop a credit history (read: have a history of losing money to outlandish interest rates), your credit rating will go up. You will get higher credit levels. Try to use it, but not much: you want to keep losing money to them, so pay them off, but slowly and steadily. This builds credit history.

When you have enough credit history, you can switch to new credit sources, which may offer cash-back or other rewards, as well as lower interest rates. Don't cancel your old credit lines, just don't use them any more. The fact that they exist and have existed for a while is a point in your favor (within reason: if you have grossly excessive unused credit, that can count against you).

I am fond of Credit Karma as a rough check as to how I am doing. You might also try annualcreditreport.com as a free way to grab all of your credit reports from the Big Three credit monitors, but it's only free once a year (usually, depending), and it can be iffy getting through the verification process, which isn't that bright.",finance,1464821350
personalfinance,"How are ""investment returns"" for 1, 3, 5, or 10 years calculated?","I'm a NYC teacher and we have Tax Deferred Annuity.  In essence we put money pre-tax into a retirement fund and we can choose where to put these funds.  This is optional and separate from our pension plan.  Two of the options are a Fixed Return fund of 7% (not sure how this is possible) and a Socially Responsive Equity fund which has performed at 10.24% over the past 3 years.  I believe that a fixed return of 7% is quite amazing (thanks to compound interest) and put a majority of my money into that fund but my co-worker said that the Socially Responsive Fund has better historical performance.  


I've read a few different ways of how ""annual returns"" are calculated (geometric mean, arithmetic mean, CARG...) and see similar performance results posted on index funds.  So how are they typically calculated? Which fund would be more reliable over 25-30 years?

Glossary:  https://www.trsnyc.org/ASPENMemberPro/Account/glossary


Fixed Return Fund:  One of the Passport Funds (TRS' investment choices). This fund offers a guaranteed rate of return set by the New York State Legislature in accordance with applicable laws. The current annual rate is 7% for TDA investments of members who are serving in (or resigned/retired from) titles represented by the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) and 8.25% for other investments.


Socially Responsive Equity Fund: One of the Passport Funds (TRS' investment choices). This fund invests in stocks of large and mid-cap U.S. and non-U.S. companies that meet certain financial and social criteria. It seeks companies that show leadership in areas such as environmental concerns, diversity in the workforce, progressive employment, and workplace practices. The fund attempts to avoid companies that derive substantial revenue from alcohol, tobacco, nuclear power, or weapons. The objectives are to achieve, over a full market cycle, positive long-term capital growth and to earn a rate of return comparable to the return of the broader equity market while reflecting social priorities.


Explanation of TDA from a blogger: http://chaz11.blogspot.com/2016/01/with-new-year-think-about-increasing.html

&gt; The new year has started and I am shocked how little some educators contribute to their TDA.  In the school I am in now, I had to encourage some teachers to put in money into their TDA.  A few who did have money in their TDA had allocated less than 5% of their paycheck.  Ihis post is my recommendation to educators on why its important to contribute as much as you can to your TDA contribution.

&gt; First, the minimum I recommend for educators is to contribute 10% of your paycheck.  Yes, I know that 10% seems like a lot but it really is not 10% because you save on taxes,  If you live in New York City, educators will be paying a combined 27% tax rate (15% federal and 12% state and local).  Therefore if an educator contributes, say $10,000 to their TDA from their paycheck, they will save $2,700 from their taxes. That's right, because the $10,000 will not be taxed and even if you take the money out after you turn 55 years of age and reside in New York State only the federal government taxes need to be paid as the TDA is exempt from State and Local taxes.

&gt; Second, the TDA money is taken out in 24 checks annually and you can adjust your take home pay to minimize the pain since you will be taxed on a lower salary.  For example, the $10,000 will result in a $417 reduction per paycheck. However, since your salary that is taxed is also reduced by 10%, the $2,700 reduction in taxes will allow you to recover $113 per paycheck.  Therefore, the actual reduction in take home pay is $304 per paycheck.

&gt; Third, remember, the TDA contributions are tax deferred and accumulate interest for the decades during your working career without being taxed and will be exempt from State and City taxes if you decide to live in New York State when you retire and withdraw the TDA funds.

&gt; Finally, at retirement, you have at least three choices for your TDA.  You can make it an annuity, convert it to the fixed income fund and which gives you 7% interest (UFT titles) or 8,25% (non UFT titles) and take the interest, or take a fixed sum annually based upon your wants or needs.while keeping an asset allocation that allows you to combat the eroding effects of inflation.

&gt; Once, you start putting in the 10%, then increase your contribution rate annually by 2%, after receiving a raise.  By the time you retire you will probably max out your yearly TDA contribution ($18,000 or $24,000 if you are 50 years of age or older).  The end result of the ""short-term pain for the long-term gain""will be you may end up a millionaire with or even without your pension or Social Security. What a wonderful thought.

gaming,Theory: Super mario brothers was all over unpaid work,"We all know the game, Mario has to stop all the bad guys in front of him to save the Princess from the evil Bowser.  But why would a plumber be in the princess rescue business?  How did he know the exact layout of each castle necessary to to get to the specific spot where the Princess was supposed to be hiding?  Only one answer.  This wasn't a rescue mission, Mario did all the plumbing work for Princess Peach and she stiffed him.  He's not there to rescue her.  He's got a lien against her and he's coming to collect.

This explains all the shiny tubing every where in the kingdom.  The Princess needed a brand new sewer system installed in her kingdom and Mario did an extremely thorough job.  When it came time for her to pay up, instead she locked herself in a castle and hired Bowser as her personal bodyguard and his private security contractors to keep Mario from collecting the massive amount of money owed for the plumbing contract.  Bowser has all these minions working for him and doesn't think to put one in the same room of the woman he's supposed to be holding hostage?  That's because she's not a hostage.  She's just in her little safe room behind a drawbridge and a locked door so the contractor she just gave a bad check to can't get to her.

Every time you beat a castle and there's the little spud telling you ""The princess is in another castle!""  They aren't helping.  They are begging for their lives.  You've just stiffed a pissed off Italian plumber who WILL get the money owed.  You think Toad is going to be obstinate or is he going to give up his boss that just left him hanging as a lure to the pissed off Mario?  

So what's more likely, a giant turtle guy kidnaps a princess and seven of her little sycophants all to take over some piddly little country with no real assets, or some stingy little princess gets a bunch of contract work done and when its time to settle up she stiffs the plumber?  Super Mario Brothers was no rescue adventure, it was the story of a working man trying to get the money he was owed, and nothing was going to get between him and the stuck up princess that welched on him.",technology,1464832803

personalfinance,I have $10K saved and don't need it for 8 months. Are there better options than leaving it in the bank? (NZ),"Hi PF, first of all I just wanted to say thanks. I've been lurking here for a long time and thanks to all your helpful suggestions I've gone from having 2K in CC debt at the beginning of the year, to now having $10K in savings!

The current situation: I'm planning to move from New Zealand to Canada in March/April 2017. I'm currently saving about $1300-1500/month and will continue to do so until I leave. 

My question: is there anything I could do with that $10K now that would be better than leaving it in a savings account? 
The highest interest rate on a savings account that I can see is 2.83% P/A - paid monthly.
I've had a look at some term deposits and the highest I can see is 3.10% on a 6 month deposit which is obviously slightly better, but really we're talking about $35 difference on a 10K investment.
I could happily continue to contribute the amount I'm currently saving each month into an investment, but given the fact that I'll need it in about 8 months time I'm not sure how that would work? Also I'll likely need to start using that additional savings to pay for things like flights/visa/insurance etc. Any advice would be awesome!

Also probably worth noting: I have $26K in student loan debt. While I'm in NZ this is completely interest free, however as soon as I leave the country interest starts to accumulate. The current interest rate is 4.8% and will remain at that until 31 March 2017.",finance,1464837153

investing,"Bond ETFs, help me understand this :P","Okay, so.

I've gotten a grasp of everything so far. But I want to balance out my portfolio just a little more with Bond ETFS (Probably gonna go with BND for this one).

If I understand this correctly, say I buy 20 shares BND valued at $100 per share. This equates to $2,000 as an initial value.

As I hold these bonds, I get paid monthly due to on-going maturity.

Similarly, as interest rates rise, the ETFs prices will fall and vice versa.

Here's the thing I don't understand. Using the example above, let's say the bond's price went down to $90. And if I sell my 20 shares, I sell it for $1,800. This means I get a $200 loss in total.

So basically my principal payment is entirely dependent on the ETF's price.

personalfinance,Safe investment for car money,"I am going to medical school in a place where I can't bring my truck. However, in 2 years when I'm doing clinical rotations I will need a car at that point to get around. 

I am thinking of selling my truck (worth ~$25,000) since I won't be using it during the first 2 years of basic sciences, and the value will just continue to depreciate. My school will be financed through graduate financial aid - Stafford and Federal Plus Loans -and there might be a possibility that I could just use the truck money to pay my first semesters tuition and use financial aid to later buy a car, but I think it would be smart to have the cash set aside to buy a car if I need it in a hurry/emergency. 

What is a safe way to invest $25,000 for 2 years and earn decent interest? Is this a good idea? Should I just let the value depreciate for the 2 years and keep the truck somewhere, or sell it and pay off my first semesters tuition so I don't have interest accruing?

So I am a University student who has saved up $5,000. I am looking to maximize my saving so that when the time comes I can pay off my student debt quickly. For the summer I am currently working three jobs hoping to save up for rent and expenses next semester. From reading these pages I have looked into credit unions who have a far better interest rate on savings at .07%, .10% and .05%. I was curious to know if anyone has ever used a credit union not specific to their location whom has a better interest rate? I did a quick search and found some that are 1%, 1.5% etc.. ! I also plan on opening up an online bank account with ally as many have suggested, so in the end i'll have three accounts my main checking, an ally savings, and a credit union savings. Currently I have three accounts with just one bank as a checking, second checking (second savings) and a lifetime/emergency savings Thoughts?  Thank you!",finance,1464880660

I am in a situation in which I have some credit card debt to pay off, I have a lump sum that will allow me to pay about half of it off, and then I'd like to chip away at the balance over the next 12 months or so.

I did a balance transfer with Discover several years ago and had a good experience so I'd like to do it again. However, I owe a big chunk on the discover and it has a lower interest rate than the other card. 

What I would like to do is pay off the discover, then do a balance transfer back to the discover to pay off the other card. At this moment I have no balance transfer option on my discover, I assume because I am near the limit). What I am wondering is if I pay it off will the balance transfer option become available again? (In the past they have almost always had 18 months 0% APR available when my utilization was lower?

What I don't want to happen is to pay the discover off - then not have any promotional balance transfer opportunities open up and be stuck paying off the higher interest card over the longer time frame.",finance,1464882052

&gt;(for example, Sweden and Argentina might be usable, over a long time comparison, to represent comparable “economic civilizations”.)

For about a year or so that I've been checking my score was around 735. I have two credit cards, one I don't use and keep at $0, unless I miss place my other card then pay it off right away. I typically use my Citi Thank You card for almost every purchase. I've recently had about a 30-35% usage rate I'm trying to lower. But it didn't seem to affect my rate much. I have a mountain of student loans from Sallie Mae that had to be cosigned and under my parents name. My dad is a saint and in order to help me out, has been slowly chipping away at that debt since I started school (~$70g left to go, I graduated last year). Since I got a steady job I have been helping him pay this off as well. 

Which brings me to my issue today: I completely forgot/didn't think about my federal loans that were in MY name. I guess I didn't have to start payment until November 07 2015, which came to my surprise when I checked my CreditKarma and my score was at 566! I was devastated and was so confused because I thought he had everything connected and automatically taken out of his bank account. This is when I realized these are those random $3,000-$4000 loans I was offered through the financial office I had once accepted not thinking much of it as a college student and that it was solely under my name. I had some random emails from Navient but they seemed spammy like ""Deffer payments now!"" so I didn't think much of it. Until I saw this, freaked out and called them. I don't remember the term they used but essentially they started me over with payments, so I'm technically starting this month. The first withdraw will be taken out of my account tomorrow. I then went on CreditKarma to try to dispute this, clicking ""I've never missed a payment"" and ""Creditor took off late charges"" (which I think was accurate, right?). So long story short, is there a chance that my score will go back to normal? Or am I screwed for the next 7 years? Also this was technically 4 different loans. So that's 4 different missed payments, I think?

TL;DR: Had good credit score. CheckedKarma, realized I was in delinquency on student loans I didn't realize I hadn't started paying. Score went way down. Started my payments from this month instead of November, so I disputed with TransUnion through CK. Still waiting to hear back. Am I screwed for the next 7 years?",finance,1464883791

(everything I put in parenthesis are my words)



""China's lunar exploration project refers to March 2003 by the China National Space Administration announced the official start of the lunar exploration program.  ""

-------


Since then they have launched satelites and performed extensive research with regards to having unmanned vehicles on the moon.

Ouyang is the man in charge of China's lunar exploration project.  

Ouyang (proudly) stimulate (simulated) the first artificial Earth satellite.

(Hi, I am Ouyang.  We are very upset that the only thing given to us from Earth traveling to the moon 6 times are various moon rocks with no information as far as their origin.)

""I carefully took 0.5 grams for research, in addition half sent to Beijing Planetarium hope our people can see for themselves a part of the moon, ""Ouyang went on to say:"".. this study only 0.5 grams of stone, we made ​​a total of 40 articles, we finally confirmed the stone is ' Apollo 17 ' acquisition and confirmed the collection sites, and even confirm whether there are areas where stone sunlight and so on. "" 

------

(In 1997, I, Ouyang, proposed that we perform a rocket launch to the moon in order to boost morale, with all the political tourmoil regarding Hong Kong.  My idea was shot down though, because the government overturned the idea on the basis that there would be ""no scientific value."")

Article title: (Let the moon bear chinese footprints.)

(I was very excited when I performed an analysis on a meteorite which fell in Inner Mongolia, but that fell in 1960.  This is what started my journey into the exploration of lunar meteorites.  To be honest, ever since the Soviet Union launched the first man-made satellite to orbit earth in 1957, I studied geology [date unknown whether he started at that point or before].   Every since I was a young boy though, I always dreamed about what kind of an epic journey it would be to study the moon.  For example, why can't it be filled with life the way that earth is? )

(even back in 1994, I deeply longed for the United States to share knowledge that would aid us in our effort.  Look, we really need to do this now.)

""Apollo "" moon has passed 35 years, and now they plan to re-manned lunar landing in 2015, the European Space Bureau announces the implementation of a manned lunar landing in 2020, India has also announced the launch lunar satellite in 2007. Therefore, we must seize the time to accelerate research in this area, for the Chinese people Zhengkou Qi. "" 

(getting international technical assistance from other countries is like pulling a diamond from a coal mine.  A long protracted effort.  But the diamonds would be so worth it.)

""Ouyang said lunar exploration project is significant, this is a can not do the job. He said that all countries of the lunarvery concerned about China's lunar exploration is difficult to obtain international technical assistance from other countries.
Ouyang said: Because lunar exploration is a country 's comprehensive national strength reflects, for improving the country's international prestige, enhance our national cohesion are meaningful. Moreover, the lunar exploration of our country to achieve manned space flight and after the application of satellite and a new milestone, but also a symbol of the national high-tech development.""

(Hello.  I am the Chinese government.  This man has put his entire life into dedicated research and that is not a small statement.)

-----------
(Hello. I am Ouyang.  I really had to keep my research secret.  My family knew what I did only in a general sense but without specifics.  They had guessed over time.  The real value of being amongst them was the emotional bond I received towards the importance of this project.  I would bring raisins when visiting my family and it spectacularly helped motivate me.)

""Anatoly Perminov, head of the Russian Federal Space Agency, revealed in September 2006 in RIA Novosti that Russia and China were working on lunar exploration as partners, and that the Russian-Chinese Space Sub-Commission's priority was to conclude a joint lunar exploration agreement by the end of that year.[11][needs update] ""

I'm now making a pretty good salary, my housing costs are low, I'm maxing out my retirement match, and starting to save more, as well as contribute to a down payment fund with my fiancee, wedding in November, which we're paying for ourselves - which will require us to dip into our savings.

So the question is I have only federal loans outstanding, as of today I have a balance of 21,354.84, with interest rates varying from 6.55% to 2.07%.

I used a snowball/avalanche calculator to weigh the options and looking for input.

If I remain on my current schedule, I'll complete paying off all loans by June 2021, 5 more years. So on to the questions:

* Current Schedule: $2,115.24 more paid in interest - Paid off June 2021.
* An extra $250 a month: $1,100.42 more paid in interest - Paid off March 2019.
* An extra $350 a month: $938.25 more paid in interest - Paid off November 2018.

In order for your employer's plan to pass this year's test, we have been instructed to return a portion of the contributions made to the plan on your behalf.
&gt;
&gt;Enclosed is a check for the contributions, plus any earnings attributable to those contributions.  These contributions, plus any earnings, are subject to ordinary federal, and, if applicable, state income tax for calendar year 2016, and will need to be reported on your 2016 personal federal, and, if applicable state, income tax returns.
&gt;
&gt;The distribution will be reported by the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099-R.  This Form 1099-R will be sent to you by January 31, 2017.

&gt;Should you have any questions regarding the taxation of this distribution, please contact your tax advisor for assistance. If you have any additional questions about this distribution, please contact your employer or call Customer Service.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Benefits Administration

Included with the check was a summary of totals.  This outlined the ~$4,590 (pre-tax) which was withdrawn, the ~$460 IRS withholding (10% early withdrawal penalty), and the total check amount of ~$4,130.

Since I am in my late 20's this has the potential to be tens of thousands of dollars (6% interest rate + ~35 years = nearly $40k) by the time I retire.

I definitely have not deposited the check (as I don't want it and I don't want to implicitly agree to this withdrawal).

**So, my question is: Is it legal for anyone except me to request an early withdrawal from my 401k?**
Being forced to withdrawal feels a lot like extortion.

**What can I do to get the 401k retirement company to reverse this withdrawal and return the funds to my account?**

At the time they gave me two options:

1) Pay back the total amount due

2) Make payments (175/month) until the balance is paid in full. The balance due is subject to a very small interest rate. Something like .01% - basically nothing

&amp;nbsp;


I took option 2 since I obviously didn't have 25k to drop and have been paying since. I have an ~21K balance left and they recently presented me with an offer to pay ~7K and have the rest of the balance forgiven. I would be taxed at my income rate on the difference though (25% of ~14K = 3.5K). So I'd basically be saving 10.5K on the balance.

I've got ~25K sitting in my 401k and I'm wondering if its a good idea to take 7k loan (@ 5.5%) from it and pay the debt back and get it removed from my credit report.

~25K in 401K (as mentioned above)

~30K in cash (not including emergency fund)

~30K in other student debts (federal student loans)

personalfinance,Can I contribute to a 401(k) other than the one provided by my employer?,"I live in Michigan, and I earn $82,000 pre-tax, Which I believe puts me in the 25% tax bracket for federal. I have no debt. My employer only matches up to $1,000 if I contribute $5,000 to my 401(k). 

My plan would be to put $5k into the employer's 401(k) for their match, and then max out my IRA. I know that the guidelines on the Wiki suggests to top up the remaining 401k ($13,000 in my case) with my employer. However, the employer goes through Principal Financial, which has pretty high expenses. Almost everything has an expense of around 1%. The cheapest is the US Large Cap 500 at 0.53%.

My question is, can I contribute to an alternative retirement investment with the remaining $13,000 pre-tax? Can I contribute to another 401k, such as Vanguard's? Or would my only suitable option be just investing the money as an individual and buy ETFs, mutual funds, etc?",finance,1464911537
financialindependence,Just Want To Make Sure I'm On The Right Path for FIRE,"I know you all see a ton of these posts, probably daily, but I'd really like some feedback to make sure I'm headed down the correct path or at least know that I'm not now so I have time to change it. I'm going to post a little about myself and what my current status is so you can provide some feedback - I'd really appreciate it!

My S/O and I just graduated college in December - we both just turned 22 a few months ago. I work in the financial industry, and currently make $40k a year salary. My employer has a 4% match that I take full advantage of, and additionally contributes 10% of my salary a year to my employer plan on top of the match. My S/O makes $35k a year in the digital media sector - her employer doesn't have a company match, so she's setting aside 4% for now just to have something for retirement until we pay some debts down and can increase that. Not that great I know, but we're entry level and I know the ceiling is high on my career down the road. We're in Charlotte, NC, so COL isn't the cheapest but isn't terrible.

Currently, our assets look like this: we have about $62k in student loans - I have $37k myself, and she has $25k. All federal loans, about $9k worth at 6.8%, 5k at 5%, and the rest are 4.7 and below. Our minimum payments come out to about $350 per month. After rent, utilities, fuel, groceries, etc. our leftover monthly income is around $900. We started some emergency funds and have about $1500 each in a Barclays Dream High Yield Savings Account paying 1.05% APY. We also have about $5k in our checking accounts total, and about $1200 in some brokerage accounts invested in things like stock market ETFs.  My plan was to put $400 aside in savings per month - $200 each, $100 in each Barclays account and $100 into each brokerage account. Aside from the student loan debt, other expenses on the table are there's a car that we're upside down on - the car is worth about $7k and still owe $11k on it. Not our choice - her mom bought the car with a 21% interest rate (yeah, I know. She has no clue how money works and just pulls the trigger) and now we're stuck with it. At some point, I'd also like to get a ring - we've been together a couple years and have been living together for most of that time. At some point it's likely I'll need to move to another location to advance my career seeing as how I'm not in the main offices where most of the jobs are, and I'm sure she'll want some level of commitment to come with me which is understandable. 

I'd like some insight into what order my priorities should be in, and if I'm even on the right path. I have wanted to be FIRE for some time now, even though I'm only 22. I dream of the days where I can wake up and just enjoy my day without feeling constricted or obligated to work just to pay off debts. Should I attack loans first? Work towards getting out from under the car payment? The car will need to be replaced at some point, and I'm looking at a quality used car. Should I save for a ring while I'm at it, or deal with that after? Also, any side gigs I could do to add money around my schedule would be great so toss those out as well.

I just need some guidance - neither of our parents have ever been financially responsible and I don't intend on heading down their paths. I've read these forums for a while, but I'll be the first to admit I'm a Reddit rookie as far as I'm concerned and just want some input on my specific situation. Thanks to all who comment in advance!

EDIT: if this falls more into Personal Finance, let me know - again, I'm a rookie so the more I learn, the better.",finance,1464915562
personalfinance,What kind of federal student loan should I choose?,"Hello Everyone! 

I am attending a private university in the US, and I am thinking about taking a student loan to help me in the present and the future. There appears to be many types of federal student loans, and I'm not sure which one is right for my situation. 

-I am on active duty in military, and I want to take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. This is the main reason I am thinking about taking out a loan. I wouldn't have to pay now, and I would only pay until the loan is forgiven. Which by my estimation would be a fraction of the principle+interest.  

-The total sum of my loans would be no more than $100,000

-I have no debt, and I am good with finances on a common sense level.  

I apologize if this is not enough information to have my question correctly answered; I will provide any ancillary details needed to aid you guys.  

I have seen a lot of great things come out of this sub, I thought I would ask your opinion on the matter.

personalfinance,"Really simple things I have done for my personal finances in 2016. Anyone can do some, or all, of these things.","***edited to address somr of thr most common comments i am getting :)

Clarity - I am in Canada not the USA. I am a female.  Late 20's. Small rural community on an island. 

In my early 20's I made many foolish decisions financially. I grew up poor and didn't know anything about money. Now that I am in my later 20's I am paying the price. Literally. 
So I started working on ways to save money, make more money, make my life simpler, live within my means, and work towards eliminating a certain portion of my debt and possibly consolidating the rest in a debt counseling program.
But mainly what this post is about are some simple ways to help people get started, or make a difference.
Maybe you have thought of some already, maybe not, but if this helps anyone out even a little, then it is worth my time typing it up!

In no particular order, these are some steps I have taken since the beginning of 2016. For clarity, I am a Canadian woman. 

~switched to a no-fees bank account, that also pays interest. So I save money, and I make a little extra from the interest. Every dollar counts. 
My old bank was charging me $14.95/month for my checking and savings account. No interest paid. Charged for checks, and charged for services such as a Stop Payment.
My new bank (Tangerine) charges $0/month for my checking and savings. They pay a small amount of interest on balances in checking and savings. First book of checks are free. 1 free stop payment a year.
Overall this saves me about $200 a year give or take. And i am not sure what the interest will be but more than 0 so it is good.

~Called both of my credit card companies and asked for the lowest possible interest rate. Both were able to do so. 
Card #1 lowered my interest rate from 19% down to 11%. 
Card #2 lowered my interest rate from 19% to 11.9% with a once yearly fee of $60. Just goes to show you it never hurts to ask. Communication is key. ***Most companies would rather help you, or make a payment agreement with you, than pursue your account and send it to collections &lt;---- they will lose money if they do this.

~Went meatless. Look it's not that hard. It is so much less expensive. Fresh fruit and vegetables are cheaper than meat where I live. Yes I get more than enough protein and I am incredibly healthy and fit. I can make many delicious meals. 
You also tend to spend less going out to eat because there aren't as many options. This is a good thing. Good for your health and your wallet. No fast food. No chain restaurants. I REALIZE THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE OK THANK YOU :) but it can help some people.

~Sell items I don't need or want. 2 Lululemon hoodies. Dirtbike gear that I likely would not use again. Etc. Used the money for sensible things like groceries and my overdue credit card bill.

~Get a cheaper cell phone plan! Another one of those ""at least you can ask"" scenarios where your provider may give you a deal if you've been a customer for a long time. If they don't, shop around until you find a good deal. The BEST times of the year to do this are ""back to school"" (late aug - late sept), or Black Friday (this is usually a whole weekend of deals in store and online), and Christmas. Often $0 phone deals, good plans, extra data especially around back to school. You can also search online for deals.

~this one may not be for everyone but I needed a bed, and I did a lot of research... ended up buying a hammock and a stand instead of a mattress and frame. OK WAIT. I know it sounds odd but... the whole setup was $250, *edit - i checked my receipts and it was $166.87 CAD. It saved me a lot of money. &amp; my back is fine thank you to the many commenter who were concerned about that. But there are entire countries where a hammock is normal for a bed and they all can still walk and function. I appreciate the concern however. Thank you all.

~take people up on their offers to help. Really, my friends and family have been great. They often offer help (I don't mean give me money) and I rarely take it. But this year I am trying to change my ways. A friend offered me a few months rent free in his apartment. It's fully furnished except the bedroom I'd be in. I accepted and am eternally grateful. For my birthday my dad offered instead of a tangible gift (I didn't want gifts anyways, and I am trying to cut down on ""stuff"") that he would pay off the remaining $500 on a student loan I took out in 2007 and had paid down from $10,000 down to $500 in 2016. That loan is now eliminated completely from my monthly bills.  This also isn't for everyone.

~Cancel your gym/yoga/pilates/karate memberships. You can do almost any workout at home using your computer and YouTube. Its free. I'm assuming you have the internet of course, but most do You can also make a one time investment in a dvd or two if you don't want to use up data or you'd rather use a TV and can't hook up your phone or laptop to it. You can fill old milk jugs with water and use them like kettlebells. You can do squats, lunges, jumping jacks, burpees, pushups, yoga, planks, and much more without any equipment at all. Maybe a mat and again that would be a 1 time investment. Sometimes if you can't cancel the agreement you can transfer it to someone else. I have done this in the past using Kijiji. This will save you on average $50/month, or $600/year. IF YOU ARE A GYM LOVER I GET IT OKAY :) You don't have to do this - I hope to re open a member ship when I can. It is a temporary money saving tactic for me. Best of luck on your gainz.

~Assess your car insurance. I went in to renew my insurance and was able to get it from $140/month to $109/month. I could save even more ($29 finance fee &amp; %2.5 interest) if I purchased the insurance all at once, and didn't pay through monthly installments, but I do not have that much cash set aside unfortunately. ***This reinforces the often pointed out fact in Personal Finance threads that having personal savings is just as important as paying down debt.

~Get a 2nd part time job. I am working 2 jobs with strange hours right now. So I have applied for 2 jobs in the hopes of getting another (3rd)one to supplement my income. One of the jobs is a part time overnight stock position - not terribly exciting or rewarding BUT it is not forever and it is extra money. The other job is only for 2 months but it pays well, working for the Federal Census (big survey Canada does to discover info about demographics). Fingers crossed. If I get neither of these positions then I will continue to apply for other similar ones and work as much as I can in my original job as well. So I am trying to bring in extra money. 

~change the way you give gifts. I am trying to give people less ""stuff""... consume less. So I sometimes make a donation to the SPCA in the name of the gift recipient. Or to a cause close to that person's heart depending on their individual personalities and life experiences. Or I buy some groceries and we make a meal together. Or have an ""everyone bring 10 bucks"" party and order as much vegetarian take out we can get with the total. (may have to adjust a bit depending on where you live but you get my drift) this is also not for everyone I get that. My circle is ok with this. Not everyone will be in the same boat. 

~make an honest budget. get out your calculator. Make all those columns and lines. Fill in every little thing. All your bills. All your vices. How much do you really spend on groceries? (Hint - look back through 1 month of bank statements, you can do that on any banking app, any mobile website for your bank, any paper bank statement) How much cash? where does it go? Gas stations for fuel? Get areal clear picture. It will help you. Remember, keep 10% minimum of every paycheck aside in a savings account for you - whichever one will give you the highest interest rate while still allowing you access to your funds (and I always have a few rolls of loonies and a few 20's stashed as well just in case) and incorporate that into your budget.

~consider seeing a non profit debt counselor. They can often help you lower or eliminate your interest and other fees, consolidate your debt into one monthly payment instead of spreading your money between all your debts and trying to just make the minimum payment on everything. *Note - some debts, such as student loans, are not eligible for this service. Please do the appropriate research.

~stay away from shopping malls and TV. Malls make you want ot spend money. Don't go places where the temptation will be great. TV commercials make you want to spend money. They are designed to do so. You don't need any of that crap. It is not as important as what you are saving and working so hard for. Opening your own business. Taking a program at College. Going on a trip. Being debt free. All of these things are more important than a new shirt or the latest shoes or KFC or the latest cell phone...

~Walk more. I have a car. But I live within a reasonable walk to a Loblaws Superstore (kind of like Wal Mart for those of you not in Canada) &amp; a pet supply store (for dog food). Save the gas. Save the wear &amp; tear on your car.

~if you're partnered, do free or very cheap dates. Fly kites somewhere cool. If you don't have a beach you might have a cliff or the roof of a bulding... flat roof... haha. Make a craft. Have a cook-off. Go for a walk where 1 of you is blindfolded and the other one has to guide you over obstacles. Do chin ups on the monkey bars. Go to an open mic night for music and atmosphere. Read aloud on the beach. Go for a drive somewhere to watch the sun set. Write down your goals and then burn them off a candle flame into the wind. You know just think outside of the box.
 (I am single and not interested in dating for a while when I'm sorting out my life so idk just suggestions)

Most of all just don't give up and keep making changes in small ways and you will get there. I was so hopeless a year ago and now I am starting to feel better. Things are starting to look up. I am still in a huge amount of debt but now I have made a dent in it and have a plan to continue doing so. I am able to sleep better at night knowing I am really doing everything I can think of to make my situation better and I am constantly looking for new ways and new ideas. 
Like I said not everyone can do all of these things but everyone can do at least 1 or 2 of these things, even right now, today, after reading this, you can do some of these things right away. Don't procrastinate. And keep your chin up.
=)

personalfinance,Stuck between a rock and a hard place.,"I'm in a really difficult financial bind right now. Before I give any back story let me start off by saying I know I got myself into this mess. I'm looking for help to get out, not judgement. 

Most pressing issue : My 2004 VW Beetle is dying. It is practically undriveable at this point. It's worth about $1.5 and I owe $5k on it roughly. I cannot afford to pay the $2k it'd cost to fix the car. 

I've been thinking my only other option is to buy a car and roll my negative equity into it. Unfortunately that's not something I've been able to qualify for as I have a large amount of credit card debt and a poor credit score (546).

As far as the debt, I'm seeking credit counseling at the moment about how to crawl out of that hole while making under $30,000 a year. 

But what can I do about a car? I have MAYBE $300 I could put down but the only loan I've qualified for is from roadloans.com with a hefty 21% interest rate. I really don't want to pay over $10,000 in interest on a car worth less than that... 

I don't have any family or friends to loan money or cosign a loan with me. I'm on my own in that. I'm afraid I'll lose my job if my car does and then I'll have no car and still a car payment, you know? 

Any help/advice on my immediate need for a working car would be so appreciated!",finance,1464919272

I've looked at the guide and want to make sure my plan is appropriate. I live in Virginia. My income is $32,000 (before taxes). I believe this should come out to something like $2,100 per month after taxes. I have $36,000+ in student loans (all federal, up to 6.8%) and $10,000 in savings.

**Monthly payments**

Rent (including utilities): **$450**

Food: **$250**

Transportation: **$250** (lease + gas, lease is over at the end of the year)

Student Loans: **$500** (minimum payment on all loans, then the rest on highest interest?)

Miscellaneous: **$200**

Savings: **$450** (into Ally 1% savings account, along with the $10k already saved)

---------------------------------------

Total = **$2,100**

I just started the grace period for my student loans, but I should probably begin payments earlier now that they're all accumulating interest, right?

personalfinance,Need advice: Lock in Current Mortgage Rate or Seek a Different Loan,"Hey gang, first time poster and longtime lurker.  I’m seeking some advice in my first home buying experience.  I found a house, put in an offer, and it was accepted.  I’m currently working with the bank to finalize the terms of my mortgage.  This is where I’ll need some advice.  Relevant information: I’m doing a conventional, 30 year fixed rate mortgage with 5% down (It’s only me buying this house).  My original loan estimate had a rate of 4.5% with 0 points and NO PMI.  I thought, “awesome this works for me.”  My loan officer kept asking me if I wanted to lock in my rate, however I was 1) unaware of why I would want to do that and 2) wondering if I could still haggle for a lower rate.  I spoke with my loan officer about getting a lower rate and low and behold, not only did my rate not go down, but it went up to 4.625% (still no PMI) with 0 points.  

Here’s my dilemma.  I can still swing the higher mortgage rate, but I think now the “no PMI” is not as effective and may not be beneficial.  I currently have a friend who is in the home buying process that is getting a rate of 3.65%, putting 5% down, but he does have to pay PMI.  I’ve been using the calculator at http://usmortgagecalculator.org/ and it looks like (entering in all the same data except for interest rate and PMI), I will end up paying more in interest, but less PMI (obviously) over time.  However, once I pay off 20% of my principal I can lose the PMI and my monthly payment will be lower.  

One more bit of information.  I have a chance to re-lock my rate one more time before I close.  So, if the rates happen to go down, I can get a lower rate.

I need to decide if I want to lock in my rate and hope it drops so I can re-lock in the rate OR find another financial institution that will give me a lower rate, but with PMI.",finance,1464920592
personalfinance,Just bought a house and may have jumped too soon.,"Alright PF. Need some help. 

At the beginning of this year, I purchased a house with my fiancée after receiving a pretty solid promotion at work. (We were already on the fence about purchasing a home prior to the promotion.) After the home purchase, I have racked up some credit card debt trying to get the home just like I wanted. With that said, I've put myself in a sticky situation financially and would like some pointers. 

I've accumulated around $19,500 in credit card debt paying for future wedding expenses and big ticket items for the house like a privacy fence and other things. I also have around 12k in student loans on a lower repayment option with hopes of utilizing the Public Safety Loan Forgiveness program. I have two car payments totaling $640 a month and those are within 18 months of being paid off. I usually pay around 1800 a month in bills including mortgage and all utilities. 

Between my fiancée and myself, we bring close to 5k a month home but most of her checks are going towards wedding items after bills and budgeted items are paid. I live paycheck to paycheck because I pay the bulk of the bills and I'm looking for ways to reduce my payments or consolidate the debt so I can get a better interest rate and/or not have to pay to multiple debtors. 

What's the best way to stay afloat until after the wedding in August? And after the wedding is a joint account a recommended practice for newlyweds. We're pretty open about money but not sure how different it'll be when sharing an account.

personalfinance,"M/21 - Credit score was 715 Jan 2015, 572 EQ Jul 2016. Help","Hello reddit,

so I'm currently trying to repair my credit after some things slipped through the cracks. When I was 20 years old, I was making well over 100k, was approved for a mortgage up to 500k with a 50k down payment (didn't pull the trigger), and was doing everything right. Late last year, and early this year, some events made me ""drop the ball"" professionally and personally. 

I'm back now out of depression, and in the course of the year, my credit has dropped from [715 January, 2015] to [572 July, 2016]. I need some help. I've given advice on business, investing, and career help here, I would like some guidance of my own.

I'm 21 now, I opened my accounts when I turned 19. 

1 credit card with BofA (closed, $1200 cap)
1 credit card with NFCU (open $1500 cap)
1 Auto Loan with NFCU (closed, car totaled, auto insurance paid, I closed account) 

those were the only lines of credit I had, and the lines of credit which actually built my score to 715, losing my credit virginity. 

January of this year, I negotiated a personal stock sale with a VC firm, and they required a credit check. I asked them to give me a copy of the report, and it report (695 January, 2016), so the crazy drops happened over the course of 5 months. 

I then missed February and March for unspecified reasons, which caused BofA to close my card, and my insurance (Progressive) in the background of all this issued a collection for my CANCELLED POLICY AFTER MY CAR ACCIDENT of $493. This is showing up on my account via Credit Karma a a derogatory mark and it is MY ONLY derogatory mark. I've been doing research about how to handle this and it appears Progressive does this reguarly to people and you can get it taken off if the balance is paid, which I have no problem doing. 

-----

The payment on the Navy Federal, never missed a payment, always paid in full at the end of the month.

I missed two payments, February and March for my Bank of America card. This resulted in a 60-89 late mark, and BofA closing the account. These are my only late payments on anything ever, and I PAID Bank of America the entire balance in April. In hindsight, I could have made a minimum payment if my judgement wasn't so clouded and I wasn't depressed and drugged out. 

I signed up for Credit Karma, which is making me now take control of this situation.

My questions for reddit is, in general, what steps can I take to get back in the 700 range? I realized I fucked up, and thankfully, I'm young, and my total credit history is as well, which may be a good thing. The only thing I want to use this stuff for is getting a mortgage and getting a platinum AMEX. Couple of points I would appreciate if answered as well. 

1. What steps can I take to get back to the 700s?

2. How long will that take? Since they closed my BofA, that account was two years old. I've been calling this my ""2 year plan"" in the sense that, I will purchase a home in two years if I can build my credit up. 

When I can get everything neutralized and reduce utilization below 15%, I can open up another credit card sometime when my score enters the 600s so during the following two years of doing what I did previously, my score will go back to where it was January 2015.

My two credit cards and auto loan were opened in March 2014, so I went from 000 to 715 in less than a year I'm presuming, and within 6 went down to 500s.

personalfinance,"Getting $5k from my parents, best way to allocate","Hello all,
Thanks for reading. Just looking for a quick check on my thinking. I looked at the windfall wiki but it was more for larger amounts of money - I'm only talking $5k. 

When I went to college, my parents weren't able to help much (my father refused to, for 'religious reasons' because I went to a state university). My two younger siblings capitulated nicely and went to good private colleges (one is graduating in three years, and another got into a straight-to-doctorate program, so I'm not poo-pooing their choice of private college in their situations- it worked great for their goals), and my parents were in a better place financially at that time to help them. My mother, in the very generous interest of fairness, would like to even the playing field by giving me the $5k that she would have given me towards my education, had she been able to. This is extremely generous of her, and quite unexpected.  

My logic is this: I started with $27k in student loans which I've paid down to $12,100. I bring home $2,600 per month, and have about $2,500 in an Emergency fund, $5,500k in a Roth 401k ($3,800 is vested, but I'm not planning on going anywhere). Of my remaining $12k in loans, $2,700 is at a 6.8% interest rate (the rest are more in the 4% range). My thought is to pay off the $2,700 of 6.8% and use the rest to open up a mutual fund (I currently use the 401k match at work but don't see that a 401k offers me an advantage over a mutual fund once I've taken the match). 

Can someone just confirm for me that this seems like a reasonable plan?  Would it be wiser to use the full $5k on the mutual fund and just keep plodding along on my student loans? In the grand scheme of things it's a fairly small amount of money, but for me it's a large chunk I'd like to use to get some financial momentum.

Tl;dr Use half of $5k to pay off 6.8% loans and the remainder in a mutual fund, or use the whole $5k to start the mutual fund?

Thanks all!",finance,1464957374

Capitol One Credit Card:

I used to watch r/bitcoin as my source of news and it all seemed so hopeful until I found out about the censorship. Then I found r/btc and I've watched this sub near daily and it's been an inconsistent roller coaster. 

I don't know a thing about coding or protocol. I've bought and sold coins on a whim for both speculation and investment. The block size debate makes sense to me and I support a larger block size, but only on principle and nothing on technicality. I run a Classic node on my home computer with no downtime. I don't really know why, maybe just to support anything that's not blockstream.

But with all of the warring opinions going on, I feel like things are conflicting far too often. Classic is on the rise! And then nothing happens. Blockstream is going to push people to altcoins, hurting adoption! And then the price rises to $570. Coinbase exchange becomes gdax and exchanges ethereum! But then the market cap increases by $2b and huobi breaks 3000 cny. Is it this sub then, or what?

I don't really know what answer I'm looking for right now. I think I'm just venting.

Would there be serious implications to my credit if I were to accept the first offer so that it doesn't expire, and when the other two banks get off their butts and give me an offer (that ends up being significantly better) pay off the first loan with the lower APR loan?

Locked in FIRE thread,"I know you all see a ton of these posts, probably daily, but I'd really like some feedback to make sure I'm headed down the correct path or at least know that I'm not now so I have time to change it. I'm going to post a little about myself and what my current status is so you can provide some feedback - I'd really appreciate it!

My S/O and I just graduated college in December - we both just turned 22 a few months ago. I work in the financial industry, and currently make $40k a year salary. My employer has a 4% match that I take full advantage of, and additionally contributes 10% of my salary a year to my employer plan on top of the match. My S/O makes $35k a year in the digital media sector - her employer doesn't have a company match, so she's setting aside 4% for now just to have something for retirement until we pay some debts down and can increase that. Not that great I know, but we're entry level and I know the ceiling is high on my career down the road. We're in Charlotte, NC, so COL isn't the cheapest but isn't terrible.

Currently, our assets look like this: we have about $62k in student loans - I have $37k myself, and she has $25k. All federal loans, about $9k worth at 6.8%, 5k at 5%, and the rest are 4.7 and below. Our minimum payments come out to about $350 per month. After rent, utilities, fuel, groceries, etc. our leftover monthly income is around $900. We started some emergency funds and have about $1500 each in a Barclays Dream High Yield Savings Account paying 1.05% APY. We also have about $5k in our checking accounts total, and about $1200 in some brokerage accounts invested in things like stock market ETFs.  My plan was to put $400 aside in savings per month - $200 each, $100 in each Barclays account and $100 into each brokerage account. Aside from the student loan debt, other expenses on the table are there's a car that we're upside down on - the car is worth about $7k and still owe $11k on it. Not our choice - her mom bought the car with a 21% interest rate (yeah, I know. She has no clue how money works and just pulls the trigger) and now we're stuck with it. At some point, I'd also like to get a ring - we've been together a couple years and have been living together for most of that time. At some point it's likely I'll need to move to another location to advance my career seeing as how I'm not in the main offices where most of the jobs are, and I'm sure she'll want some level of commitment to come with me which is understandable. 

I'd like some insight into what order my priorities should be in, and if I'm even on the right path. I have wanted to be FIRE for some time now, even though I'm only 22. I dream of the days where I can wake up and just enjoy my day without feeling constricted or obligated to work just to pay off debts. Should I attack loans first? Work towards getting out from under the car payment? The car will need to be replaced at some point, and I'm looking at a quality used car. Should I save for a ring while I'm at it, or deal with that after? Also, any side gigs I could do to add money around my schedule would be great so toss those out as well.

I just need some guidance - neither of our parents have ever been financially responsible and I don't intend on heading down their paths. I've read these forums for a while, but I'll be the first to admit I'm a Reddit rookie as far as I'm concerned and just want some input on my specific situation. Thanks to all who comment in advance!

EDIT: I just had a stroke of genius today - the car is still in her moms name, and her mom is driving an '09 accord with a KBB value of ~7500. I told her to talk to her mom about selling her car, taking my SO's car (which is two years newer with a service package) and paying the $7500 towards it. Then her mom would have this car, not be upside down on the loan anymore, and we could go get a quality used vehicle for $11k or less with a much better interest rate than 21%.

personalfinance,[debt] Can anyone point me to an amortization calculator which allows me to examine how much monies might be forgiven under an IBR plan?,"This question is difficult for me to explain. I'll do my best below;

I am seeking a calculator that will show me how much debt will still remain at the end of my repayment period if I am paying less than the amount needed for full repayment. The only calculators I can currently find say ""that loan will not be paid off within the term"". No shit. I'm aware I'm not treading water. But having a ""student loan debt bomb"" of $460,000 compared to one of $50,000 would certainly help me sleep better at night. The federal student loan calculators all assume a $5% increase in income each year. As such, they are not helpful. (I think 5% is overly optimistic and rather arbitrary)

.

I.E., my situation is thus: I have $158,800 in student loan debt at 7% interest (law school). I am currently making ""ok"" money but require IBR to make life livable.* On my current IBR plan, I pay $760 a month. I know that amount does not cover my interest as my loan amount continues to go up. I want to know how much I need to pay to prevent my principal from increasing. Is there a calculator which would show the ""tipping point"" amount which will prevent the mountain from growing? I would like to prevent this debt from getting larger and I am fully aware of the ""debt bomb""

Please help. Sorry if this is poorly phrased. I will answer whatever questions I can.

personalfinance,Should I refinance to eliminate PMI/lower monthly payments? (X-Post from r/mortgage),"This would be our second refinance. We originally bought in 2006, interest rate was 6+%, quickly became underwater when bubble burst and took advantage of HARP program in 2012 to refinance $331K for lower interest rate (4.375%) and monthly payment on a 30 year conventional loan. Unfortunately we only put 10% down when we originally bought the home so have been stuck with PMI ever since. I started thinking about a second refinance when got letter in the mail from our lender, Wells Fargo, giving us options to get rid of PMI. We could pay $89K now (ridiculous) to wipe the PMI clean or pay Wells Fargo's appraiser $550 in hopes that our home market value has gone up to 75% LTV to get rid of the PMI. In Googling others experiences with WF, seems most appraisals come in low so would just be a waste of money. We are close but don't want to waste the monty. So...refinance?

Our outstanding balance is $305,000. We pay $2253/month, of which $1652 is principal and interest, $600 is property taxes and homeowner's insurance and $143 is PMI. According to our loan docs, we will reach 78% LTV on 10/1/27 and it will be automatically dropped with no appraisal. That is approximately 135 months from now, or $19K.
Currently on Quicken loans, there is an offer for 30-year fixed with monthly payment of $1850 including taxes and insurance for 3.625% and $8,513 closing costs including 1.75 points. Running the numbers thru HSH.com's Refi Calculator, we breakeven in 54 months. Interest costs are $195K for new loan versus $255K for old loan, plus PMI ($19K). Interest costs are $204K for new loan with costs added to loan amount, which I am inclined to do, versus paying out of pocket.

My questions are: 1. Is this a good deal and worth the trouble? 2. Is Quicken Loans/Lending Tree or any of the other online mortgage lenders reputable to do business with? I'm inclined to go with them since this is our third time around and we can potentially get better rates. I would also consider a broker.

Our primary reasons for refinancing is to get rid of PMI. A better interest rate (but &lt;1%), a lower monthly rate is nice. I want a conventional loan, not FHA or VA. I don't want any prepayment penalties because I want to put extra money toward the principal throughout the year. I would like to decrease the loan term to 20 years but my husband isn't bothered by the extra money paid in interest, he would prefer the lower monthly payments. Plus there is the argument that money could be invested elsewhere with a better return. Sorry for the word salad, any thoughts would be appreciated.

personalfinance,Remodel in progress. Want to quit my job but can't reappraise/refinance until the construction is done. Am I missing anything?,"Some of this may be extraneous information but it's helpful for me to get it all down, and who knows, maybe some of it is more relevant than I thought.

I graduate in May 2014 and immediately took a job at my university doing web development, making right around $45,000/year. Other benefits included tuition remission and an 8% contribution to a retirement plan from the university (I put in 5% of my salary, they match with 8%). Take home is around $2,800/mo. I actually took the job at less than the posted hiring amount because I'm self-taught and my degree is completely unrelated to the field (B.A. Theology), so they had to hire me in a different bracket (can't remember the official term). All that to say it's on the low end of the pay scale for the field with no real opportunities for raises or promotions and I could be making a lot more working elsewhere or even freelancing/starting a business (not to mention the work would be more fulfilling...).

In August 2014 I purchased a house walking distance from my office. I paid 170k with 3.5% down on an FHA loan. My monthly mortgage payment on a 30 year fixed loan at 4% is $1,240 - $178 of which is PMI. The good news is I rent out the extra bedrooms to my friends for $300/mo each and that basically covers my mortgage (I've had between 3 and 5 renters the entire time I've owned the house). I cover all the utilities which usually averages around $300, depending on electrical usage. I bought the house with the intention of remodeling and either selling to cash in on the sweat equity or renting for some semi-passive monthly income. I've done a ton of work on the house (scraped popcorn ceiling, repainted all the walls, new hardwood, new carpet, new doors and hardware, added a bedroom, etc.). I've spent around $17,000 on the remodel so far. I'm currently in the middle of remodeling the kitchen and still have a ways to go before it's finished. I want to reappraise the house to remove the PMI and refinance at a lower interest rate. I currently owe $160,000 and I'm confident the reappraisal will come in at over $200,000. I just received a property value notice from the county putting the value at $198,000 and that's without reappraising for any of the improvements I've made. Unfortunately, I can't get a reappraisal until I finish up current construction, which is still at least a month out. There's more I'd like to do after that, but nothing too major.

None of this would really be a problem except I desperately want to quit my job. I'd like to give more than 2 weeks notice because I know it's a difficult position to fill at the available pay range (the position went unfilled for 8 months before I was hired) and I like the school and don't want to leave them hanging. If it comes down to it, I'll prioritize my sanity and mental health over the job, but ideally I could give a couple months notice. I need to have more creative fulfillment in my life, whether it's a personal project or a job. I have $5,000 saved up right now and I'd like to cash out some of my equity when I reappraise to have a safety net while I try to establish a business or just to pursue some creative projects I don't feel like I currently have the time for. Between the full time job and remodeling I often work 12-16 hour days and it leaves me exhausted with little time for maintaining relationships or working on personal projects. So it's a catch 22 of needing to keep the job until I reappraise/refinance and not having enough time to work on the remodel because I work a full-time job that leaves me emotionally exhausted.

One last piece of financial information - I owe $23,000 in student loans making minimum payments of $280/mo. 

I want to make sure there's not something I'm missing. Is there a way for me to refinance or remove my mortgage insurance sooner? Any other pro tips?


TL;DR
I make $45,000/year as a web developer, take home $2,800/month. Bought a house to remodel for $170,000 with 3.5% down and 4% interest FHA loan. I currently owe $160,000. Actual property value likely over $200,000. Kitchen currently being remodeled. My mortgage is $1,240, mostly covered by renting to friends. Utilities around $300/month. $280 monthly student loan payments on $23,000 owed. Desperately want to quit my job and freelance/start a business and pursue creative projects ASAP.

personalfinance,IRS refund processed into debt. IRS does not find my SSN on file.,"Hey,

I am a grad student in the US but from a different country. I've been filling taxes since 2011 (both federal and state) while doing my undergrad and now PhD. My federal taxes have always been refund.
For the year 2014 I was processed a refund of about $300. I have the documents (Form 1040NR-EZ) but my school (I was a senior) processed the payment. Because of weird international student taxes the arrangement was that they pay my State tax which was about $700 but they get to keep my federal refund.
This year my federal refund was close to $400 and I actually had a state refund of about $100. I got that refund within a few weeks. The federal return took longer, when I check the where is my refund option from the IRS it told me that it was too soon to check. 
I left for a trip in early May and returned now to find a notice from the IRS saying they have applied my 2015 refund to a previously owned amount and now I have to pay them $850. I never had any debt. I have records of all my tax years and all are refunds.
I tried calling them to clarify but first the automated option walk through told me there was no match of a person with my SSN, DOB and filling status. I double and triple checked all my entries on tax forms and the phone, called again and the same thing happened so my call never got through to an agent. Then they hang up on me as it was ""after hours"". This makes no sense as I had filed taxes for 2011,12,13 with NO issue so clearly my SSN was there.

Has this ever happened to anyone? Is it at all possible to challenge this owed amount? I'm in no position to pay that money currently. I will call them again first thing Monday morning but it's the weekend and this is causing me a great deal of stress. Is there even a way to check online past dues to see where the debt is coming from? As I completely don't understand that. 

Thanks for your time. And I can clarify anything that's vague and weird, I don't write very well when I'm upset.

I'm thinking about taking out a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the first time in my undergraduate career. Until now, I have only taken out a few subsidized loans. With unsubsidized loans, unlike the subsidized loans, I know that interests starts to accrue immediately once I receive the check.

I wanted to make sure that I'm calculating the YEARLY interests that I will accrue by taking this loan out correctly. The rate is 4.29% and the loan amount will be for $3500. 

I did 3500 x 0.0429 = $150.15. Therefore, my student loan interests will be $150.15 YEARLY, is this correct? Or is this $150.15 my interests that accrues MONTHLY on this loan? 

I used this website to help me:

https://myfedloan.org/billing-payment/about-interest/


In summary: Taking out a loan for $3500, with an interest rate of 4.29%. The YEARLY interest will be $150.15 on that loan, is my math correct reddit?",finance,1465006076
personalfinance,Wife's student loans are surprising us - appreciate input,"Greetings PF! My wife and I were sitting down to firm up our budget (newly weds) and yes, I realize this should have been done sooner, but we began looking at her student loans (EDIT: these loans are ALL private) and my jaw hit the floor when I saw the interest rates (7-13%.....I'm a mathematician, she has no clue about good rates). These 6 loans (totaling ~65,000) have not been refinanced and are lumped together in one payment. After further inquiry, we find she has another set of loans totaling 38,000 that aren't being touched at the moment. A third set of loans (much, much smaller) is being paid for by her parents, who offered. Note: everything, including borrowing and management during her undergrad years, was taken care of by her parents who recently declared bankruptcy. A few of the 38,000 loan bunch have since ""disappeared"", I""m thinking for only a short time. It also appears her parents used her as a cosigner for a few of her sister's student loans, but I digress.

I'm stepping in to sort everything out. I understand all parties involved with financing an undergraduate degree needed some more information regarding borrowing, but we can't change the past so let's deal with managing this. Where to start? These loans need to be refinanced; I have a good credit history and can cosign. I have another good cosigner in my back pocket as well (my parents are willing to help). However, seeing as how my in-laws aren't sure what happened to a few loans (""disappeared"") and declared bankruptcy, I am unsure what debts are in my wife's name so we can do damage control. Other than contacting companies directly, is there another way to see all of her loans? Is there a way to see loans she is cosigned on (unfortunately she either does not remember to agreeing to this or didn't know what it meant)?

I appreciate your time and feedback. I'm just perplexed and frustrated.",finance,1465006570
personalfinance,Auto Loan Help Needed,"Hello!
Currently out of a car and am needing to purchase one. To keep it short, apparently my credit is crap due to my debt to income ratio:

More information:

Income: $22k a year.

Current expenses: $100 cell-phone bill.

Debt: $1500 CC debt from.

Recently (2 weeks ago) GAP insurance paid off the totaled car I was still making payments on that was financed at APR 5.2%.

Car loan #2: $9,000 on another auto loan I co-signed last year for my significant other. Rate we got then was 4%.

Savings: Currently have around $2k in checking and will be receiving close to $2k from gap insurance payout.


Attempted to get pre-approved for a loan by my bank (Wells Fargo) and was given interest rate of 10% at 60 months. 

Attempted some credit unions, denied due to debt to income ratio and revolving credit being high.
Plan to pay down my CC now after having saved up for the past two months. I know it won't help my situation now, but perhaps I should take the offered high interest rate and then attempt to refinance 6 months down the line? Or should I pay down the debt, then re-apply for loans after 30-60 days? The issue would be: no car which is really hard in a city with no public transportation.

TLDR; Offered a 10% APR over 60 months on a $15,000 loan from my bank. Have been denied by local credit unions, should I take the high interest rate and attempt to refinance in 6 months after I pay down $1,500 in CC debt?

Or pay debt off, wait 30-60 days and re-apply and hope for better interest rate? Would that even help at this point?",finance,1465008908

investing,How the CME 30 Day Federal Funds Futures works,"I read a great article recently explaining how the math behind how the CME 30 Day Fed Funds is used as a proxy for market sentiment on what the fed is going to do with rates. However, I had a few very basic level questions that I suspect will just cause me to smack myself in the head with my palm when they're answered. Thank you in advance:

1. To determine, hypothetically, what investors currently think the July 2016 fed funds rate will be, one would take the difference between the current July 2016 contract price and the current fed funds rate. However, given that I could buy contracts at a wide variety of strike prices, how could I exactly say what THE ""current July 2016 contract price is""? Is it just the strike price with the most open interest? Is it the ""settlement price""? If the latter, what the hell does that actually *mean*? is it just an average of the high and low for the day?

2. I get directional trades with options; if I'm bullish on AAPL, I buy calls at a strike price that isn't too expensive premium wise but where I still think I can turn a good profit as the stock price rises. I do the same for puts if I'm bearish. But let's say I think the fed is going to raise rates by 25 bp by December. What do I actually go out and buy or sell to attempt to profit from my conviction? Is there any other reason people buy these futures? Is it just purely speculative?",finance,1465015688
personalfinance,Should I use cash savings to pay off one of my student loans?,"Hi! I'm hoping I can get some advice on whether to use my savings to pay off one of my student loans. 

There's basically 8k left at 3% interest. I also have another loan of about 54k at 2.5% interest, on a 10-year repayment plan due in 2025 (it's a grad school loan).

Paying off the 8k loan would leave me about $5,000 in cash for an emergency. I know the 3-6 month rule - $5,000 for me could maybe stretch 3 months if I live bare bones.

I like the idea of just getting rid of one of these loans, but I'm not sure if it's worth depleting my safety net.

personalfinance,Found out I have defaulted on a federal student loan. Dealing with a collection agency I have a bad feeling about.,"I know it may seem impossible that I was unaware that I had a 2 student loans that amount to be around $5000 at disbursement, but through the wondrous Sallie Mae/ Navient it became possible.

I will admit I was an uneducated borrower. I have made mistakes. 

I am currently paying on cumulative student loan debt of around 20K. The payments put me at about 25% of my base income after taxes etc. I say ""base"" income because I often make more through over time and on call pay.

I was contacted by this debt collection company in February. Initially I thought it was a joke. But, I contacted the university it was through and found that I was actually not paying on these 2 loans and they were in default. I could go on but this is my concern:

When I first spoke with them they were trying to get me into a payment plan. I informed them that I cannot afford to pay anything in any plan as I was already paying 25% of my income to other student loans.

In the research of these loans I consulted my parents to see if they had any documentation to these loans. Once it was realized that these were in fact my loans, they offered to pay (through an inheritance from my grandparents) a lump settlement.

The total disbursement was about $5300. The ""principal balance"" is about $5800. They are willing to settle for $6000. However, when I initially talked to them they said they would send me a written agreement. They never did. Of course they started calling me again. Here is the the thing that is bothering me... It's a ""new"" collection agency. I again ask for a written settlement offer for a lump sum. They say they will send me a letter in the mail. I get nothing for 2 months. I get calls again from this same company. I explain to them that I want a written settlement and that I had been through this once before. I was told it would take 30 days.

I finally get a call, and I'm again told that they will accept said amount as a lump sum. I told them again that I needed a written document stating the agreement. This seemed like a foreign concept. I was put on hold several times. I was finally informed I would get an email shortly with the required information. I did finally get an email, but by this point the ""principal balance"" had increased and the settlement was more.

I was also told they accept all major credit cards. 

Should I be dealing with a collection company like this? What are my options? And have I even gone about this the right way?",finance,1465017305
personalfinance,Second job and taxes?,"I am in the process of looking for a second job in order to build up my savings and pay down my debt at an expedited speed. I currently work in my career field (veterinary technician), but for five years (throughout high school and college) I worked in retail, the last three years in a management. I have the option of going back to that company, as a very part-time employee. I will most likely be doing that unless I find something more appealing/better paying.  

At my current job, I am paid every two weeks. I am filing single and claim two (2) allowances on my W-4. Looking at my last paycheck, here is the breakdown:  
* Rate of pay: $15.41/hr  
* Hours Worked: 80  
* Gross Pay: $1233  
* Social Security: $77  
* Medicare: $18  
* Federal: $99  
* State/Local (MN): $52  
* 401k: $62  
* Take Home Pay: $925  

With my potential second job, I will be paid every two weeks. I will make $11/hr, and work 12 hrs/week, or 24 hrs/pay period. This would give me a gross income of $264 per pay period. I will not have any deductions such as 401k or insurance or anything.  

When I plugged those numbers into calculators such as Bankrate or Paycheck city, it's coming back with $0 in federal withholding and $0 in state/local withholding. While that would be awesome (taking home 90% of my pay!), I'm concerned that it's not accurate? Will I actually end up with taxes taken out of each paycheck? And/or will I end up owing taxes at the end of the year, based on my total combined income?

personalfinance,Student Loan Wage Garnishment.,"I have two Federal loans in wage garnishment. For the past three years I have been losing 25% of my income to these two garnishment. At the time in was told I had no hope, recently I found I may ha e some options. One of the services was 5 payments of 448/month before stopping the garnishment, I assume the other company will use the same formula and ask for another 448/ month. We are talking 50% of my income for 5 months.  I will never have that money. 

On the official federal borrower site [studentaid.ed.gov](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/default/get-out)

I submitted the application and the request for an income based repayment plan but I was told my loans did not qualify.

Is this true? If so they why is it mentioned on the federal government's own website?

As far as I can see this is my last option. I can't believe I'm saying this but I can't spend the rest of my life like this, if I can't get help soon I may just enact the death benefit, if I'm dead they won't get a thing.

 I am crushing under the weight of these loans, with these garnishments in place I can't have a family or afford to buy a home. My employer is moving soon, ill be unable to find a new job too.

The IRS automatically applied the $5k to the tax debt (which is supposed to be his responsibility now). Big punch to the gut and I feel horrible for her.

Emergency fund of 7k and SO owes me 1.5k that she is starting to pay back.

I know technically I will have enough money, just barely, every month but I don't like it being that close, especially if I'm forced to use my emergency fund as I will have no way to build it up again.  What I want to do is get all of my loan payments down to my just paying the interest which would get my loan payments down to about 400 a month (which I have looked into and can get very close to doing) and put my extra 400 towards the principle of the 5.5k at 6.96% loan.  It just feels more efficient that way because instead of paying a little principle on a lot of loans I will be paying interest on all of them and knocking out a high interest loan quicker by applying all spare money to its principle.  My big question, is does it make sense to pay back my loans that way?

I currently make $60,000 gross income annually.

I intend on continuing to pay $150/month until the car loan is paid off (roughly the next 2 years). 

I will be paying $390/month in total for all 4 of the federal student loans, starting in July under a standard repayment plan. I was previously on a payment plan to rehabilitate my student loans, as I defaulted on them for a while and only recently (within the past 12-15 months) started to repay my student loans. While in rehabilitation, I was paying $180/month for all 4 federal student loans. 

I do not currently have any retirement accounts, as I had to withdraw from a prior employer-offered 401K to relocate to another state in order to find employment. This was a few years ago, and I've had the leftover funds sitting in my savings account since (roughly $4,000 or less of the $12,000 I have currently). I'm interested in opening up a IRA account using some of the funds in my savings account, and then possibly setting up a biweekly deposit into the IRA. 

I have a multitude of questions, as I seem to have a few options and do not know what to do despite have read the sidebar.

If I open an IRA, should I opt for a traditional or roth? I make less than $117,000 and feel it's logical to pay the taxes now instead of later, so I'm leaning towards a roth IRA. However, if my earnings increase beyond the roth IRA limits, I may have to convert it to a traditional IRA. Would I lose money having to convert? Could there potentially be fees for converting?

What is the best use of a portion of my funds in my savings account currently? I do not believe it makes financial sense to hold $12,000 in a savings account that accrues .01% back in interest. I do feel it is worthwhile to keep some of that money in the savings account for emergencies and whatnot, but I don't think I need $12,000 for an emergency. Ideally, I'd like to keep at least $5,000-$7,000 in my savings account for emergencies (unless this is an overly high amount?). That leaves me with a few thousand to move around by paying down my current student loan debt and/or opening an IRA account. Should I use it to pay down my student loan debt instead of opening an IRA? Should I split the funds evenly and put half to debt and the other half to retirement? Should I only put the minimum amount required into my IRA upon opening and the rest towards my student loan debt?",finance,1465072367

economy,"In Sweden, the total debt-to-income ratio, that is, debts in relation to disposable incomes, is currently at about 179 per cent. A disaster waiting to happen.","http://www.businessinsider.in/Swedens-central-bank-is-sounding-the-alarm-on-the-countrys-insane-housing-bubble/articleshow/52538569.cms

&gt;Basically, things are really bad.
In its latest Financial Stability report, the Riksbank puts much of the blame for what it calls the ""increasing vulnerability"" in the Swedish economy at the door of the country's rampant housing market, saying that the ever expanding housing bubble has the potential to fuel a recession.

&gt;If we just consider the households that have mortgages, the average debt-to-income ratio amounts to 317 per cent. The proportion of households with a debt-to-income ratio of between 300 and 700 per cent has increased over the last five years

&gt;Since becoming the first major economy to go below 0% in early 2015, Sweden has been one of the biggest cheerleaders of negative interest rate policies, frequently championing their effectiveness in spurring economic activity and boosting inflation and growth.

&gt;""Excessive risk-taking can make the financial system more vulnerable as it can lead to assets being overvalued and risks being incorrectly priced. Such a situation increases the likelihood of large price falls on the asset markets.""

&gt;Riksbank thinks the most likely cause for Sweden's housing bubble eventually bursting is a global shock - something like Brexit or a sharp fall in Chinese GDP growth. That shock could lead to a sharp fall in the performance of Sweden's already shaky banking system.",finance,1465073713
personalfinance,Choosing a savings account,"I am an upcoming college freshman who just graduated high school (today!). Let me describe my financial situation for the next year and the next 4-5 years.

I have been given enough financial aid that I do not have to pay out of pocket for college (yipee!). However, This package includes the two federal loans; subsidized ($3500) and unsubsidized ($2000). My goal this summer is to raise enough funds to get rid of/not have to take out the unsubsidized loan. Also, I want any money left over to grow. So the question for me is, how on earth do I choose a savings account for this type of situation? In summery, I am a poor rising college student who wants to raise money over the summer, work throughout school and save money over 4 years that will eventually help significantly to reduce my debt when I graduate.

I have a Core Checking account from BofA, and I just opened a Regular Savings account which has 0.01% APY, which doesn't sound good. My thought is to get an account that will help me reach my goals better. Which would that be and why?

personalfinance,"Spend a lot on ""Forever Home"" or buy budget friendly investment condo? Or don't move at all?","Hello!  My head is spinning a bit from several options and I would love some advice on what makes the most sense financially. Any advice would be much appreciated - sometimes it's hard to see the situation as it is when you're in the middle of it.  
 Here is our situation:
    
 *$175k combined base salary   
 *$40k of bonus this year (up to $90k next year), with $20k last year (we typically just think of this as gravy though and don't count it as ""income"") when we budget  
 *Put about $23k/yr into 401k to max employer contributions   
 *We have a $300/mo car payment that I make 2x payments on each month (Will be paid off in 1 year); this is our only debt aside from mortgage  
 *We're married with no kids but want to start a family in the next couple of years so good public schools are priority (live in Chicago so there's a huge variation of quality of public schools)  
 *Will put 20% down   
    
Here are our options: 
     
Option #1: Developing neighborhood that is expensive and in high demand (low inventory, high prices) - but we're looking to buy toward the edge of the neighborhood, which is still in the good school border but there is room for properties to increase in value.  This is extremely convenient for our commutes and we really like the neighborhood since it's near a big, beautiful park.    
    
1a) Budget friendly investment that may or may not work long term:  
 *$425k, technically 2BR + den
 *Commute time is 10 min for me, 45 min for husband
 *Mortgage would be $2500/mo, incl. tax, HOA.  
    
The cons are that the den is 9X10, so it might be difficult for that to be a fully grown child's room (although maybe it could work).  We would have to do some work on this place cosmetically.  It also has little outdoor space - just a balcony.  The pros are that it really works for our current lifestyle, it's gorgeous (exposed brick, floor to ceiling windows) and it's budget friendly.  I do think this would be a good investment, given the boom in this neighborhood, but not sure we could stay for more than 5-10 years as our (now non-existent) kids grow up.  It's the smallest of our options.   
    
1b) Very expensive ""forever home""
 *$650k full 3BR
 *Commute time is 10 min for me, 45 min for husband
 *$3200/mo mortgage incl. tax, HOA  
    
Good outdoor space, big bedrooms and it's brand new so we wouldn't have to do a thing to it.  It's stretches our budget by a lot and wipes out all of our non-retirement cash for the down payment - but we could absolutely raise a family here.  Same neighborhood as above, so I'm sure this would be an investment as well.    
    
Option #2: Move to established neighborhood, with more reasonable prices and plenty of available 3BRs in the $500-600k range.  
 *Mortgage would be ($2800-3k/mo) 
 *Commute time would be 45 min for me, 1 hr 10 for husband (probably 40 min in the AM, but 1 Hr 10 at night)  
    
The neighborhood has several good schools, more mature (so perhaps less appreciation in value, but more parks, green space, more families).  The problem is that it makes our commutes more difficult.    
    
Option #3: Stay where we currently are for as long as we possibly can (i.e. I get pregnant with kid #2 or kid #1 goes to school).  
 *Mortgage is $2100/mo 
 *Commute time is 30 min for me, 1 Hr for husband (30 min in AM, 1 Hr at night)   
    
The issue here is that we're nearing the point where stuff's going to go wrong (i.e. replacing appliances) and I'd really love to put $$ into updating baths, kitchen - but it's hard to justify throwing $$ into this when we know we want to move in a couple of years.     
    
So I guess my questions are:   
    
*Is it smart to buy now/sooner due to rising interest rates and prices? 
*Is buying a budget friendly investment that fits our needs for the next 5-10 years smarter than spending a lot on a ""forever"" home? 
*How much is commute time worth? Moving to the other neighborhood solves a lot of problems.   
    
We made a great investment in our first place, although that is mostly by dumb luck. I'd really like to make a smart, well thought out financial decision this time around. My husband is leaning toward 1A because he thinks that we may change our mind on living in the city in the next 5-10 years when we do actually have kids, so spending more for our ""forever home"" isn't THAT important.  However, I realize buying/selling is an expensive business in transaction costs, and I'm hoping to be responsible about this decision.

Between my wife and I, we are going to be making $8000 a month (not sure what the take home pay will be yet). We have a $5000 emergency fund, 62k in an investment portfolio, 40k in student loans with varying interest rates but other than that no debt. I have two main questions.

1. Outside of my roth IRA, I have 56k in index funds. Funds VFIAX, VSMAX, VTIAX, VTSAX. I picked these funds originally because I wanted a more aggressive index portfolio, but now I'm reconsidering based off of what I've been reading here and on r/investing. Any suggestions?

personalfinance,22yo starting medical school. Minimize debt or maintain savings/emergency fund?,"As the titles says, I'm 22 starting medical school in August. Over the last several years I have saved up just under 14k. I'm projecting my the total cost of attendance to be 52k next year and yearly COA will likely increase 2-3% per year. Overall, I expect to pay 215k over 4 years. I am fortunate to currently have no other debt. I have been approved for federal Stafford loans. I can take out $42,500 at 5.31% yearly interest rate. I can then get additional funding with federal grad plus loans at 6.31%.  

I have been trying to decide whether I should use my savings instead of taking out 10K in grad plus loans (6.31%) this year. Regardless, I am likely going to use my savings to pay down my loans at some point. However, I am trying to decide whether the cost of 10k compounding at 6.31% over my 4 years of medical school is worth losing the emergency fund I have created. There seems to be an opportunity cost to using my savings in that I won't have any of my own money available for surprise expenses, emergencies etc. which might not be covered by the rules governing the use of my loans. Is this a valid concern and does it warrant the cost of 4 years compounding interest? I am unsure as to the limitations of federal loans and the restrictions I may experience if all my expenses are paid with federal loans.

Lastly, I understand that federal student loans currently have very low interest rates (correct me if I'm wrong). Is it feasible to hold onto my savings now and then use them later when my loans will likely be at higher interest rates? If I were to take out grad plus loans I would likely put my savings in an index fund of other lower risk investment to offset some of the interest accumulation on my loans. I have some experience investing and would feel comfortable managing an investment in the QQQ, SPY etc. 

Thank you in advance for your advice. If there is any additional information that would be helpful let me know and I will edit the post to include it. Any other tips from those who have gone through medical/graduate school would be greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: I should add that there is an $841 grad plus loan processing fee and the fact that I would only require 10k in loans makes this an additional 8.41% fee on top of the 6.31% interest. I am almost leaning towards not taking the loans simply because this fee is so high.",finance,1465143092

personalfinance,"21 Chemical Engineer graduate, Landed my dream job! $91k in debt has me worried. Can you all help me make sense of this??","TL/DR: $72k/year isn't all that great when you have $91k in student debt and need to move in 2 monthes.

I graduated with my BS in Chemical Engineering on May 21st. I landed a job as a Controls Engineer at a consulting firm that I love, where I'll be working mainly at pharmaceutical/biotech companies (an industry I'm passionate about), in the Boston area (my favorite city). Needless to say, this is basically my dream job. On top of that, I ended up with the highest starting salary in my major - I'm very lucky, and very grateful for my opportunities. I busted my ass in school, ran an industry related student organization, and networked like a m********ker to get this job. Investing my blood, sweat, and financial security into my education is by far the best investment I have ever made, maybe I'll do an AMA about this sometime...

That being said my massive college debt, chronic back issues, and family situation have me a little worried about my finances.

My family situation:

 - Dad (65) is a teacher, Mom (63) is a social worker. Combined salary is around $120k. My dad ( the major bread winner) plans on retiring next year, and my sister is starting college in the fall.
they took out a 20k loan to pay for my first year of college (again, thanks Mom and Dad), and will be doing the same for my sister.

 - Our house is too damn big, and too damn expensive. They still have a home equity loan out, and need to do more work on the house before they sell it. Needless to say, money is tight. I love them to death and need to be able to aliviate financial strain I cause them as much as possible

My situation:

 - I live 2 hours away from the office, had to find housing that was closer, and on extremely short notice. Since this is a consulting company, I have no way of knowing which clients I will be working with after I get done with (what I'm guessing will be at least 1 month) of training and therefore, estimating a commute for the next year is almost impossible.

 - As a quick fix for the living situation (yah know, so I can actually make it to the office on time for the first few months), I found a sublet in Medford, MA. $750/mo + utilities from June 1st - August 31st. Its about 40 min, westward commute to the office, but is closer to Boston (max 10-15 min eastward), where most of our clients will be. This is somewhat unfortunate because I am compensated for any miles I drive of my normal commute to the office but like I said - its a quick fix so I can at least start working, and buy me time to strategically plan a more perminate living situation.

 - I plan on moving in with a buddy of mine from my graduating class who has a similar job, similar salary, in the same general area come September when the sublet runs out. This should save money, and hopefully we can pick and area cheaper than immediately west of Boston. This means that in 2 months (or maybe less), I will need enough savings for my first and last month's rent + security deposit... I'll assume that means $2,250 ($750x 3)

 - Currently driving a family car (2003 Civic 90k miles) and its in the shop, borrowing my dads car for the first week while it gets fixed. Luckily, my parents have sympathy for my situation and agreed to pat for all the repairs (around $1000). My parents currently pay for the insurance on the car, but would like me to contribute to it as soon as possible. Eventually, I will need to give this car to my sister and buy my own car. This could happen as soon as in the next 2 years.

 - Currently on the family cell phone plan, paid compeltely by my parents as of now. My portion of the bill is likely around $40/mo ($30 for the phone, $10 for the line). Again, my parents would like me to start paying g this in full as soon as possible.

 - Student debt of $91,102.66, with payments due starting in November.

 - Credit score of 655. No credit card, and just got denied Sallie Mae's UPromise Card because my debt to income ratio was too high... Thanks Sallie Mae...

 - I have degenerative disk disease, every few months it flares up, and as luck would have it, i had an extremely bad flare up the night before graduation (so bad I couldn't sit through my commencement). It started getting mildly better, until last Wednesday when it flared up again so bad that I couldn't walk and had to go to the ER. I was given a 12 day prescription for Valium, which helps a little, however I cannot ""drive or work"" while on it, and cannot walk without limping, or for longer than about 5 minutes. Sitting it also very uncomfortable, and basically the only relief I get is from laying down.

And now for the numbers:

Savings:

 - $675 left from the end of the school year

Assets:

 - absolutely none at this point.

Income:

 - $72,000 base salary from employer, paid bi weekly. Subject to MA 5.1% income tax + federal

 - 3.5% employer match on 4% employee 401k contribution, no details on which funds as of yet, (100% match of first 3% contributed, 50% match on an additional 1% contributed)

 - Quarterly bonuses based on billable hours worked, no details yet, but I understand that most employees get between 5.5%-10% base salary: (5.5% for 500 billable hours worked, 8.8% for 800 billable hours, 10% for 1000 billable hours. Bouneses are awarded at the end of each quater, and hours rolls over to the next quarter until the 10% max is reached)

 - $750 from Grandma to cover 1 months rent (graduation presant, god I love you Grandma &lt;3)

 - after taxes I imagine my take home pay will be around $46,000, which comes out to a monthly income of $3,833, and a biweekly pay check of $1,769

Expenses:

 - $750/mo for rent

 - $13/mo for internet

 - $35/mo for electricity (estimated)

 - $10/mo for gas utility (estimated)

 - $65/mo prescriptions

 - $80/mo gas for car

 - $265/mo groceries

 - $400/mo student loans

Total monthly expenses: $1,616

Debt:

 - $29,374.47 @ 7.14%, CollegeAve Student Loan

 - $34,394.99 @ 6.00% Sallie Mae Student Loan

 - $27,333 @ 4.384% (average), total federal student loans

Grand total of $91,102.66

In summary: I feel completely overwhelmed. Right now im on the trial for YNAB, and im debating on whether or not to drop the $50 because my savings are so low. Basically, I need to have 1 months salary in the next 2 monthes, my budget has 0 wiggle room, I can't save an emergency fund fast enough because of my student loans, and I'm not even sure how working this month will work out because of my back. I may have to tell them that I need 4-6 weeks to recover, and man do I hope theyre cool with that (not supposed to take time off for the first 90 days of employment).

This of course, is assuming that I only pay $400 a month for student loans until November, when I estimate my mandatory minimum student loan payment will jump to around $1200/month... And that'll still take 10 years to pay off! What the hell?!?

I need your help reddit! This post was partially therapeutic as I just needed to write out all the facts to help make sense of it all, but I really could use some advice.

I've lurked on PF for quite some time and I see posts from people who pay off like $65k of debt in 2 years... What am I doing wrong? Is this just my life? To be a debt slave for the next 10 years? I understand that I am extremely lucky to be in the position that I'm in, and have the job that I do, and I also understand that life isn't fair... But this just seems rediculous.

I want to be able to enjoy my life while I'm young at least somewhat. I want to be able to go out and meet girls, have drinks with my friends occasionally, maybe take a trip once in a while, etc, etc.

I busted my ass for 4 years, and I look around at all the other kids in my major who are making less money, and are planning on enjoying their lives all because they graduated with a fraction of my debt.

Before you say anything about ""knowing what I was getting myself into"" with the student loan debt, the only other option for school would have saved me maybe $10k in loans, and I hated the atmosphere and the people there. The fact of the matter is that I didn't ""stand out enough"" for any scholarships, and got my tiny fraction of financial aid cut my sophomore year because no longer qualified...

personalfinance,Critique my plan to pay off student loans (and my SO's),"Hi r/personalfinance! My girlfriend and I spent the morning reviewing our debts and coming up with a plan to tackle them. Here's the quick and dirty. 

Goal: Pay off student loan debt ASAP and save for a house. 

We're both 30 years old. 

Combined student loan debt: ~$113,000. Across about 7 different loans. Different interest rates. Decided to tackle by avalanche method, paying highest interest rate first (8.0%). 

No other debts (no car note, no credit card debt, no mortgage).

We have no savings. Both have 401(k)'s. Both meeting employer match. Mine is at $23k, hers at $16k. 

Net combined monthly income: $5,870.00

Monthly expenses: $3,395.00 ($1,100 rent, groceries, utilities, gas, amusement, $875 student loan minimum payments). 

Leftover: $2,475.00

Plan is to put $1,837 of the leftover amount to student loans, on top of the $875, for a total of $2,712/month. That leaves $600 to put into savings. 

According to our calculations, this will allow us to pay off our student loans in 3 years 10 months. Hopefully earlier with any windfalls and It will also give us $27,600 in savings by the end of that time.

Any suggestions/criticisms to this plan? This was just a rough outline.

personalfinance,Getting away from debt - how to consolidate,"So it took me some years to get this far but finally I got my spending under control and make a pretty good salary. I've been using tools like Mint.com and You Need a Budget to be smarter about my spending. Over the past year I have focused on alloting X amount per month to spend on something and if I didn't have enough, wait a month to buy whatever must have item I needed.  

This has worked out well but I still had to pay down some credit card debt that was moving slowly due to high interest rate. I had an APR on my Discover Card of like 27% with a $8000 balance. It was ridiculous. So last year I joined Prosper and got a loan with a 10% APR to pay off my discover card.

But now I see that I can transfer my outstanding credit card debt on my remaining cards ($3500) total where I currently have a 18-24% APR. When I transfer it to Discover there is an intro no APR for 9 months. This seems like a no brainer for me since I am scheduling payments to pay it off each month so by month 9 I will be pretty close to paid in full.  
  
My main credit card to use now is my American Express card which has to be paid off every month in full. This has helped me a lot knowing I have to pay everything off at the end of the month. 
  
Additionally, is it worth contacting credit card companies to get your APR lowered? I have never missed a payment in over 5 years and have over a 750 FICO score with most companies so that looks good but I am not sure if it helps.

personalfinance,Small student loans vs beater car risk,"23 years old with about 7k in student loans at 7% interest, also 3k in credit card debt at 18% interest.  My w2 for the past year was roughly 40k, but my salary is 36k; just over $1000 bimonthly in income. 7% going to 401k with a 4% company match. I feel like I have it lucky with such minimal student loan debt, but I feel like I still have a looming financial burden with debt over my head.

My thoughts right now involve my car.  I drive a 2008 toyota with 125K miles that is completely paid off. I can probably sell my car private party for 13-14k.  My thoughts are that I could take out a minimal car loan of 5-6k and buy a beater old toyota or jeep that could potentially last me a few more years.  I would then sell my current car and use the money to pay off credit cards, then student loan debt, with the remaining balance to be paid on the principle of the new car loan.

My thoughts are that it would be a lot easier to pay $1000 or so to a car payment at a lower interest rate than to pay 2 or 3 different payments at different variable interest rates over the next few years.  The other side of this is that I know my car right now is in good condition and will not give me any foreseeable problems in the future.

Question: Do I sell my car and pay off my debts in full, or do I keep my car and manage to pay my debts over the next 3-4 years?",finance,1465181725
personalfinance,[Budget](JP) Am I on the right track?,"Hello! I’m a recent college grad as of May 2015 and started working as what more or less amounts to being an ALT in Japan in July. I’m the eldest of three brothers (the older of which moved out sometime before to live closer to Art Center and the younger of which is doing just about nothing with his life) and decided that getting on with my life was the right move.

I’m frankly not sure how much detail to provide, so I’ll just write in everything I can think of for now.

Having moved into a one-room apartment and out of the security net that is my mom’s basement, I decided that I needed to start budgeting properly and work toward the future. My budgeting each month comes out as follows

INCOME: ~3000  2,600
Rent: -400
Utillities: -50
Student Loans: -300
Phone: -50
Savings (Long): -500
Savings (Travel): -300

This leaves me about $900 per month to do whatever I feel like with, such as buying food (necessity), going out drinking (with coworkers, and thus a monthly necessity), pay for trains/buses/taxis, etc. I generally try to high ball my rent and utility payments while lowballing my play fund and might dip into the travel fund but generally never touch the nest egg. I know that I’m not the most responsible person in the world and give myself that leeway to appease my own thirst to do stupid things (I bought a $400 yukata set yesterday, for instance).

Which is all well and good, but I’ve learned lurking here for the last couple months that I need to invest in my retirement and pay off my debts as quickly as possible. 

From what I’ve gathered, my position entitles me to an at-max $3,000 pension payout whenever I quit (in the next 1-4 years as my contract expires). There aren’t any 401k/Roth IRA options to speak of for my coworkers and I, however. 

My student loans will ring in just below the $18,000 mark come June 9. A part of that lump is subsidized and thus interest free, but part of that isn’t. I’d tell you exactly what the interest rate is but I locked myself out of my student loan account for an hour on accident (go me!). I`m paying these off with the minimum each month of $200 + transfer fees.

And so the question becomes: Am I on the right track? 

I don’t have a car to pay off and won’t for a good while, if ever. Insurance is deducted from the initial $3,000, so I don’t worry about it. I don’t think my student loan interest is too high off the top of my head, so should I continue paying that off per usual or just outright prioritize that and throw each month’s Savings portion at the loans? If I go that route, and assuming I get that far with this job, my loans would be paid off in less than three years. Sure, no loans would be great, but I wouldn’t have a fund built up for whenever I move back to the States. 

What do you think? Am I doing decently well for myself? Does this plan hold water or is it all leaking out from the sides? Are there any options I’m missing altogether that you would recommend checking into?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day.",finance,1465182493

personalfinance,Leasing a 2016 Hyundai Genesis Coupe as a Working College Student,"Hey everyone!

I am very firm on leasing a new car - most likely a Hyundai Genesis Coupe. I have fair income with very little expenses. 

Some background: I make ~$25,000 a year working full time before taxes. College is paid for by scholarships and federal direct loans. My monthly income is about ~$1400.00. My only expenses are my gym membership and Netflix etc which are $55.00, and also food / leisure. I have been working at a stable job for 6 months. My credit score is 600, but it's probably because of student loans - all of my credit is paid off.

Now before you bash me about my loans, I'm confident that I will be able to manage payments in the future and I've never had an issue finding a decent paying job with my experience / area. Oh and I'm living with my parents and I don't plan on moving out until at a later age (I'm 21). 

I plan on finishing my degree and have a job with decent pay. I also don't mean to sound cocky, but I'm not very worried about my financial state and I am able to pay off my loans and expenses on time.

So now the Hyundai Genesis Coupe.. It's about $29,000 brand new and based on research from Edmunds, it has a 57% residual and 0.0012 interest. My monthly payment would probably be $500 - ballpark. (I have no experience whatsoever with leases so this is just a personal estimate).

So... good idea? Calculating my monthly budget, $500 goes towards lease payment, save $300-400, ~500 can be leisure and other expenses

EDIT: COMMENT FROM BELOW

Got home half an hour ago and read everyone's comments and realized how stupid of an idea this was. Everyone made really good points and I'm going to definitely not go through with leasing this.

I'm going to search for a 2010-2011 Hyundai Genesis Coupe or a similar priced car at around $10,000, so that I can aim for a $250 monthly payment at 4 years or so like /r/CDragon00 recommended.

Again I really appreciate everyone's help because I've read through all your comments and learned a lot about personal finance and common sense.

I'm not sure which I should do..  The other side is, my husband also needs a new vehicle (his is a 2003), and we want to start saving to buy a house.

I'm a 21 year old full time student who's spent the last few years working full time and racking up debt. I'm finally in a good position after years of horrible financial choices and have spent the last few days sorting my finances out and making a plan. I found out my credit score is actually quite good for my age and because of that, I've made some major changes to try and continue to improve my credit including:

Taking out a 0% balance transfer card and transferring most (around £850) of my credit from a 49.9% APR variable credit card on to this. (leaving £600 on that card)

Calling up and reducing my interest rate on my main credit card (current balance is around £3450) from 29.9% APR to 6.2% APR.

My main goal is to pay and close off all but my main credit card by January 2017. I also have around £210 a month direct debits (such as phone contracts and an £1000 loan) which I'd like to reduce. I'm hoping that by this time next year I have 1 main credit card with less than £1000 on it and have my direct debits reduced to less than £150 a month (basically, paying off any and all credit I can early).

In terms of income, I work mainly full time over the holidays and part time during the term. I earn around £10k annually. I have also currently been receiving £100 a week from my parents (I've been financially independent from them for several years now, so it's a nice gift). I'll also have my £8k student loan in September too. So overall in the next year, my overall income will be around £23k. Besides my rent (£350 a month including bills) and food (around £200 a month for two people) and above mentioned costs, I don't really spend money on much else. So my questions are:

1) Am I going in the right direction? Where am I going right/wrong?

2) Is there anything else I should be doing to help my credit and my financial position?

3) My plan is currently to reduce my overall debt to under £1500 within a year. Where do I go from there?

personalfinance,Should I refinance to drop my MI on my FHA.,"I was curious on getting everybody's advice on if I should refinance out of my FHA loan to a conventional load to drop my MI.  Looking at the numbers it seems like an obvious decision but just wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything.

Loan stats are 30 year fixed FHA @ 3.75%.  MI is $144 a month.  It's going to take roughly five more years to hit the 78% LTV ratio for it to automatically drop off.  The current value of the house (according to a couple websites I've used) says I have the equity to get a conventional loan without PMI.  I don't plan on living in this house for my entire life, but will most likely be here for at least five to ten more years.  So lets say I have 5k in refinancing costs, with dropping the MI alone I'd recover that cost in three years.

Would you guys refinance even if the interest rate is only slightly lower than my current just to drop the $144 monthly MI I'm currently paying?

My plan is to have it upgraded later this year/early next year before the APR kicks in. 

Moving forward, this morning I checked my credit score and saw that it had boosted from 590 to 640. Credit karma has given me a fair chance with the Amex BlueCash Everyday and a good chance with the Chase Freedom Unlimited. I'd much rather have the Amex card since the Chase has the same rewards as my Quicksilver. Another card that's been thrown into the equation is the Discover IT. I got a mail offer that was addressed by name with a set interest rate and invitation ID. 

I think I'd rather have the Amex first if not then the Discover. Should I pull the trigger on the Amex or go with the safer bets in the Discover and Chase. My biggest reason for wanting a new card so I can have more accounts plus a higher CL than my current Capital One cards.

personalfinance,Cash-out refinance at age 27,"Hi all, 

I'm curious if a cash-out refinance is right for me, and I am looking for some input. 

27 years old, make ~70k per year pre-tax. Not married, no kids. 


Debts:

- House - $151K (worth ~235k per county estimate for taxes)

- Truck - $11K (worth ~20k per kbb.com)

The interest rate on my mortgage is 4.5% and I am looking to refinance down to ~3.65%. I would continue to make my current payment, so extra towards principal with the lower rate. Judging by various internet mortgage calculators, that would save me ~40k over the life of the loan. I pay $500 per month on my truck at 0% interest (thanks Dad) which would mean paying it off in just under 2 years on my current plan. 

My question is what would be the risk/benefit in cashing out 10k from my mortgage to pay my truck off next month? I understand that it would increase the amount I owe on my home, but it would also allow me to save/invest more each month rather than throw it at a truck payment. 

This is my first home, and I've never refinanced so I'm looking for input. Let me know if there are any other details I can provide to make things more clear.

personalfinance,Help with my fixing my financial situation after getting sober.,"Hello pf!

First, I just wanted to say that I just found this subreddit so I hope this post is alright, but if there's anything I need to change please let me know and I'll do it right away. I'm posting from a throwaway, but I'm still new on my regular account too, so it's definitely possible that I'd make a mistake.

Anyway, I'll try to be concise. Like the title states I've recently gotten sober and I'm trying to get my financial situation in order. I've been sober 7 months now. I had a one day relapse 7 months ago, but before that i had been sober 6 months. Nonetheless, because i spent all my time getting high/drunk since I've been a teen I find that I'm now sober for the first time in my adult life (27), but I don't have many of the finance skills I should have developed in that time.

When I got sober my parents helped me pull my life together (got me in an apt, got me medical help, helped me get a better job) and they had been helping me financially maintain everything. Recently though they've told me that they can no longer provide me financial help. I wish they had been able to give me more notice, but I definitely understand where they're coming from and I appreciate all the help they've given me thus far.

I have a degree in Political Science and French, but the job I have now is my first office job, so I don't have a lot of good job experience. Additionally, i attend a program 4 nights a week to work on staying sober which this job has been flexible with so I haven't been actively looking for a new job, but maybe I should be.

Now that my parents can't offer me help I can see clearly that my expenses exceed my income and that obviously needs to be corrected. As it stands:

Income:
Net - $650 biweekly ($1300 monthly)
Savings - $500 ( I've been paying all my debt instead of saving which I guess may have been a mistake.)

Expenses:
Rent - $725 mo.
Water, ect ~ $30 mo.
Utilities ~ $75 mo.
Comcast - $120 mo.
Student loans - $168 mo. federal, $100 mo. private
Medical ~ $200 mo.
Cat ~ $50-$75 mo.
Food ~ $250 mo.
CC payment ~ $60 mo. (minimum but I had been paying more)

Outstanding debt:
CC - $1000 (down from $6000!)
Ambulance bill - $600
Hospital bill - $1300
Student loan - $70,000 federal, $2000 private

I haven't been paying the hospital or ambulance bills because I've been in contact with both companies and they said for now I could just let it remain.

Right now I've been thinking that i need to find a new place to live. It costs $1800 to break my lease, but if i could find a much cheaper place it may be worth it. That being said, I don't have $1800 so I'd have to put it on a credit card when I break it. My private loan company says I can lower my payment to $50 a month so I'll take advantage of that. I called and cancelled my Comcast this morning so i have to pay one more month but then I'll be done. My credit score is 765 according to credit karma so I thought maybe I should do a balance transfer to a card with no interest.

I could stop going to my program and try to get a part time job which worries me health-wise but if I need to I definitely will.

This has gotten much longer than I intended, so a really appreciate anyone who took the time to read it. If I need to provide anymore information just let me know and I'll do it right away.

At this point I guess my question is am I doing everything I should/could be doing to get this situation under control? Is there anything I haven't thought of or need to be doing? Does it make sense for me to break my lease and move? Now that I'm getting my personal life and sobriety in order I just really don't want to mess this up too, so I really appreciate any advice or critique anyone has to offer. Thank you!",finance,1465236125

personalfinance,"Just landed a 6 figure job at 25. Packed my bags and moved to a new city alone for my career. Now I need to make it worth it. Seeking assistance in setting goals, diversifying, learning efficiency, and creating a budget.","Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am financially illiterate. I never studied it, and come from a family where I am a first generation college graduate and my parents never had any financial or money-management advice to give. I am learning all of this on the fly, therefor, I really appreciate your patience, understanding, and advice. Here it goes: 

Background : I job hopped for 2 years before landing a job at a company I really loved in the tech industry. I went from living above my means at 22-23 in an expensive city and barely breaking even to living with my parents at 24 and landing a job making 60k. I received a raise to 65k after 1 year and then began investing into the company's 401k which had no match. At this point, I was just trying to get my head above water but still living a young and frivolous lifestyle with quite a few vacations,concerts,roadtrips,expensive trips to the bar. Because of this, I was only able to get my savings account to about $15K while having zero credit card debt and roughly $30K in student loans. 

Fast forward another 6 months to my current situation. This February, at 25 years old, I landed a job in another city with the same company for 115k target compensation(base+commission 55%/45%). I was nearly trembling as I got the phone call after weeks of nerve-wracking and competitive interviews. This was a huge acomplishment for me. At the rate my professional career was going from 22-24, 6 figures seemed like it may never happen and I almost left the professional corporate world all-together to wait tables because I just didn't enjoy it or have any passion in it. At my new company, I'm very passionate and my job is enjoyable, that + the income really feels like a dream sometimes. I truly am proud, and hope this is just a first step of many accomplishments. But - what's all that income worth if I can't manage it properly? That's why I'm writing you here.

More about the role -  I'm not in direct sales, but I'm in a role where my income can vary +/- 5-15% depending on the geography's performance. Worst case scenario I end up making around 90-100. Best case scenario, 130-140 for my first year, most likely scenario right now? I'd say between of 105-115 based on the current geography performance. Things will reset in August during our new fiscal year which could help the number. 

My company offers a 401K with 100% matching on contributions up to 4.5% for Pre-Tax or Roth. I am currently contributing 4.5% to pre-tax which is being match 100% and 4.5% to Roth which is not being matched on both my salary and commissions. This means I'm contributing 9% of each paycheck with 50% match. 

I am also now eligible to enroll in the employee Stock purchasing program where you can choose a contribution percentage between 1-10% for a 15% discount of company stock. It is a publicly traded company. The open-enrollment ends on June 16th, so I have some time to decide. Basically, if I contribute 5% - I'll have 14% of each paycheck going towards the 401K and the Stock Program. 

When I picked up all of my things and moved, I had no idea what to expect. I've always known that my financial acumen is not very high as I've never studied it and am the first generation of my family to graduate from college. My parent's were never the type to teach me how to manage my money and it's all self-learned. I want to use my current situation to better myself financially for the now and the for the future.

The move itself and furnishing of my first ever apartment to myself cost a bit more than I expected. I ate up the $5,000 relocation bonus on rent and furniture very quickly. Since living here, I've flown back home to see family a couple of times and all in all my travel and recreational costs have gone up as I eat out more in an attempt to learn my new city and make friends. It's a very social city and I'm a very social person, I'm always out trying to meet people and enjoy the culture here. 

My current financial situation is this:

Income per month
-Before any contributions = roughly $6,000
-After my contributions(not including the employee stock purchasing program) is around $4,800-5,300.

Savings Account : $11,000 (I contribute $1,000 a month currently)
Checking Account : $5,000
401K : $4,000
Student Loans : Roughly $30,000 with 2 private loans- I've been paying the minimum payment per month = $267
One equals $16,780 with a 3.2% variable interest rate and a minimum payment of $147
The other is $13,530 with a 3.060% interest rate and a minimum payment of $120

Credit Card Balance: : $8,000(Opened this card in August 2015, there is 0% interest for one year at the time of opening, I'd like my balance to be at 0 by then and then pay it off monthly if possible. My credit score is good, hovering around 730) 
Rent : $1,345 per month
Phone : Paid for by work
Internet : $70
Cable : No Cable
Utilities : Roughly $100 per month
Car : Paid off - I get reimbursed on mileage I put on for work as well
Gym : $45 
Sports leagues : $45



With all of this being said, I have a few questions and am also seeking any and all advice you may have to give: 

* Should I adjust my 401K contributions to just Roth or just Pre-Tax? If so, how much should I contribute?

* What percentage should I contribute to my Stock Purchase Program? between 1-10% of my paychecks

* What can I do with the growing $11,000 in my Savings account? 

* How should I go about paying off my credit card debt + student loans?

* How can I diversify my portfolio? 

* Should I focus on paying off my student debt as quickly as possible, or keep paying the minimum? 

* What types of goals should I have? 

* How should I be budgeting my money?

Please let me know if you have any additional questions or things that I can clarify for you. I know this was a long post, thanks for reading!

-Much Love

Bitcoin,Why Coindesk became the most crap crypto news site?,"I have follow Coindesk almost from their beginning and i always respect their articles as in my mind i had them for a very respectful crypto news site.
The last months this has completely change and in my opinion coindesk like ti is today is the most crap new crypto site outthere.
First almost every day they post a fud article about bitcoin and about a disaster that is coming. This happen almost  4 months now and without any reason and imo that fud article are completely manipulated.
An example the last fud attempt is this

http://www.coindesk.com/crisis-halving-bitcoin-mining/
 
Second they write articles without any proper information.
For example i read their last article about the recent federal reserve meeting for bitcoin and blockchain.

http://www.coindesk.com/central-banks-blockchain-federal-reserve/

Coindesk the only thing that write about Bitcoin is that banker have afraid it because Satoshi has not uncover his id.. lol
The story for what really happen to this conference is very difference if someone read it from an insider

http://www.caitlin-long.com/fedconference.html

....Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, demonstrated how bitcoin works by donating bitcoin to Wikipedia during his keynote speech.  Surely that made history as the first time a bitcoin transaction originated from the Fed’s boardroom (#probably)! ""

it seems that this was not so important for Coindesk to inform site readers about that historical transaction.

Examples like this is hundreds and show in my opinion how a well respectful crypto news site like Coindesk transform to a crap and manipulated news site like it is today.

personalfinance,"100k+ In Student Loans, Need Help with Private Loan Consolidation","Hello Reddit,
I’ve been struggling with my student loan for the last 5 years and I am in desperate need for help. I went to an Art Institute and most of my loans are private loans (with interest rates ranging from 7.5-13%) and my minimum payment per month is $1,580 which I have been making with sacrifices.  Since making those payments with a handful of deferments here and there when desperately needing them my loan has only went from 122k to 116k. With the decrease being small federal loans, and the bigger loans increasing.

The sob story is that I was the first person in my family to go to school and I wanted to be an animator. I didn’t know the pitfalls to avoid and was eager to live my dream, I didn’t know the school was so much more than others and didn’t know different types of loans. I wasn’t educated enough to make the decision and neither was my co-signer, my mother. Financial Aid seem to only be helpful if you was looking at Sallie Mae. I didn’t get much grants and I was 90% financed through Sallie Mae which now is Navient? 

The only reason I am able to survive is that I live in a low-income state and I work as a freelance animator. Ironically college was supposed to be a stepping stone for your dreams but has put a handicap on mine. I fear that I wouldn’t be able to live in a high-income place like California and be able to pay the loans. 

The following is a link to a spread sheet with all my individual loans information;
https://i.gyazo.com/ded779cf829f2bcd6b53788cf3efcffe.png

I know there are governmental forgiveness plans for Federal Loans, but honestly those are the easiest ones to pay off. I’m doing fine. I have a handful of them paid off. They’re easy to do the snowball effect.
I wanted to try and keep my private loans unconsolidated for the same reason, but the idea is so far out there at this point that I am now looking to consolidate. Navient apparently doesn’t do consolidation with the private loans and told me to look for a bank.
A couple of years back I tried to consolidate all my loans together but places like Wells Fargo told me I was too much a financial risk even though the payments were reasonable. My income to debt ratio wasn’t in my favor. I currently am looking for exclusively the private loans and I currently make 3,000 a month, guaranteed contract job. But that is also before taxes are taken out.

personalfinance,"New job, new 401k plan - what now? Roll 401k into new 401k? Leave it alone? Pay off student loans?","Hi guys,  
    
Hoping you can give me a bit of an idea of what to do at this juncture. I amassed a good amount of credit card debt that is paid off now, and want to concentrate on where to divert my savings, what to do with my current 401k, and minimizing tax burden.  
    
Without getting into specifics, I am married, and our combined incomes land us in the 33% federal tax bracket (and no amount of deductions are getting us to the lower one. The deductions we have get us AMT liability as is.) So no deduction for IRAs.  
    
401k eligibility is coming up for my new job, so here I am. I have:  
    
- 70k in a 401(k) from my previous employer  
- 60k or so in 6% or lower student loans  
- only 2k contributed this year because of job switching  
- company does not offer a match  
- have 3 months emergency fund  
    
So my questions are 1) what should I do with my current 401k? I understand ERISA protections and all, but I'm not comfortable leaving my money there -- my old company may not be around forever, and they use companies that seem somewhat fly-by-night that I've never heard of (but they invest in your average Vanguard, Schwab, etc. funds). Should I roll it into my new employer's 401k? Start an IRA?  and 2) What should I do with savings? Divert a bunch to the 401(k) beginning July to reduce AGI, then build up emergency fund, then pay down student loans? I am expecting a sizable bonus in January as well.",finance,1465242728

personalfinance,Canada Student Loan Repayment Ideas,"Hi all, 

Student loan payment question here, with what I think is an interesting and fun twist. 

I currently have $28k left of my student loan, which I’m paying at close to the minimum monthly rate (290$/ month). By the end of the year, I will have about CAD 25K saved up in my chequing account. That said, I am planning on moving countries – from Canada to London U.K. at the end of the year. I will find a job before I move, so I should see no interruption of income. An important thing for me is to have enough fuck-up money for when I move so that I am comfortable making mistakes (which I will make), AND 8 months of emergency living funds at my current living standards. This will leave me with a bunch of $k’s once my move is over that I’ll have left over. AND I’ll have about CAD 1700 saved up at the end of each month in London (after every bill/ rent/ fun/ misc. purchases/ etc). 

Now, my interest rate on my Canada student loans is about 5.2%. And I get tax deductions on the interest that I do pay (in theory - I don’t know if this helps me if I’m living abroad from then on). So I’m thinking I have three options here: 

1)	Pay it all off aggressively in a year.

2)	Pay a large amount initially, and then switch back into 290$ a month, and use every single penny left over to invest. 

3)	Keep it at minimum payments forever and invest. 

My #1 priority is having as much money once all is said and done as possible, and don’t care if I owe money on the loan forever, so long as I have the other money earning higher interest for me. It is option 2 that confuses me the most. Would this help at all, and if so, where is the optimal point? The idea is that I would pay less toward the interest, and have the money freed up to invest it. I’m looking for a calculator, or some equations that I can wrap my head around. 

Bonus question: does anybody know if the tax deductions on the interest would help me at all if I’m living abroad, and if so, roughly how much this help actually is. If I pay no tax, do I get money back, or just credits?",finance,1465246031

I recently graduated, going to be making $65k this year (once I start work) and am looking to buy a car in order to commute. Will be living at home so expenses will be minimal for a while.

Car in question costs ~$24000. I applied for a loan with my local credit union and they gave me an awesome interest rate @ 1.89% for cars 2011+. The problem is they won't approve me until after I get my first paycheck which poses a problem for how I intend on paying for my car.

I talked to the car salesman and his finance department can do the loan for around 4% after a $3000 down payment for 5 yrs. They also suggested that I refinance the auto loan with the credit union after I start generating income from my job.

I typed this into some calculators:
The estimated monthly payments going with dealer financing is about $390. If I did this for 4 months, and then refinanced with the credit union, my monthly payment would drop down to $372 but the interest would go from $1887 to $930.

So should I refinance with the credit union, and when? Should it be after I start getting more paychecks and paying off the dealer auto loan, or should I refinance as soon as I can get approved?

Please don't suggest getting a beater car or whatever until the job starts, this is the car I want and can afford, I did the math and my current savings are enough to last me well after I get my first paycheck and covers payments, insurance, registration, etc.

I'll begin by saying- no. I'm not an attention whore because I am a girl gamer.
I started when I was merely a toddler, and I got significantly more interested as I grew older.
From a personal standpoint, not having friends when you were in high school tends to lead someone to resorting to gaming because it's quite literally 'killing time'.

However, there's such a spiel about Girl Gamers. 
Not all of us are beautiful nor are we seeking attention. Personally I enjoy it for taking me deeper into the depths of my mind's capacity. Facing challenges that wouldn't arise in ordinary situations. I have made life-long friends and I just downright enjoy gaming.

My problem: The only masters degree program is in the NYU campus in Brooklyn, which is about 60 miles one way. Combine that with working just north of NYC and going to school, I can't see myself living in Westchester and suffering that ridiculous commute (gas, wear and tear on the car, tolls, and time consumption). 

I need to find a place to rent that I would actually be able to afford, thats somewhere in between my job and NYU.

personalfinance,"[Help] Need help juggling a mortgage, a new home, and getting married.","So to start this off, I really don't want a lecture on how I'm not fiscally responsible, or how my fiancé isn't fiscally responsible. I just want to get all my thoughts out and figure out how to do this right.

First, I have a great job and I make 65,000 a year. I've gotten two offers where I will be making 70,000 a year with better benefits. I haven't decided which offer to take up yet, so at this point location doesn't really matter I suppose. I'm looking to spend 200,000 to 250,000 on a house in a nice neighborhood for my fiancé, his son and I. I've applied and been approved for a mortgage of 250,000 paying 1,100 a month, not including local taxes. This is just one offer. 

I was going to have my fiancé cosign with me, but his ex wife ruined his credit while he was overseas (long story, just bear with me). He does have about 100,000 in equity in the house we are in. I just talked to the mortgage broker and he said that it would be much easier to get me qualified alone, because I have great credit. How do I use this money to put a down payment on a house without have taxes take a chunk out of it? (US)


So, (I know all about this, don't need a lecture) I owe about 15,000 in credit card debt and 20,000 in student loans, and 8,000 for a car. The student loans and car are at pretty low interest rates, but what I intend to do is get a payment low enough so that my fiancé only has to pay a very low amount for rent while he is in school. He only has two more years of school left and gets 1100 a month while in school (on school months), so that's about 900 a month if you redistribute it throughout the year. He gets child support for about 250 a month (which he is applying to have increased, his ex makes more than enough to afford more), and he has been going through the VA figuring out his disability (he has sleep apnea, so he should get at least 20% disability once that's done) and that should be figured out in about a week. 

The goal is, with the sale of the house, to use the equity to pay off my credit cards, his truck, and set him up to only owe about 300 a month, and put the rest in savings, and, of course, help with a down payment on the house.

With my credit cards paid off, I will easily be able to make rent myself, let alone with a small rent from my fiancé. 


But, there's a few things complicating the matter. First, there are about 5,000 dollars worth of upgrades to make at the current house. However, making these upgrades will make us quite a bit of money and if we don't make the upgrades, will cost us quite a bit. This isn't a huge issue, because the master bedroom and bathroom were disgusting and we renovated it (tiling, drywall, refinishing the bathtub, laying floor, painting, etc) so we might be able to work that price down if we do it ourselves. We may not have the time to do it, but I think we should. But even supplies are going to cost money, and I don't want to charge my credit cards more (where a lot of the debt came from in the first place) to make this modification happen. However, the mortgage broker said not to take out any loans or charge up my cards (I'm at 53% usage.. EEK) plus I have about 22,000 in a 401K

The most complicated aspect of this is we are contemplating getting married ahead of our ceremony to capitalize on the benefits of that, if it makes sense. I'm certain about this guy and I'm not worried about that aspect of it. He's getting a degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I'm confident in his ability to get the degree. 

What is our best play? Renting really isn't an option because we have four dogs, three of which are on everyone's breed restrictions.

Help?

personalfinance,A different twist on the question of buying elderly mother's home,"Hello Reddit. Long time lurker here on this sub. I'll try to keep this brief but any help is appreciated. Throw away account being used for privacy.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
So I've been supporting my 80yo mother financially for a couple of years now. She has no assets to her name minus her house (valued at $135ish - median housing price for her city) and her car valued at around $7k.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
As the only immediate family member, I am the sole heir (my father and brother passed away years ago).  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Her house currently has a single mortgage for about $65k. Neither she nor I have any debt.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
I'm interested in finding out the options for paying off her house outright and transferring it into my name. This will not deplete my savings or retirement as it would only be about 1/6 of my available invested funds.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
A further twist, she's in Tennessee and I live in California.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
I believe the pros are:  
1. I now own the property.  
2. Not having to deal with it when she passes as it will already be in my name and I will have enough to deal with.   
3. Not paying interest on a mortgage that I'm already paying monthly anyway.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
The questions/cons (or possible cons):  
1. Can she even transfer/gift the house to me if I pay off the mortgage? Tax implications of doing so.   
2. If I pay off the house by paying the bank directly, does she have to claim that money on taxes? Since she has no income she currently isn't required to file federally.   
3. I believe this changes the insurance held on the house since she would essentually be my tenant.   
4. My state/federal tax implications of having a house that I am essentually renting to my mother (if necessary she could pay $1 a month rent).  
  &amp;nbsp;  
Can anyone give me some advice here and/or direct me to any resources for the implications and options of doing this?  
  &amp;nbsp;  
I have a pre-paid legal plan at work that I've reached out to and am awaiting a callback but I assume they are going to tell me to contact a tax attourney which I will do, but I was hoping to get some info from my fellow redditors as well.

personalfinance,"GF and I just graduated college, got decent jobs. Where to from here?","I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, just looking for some general advice. My girlfriend and I (who are both 20) just graduated from a college and started new jobs the following weekend. We're both doing web / software development jobs, and live in Dayton Ohio area. My salary is 45k / year, and she makes $16 / hour right now but will likely sign on to a salary position in the next 3 months. We're both covered for medical/dental/vision on our parents insurance plans for a few more years. My job offers 401k as well as life / medical insurance as well.  For being right out of school, things are going pretty well. 

We both have $13k to pay back in federal student loans, and an additional $25k for her, $40k for me in student loans that we'll owe our back to our parents asap. I have about $2k in credit card debt to pay off as I wasn't able to work during the final semester of school, she has no credit card debt however since her parents helped her out.

Currently we share a small 2 bedroom apartment with 2 other roommates (4 tenants total) so our rent / utilities are really cheap per month ($200ish per person per month, after electric, water, utilities). Our lease is up in August and we're moving out, looking for a larger apartment / house to rent, something bigger that feels more home-y. Looking for a place for $600-$800 per month, which will be evenly split between the two of us. This will obviously cost more per month, but quality of life will be much better. Both of our credit scores are good.

We both drive older vehicles that are paid for, so no monthly car payments. We share a cell phone bill, usually $40 per month for the both of us ($40 total). Pay for high speed internet, no cable bill, no other real subscriptions or monthly charges to speak of. We don't eat out a lot, maybe 2/3 meals per week. Most of the time we hang out at home, play video games, or visit metro parks. Overall we try to be relatively frugal and save up as much as we can.

We're going to start seriously tracking / logging all receipts, purchases, pay stubs, and other finances in a spreadsheet so that we can better monitor our finances. Currently we both use Mint on our phones, and I was considering trying out YNAB (you need a budget).We are both pretty motivated work-wise, and our biggest goals right now are to find a new place, and pay off our student loan debts as quickly as we can.

We've dated for a few years and things are pretty serious, we're both comfortable with splitting bills and expenses evenly. No kids and no plans for kids. We have 2 cats, though.

With all this in mind, does /r/personalfinance have any suggestions as far as where to go from here? Things to be careful of? Ways to generally be smart with our money? To be completely honest I don't have a whole lot of knowledge when it comes to finances, so any help is appreciated.",finance,1465271391

investing,The Fed is trying to keep the stock market constrained to avoid a greater bubble.,"So thinking about the Fed and interest rates, and their continuing threat to raise rates, I came to a hypothesis that the Fed does not want to raise rates any more than they have to and are only doing so to prevent the stock market from running away. 

I think the fed knows that raising rates would have a detrimental impact on the American consumer and that the most recent jobs report hints that things aren't as strong as the Fed keeps telling us. But in order to prevent a massive market crash in the future, when rates inevitably return to ""normal"", they are using the threat of a rate hike to keep markets at bay. 

If this hypothesis is correct, the Fed won't raise rates until the market starts gaining momentum, and it will happen with a disregard to data about the economy. And  this would make the markets the leading indicator the Fed is looking at.

personalfinance,"Just graduated and looking for advice on how to handle new income, student loans, and a car purchase.","Edit: Added some more info.

Hi guys, thanks in advance for any advice. I have read many of the posts here and really enjoy the discussions, so I was hoping to get some insight to my own personal situation. 


**Salary:**

 $63k + $10k Signing bonus with first paycheck.

I will receive a 13% salary increase after one year. 

**Student Loans:**

Federal - $35k at 5.4%

Private - $11k at 9.49%

**More Info:**

  I would like to take care of this debt as quickly as possible. I will need to purchase a car to get to work since I do not currently own one. I would like to start letting compounding interest do its work as soon as possible by saving into my 401k or some other account. 


 I have several advantages that I am very grateful for that I believe are relevant. 
 I will be living with my parents to save money on rent/bills for an undecided amount of time, but not more than a year at the MOST. My brother will be interning at the same company as me, so he will be able to drive me to work until August if required. 


**Current Plan:**

I know this sub doesn't like cars worth more than $10k, but I have had really bad luck with cars in the past, and would really like something with low miles and a manufacturer's warranty left. I am aiming to spend no more than $20k on a car, and would like to put about $10k down and finance the rest. This will be my first purchase. I hope to not be on the hook for more than $250/month on car payments, but see myself paying more than the minimums after I get more settled.  My loans are deferred until December, however I will start paying them down after I get the car. If I want to do this in 5 years, my payments are approximated at $900/month. After estimated expenses, I would be able to save about $600/month into either a savings account or into my 401k. 



**Questions:**

* Should I be more focused on eliminating that $11k loan? Is it worth it to just pay it off outright using my signing bonus and then finance more of the car since I can definitely get a rate below 9.49%? I have good credit (756) from a card with a $2,000k limit that I have been using for a couple years. 

* My company doesn't match 401k until after the first year, should I focus on building a savings account this year before contributing? 

* ~~My federal loan is actually several smaller loans from different semesters, do I need to see more detail on each of these separate loans? I just got this number from the federal student loan website. Is 5.4% an average?~~ 

* Dug deeper and can now see  the individual interest rates for my separate fed loans. They vary from 3.86% to 6.8% (5.4% was the average.) Is consolidating my fed loans something I should look into?",finance,1465284985

Any advice will help at this point.","I'm not quite sure if there's much more I can do but I'm struggling to stay afloat as the sole provider in a household of 3. Currently, I'm working a $32k/year job with benefits and bringing home about $2.2k a month after taxes deductions. I'm slowly getting back on the horse after a 5 month stint on medical leave earlier this year which is why I'm so far behind in bills. But the debt I wracked up is starting to become overwhelming. 

I've acquired $1,000 in credit card debt (which I wouldn't have in the first place but it was either finance a credit card or don't have a car to drive around and actually get money). $1,000 in bank loans to just keep myself fed. And about $2,000 in medical bills. All of this was in the course of 2 months.

Putting together the costs from my bills, gas, rent, food, and minimum loan/credit card payments I have about $1,256 a month in fees just to stay afloat. And this is assuming that nothing else pops up in a month long period to add to that cost. 

So right now I'm owe about $4,000 in debts and loans and only make about $800 a month to spend on those in an ideal situation.

I take care of my 18 year old sister who has severe anxiety and depression that keep her from being able to function. I'm having her apply for disability within the week to get that ball rolling but having gone through the process myself I know how long it takes. It's not something that we can rely on and even if she qualifies for it, it'll be months before she sees a check. Her boyfriend moved in with us to help out and he's looking for a job to help out and doing a damn fine job of it too. So I'll have that to help out as well.

That being said, I'm not sure how to get ahead of where I am now outside of hunkering down and working another job altogether. I'm currently searching around for something that fits within my rigid hours at my current job but it's becoming an exhausting seach that's bearing little fruit. 

Is there anything I can do outside of making like Yurgis Rudkis from The Jungle and just working harder?

* Emergency fund established that will provide for at least 1 year of living expenses
* Remainder of money goes into low cost index funds with heavy allocation towards s&amp;p and other world stock indexes. (age: early 30s so i feel i can afford to be risky)
* Mortgage has just over 150k left @ 3.5%, 25 years remain of 30. Fixed rate. No other debts. 
* I would need to sell ~130k (of 280k total) of non-retirement index fund investments to payoff mortgage.

I keep reading that investing the money would pay off more in the long run. But then other advice is that past performance of the stock market returning 7% annually or whatever over the long term has no guarantees. I get worried about ""missing out"" either way. If I pay off the mortgage i give up stock market gains but save on interest. If I keep it all in the market and hope to make more than my 3.5% interest rate....I might not. The mortgage interest tax deduction only saves me ~1000 a year so the argument that its a great tax advantage doesn't really hold up.

What have others done? I want to be debt free and stop throwing money at the bank every month, but the cost of giving up 25 years of (potential) gains/compounding of 130k of investments makes me hesitant.",finance,1465303433

I also have a brokerage account that has my emergency fund and additional retirement funds, and there's around $10,000 in there. 

MY SITUATION:
My previous position paid $70,000 and change, and my new one pays $55,000 and doesn't offer a 401(k). The work is way more awesome! But they don't offer a 401(k). My 401(k) barely has fees at all and I'm allowed to keep it there as long as I wish. Within 3 years, once I go from fellowship to full federal employment (it's pretty much a guarantee), my salary will jump to $90,000+ instantly given my education and years of experience, and within 10 years, I'll qualify for the backdoor Roth income-wise. 

MY PLAN:
My plan is to keep my 401(k) as is, roll it over to the federal one when the time comes, and then to start contributing to a backdoor Roth using brokerage funds when I hit the income requirement. Obviously I'll continue to max out the Roth and 401(k) as I go along (and once my 401(k) is matched again). I don't want to open a traditional IRA until I can use the backdoor so I don't have to pay a lot of taxes.

Lightning is anti-p2p: it brings back the middlemen, it ""re-intermediates"".","**Summary:**

https://youtu.be/Eco8NgqJV18?t=477

- The above link is a video of an *earlier* event, the DC Blockchain Summit, where Chain CEO Adam Ludwin handed a $20 bill to an audience member, and then explained that with ""bearer instruments"" such as cash and on-chain bitcoin, ""the payment and the settlement are one and the same action.""

- Hopefully later someone might be able to provide a video of his *more recent* speech at the Fed, where he sent $10 from his smartphone to Wikipedia, in front of a crowd of central bankers:

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/central-bankers-told-they-should-be-sprinting-toward-blockchain

Meanwhile, Blockstream's proposed ""Lightning Network"" would be a step *backwards* from transacting directly on-chain using Bitcoin, or directly handing someone cash.

Despite what many of its apologists say, Lightning would not really be Bitcoin: because it only uses the *crypto* aspects of Bitcoin, but not the *network* aspects.

A Lightning transaction would *not* be a ""bearer instrument"". 

Instead, Lightning would rely on middlemen, *re-introducing intermediaries back into the system which Bitcoin disintermediated* - so they can continue to control us and rob us.

---

**Details:**

Many of you know that history was made this week - when Alan Ludwin, CEO of Chain, gave a speech on ""blockchain technology"" at the Fed - in the historic Eccles building, in a room whose walls are covered by historical examples of ""bearer instruments"" including ""framed currencies such as an antique U.S. $10,000 bill"".

During his speech, he gave a live demo of a newer *(digital)* ""bearer instrument"": he pulled out his smartphone and made a $10 donation to Wikipedia - live, in front of an audience of central bankers:

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-06/central-bankers-told-they-should-be-sprinting-toward-blockchain

---

At an earlier speech at the DC Blockchain Summit available on YouTube, this same Alan Ludwin (CEO of Chain, which provides blockchain technology for institutions), also did another demo, this time of a *(paper)* ""bearer instrument"": he pulled a $20 bill out of his pocket and handed it to a guy sitting in the front row of the audience, and told him to keep it.

You can jump into the clip of that earlier demo here:

https://youtu.be/Eco8NgqJV18?t=477

A few seconds into this clip he makes a very, very important point about ""bearer instruments"" (whether it's an antique $10,000 bill, a $20 bill that you hand to somebody, or bitcoins that you send **on-chain**):

- ""The payment and the settlement are actually one and the same action.""

- ""In other words, we've collapsed things that we think of as different steps in the financial system, into one step.""

**""The payment and the settlement are actually one and the same action.""**

So, when you:

- hand a $20 bill to someone

- send bitcoins **on-chain** - ie using Satoshi's Bitcoin (""a p2p electronic cash system"")

... **the payment and the settlement are actually one and the same action.**

*This* is the essential aspect of Bitcoin-as-a-payment-network (without even mentioning Bitcoin-as-a-store-of-value - money that can't be devalued by government printing).

With Bitcoin, you get rid of the inefficient middlemen and intermediaries of the legacy financial system - the busybodies and leeches and crooks who meddle into your personal life and take days to ""settle"" your transactions while sometimes refusing to serve you, or allowing thieves to steal your identity or even your money - and then to top it off, these same inefficient parasitical intermediaries have the nerve to charge trillions of dollars in fees for the ""privilege"" of using their slow creaky insecure antiquated virus-plagued systems (mostly based on ancient technology invented way back in the 1950s).

As we all know, with Bitcoin, to send a digital ""bearer instrument"" (or ""p2p electronic cash"" as Satoshi phrased it, in the title of [his groundbreaking whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)), you simply broadcast your transaction to a network of unpermissioned nodes, and the receiver on the other end receives it - with nobody snooping into the transaction, nobody slowing it down, nobody invading your privacy, nobody threatening to block your payment, nobody opening you up to theft of your funds or you identity - and nobody charging you hefty fees for all these dubious ""privileges"".

**Lightning Network is off-chain and centralized: it reintroduces the middlemen.**

Oftentimes you hear certain people claim that ""a Lightning transaction *is* a Bitcoin transaction.""

But those kinds of people are aren't quite telling the truth. 

The only part of a Lightning transaction that ""is"" Bitcoin is the less-interesting aspect of Bitcoin-as-a-payment-system: the *cryptographic signatures*. 

Meanwhile, the more-interesting aspect - the *p2p networking* - is *gone* in the Lightning approach.

So Lightning only preserves the *cryptographic* part of Bitcoin. It does *not* preserve the *network* part of Bitcoin - which is the most important aspect of Bitcoin-as-a-payment-system.

**When you use the Lightning Network, ""the payment and the settlement are *not* the same.""**

This is why Lightning would be a step *backwards*:

Because a Lightning transaction is *not* a ""bearer instrument"". 

**What do Blockstream's owners [(accounting giant PwC, insurance giant AXA)](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=axa+OR+pwc&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) *really* want?**

When people complain that Blockstream wants to ""make money off of Lightning Network"", they're only seeing a tiny aspect of the ""conspiracy theory"".

No, the *real* ""conspiracy theory"" is much, much worse than that.

**The goal of Lightning Network is to again reintroduce intermediaries into the system - separating payment from settlement - bringing back the middlemen and the leeches and the snoops and the thieves.**

They do *not* want you transacting directly with other people *on-chain.*

They want to force you *off-chain*, back onto their centralized hubs, so they can keep their power over you and keep stealing from you.

**We could actually have *both* - on-chain and off-chain transactions - but Blockstream doesn't want this.**

Complicated off-chain approaches like Lightning *might* have been ok, if Blockstream had *also* worked on simple on-chain scaling approaches as well (bigger blocks)

This would allow you to *choose* between:

- *on-chain* p2p transactions using Satoshi's Bitcoin directly, or

- *off-chain* centralized transactions using Blockstream's / Adam Back's complicated and centralized ""level 2 solution"", Lightning Network.

But Blockstream revealed their true, anti-p2p agenda - when they refused a blocksize increase.

OK, fine - then maybe they just want to work on the ""complicated"" off-chain stuff - and maybe they could let other people to the less-glamorous stuff like simply changing a 1 to a 2 in the code.

But watch what they're doing: They're fighting tooth-and-nail against *other* people changing a 1 to a 2 in the code.

**Blockstream's real goal is to prevent you from doing cheap fast p2p on-chain transactions.** 

This is why Blockstream is:

- *pushing* complicated messy ""features"" that *they* want, which all happen to be pre-requisites for Lightning: eg, RBF and now SegWit

- desperately trying to *censor* and *suppress* the clean simple features that *we* want, eg:

  - simple, safe, on-chain scaling (to avoid unnecessary high fees and congestion) via an immediate blocksize increase - already available using other clients such as Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited;

  - faster and more efficient block-relaying via the new [Xthin technology](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4mt5tc/part_4_of_5_towards_massive_onchain_scaling_xthin/).

**Judge them by their actions, not by their words.**

They don't want you transacting directly on-chain using a digital bearer instrument.

They're trying to force you back into being controlled and robbed by intermediaries.",cryptocurrency,1465313740

Recently however, I received an $11,000 bill coming from a non-participating provider, consisting of ""surgery assistance"" and ""inpatient physician"" services for the 2nd non-emergency surgery, even though the surgery itself was covered by a specialist in-network.  According to my insurance company, this is because the hospital that performed the surgery was not able to find anyone in my network (I have a very good federal government plan, although it is the basic option) to cover this ""surgery assistance"" service.

Obviously, I plan on disputing this charge.  Do you have any recommendations on what angle I should take in the letter requesting reconsideration?  I plan on emphasizing the fact that I was never notified by the hospital that they were using out-of-network assistance for this non-emergency surgery, nor was I ever even given other options despite being completely conscious at this point.  Additionally, this second surgery had been scheduled for over 2 days after my emergency operation was performed.  The hospital had all of my insurance information and used in-network services for everything, even the emergency operation.  I find it difficult to understand how they were unable to find surgery assistance for an operation they knew was occurring two days in advance.

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1465314382

1) FMDCX Federated Mid-Cap Index Service with an expense ratio of .56% - 65% of my portfolio

2) FMXSX Federated Max-Cap Index Service with an expense ratio of .66% - 25% of my portfolio

3) FTRFX Federated Total Return Bond Service with an expense ratio of .68% - 10% of my portfolio

These three were the ""best"" options I had given they had expense ratios of &lt;1% and no front or back end fees.

The following will be my new options:

**DODFX Dodge &amp; Cox International Stock Fund - expense ratio .64%**

FVADX Franklin Small Cap Value Advisor - expense ratio .87%

**VLCAX Vanguard Large Cap Index Admiral - expense ratio .08%**

**VIMAX Vanguard Mid Cap Index Admiral - expense ratio .08%**

MXFRX Great-West Financial Institutional High Yield Bond - expense ratio .75%

**MWTIX Metropolitan West Total Return Bond Institutional - expense ratio .44%**

POIXX Federal Insitutional Prime Obligations Fund Institutional (MM) - expense ratio .2%

I'm considering the options that are bolded, but I don't know how to narrow it down to maximize my portfolio. I'm almost 29, so Boggleheads recommends bonds of 29%. BCOIX is invested 5.15% cash, 94.82% bonds, and .03% other. Of those bonds, 84.66% are US and 15.34% are foreign. MWTIX is invested 3.99% cash, 94.41% bonds, and 1.6% other. Of those bonds, 95.89% are US and 4.11% are foreign. I'm leaning more towards BCOIX because it has a better US/Foreign bond breakdown and has a lower expense ratio.

Boggleheads also recommends having 20% of my stocks in international stocks. For that purpose, I'm considering investing in DODFX since it is 86.30% foreign stocks with a low-ish expense ratio of .64%. The only other option with a high international stock percentage is OSMYX, but it has a 1.18% expense ratio.

If I go with those investment percentages, that leaves 51% to go towards US stocks. And that's where I'm looking towards the Vanguard options. I'm thinking about doing 21% in VSGAX, 15% in VLCAX, and 15% in VIMAX.

Does this sound like a good plan?

BCOIX 29%

DODFX 20%

VSGAX 21%

VLCAX 15%

VIMAX 15%

financialindependence,"For a lump sum of money, it appears that it's pretty much always more beneficial to have a larger down payment than investing it","*rather than investing it

Am I missing something here? I currently have a portfolio of $40k+ and we are buying a house very soon. The ""worst"" mortgage rate we've received so far is 2.37% (25-year fixed rate mortgage), so I've simulated some scenarios based on keeping my portfolio invested vs. cashing out and adding to the down payment. I've always figured that it's much better to invest the money since current mortgage rates are so low, but apparently not! I think a lot of people forget that when you decide to use the money for a larger down payment, you also lower the monthly expenses (which is a big win as every FI'er knows). Only starting from an annual interest rate of 8% is where it starts to get interesting to keep the money invested. Here's some examples to show what I'm talking about:

    [MR 2.37] Calculating retirement with initial portfolio of $40000, interest rate of 4%, monthly/yearly expenses of $2167.87/$26014.44 ($1237.87 mortgage) and monthly contributions of $1998.79666667
    16 years, 10 months until retirement - 43 years old
    [MR 2.37] Calculating retirement with initial portfolio of $30000, interest rate of 4%, monthly/yearly expenses of $2123.66/$25483.92 ($1193.66 mortgage) and monthly contributions of $2043.00666667

    16 years, 4 months until retirement - 43 years old

Next, for an interest rate of 7% (here's where it starts to become more interesting to invest):

    [MR 2.37] Calculating retirement with initial portfolio of $40000, interest rate of 7%, monthly/yearly expenses of $2167.87/$26014.44 ($1237.87 mortgage) and monthly contributions of $1998.79666667
    13 years, 8 months until retirement - 40 years old
    [MR 2.37] Calculating retirement with initial portfolio of $30000, interest rate of 7%, monthly/yearly expenses of $2123.66/$25483.92 ($1193.66 mortgage) and monthly contributions of $2043.00666667
    13 years, 9 months until retirement - 40 years old

    13 years, 9 months until retirement - 40 years old

But still only a difference of just a single month! Finally, here are the results for an annual interest rate of 8% on the investments:

    13 years, 2 months until retirement - 40 years old

Since I like to play it safe, I prefer using an investment rate of 4% vs. the typical 7% but as you can see, it hardly makes a difference. Right now I'm strongly considering the larger down payment since I much prefer the lower monthly expenses vs. the 1-2 months I could retire earlier.

*edit: From the insights gained in this thread, this is mainly interesting if you wish to retire ASAP (without regard for the additional gains from investing). As pointed out, the lower monthly expenses (due to the larger down payment) resulted in a lower required net worth for retirement vs. the other scenario; but that's assuming the expenses will remain the same after retirement (which only applies to the first 10 years after retirement since by then the mortgage will be paid off). Here are the results, including net worth:

personalfinance,"Thinking about bankruptcy [30/m], need advice","Hi all,

So my wife and I let our spending get out of control over the last couple years and have 2racked up about $21,000 in CC debt. Additionally, I have some student loan debt. I know the student loan debt isn't dischargeable, but we're thinking about bankruptcy to take the edge off the CC debt and then sticking to our new budget to get everything else paid off. 

**Important Info**

30yo male, married, 2 kids (3 and 5)

Employed - $94,000/yr ($25% of that is withheld for taxes and health insurance), so I net $6k/mo

CC Debt: $21,000 (over limit by $4k, so have to pay that before I can even do monthly payments)

Bar Exam Loan: $12,000 (technically not a student loan, and debtors have been successful in getting these discharged)) ($150/mo payment)

Private Student Loan: $13,000 ($150/mo payment

Federal Student Loans: ~$200,000 (currently on IBR, paying $300/mo. I know, I know.)

Van: Owe $13,000, monthly payment of $300

Car: Own, no payment

Rent a small 3bed house: $1,200 (Nevada, fwiw)


We also have several hundred dollars a month in recurring medical expenses, in addition to preschool for the kids (so technically not ""necessities"" but they're higher on the list than most other things.

We just started Dave Ramsey's FPU (its working to get us on the same page, develop a good budget and habits, etc.) and after doing our initial budget we can throw about $800/mo at the CC debt (apart from payments on van/student loans/bar loan)


I'm not too worried about being able to get on track, and honestly if I can get rid of $30k of debt that would be a significant help in getting back on top of things. Job is stable, no concerns there. I realize the negative aspects of bankruptcy - bad credit, rent/buy is difficult, can't use it again, etc.

I also did some sample means test calculator online to determine if I can file Chapter 7 and it said that I could, but does anyone have any additional resources on that? Obviously I'll want to consult with a lawyer but I figured I'd ask all you good folks here first. Any advice or insight anyone has would be very welcome.",finance,1465322520
investing,Questions about the FED balance sheet and The Monetary Base,"So the monetary base rose dramatically starting 2008.

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/BOGMBASE

I read that the currency in circulation has not spiked, because the increase in monetary base was use to tie up balance sheets on the big banks.  

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/MBCURRCIR

The article I was looking at indicated that the FED total assets would shrink back as the big banks start paying off the loans from the FED.

https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/WALCL

Ok... so is the growth in the monetary base directly tied to the FED assets?  If the big banks start paying off their loans successfully, will the monetary base shrink back down?

Lastly, what does the FED balance sheet look like?  Assets = Liabilities + Owner Equity.  If they are growing their assets side, what's funding that?  Where's the liabilities?  Why, when they take care of their liabilities, would the monetary base go back down?

And to tie it into this subreddit... how can you successfully invest, knowing all of the above.",finance,1465322867

I have a fed subsidized federal loan of 18.5k @ 6% and a federal subsidized loan of 46.5k @ 6%. I was looking at refinancing the 46.5k loan to see if i could get a better interest rate. I got an offer for a fixed 8 year loan at 5.5%. So my payment would be $599 which is really close to what an 8 year repayment would be at 6%...$610. Thats only savings of $132 a year. Making that payment plust the payment on the other two loans would be about what we've been paying each month.

My wife and I have been working on our credit for almost the same amount of time and our scores have gone from 525 up to 692 currently. 

Here is the information on my current loan, and the new loan I was offered. It seems like a great deal, but I just wanted to get a sanity check before I go through with it.

Current Loan


* Balance: 11,793
* Monthly Payment: 454
* Interest Rate: 11.99

* 11,793 Payoff

* GAP Insurance provided

personalfinance,I have a question on most efficient way to pay back student loans.,"I have approximately 140k in student loans.  I have 7 separate loans, all federal and none private.  5 are Direct Loan Unsubsidized.  2 are Direct Grad Plus Loans.  My question is specifically geared towards paying the 2 Grad Plus loans because they each have the highest principle and are at the highest rates.  (All of the following figures are directly from the servicer's website).

Loan 1:  $30180 is owed in principle at a rate of 7.9%.  So, over the life of the loan, roughly $55000 will be paid at this moment in time.  

Loan 2:  $36360 is owed in principle at a rate of 6.410%.  So, over the life of the loan, roughly $53000 will be paid out at this moment in time. 

After paying my standard monthly bill for all 7 loans every month, I have been taking every extra cent I have towards Loan 1 since it had the highest principle and the highest rate.  

Now, my specific question:  After a couple more payments, the total money that I will owe over the life of Loan 2 will be higher than Loan 1 despite it being at a lower interest.  What is the most efficient way to pay off these loans when that happens?  

1.  Do I need to start splitting all extra money evenly between both loans for each extra payment I make?
2.  Do I keep paying down Loan 1 entirely (since it has the highest rate) until it is through and then start with Loan 2?
3.  Do I continually switch back and forth between each loan and pay whatever extra money I have towards the loan that at the specific time has the highest total principle over the life of the loan?

I feel like this is a simple arithmetic question, but I am asking for help because this is a lot of money I am dealing with and I don't want to have to spend any extra if I don't have to.  I really appreciate any help anyone can provide.  Thank you.",finance,1465334528

personalfinance,$55K in Student Loans paid off in under a year!,"Hi PFers,

So here's my story. I graduated with a MBA debt free at the end of 2013. I met my wife when she was just starting her masters in accounting. When I met her, she had roughly $50K in debt from her undergrad degree and her first semester in grad school. At this point, I had some money saved. We talked about it and she agreed she did not want to get into more debt. We started saving money and spent the next couple of years paying her tuition out of pocket. After we paid for her final fall semester back in July of 2015, we decided it's time to start paying off her debt. I looked online and noticed the debt had climbed to $55K as one of her loans had a 6.7% interest rate on $20K. I quickly took out all of my savings from my index fund and threw it towards that loan. Once that one was paid off, I systematically paid off the loans that had already started accruing interest as they were not subsidized. Once that was done, I started paying off the loans that were subsidized, highest interest rate first. My wife graduated last December and I believe she was about to start incurring interest this month. We paid off the debt at the end of May. I'm so happy to finally be out of the debt. Now each dollar that we earn is ours to keep! 

My bit of advice to others is sacrifice every thing for a few months. Live with your parents. Cut out all entertainment. Carpool with a friend. Eat Ramen Noodles. Just get out of that debt as fast as possible. It seems impossible at first, but once you finish, you can breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy the rest of your life.",finance,1465340041

Question 1: what would be my rate of return on the purchase? Based on what I've calculated, it would be around 10% on average over the life of the loan. The house is worth several thousand dollars over the principal so not entirely worried about default but there is that risk.

During the construction loan process, our loan originator mentioned that our credit scores were not as high as we thought (previously 825 for me and 790 for my wife) since we said how high they were when we bought our land a few months ago. My wife's score was all over the place from the three bigs. Her high was 796 and her low was 684. It turns out, Equifax has a new negative for a collection worth $25 from August 2011 that was just reported May 2016. It was paid. There was an issue with the bills at the time since my wife accumulated a bit of debt when we battled a few miscarriages.

My questions are:
Is there any law about the amount of time they can file a negative?
Is there anything we can do besides a dispute?

Experian and Transunion are both good and not showing the negative. It is bringing down her score significantly. It is not a huge deal right now since the construction loan is fixed at 2.8% as long as your have a 680. My perm loan is my concern.

General living expenses - 
Rent/utilities - $850/mo total (live in AZ, low cost of living)
Car Payments - $650/mo total (I lease @350/mo and she financed)
Food - $800/mo total (we eat all organic, it gets expensive)
Storage Unit - $150/mo (I moved into her 1bd/1ba condo after marriage)

One of the big things on the plate is purchasing a house.  We are looking in the 300k range.  I have a basic understanding of market price vs interest rate, and am curious whether we should be waiting to purchase the house (some say the housing market is going to dip over the next 10-16 months), or taking advantage of low interest rates.  I have worked very hard to save the money I have (I brought the majority to the joint account), and want to make sure I am investing it wisely when I do.  Is now the time to start looking into real estate (first time home buyers btw).  For reference - we are looking in the 280-320k range for a home.

Also, what other investments should I be looking into?  Neither of us have expensive hobbies (maybe we go on a nice trip here and there on our dollar, but I have a couple of corporate sponsored vacations throughout the year as well for 2, so we don't have a huge desire to travel more), or have any major personal purchases coming up that are planning on.  The lease on my car comes up next April, so I have some time to plan for that.

Thoughts, PF?",finance,1465354416
personalfinance,"To Buy or Rent? A student with some money to spend, is it too soon or too risky to buy?","So I'm trying to decide if I should buy or rent a house. Currently I'm a college student, I went to community college for two years and in the fall I'm transferring to a public university. It's far enough away that I can't reasonably commute from where I live now with my father. On campus housing is quite expensive. So I've ruled that out. I have three friends who are serious about moving to the area with me.

So I'm torn between two options, either renting a place or taking out a loan and buying a house. Currently I have $50k in the bank set aside for school (money left for me by my mother in the form of life insurance when she passed away). Tuition and books at the university I'm going to attend is just under $10k a year. So two years, and I'm looking at $20k for school, leaving me with $30k in savings. I might work while I'm in school, but not a whole lot, so it's not a substantial source of income. I'll also need to probable use some of that savings for living expenses such as food. So maybe put aside another $10k to be generous.

So I'm left with $20k for housing. Now my question is this: should I use that money to pay rent, or should I try to take out a loan and use it as a down payment and for closing costs? The three potential roommates I have are committed. So if I bought a house they'd be basically paying the mortgage for me since I'd be putting down the money up front and taking on the risk. They all work pretty much full time and only one of them is in school, and it's online. And they said they'd sign leases so they wouldn't just jump ship.

I'd be looking at houses in the $100k-$200k range. So if I put $20k down that's 10%-20%.
So is it worth the risk? I really like the idea of using the money as an investment as well as for housing. I plan on going to medical school in the state after undergrad, so I'll probably be in the area. But I'm not looking at having a substantial income for at least 6 years. So in the event that I couldn't find renters I might be in trouble...
I have pretty good credit, I got a credit card a few years ago and I've always paid it on time. My credit is upwards of 720.

The other issue would be getting the loan. I'm thinking I would probably need a co-signer in order to not have a crazy interest rate, since my yearly income is low.
Maybe I'm crazy for even considering it. What do you guys think?",finance,1465354630

personalfinance,"New user here. Need some serious advice here ,very unsure what to do with my large student debt, of around 37,000. 28,000 of that is parent PLUS, 8,000 is in my name. Parents cannot give me any money i am attempting to pay this off by myself at home.","Hey guys. I should've posted here a long time ago but I was sort of nervous to because I'm inexperienced. 
I am currently 22, live in WNY with my parents still, making about $12.12/hr with raises every year. 
So this is my situation:
When I was 18, i dormed to an out-of-state school and money had little meaning to me. I thought sure, I can make 100 grand a year doing what I originally enrolled in. I went for 3 semesters, was incredibly irresponsible with my time, developed an Adderall addiction, and dropped out. I didn't bother looking for a job for like 6 months, because once again I was irresponsible and thought I could just teach myself programming and go into a job. 
Thankfully, I ended up in a job that pays better than minimum and get raises every year.

The thing is, that I didn't have a car. I could then only work 25 hours a week, because I'm scheduled part-time, and I had to use my mom's car to get there.  I picked up on the weekends a bunch and worked a few weeks/months in a row, and I finally am getting a car tomorrow. Now I can work a bunch as well as explore other opportunities. 

My debt is as follows: 

**parent PLUS loans:**

$9,569.29   @    6.41%

$19,782.73  @ 7.90%


**MY federal direct student loans:**

$3,306.34 @ 3.40%

$2,149.50 @ 6.80%

$1,665.64 @ 3.86%

$965.54 @  3.86%


I took out a small personal loan for my car that I just bought

**Personal Loan:**

$2,000 @ 5.99%



I live with my parents. They mostly pay for all of my living expenses, thankfully. However, I don't their exact finances but they've said again and again they CANNOT help me with my loans at all. Period. They completely refuse to even factor it in their budget. Even though that it's in their name, and I could technically completely blow it off but I cannot do that to my parents. My minimum payment on my student loans is 500 bucks a months which is super steep for my income level. It'll be getting better now that I can pick up more hours, but for a long time I was floating between $500-$1,500 dollars in my bank account, just paying the monthly minimum payment and getting NOWHERE. It was incredibly frustrating and my parents couldn't grasp my frustration: ""well you're paying them off I don't see where the issue is!"". Sorry thats neither here nor there. 


So now this is where I need advice: 

So I'm 22. My youth is running out. I need to figure out what to do with my life. I was teaching myself how to program for quite a while, and I recently completed a year-long Udacity Android Nanodegree. I'm glad that I have completed it but I'm not sure I want to do that for the rest of my life, it felt very isolating and like I always need to keep learning in order to even stay relevant. Working 60+ hours a week on salary in my own head sounds awful for my mental health and my social life, and I place a very high value on a healthy social life. 

I am now thinking about joining the military, to become an aircraft mechanic and get a job at an airport by the time I'm out and throw all my money at my loans while in the military because they pay for housing and food while im in there. 

My other option is to go to school for it, but that's a few towns over at 13,500 a year, and I'd only need to go for a year to get my A&amp;P cert. The problem is, I don't have 13,500 a year, and that's not including living expenses that I cannot afford because of my debt. 

The thing is, I honestly do not have any experience with mechanics. I just find them very interesting but I have literally 0 experience with working on cars and stuff like that. Should I take a crack at it somehow before I plunge into something? 

I'm kind of at a crossroads. Should I just try and pick up a whole shitload of hours and throw all my money at my debt? That's the simplest option but it'd still take me a minimum of 2-3 years I believe to pay everything off, and I wouldn't have any more marketable skills. Who knows if my job will be around for that long? I need to get skills to make myself more marketable.

Please /r/personalfinance, I'm really lost here. I seriously appreciate any and all advice or input on my situation at all. I feel very stuck and scared for my future.",finance,1465357414
personalfinance,Question about unsecured debt and hospital bills upon death [US],"I have a close friend who had a relative pass. I'm the somewhat educated one in the clique, so I get to field questions like this, and I'm a bit out of my league on this, so here goes:

When one dies, and has unsecured credit card balances (of any amount, I don't know any actuals here), and if there are no co-signers on the account, that debt is non-collectible, and should be discharged, correct? 

I've googled this, and the top hits in my search make no differentiation between secured and unsecured debt. I always understood it that unsecured debt, like a revolving credit card, charges a higher interest rate to cover their risk of the debt. I.e. you - the consumer - are paying more for it for the benefit of not fronting a collateral to obtain that loan.  Obviously, the reverse also being true - a secured loan (like a HELOC) carries a lower interest rate because the risk to the lender is much lower. 

I believe I understand that correctly -- no obligation to repay unsecured debt upon death, assuming no co-signer.  I see the argument sometimes brought forward about ""moral obligation to pay"" - which I don't buy into, being that both parties (bank and cardholder) agree that the debt is unsecured, and there's a premium on that already in the form of an interest rate that's usually double or triple the secured rate. 

So, what about hospital bills?  Our friend was in and out of the hospital, and although had insurance, I'm sure the out-of-pocket maximum, whatever that is, maybe $3000 give or take, is now or is about to be billed to him by the hospitals/doctors.

Since the relative was older and on social security, they had money - not wealthy, but not street poor. Had medicare insurance. Will Filial laws come into play (we are in one of the 29 states that have this) to cause the family or the estate to be responsible for the charges? I believe they put one of their hospital co-pays on one of the above credit cards, btw.",finance,1465357709

I'm 24 years old and looking to buy my first home in NC. I currently do not live in NC, but will be moving there in the near future. I have lived there in the past (not a blind move by any means). Some background information:

* $85,000 salary, stable job
* $51,000 in investments
* $11,000 in debt (low interest rate car loan/student loan)
* $10,000 in cash

I've been putting a lot of my funds into investments, hence why I don't have a lot of cash on hand. I could definitely access some of these funds for a down payment, if necessary. I'm ideally looking for a place between $200k and $300k (if this is not feasible, please feel free to let me know).

personalfinance,Cash-Out Refi...VA or Conventional?,"I'm looking to start the process for a cash-out refinance on my home to do some renovations and am trying to weigh the benefits of a VA vs. a Conventional Loan.  I currently have a VA loan and have been making payments on it now for just over two years.  Basically, I've paid off the funding fee.  The original loan with the funding fee was $257,000.  Currently, it's down to $248K and I'm trying to pull $50K out to renovate my kitchen and potentially build a separate garage.  I expect my appraisal value to come in around $350K based on comps and what's happening to the market in my area.  Being that I already have a VA loan, I know the benefits of it but I'm a little apprehensive about incurring another funding fee.  

The interest rates I qualify for both seem comparable (+750 credit score for both me and my wife).  It looks like my payment between the two borrowing the same amount would differ by about $30 a month (more for the conventional) but that's not completely weighing in on closing costs as those seem to be a complete mystery to your mortgage broker until the week before closing.  All that would be required by me beforehand is an appraisal plus some fees for credit checks.  Also, VA is currently doing cash-out refi's at 100% loan to value where conventional loans are at about 95%.  

Any advice on which might be better considering swapping to a conventional loan on this home would open my options for using my VA benefit on another home when I have to re-locate (still full Active Duty)?",finance,1465370233

personalfinance,Tackling student loans during grace period: unsubsidized + lower interest rate OR subsidized + higher interest rate?,"[I made a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4maqyi/out_of_college_32000_income_36000_student_loans/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) a few days ago and took everyone's advice on paying off my highest interest rate loan ($2,000 @ 6.8%). I'm wondering what the financially optimal situation is from here. My next goal is to make payments towards the next one.

I'm currently in my grace period, with 5 months before official repayment begins. I think it would make sense to first go after my Unsubsidized Stafford Loan 2 ($2,000 @ 4.66%). Assuming I pay this off before repayment begins and can start making payments towards the next one, should I go after Subsidized Stafford 3 or Unsubsidized Stafford 3? Although interest doesn't accrue on the subsidized one until my grace period is over, it has a higher interest rate.

**Summary of Loans**

Loan | Principal | Interest Rate | Accrued Interest
------------------|---------|-------------|----------------
Subsidized Stafford 1 | $3,500 | 3.4% | $8.12
Unsubsidized Stafford 1 | $2,000 | 3.86% | $201.99
Subsidized Stafford 2 | $4,500 | 3.86% | $11.86
Unsubsidized Stafford 2 | $2,000 | 4.66% | $150.66
Subsidized Stafford 3 | $5,500 | 4.66% | $0
Unsubsidized Stafford 3 | $2,000 | 4.29% | $52.19
Subsidized Stafford 4 | $5,500 | 4.29% | $0

personalfinance,Utilize student loans to pay off CC debt?,"Hi PF,

I'm a student working towards a bachelors degree in Information Systems, I expect to be making a very livable wage ($60k at least) after graduation (2.5-3 years). For the upcoming year, I have been offered a total of $13,300 in grants and loans:

* Federal Direct Subsidized Loan: $5500
* Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan: $7000
* Tuition Assistance Grant: $800
* Expected Total Costs 2016-2017: ~$10,000

I currently have about $6000 in CC debt from being underemployed for about 2 years and using credit to make up the difference. I have a plan to get this all paid off by September 2017, give or take, but I'm wondering if I should just take the full aid amount and use the extra $3300 to pay off a chunk of my debt, since the interest rate is so much lower, and then work on making payments towards student loans once I get the CC debt paid off (probably Spring 2017). Is this a bad idea?

A few other pieces of info:

* Currently make about $31k per year
* Currently have $10k in student loans (about half sub, half un-sub)
* Combined household income about $55k
* Trying to allocate about $400 per month to CC debt
* No significant savings, but working on it",finance,1465391329

In the ideal situation, I net around $550 on average biweekly. I've been lucky enough and thankful as my parents pay for housing, food, phone, insurance, etc. I only pay for the small stuff like gym, spotify, netflix. Being in college, my parents have the parent plus loan and I have my unsubsidized loans. They are all federal loans. We are paying of the interest and more, little by little.

I want to save a lot by Sept. as I'll focus more on my studies then and decrease the hours working at my job. The main thing I want to know now is if I can get a credit card. I tried 2 banks around 6 months ago, one said I needed a cosigner and the other said I don't have enough credit which makes sense. I know this probably impacted me negatively. I also don't want a cosigner but I'm open to suggestions. But I want to try again now and at least try to get a secured card.

personalfinance,Credit card debt resolution,"I'm curious as to how things work involving credit cards.

I currently have about $15k on a single credit card.  It's a low interest card (9.15%) which I wish to keep.  I pay about 300-400 towards it monthly as I'm trying to get it paid off.  I've been considering finding a new card to transfer some or all of the balance to.  I've gotten plenty of offers for 0% for 21-24 months, but I have yet to look into those as I feel it would only complicate things.  I'm also thinking that they probably wouldn't accept the entire balance.

Is this an idea worth pursuing to help cut down on interest over the long term?  Even if they don't take the entire balance, is it worth possibly using multiple offers to a 0% over months?

My next question is about debt resolution.  In the mail I've gotten letters offering to reduce my credit card debt.  The latest one shows that if I have a balance of $20k, they will negotiate with my lender to resolve the debt down to $6k.  How exactly does this work?  Will this cancel my current card as they will close the account for less than owed?  Would I then owe this new third party the ""negotiated"" balance?

As I said, my current card is a very good one as the interest rate is extremely low.  I don't want to lose it.",finance,1465397226
personalfinance,Use Equity in rental property to pay off student loans. Opinions/experience?,"Hi all,

In need of your wisdom here. I have about $100,000 in outstanding federal student loans, varying from 6.0% to 7.5%. I'm currently on the PAYE plan, but have been paying more than minimum to work down the loans. However, it still feels like an uphill battle and my ability to save is diminished. I'm currently living at home to save.

I'm lucky enough to have a rental property that I co-bought with my parents worth about $400,000, with $177,000 left in outstanding principal. Therefore, the property has about $225,000 in equity. The current interest rate on the existing mortgage is 4.375%.

I was thinking of taking an equity loan of $100,000 from the rental property to pay off all my student loans, leaving about $125,000 equity left in the property. This loan would refinance the mortgage at 3.9%, effectively reducing my interest by ~2.5% compared to my student loan rate. It also would extend the term to 30 years. The intent is to sell this property within the next 5 years and use the proceeds as a down payment for when I move out of my parents house.

Anyway, just wanted to see if anyone has been in a similar situation and discuss pros and cons. In my opinion, it makes sense to use this strategy since it lowers my interest rate, will give me a bigger mortgage tax writeoff, as well as spread out my payments across 30 years allowing me to save more money in the meantime.

The only con I can really think of is that when I do sell the property, I will have less cash in hand. Plus there is the risk that if the real estate market goes down, I'll be left with a larger mortgage payment and no equity. 

Any opinion or insight is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1465400216

Current 1 month performance is 7.4%, primarily driven by the rally in GDXJ and CRESUD. SPX(S&amp;P) has gone up slightly which is hedged out by the slight decrease in 10 year treasury yield (IEF), leaving those positions largely net neutral. Returns have primarily been driven by the continued weakness in the dollar and continued hesitancy towards a rate hike by the fed, leading to higher gold and EM pricing. Going forward, I will be focused on total returns and not be tracking the sharpe ratio because I fundamentally disagree with the concept that volatility is risk.

Basically, you buy individual panels for about $202 - after $87 federal tax credits and $117 in incentives.

These panels are part of a larger community solar farm built on the other side of town and you get about a $2 credit per month per panel on your bill.

Break even is about 8.4 years per panel.

If i were to spend, let's say 30,000 on this, it appears I'd get ~300 credit per month. 

How does that compare to a 30k rooftop solar investment?

personalfinance,A quick PSA regarding the IRS that we recently encountered,"So, this is just a headsup for anyone else who happens to encounter this situation. Last week, we got a letter from the IRS (legit letter, not a scam) stating that we have not paid our federal tax, and demanded we pay it immediately, with penalties added. The problem is, we DID pay it, on time, and had the bank statements to prove it.

It took FOREVER to get them on the phone. The first couple days, their system flatout said they had too much volume, to try again later, and automatically hung up on us. Finally, a few days ago, we got put in a queue that lasted over 40minutes. Incredibly frustrating. However, once we FINALLY got connected to someone, the situation was remedied quickly. 

What happened was, when my wife and I filed (jointly), my SSN was tagged as the ""primary"" SSN, for whatever reason. We weren't aware this was a thing. However, we used my wife's account (and SSN) to pay the tax owed through their own website. Apparently, their system only checks across primary SSNs, so the payment went through just fine (again, had bank statements proving it), but it was never tied to our account, hence the letter. The IRS lady was able to quickly find the payment via my wife's SSN, and made the necessary adjustments to show that we did indeed pay on-time (and thus, we obviously don't need to pay the penalties).

Long story short, it was a pretty stressful and frustrating situation, but ultimate, just came down to getting someone on the phone and explaining the situation. Lesson learned, though. Not something I want to go through again.",finance,1465410859

OK, fine.

But now, I find the following paragraph:

&gt; If your account is assigned to a private collection agency acting on behalf of the Federal government for the purpose of collecting defaulted debt, the current collection agency assigned is named below. You can contact them directly with any additional questions or requests. If your account is not assigned to a collection agency, contact us with any questions or requests.

I've been paying off both mine and the one's in my Mom's name since graduation as I think the responsibility is on me (don't want to argue this point). 

I've been aggressively paying off the one's in my name, while paying the bare minimum on the one's in my Mom's. After I receive a mid-year bonus this July 1st, I'm going to throw all the bonus at my loans and it should be pretty much erased (Yippe!). 

My next step is to refinance the one's in my Mom's name to me - SoFi and other tech-enabled loan providers let you do this. I'm pumped because the Parent Plus loans are at 7.65%, which is shitty. I want to do this transfer to me ASAP.

However, I don't want to lock in the loans with SoFi et al if my credit score is about to jump after they see a big reduction in my personal liabilities when I throw a big payment at my personal loans. Right now SoFi is quoting me 4.625% for a five-year fixed, but I want to get lower to their advertised 3.5%.

personalfinance,"High APR. Looking to transfer funds, but need further advice.","Hey PF,

I've been a customer for a large U.S. bank for almost 10 years and have a credit card with them. My balance with them is $4,200 with a limit of $8,00 and an APR of 23%. I've paid off and closed 2 other cards. The first because I was young and didn't know it would hurt my credit score, the second because I settled with them over 3 years ago.  I have one other credit card, but it does not have a balance.

I've tried asking the bank to lower my interest rate a few times, but they will not budge. I've hesitated to open another card in fear of rejection or hurting my credit score, but I think it's finally time I do. My credit score is probably not GREAT, but I honestly have no idea what it is. 

My options, if approved, would be to to either find a new credit card with 0% APR for 12-18 months and transfer my balance over, or apply for a low interest loan from a credit union. I could easily pay off my debt in the 18 months provided -I am already paying the same amount per month with my current bank -and it could help my credit score, right?

What's the best option? Keep paying on my current credit card with 23% APR? Apply for a new card, hopefully get approved and transfer balance? Or apply for a low interest loan from a credit union? 

Thanks in advance.",finance,1465432716
personalfinance,Debt Consolidation. How to approach this?,"Hi all,

First, thank you for taking the time to read this. I have some debt that is spread across several credit cards  and line of credit. They all differ when it comes to interest and monthly payments so I would like to ask someone help me determine what would be the most efficient way to pay it all off (minimizing the amount of interest i need to pay).

Income: $1700 take home bi-weekly

Debt: 

Type | Credit Limit | Debt | Interest Rate
------|--------------|-------|-------------------
Visa|15k|14.5k|11.99%
LoC #1|5k|4.449k|9.39%
LoC #2|10k|0|6.5% + $1 per day while balance !=0
MC|5k|2.3k|19.99%

Of the $1700 that I take home every 2 weeks, I need maybe $200 for misc expenses (food, car insurance, gas, etc). 

I was thinking of paying off the MC with the LoC#2 (since the interest rate on the MC is almost double that of the LoC#2), but should i also be using whatever is left on the LoC#2 and transferring it over to the visa? 

To my understanding (please correct me if I am wrong) but $1/day for LoC#2 would be the same as an additional 3.65% per year ($1dollar/day * 365days a year / $10,000 * 100%), so does that mean LoC#2 has an effective interest rate of 10.15% (3.65 + 6.5)?

Again, thank you for reading my post. I appreciate it.",finance,1465435596

2 car loans, approximately $500 in total and a home improvement loan that's almost paid off. All debt is being paid monthly, all at very low interest, car loans under 2%.

$30k in a trading account + $15k and $13k in separate trading accounts acting as college (or life starter funds) for my 2 kids (both under 6).  I add $350 to main account each month and $1,000 to the other two each year.

personalfinance,First time home buyer: receiving gift funds to buy into a co-op in NYC - how much should I put down of my own money?,"Hi all, throwaway here for personal reasons, but I'm a bit conflicted on what to do, hope someone can help!

**The situation:**

- My fiance's parents are gifting us $600,000 to put on as a down payment for an apartment in NYC. We searched for a few months, found a place, and the seller accepted our offer of $975,000.
- We want to keep around $50,000 of the cash gift funds for renovations, leaving us with $550,000 for a down payment.
- We plan on selling in 5-7 years when/if we have kids and need more space.
- The co-op's maintenance fees are $1200, which includes property tax and all utilities except for electricity.
- I currently have a liquid $80,000 in my bank account. I have another $20,000 in emergency funds. I also currently have $15,000 in investment accounts. I've maxed out my traditional IRA for 2016 already. I'm self-employed (software) and make $240,000/year, or about $20,000 a month. I've done this for the past year and I'll likely continue that way for another year, possibly coming back down to 10-12k a month if I decide to go back to fulltime, W2 wages.
- My fiance's salary is $45,000/year.
- I'm 32 and she's 30.

**The mortgage:**

We have two options:

1. Finance $418,000, and put $557,000 down, which gets us a fixed interest rate of 3.25% (30 years).

2. Finance some amount less than $417,000 and X amount down, which should fetch us an interest rate of 3.50%.

I generated some amortization schedules and found that if we finance $325,000 @ 3.50% and put $650,000 as down payment, we would save about $10,000 in interest over the next 5 years when we decide to sell the place, or about $40,000 total after 30 year. Or, if we do $350,000/$625,000, we'd save about $6500 over 5 years, or about $15,000 over 30 years.

My question is two-fold:

a) Should I put $75,000 of my own money into the down payment so I can reduce the amount of interest we're paying?
 
b) Is this even the right way to think about it? $6500 over 5 years doesn't seem like a lot if I can put that money elsewhere. Can I make more than that investing in something else like a mutual fund?

personalfinance,"So I just bought a condo, what should my next steps be?","Background:  Age: 28, Single;  been working at my very first real job for almost 2 years now.  Salary: ~$140-145k a year.  Take-home pay is ~$6.6k a month after all taxes and the 401k contribution.


Debts:  None


401k: Currently ~$38.5k, contributing the max ~$18k year


Traditional IRA from 2 years ago: ~$5k


Roth IRA:  Backdoored $5.5k earlier this year


Vanguard mutual funds: ~$10.5k in Total Stock index and Total International index


Savings account with Ally: $50k, at 1% interest rate (will be using this for the down payment and closing costs)


Recently bought a condo in a highrise, ~8 minute drive from work, ~12-14 minute walk to some restaurants and shops nearby.


Final agreed-upon price was $180,000, with me paying my own closing costs (~$6.6k);  Condo is a 1-Bed 1-Bath, ~818 square feet; not terribly outdated, but definitely not new either; highrise building was built in 1980 and has all the usual amenities - pool, gym, party room, office, and even a sauna.


HOA fees: ~$500 a month, all utilities included


Mortgage I chose was a conventional 20% downpayment, 10-year mortgage of $144,000;  interest rate of 2.75%; APR 3.01%.


Property taxes (estimated on Zillow) ~$2448 a year


Now as far as job stability goes, I'm fairly confident (~90%) that I should continue to be working at this same place for the next 2 years; maybe (~75-80%) confident I'll still be here in the next 3 years.  


I'm no star employee or anything, so I maybe estimate ~60-65% chance I won't be fired or let go in the next 5 years.


Since this is my first real job, is 7-7.5 years a good amount of time to spend at one company?


I do like the area, and so as long as I continue to have a job in this area, I don't forsee myself moving.


I've read elsewhere that buying a home is really only worth it if you plan to stay in the area for at least 5 years after moving into the new place. 


With my situation, was it a good idea to purchase, or should I have continued to rent?  I'm also not the happiest with the HOA fees, but from my research, the fee is in line with the typical HOA fees for similarly-sized units in similar highrise buildings in the area and city.


My current rent is $1095 a month for a 650 sq ft  1-BED apartment, not including electricity (which averages ~$15-$18 a month).  My apartment is a 6 minute walk to work currently.  But the downside is that it's in the basement of a really crappy rundown building, really dirty, and cockroach infested.  I literally wakeup most mornings and find a huge dead cockroach in my kitchen or bathroom ~2-3 times a week.


Typical rents in the area are $1350-$1400 a month for studios, and $1400-1500 a month for 1-bedrooms in nicer highrise buildings and newer apartment complexes.  My last apartment I was renting was $1356 a month for a 550-sq ft studio, before I moved to this new cheaper apartment that is closer to work.


My lease in this apartment will be ending at the end of August, and closing date for the condo is scheduled for the beginning of August.


What should my next steps be as far as my finances?  


I had planned on paying off the mortgage in 4-5 years, because I may need to sell the place and move if I lose my job in 5 years. 


Should I be worried about losing out on the tax deductions if I do pay off the mortgage in 4-5 years?  Or should I just pay what the calculated monthly mortgage is and not contribute anything else to the principle?


I do plan on replenishing my savings account back to at least ~$30-40k, since it'll be drained to maybe $7k or less after I pay the $42k-$43k for the down payment and the closing costs.


But after that, what should my next steps be for where I put my money?",finance,1465485837

I have a couple of questions regarding the end of my vehicle lease, and I would appreciate any feedback/opinions/recommendations you all may have.

I am planning on buying out the lease on my car. I know, this is traditionally not the wisest move financially. The car's residual value is $21,185, but the same model, features, miles currently sells for about $28,000. I love the vehicle, so this seems like a good decision for me, as I do not want to continue leasing.

Some specifics: The current lease is $365/month. My income is ~$1800/month after taxes, health insurance, etc. My SO and I work full-time, and she takes home about $2600/month. We have a mortgage that we got last year for $212k, at the prime interest rate, and do not pay for PMI. Our mortgage payment is $1200/month, split evenly. My current FICO rating is 720, hers is 700. We both have more credit card debt than we should, and are aware of this. We are actively paying down, but right now my credit utilization is at about 50%.

I am about to begin graduate school, during which I will be living on loans (taking out student loans to pay for my mortgage, amirite?). I've been approved to receive about the same amount that I take home now for living expenses, etc. I have about $6000 in savings, which I would like to put toward the car. I'd like to secure the loan money now and buy the lease out (it officially ends in July) while I am still working full-time. I have family who is willing to help if I need, but I would prefer to do this myself.

My question is, what is the best way to go about getting a loan for the $16,000 I will owe on the vehicle? Should I add my SO as a cosigner, despite the fact that her credit score is currently lower than mine? Will that decrease my chances of getting the loan/lower interest rate? Or will her income help me? Together we were able to get a great deal on our mortgage, and we both have gotten raises since then, but our credit scores were better at that time. Any advice?

personalfinance,Advice/help with large amount owed to IRS,"For some context I was debt free up until about 4 years ago. Car was paid for, student loans paid off, CC debt was all gone, no loans, nothing but my recurring monthly expenses. That was the case for quite literally only a month or two...
Then I had a medical issue that flipped that all over. 15k out of my own pocket (which I didn't have). All in various copays, deductables, fees/tests that were not covered by my insurance, etc.
(The total bill was around 75k).

This left me massively relying on credit cards as I had no family or friends able or willing to help me out, nor did I have the time to say ""wait a minute, let me grab a loan"". Maybe things could have been different, but I wasn't in the best shape to do so.

So I basically maxed out my 2 credit cards, drained my savings, and was living on the very edge of my ability for my salary to sustain me for a bit, and then the compounding interest basically forced me into a hole. I took a loan out from my 401k to pay off the huge amount of debt (over 20k all said and done), but that then garnished my wages by almost half.

I was left in a better position, but only just barely.

Then I had car troubles to the tune of over a grand several times. I couldn't be without a car, I couldn't afford to get a new one, so I had to pile onto the CC again since I was still operating at a lot of money out the door.

So that leads me to the current situation.
I'd lost my job. Completely unexpectedly and suddenly.

I was facing very few options since I had the 401k loan I'd be forced to pay back or default on (to massive penalties), plus still needing a new car, plus credit card debt, plus just needing to be able to stay afloat for however long I would need to not only find a new job, but also start getting paid.

So I took the path that is certainly not recommended and cashed out my 401k. Now I've never done this. I read up on it, but details I found were pretty unclear (and I hadn't discovered anything like this subreddit to ask about).

All said and done it was ~120k in my 401k. Of which I recieved about 70k. The rest was all penalty, what I assumed was taxes, and the remainder of the unpaid loan.
Of the 70k I had just under 20k left after getting a new car to replace the old one, paying off bills/cc, etc. And living in an expensive area and needing that money to just survive until I got a new job there wasn't much left of it at all by the time I got a new job and started getting paid.

Now the specific problem is tax time came around... and I owe over 20k in federal taxes. Which is... a substantial amount... and I see they taxed me based on my receiving 120k from the 401k, when I realistically saw only just over half of that (not even counting what I HAD to use to pay off, plus the need to get a reliable vehicle for a new job).
Is there anything I can do, anyone I can specifically talk to to get that reduced? I'm currently on the installment payment plan, which I can just barely afford comfortably with the new job, but that's assuming no further issues or unexpected financial problems present themselves.",finance,1465493612

personalfinance,"Should I apply for multiple Credit Cards now, while I am young and virile, to BOOST my average account age several years from now?","I’m a 22 year old student with one year of university left. I have two part-time jobs outside of school and am looking to build long term credit and raise my credit score. I have two credit cards at the moment and am looking to acquire a few more in order to boost my account history.


**My plan:** 

Apply for 2 or 3 credit cards (with no annual fees) in the next few days/weeks. Let’s assume I am very responsible and would only charge enough to the cards to keep the accounts active and would never carry a balance month-to-month. On each card, I would set up a recurring monthly expense that I already have (e.g. Netflix) and have the balance auto-withdraw from my checking account. I would continue to make 99% of my purchases with my debit card as I do now. 


**Pros:**

- Increases number of open accounts (boosts CScore now)
- Increases average account age later (boosts CScore later on)
- Decrease utilization (boosts CScore now; minimal effect because I use very little credit as it is) 


**Cons:**

- Possible ding for hard credit pulls by applying to several cards in a short period (alleviated in two years)
- Dip in average account age (minimal effect because my account age is short to begin with)


Ideally, opening more lines of credit earlier on would make my average account age longer several years from now. So I could have good credit by the time I need to take out a home loan or what-not. Also, I don't plan on taking out any loans in the next couple of years. I already have a used car and don't plan on buying anything big.


*Would applying for multiple cards now be a wise decision?* I'm looking for **any** advice or thoughts in general.


Also, any recommendations for cards to apply to? I'm currently looking at the Citi Double Cash Card. I won't be using them heavily so rewards aren't a huge seller but better have them than not I suppose. Interest rate isn't a huge concern either because I don't intend on carrying a balance. My only hard stance is no annual fees.

     
If this plan works out, I might rinse and repeat every 2-3 years until I have 20-25 open lines of credit at which time I would transform into a God-King and have ladies swoon upon the faint whisper of my FICO score.

personalfinance,Question about 401k loans,"First off, I'm a college student who doesn't have a 401k, I'm not asking because I plan to take one, I'm just curious how they work.

My main question is, is the interest on the 401k loan paid into the 401k or to the provider of the 401k?

If it's paid into the 401k, it seems like they wouldn't be as bad as people make them sound (tell me why I'm wrong please). If you take a 401k loan at 4%, then you're losing on ~8% in the market, so it's effectively a loan at 8-4=4%, so is cheaper than any loan with an interest rate higher than 4%. I get that there are some tax implications that might change this, although to be honest I don't understand those all that well. People don't like the idea of touching retirement funds, but it seems like from a purely numbers perspective (unless the tax implications are worse than I'm picturing) they really aren't that bad.

Also, this probably doesn't exist, but if one was able to get a 401k loan at like 10%, wouldn't that effectively be a way for them to contribute extra to their 401k (if they had a lot of cash on hand and for whatever reason all they cared about was the size of their 401k) since they're likely to beat its growth in the market?",finance,1465497787
personalfinance,Making early payments on student loans,"Hello! I just graduated college last month with about $25k in student loans. I am currently in the grace period with my loans that are served through My Great Lakes. I have worked since I was in high school and so throughout the years I have made small payments on my loans each month. Right now I am paying $150 each month since I have the money. When the grace period is over my payments were projected to be about $260 using the standard repayment plan.

Today I was looking through the options on My Great Lake's website and there was an option for custom allocation vs. standard allocation. When I clicked custom allocation it gave me options for certain percentages of my payments to go to specific loans which somewhat confused me. I know that it is generally said to start with the loan that has the highest interest rate and knock it out first, but should I also have some money going towards interest on the other loans to keep the interest manageable? These are the loans I have:
(Loan Type, Principal, Interest, Interest Rate)

personalfinance,"UPDATE: One year later, for anyone in medicine/dental/health with crushing debt","Original post:  https://redd.it/2vg48l

TL;DR - In one year, debt went from 530K to 730K to 492K.   Life happens but still plugging away on debt pay off.  

So it's about 1 year later, and I'd like to add what's been going on since.  We still see a lot of doctors/dentists/pharmacists/vets talking about high debt after graduation.  Real life story time kids...

Where we left off:
Made lots of financial mistakes.  Moved to medium COL area, yearly income for DINK ~280K about 5 years out of school, started with 580K debt from school but paid down to ~330K.  No car debt, but mortgage ~200K.  No CC debt.  So total debt last year was ~530K.   

Over the last year:


- spouse bought into practice almost immediately after original post, which put us back in MORE debt of another -200K after our initial down payment. So that means our total debt went to ~730K!  My palms are sweaty just thinking about it.  

- spouse's income increased, which is the only reason to buy a practice.  Big pause button on school debt (minimum payments only) and all extra payments went toward practice loan.  This changed up during the year because of interest rates of loans.  One student loan that was variable went UP in interest rate so we decided to divert payments to that student loan.  You get it.  

- some bad stuff.  Medical issues prevented me from working for about a year.  Yikes, just awful timing.  Get your long disability insurance people, it is a total life saver.  However, it only covers 50-60% of my original income.  So while spouse's increase was nice, my decrease made things difficult again.

So with all that's happened in a year, where are we now?  

Debts: practice loan of 200K will be paid off next month!  Paid off the higher interest student loan of about ~33K, so that means about 297K left for student debt.  Mortgage in the back burner, so about 195K.  That means we went from 730K to about 492K in about a year of total debt.  

Income:  Spouse is getting bonuses each quarter, so it's difficult to predict how much extra money is made.   Let's guess a total of 200k per year?  So even though spouses income up, mine went down.  Mine, a little less than 8K from disability per month, but about 4 months with no income for waiting period.  We did get some help from family during the medical issue phase, which we are very grateful for.  

So everyone, even though life happens we have been paying off our debt the best we can.  The risk of buying a practice seems to have paid off, but it's hard to go from 530K debt to 730K debt back down to 492K all in about a year.  It would have been probably closer to 400K if it weren't for medical issues.  

Hope my story helps.  We are lucky in the sense we can keep our living expenses low but as you can see life happens too so it's good to be prepared.  Hope this helps!

I pay for my own rent, food, and tuition for college and took off a year (2014-2015) to save up for tuition and get myself financially on my feet after my parents refused to pay my tution or help with anything. While saving up for school, I got an Amazon credit card and bought a laptop (around 1,000 plus interest) , thinking I could use my cash stash to pay off the monthly minimum payments. I also got a credit card for BofA which had increasing charges on it as I ran out of money towards the end of the semester and had to put charges on it (500). I also foolishly got a paypal credit account when I first got my job, didn't realize the sky high interest rate and went crazy shopping on there (1000) when I first got my job, thinking I'd pay it back. After a year of school, I was promised by the manager of my job that I could work there during summer break and I got enough financial aid/fed loans to pay for tuition. However, since I've been back home, my manager screwed me over and said they weren't hiring after I sent in my application twice (they claimed both times it never went through). I've been sending in job applications in like crazy and haven't heard back from anything and I still need to save up for housing as well. I'm freaking out as financial reality hits, and my parents aren't going to bail me out at all. 

My grandma has offered to pay for my rent for the upcoming year, provided that I work for her the entire summer, thus killing off any job opportunities back home. Working during the semester is impossible because I took on an unpaid internship that requires 10-15 hours per week- I have a liberal arts major so I need all the connections I can get to secure a paid internship next summer. I've been offered a potential on campus job as an office assistant next semester, but its not guaranteed from what I can tell.

I bought the home on 4/27/2011 for $300K.
Sold the home 9/26/2014 for $355K.

I got a letter from the IRS stating the ESCROW company who funded the funds for the sale of my home reported $355,000 to the IRS and my return only shows $0.  IRS knows I sold or transferred real estate during 2014 however my tax return does not show this transaction.

I only received $59,850.40 after the sale as the rest of the $355K was used to pay off the existing mortgage I have.

personalfinance,Need help! Does PF think I have leverage to make a counter-offer?? From intern to full time.,"Little background about me. 
21 Year Old Male. Father. Head of house hold. 
I was born and raised in Mexico 1994-2004, in 2004 I moved to Texas (2004-2005) in 2005 I moved to Indiana and I've been living here since then. 

I'm about to start my second semester of my junior year to complete my degree for Computer Engineering Technology with a minor of Electrical Engineering Technology. I received my minor a month ago and have three semesters until I completely finish. 

I started my first big boy job as an Electrical Engineering Intern for company X in June 8th, 2015. 
Since I received my minor I was informed I could apply for a position for Electrical Engineer Technician, and as I finish my degree I can move up to an Electrical Engineer. During my interview I asked what the difference in role would be from Electrical engineering technician to electrical engineer, I was informed that the electrical engineers should be able to program our projects as well. I followed that stamens with a question and asked, out of our team who could program? And the manager said that that was the path we where heading. 
No one in our team can program. I'm doing the same job/task/responsibilities as an engineer.... Even more...

When I got hired for company X we had a total of 6 engineers and me, since a year ago 5 out of the 6 engineers have moved on and found better jobs or moved closer to home. Apart from the 5 engineers that have moved on, our manager also moved on. Our new manager has been part of our team for around two months. 

I'm second in seniority in our team and I am second with the most experience in what we do. When i got hired I was informed that I would be helping around and would be just doing intern stuff, as people moved on and we started to be short staffed my role greatly increased. I have been a project lead(just my self as an intern) on a 1.3 million dollar project for the past three months,(usually a project lasts around 6-8 months) I have met every deadline, I have went above and beyond of what it is expected from an intern. 

I had an interview Monday for this new position (this is probably bad of me but I recorded the interview without them knowing. I used voice memos on my iPhone, I wanted to use for reference and learn from it), and today I got an offer... I believe that the offer is low compared to the market and I also believe that I deserve more... 

My hourly rate as an intern compared to what I got offer was 15% higher. I also get benefits, I didn't get benefits as an intern. The benefits include: paid vacation time, personal/sick days, tuition reimbursement, health insurance, 401k. 
But my offer is half of what the other engineers get... And we do the same job. 

Does PF believe I have leverage to make a counter offer? I would be happy with 10% more....

Using past performance to predict future results is certainly a fallacy in equities (although this engenders a discussion of both the utility of historical results for planning purposes as well as the choice of time horizon for ""future results"").

Looking at the Morningstar charts, I feel like I'd be a damn fool not to have assets allocated in the long-term bond fund given that I can weather interest-rate risk with my relatively long time horizon and the historical performance of long-term funds (with consequentially higher yields). However, this decision *also* appears to be returns-chasing behavior for what might well be an over-valued asset.

 **My question(s):** given my dual time horizons, is my decision to have my bond allocation is strictly long-term instruments as foolish as I suspect it might be?

personalfinance,"Defaulted on private student loans, now what to do?","Long story short, I regrettably took out about $100,000 of private student loans to attend to undergrad and as I graduated with my BFA in 2009, during the economic recession I had a very difficult time finding a job. I lived very frugally and hand-to-mouth while working for the next 3 years, during which I defaulted on my loans. Sallie Mae did not work with me on manageable repayment options.  The lowest they would offer me was $700/month, which would only touch the interest (which was accruing about $1800/month), and which was more than my living expenses per month. I purchased two $150 forbearances for 3 months each and then stopped because my financial situation was dire and I needed that money to survive. I had no intention or desire to ever default on my debt, but I didn’t have any viable options. 

Fast forward to now. I have been teaching part-time for 4 years, and I now make about $60,000/year (since last year). I live in a city with a fairly high cost of living. Once I started making a steady income and feeling comfortable, I decided to try to get the situation under control. It’s been about 3-4 years since I defaulted on my private undergrad loans. The payments, late fees, and interest have accrued an additional thousands of dollars onto my debt. I consolidated my private loans a couple years ago because some of them had interest rates that were as high as 13.25%. I receive multiple calls daily by various phone numbers of debt collectors. I receive notices in the mail from Central Credit Services asking for $40,000 payments at a time. Recently they called my employer and while I was on the phone with them requesting they do not contact my employer, I discussed options with them. They offered me a settlement that would alleviate my defaulted debt of around $120,000 for around $30,000. While this is a silver lining, I did the math and I cannot afford the payments they would require me to make within the time frames they are asking. To do so would completely decimate my life savings. I do not have anyone I can turn to for financial help. 

My thoughts were: maybe I should try to save money for a couple years and then pursue a settlement with CCS if there's no catch. 

The other option is wait until the statute of limitations reaches 6 years. I’m about halfway there right now.

I fear that since the statute of limitation's expiration is approaching soon, the collection tactics might become more aggressive or they might file a lawsuit. 

So my questions are:
Does anyone have any experience settling with Central Credit Services? Is there a catch? How did it work out?

Are there any other options/plans I should look into to somehow rid myself of this?

Any advice would be much appreciated. 
Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,"Reddit, I need advice with my student loans.","Ok, so I've ""paid off"" my student loans 15 years early. I suck at personal finance but have a pretty good credit score and have never missed a payment.

I graduated in 2010. Since I've graduated, my loan has been sold to 3 different repayment companies and was broken up into about 8 loans which all had interest rates of **5.5% to 9%**. I had both private and federal loans. My parents and I finally refinanced the loan into their mortgage because I wasn't making headway at all. The interest rate was *so* high that barely any money was even making it to the principle.

Now, I'm curious. Since I no longer pay through the lender/repayment companies websites am I allowed to use my credit card as payment? The loan is no longer in my name but in my parents. Is it breaking any rules to pay them the monthly rate of my loan through Paypal and use my card for the reward points/cash back?",finance,1465573140

My partner's parents just bought a house that I will buy off of them within a year. I got pre-approved for a mortgage with a 729 credit score. I'm not sure what my real credit score is (I thought it was at least 740) as it was lowered by a couple factors: 1. I had just opened a bank account that did a hard check, 2. My credit card bill had just ended and I had 2.5k balance (I just didn't think to pay it off before going in). The negatives that appeared on my report where 1. Too many accounts with a balance, 2. Too short a lifespan of accounts. Basically, I need to know what the best route is to either maintain my credit for the next year or build up more. I currently have 3 student loans (totalling about 4k) since 2011 and 1 credit card (6.5k limit, I usually use about 1.5-2k/month) since December 2014. 

1. Should I completely pay off 1 of my loans (the lowest one is $900) or just pay down more of all 3?
2. Should I open a new credit card right now? If so, what kind? My current card is an Old Navy VISA that I just applied for when I moved to the States cuz I had no other credit. 
3. What should I be doing within the week/month of going in for my mortgage? Am I supposed to come in with zero balance credit cards?
4. If I need to, I'm sure his parent's will give me more time. What should my ideal time-frame be?

The ""Monthly payment amount"" and ""Amount due"" (same number) on my statements each month (these are the payments that are on the spreadsheet) don't match the actual amount I'm paying each month. Some of the loans I'm paying more than the expected amount, some I'm paying less (and this is automated by my loan servicer; I can't control how the payment is applied).

For example, of my last $200 payment, $28.57 went to Group A, which I'm only supposed to pay $19.73 on. Fine, because I paid extra. However, for Group B, it only took $39.35, even though my ""amount due"" is $70.41.

Not only would there be more I could write off, but I'm fed up with my business vehicle being my personal vehicle as well. It gets to crowded full of stuff and the loading/unloading of business equipment takes hours each week (I'd be able to keep everything I need all the time in the business vehicle). 

Other benefits I could see of a business vehicle is I'd be able to wrap it in logos, ect. In addition, my personal vehicle would be a smaller 2/4 door car with almost double the mpg of a pick up I'm considering.

economy,Sweden’s Riksbank Deputy Governor: Too few homes are being built in Sweden,"&gt;“A better balance between supply and demand is needed on the Swedish property market.” These are the words of First Deputy Governor Kerstin af Jochnick, speaking on Thursday at property magazine Fastighetsvärlden’s seminar, Fastighetsdagen, in Stockholm.

&gt;At the same time, af Jochnick points out that the generally low level of interest rates entails risks for the financial system. In particular, she mentions households’ high indebtedness. The fundamental problem, however, is that, for several years, too few homes have been built in Sweden, says Kerstin af Jochnick.

personalfinance,"Graduated medical school, starting residency. 350k loans, average 6.4% interest rate. Been studying this stuff for the past 6 hours and still very confused...","Hello all,

I'm looking for the best strategy to get through these. Do I:

1) Go through one of the government's repayment programs;

2) Refinance through a private lender;

3) Attempt one of the government's loan forgiveness programs (potential tax bomb, tenuous political climate)

4) Others?


Where do I begin? I'm 31, just graduated and well on my path to pursue my dream of becoming a physician. Problem of course, is the debt incurred getting here... and of course what I will owe. Hoping to get some help because I am pulling my hair out trying to figure this out and my school's financial aid office is completely useless.

Here's what I can tell you so far. All my loans are federal loans and come out to an average of 6.325% (range: 5.4% - 7.9%). My residency is 4 years long, salary starts at about 48k (before taxes) first year, going up to about 55k by 4th year. My parents can afford to pay about $2000 a month. After this, physicians in my specialty and locale start earning between 160k and 280k depending on practice location/type, hours etc.

Here is what I found out so far:

1) Going through one of the government's repayment programs:
[Table of payments](http://i.imgur.com/uvijNz0.png)
Focus on the top 4 rows (I will discuss the rows below later). Right now the **graduated** option seems best. Basically, this starts at ~2k (affordable by parents), and as I earn more the payments start going up, which I can fill in. Standard is just not affordable now, and the two extended options don't make financial sense due to interest.

2) Refinance through a private lender:
There are some private lenders that specialize in refinancing medical school loans. I talked to a couple and looks like my fixed rate will be roughly 5.3%, and my monthly payments would be low. In addition, there is no penalty to paying extra so with my parents paying the $2k and me pitching in whatever extra I can afford, **this sounds better than option 1 (graduated)**.

3) Attempt one of the government's loan forgiveness program (IBR, PAYE): Now we come to the high risk, high reward scenarios. [Look at this table again](http://i.imgur.com/uvijNz0.png) Specifically, look at the LOAN FORGIVENESS column - wow! Forgiving 600k+ of loans??? Sounds too good to be true... so I did some research, and looks like it kind of is. One reason - forgiven student loans count as taxable income. So when that 600k is forgiven, Uncle Sam will have me on the hook for taxes on 600k in addition to whatever I earn that year! I've been reading there is some [legislation sitting in Congress to remove this tax bomb] (http://pocan.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pocan-and-wilson-introduce-relief-for-underwater-student-borrowers-act), but with politics and especially the current climate being what it is, I'm skeptical...

4) Other options - one is public service loan forgiveness (PSLF), where the government will forgive all loans with NO TAX BOMB after 10 years of payments. Catch is you have to work for a 501(c)(3) place (public service hospital, jail etc). Nice part is, my residency institution counts (4 years), so I'd only be forced to serve the public (ok I didn't mean to make it sound bad haha) for another 6 years. But the fear is - the government won't actually follow through with this (I think the first batch of potential recipients of this loan forgiveness are due late 2017). Also FYI - I can always switch from government to private, but I cannot switch from a private loan plan back to government.

Maybe there are other options I'm missing but I hope you all can help. I've been living like a medical student for the past 4+ years (ie, poor... *ahem* FRUGAL) and will continue to do so through residency and probably the first few years of being an attending physician thanks to the advice of PF :)

personalfinance,Car broke down. Maybe getting a new car? Should I take a car loan?,"Well, my car broke down today. It's currently at the mechanic, but they won't be able to get to it for a day or two, so I don't know what it'll cost me yet. If I'm lucky, I think it will be around $600. If I'm really unlucky, it could be several thousand. (The car's worth about $5,500, less any needed repairs).

So, the good news is, I'm totally prepared for this! (Consider this a success story!) The car's 14 years old, so I've been planning for either a big repair or a new car sooner or later. I've read Ramit Sethi's book and I use one of his tips for savings accounts (separate accounts for specific goals). I have a savings account specifically for my car (repairs or a new car) that's currently got about $5,500 in it. Paying for a repair (or a down payment on a new car) will not be a problem.

While I'm hoping this will be a quick repair, I'm considering that it might be time to sell the car and get something newer and more reliable. This is where I have some interesting financial questions. I've also been thinking about buying a house sometime in the next 2-6 years, but don't have any concrete plans yet. Because of that, I have a separate savings account (that I had planned on using for a down payment for the house) with $27,500 in it. If I wanted to, I could pay cash for a new car and *hardly notice* financially, aside from the fact that I'd take $10-15k from my house savings account. (Sets me back maybe a year, but I didn't have any real plans anyway.)

On the other hand, I assuming I decide to buy a new car, I could use the $5,500 for a down payment, not touch my house savings, and get a reasonable rate on a car loan. The benefit of doing this is that if I decide to buy a house (or take on any other large expense) in the next year or two, I have money ready to go. The downside is that I'm paying interest on the loan when I don't really have to. I finished paying off school loans and my first car loan about a year ago and I've really enjoyed being debt-free since then.

So my question really boils down to this: It seems like the purchase of a new car provides me the opportunity to take out a $15,000 loan at a reasonable interest rate, and I might not have that opportunity otherwise. How beneficial is it to take the loan just for the purpose of keeping more cash on hand? Is it worthwhile to take the loan? Happy to hear any thoughts you have about anything!",finance,1465687169

personalfinance,"ELI5: First time filling out a W-4, tax deductions, dependents, allowances, exemptions, etc.","I recently got an at home job as a customer service rep. Every part of my job is dealt with online, including my training and all tax business. 

I have just today to make any last minute changes to my W-4, and I realized that I have only entered 1 allowance. As I understand it, just from some googling, I can enter at least 2 allowances, because I am single, not dependent on anyone, and hold one job. However, I have also always been told that it is perfectly legal to file more dependents than you actually have, which just lowers the amount taken from each check and lowers your tax season refund. 

I had planned to file extra dependents, because in my current financial situation, I could really use the extra cash in each check. When I used the IRS withholding calculator, based on all of my information and filing extra dependents, it told me that I would owe $0 of income tax.

However, when filling out my W-4 (Which is through a Ceridian self-service), it does not ask me for dependents, but allowances. To my understanding, the two are pretty similar, but I'm not sure if it's legal for me to file extra allowances, the way I would for dependents.

Also, my self service program provides a net check calculator. I enter in how much I will earn in each check, based on my actually hourly wage. It then asks how many Federal Exemptions I will be filing. It does not ask about allowances or dependents, and I'm wondering if I'm supposed to be entering the same number for each one. If these things are different, and affect my taxes differently, how can the withholding and net check calculators be accurate, not taking into account the information I actually submit on the official W-4? 

The net check calculator takes out less for taxes the more exemptions I put in, and it always still includes some taken out for Social Security, Medicare, and my primary state tax. Should these still have to be taken out of each check, even though the IRS calculator indicated that I would owe $0 this year in taxes?

So what I need to know is, are dependents/allowances/exemptions the same as far as the number I need to enter? Is it legal to put in extra allowances and exemptions, the way it is with dependents? And generally what is the best legal way to fill out each of these things in order to get the most out of each check (the least taxes reduced), while not owing money at tax season?",finance,1465688416

I currently make approx 75k a year. I'm paid bi-weekly and it ranges from 2000 to 3000 net, 4k-6.5k monthly. I have a performance based pay plan so it really depends on how I do.

car insurance: $115

gym membership:$30

I do have a 401k and an IRA (I spend a fair share of time on here) To which I contribute 18% of my gross income to the 401k, and approx. an additional 2k a year to my IRA. As it stands, I have about 6k in my 401k and 3k in my IRA


Due to my particular trade I incurred the debt of purchasing certain particular tools which I'm paying at the alarming rate of $400 a month.

I also pay more than the minimum on my car payment, which I am also on course to pay it off in half the time the loan was for. 

My student loan is subsidized and as it stands, the remaining balance is $2900.


The highest interest rate loan I have is the tools, which is why I'm trying to pay it off as soon as possible. However I've found that I'm struggling to save any money I do have left over, whether its eating out, or vacations and whatnot.

The logic is I will easily pay this $2,000 over the next twelve months at my current repayment rate while effectively reducing the interest rate by half. This is a shelved card so I would only use it since they offered these checks and would not incur new charges.

I have a question on withdrawing money from your investment to reduce the risk / to actually do something with your money. 

Let me first give some basic information on my personal situation.
I have a good job, enough money saved for emergencies and already some money invested in ETF's (they are doing okisch) and now just recently got into p2p loaning.  

With the p2p loaning I am able to get a high interest rate, which really does look good on paper, but just to be sure I want to get some money out every now and then to reduce the risk of my investment. Now, lets say the p2p loans are giving me an interest rate of 13.5%. I am planning on getting out a few percent out every year and now my big question is, how much should I get out? I have plotted different situations with 0.0, 1.5, 3,0, 4.5, 6.0 and 7.5% withdraw rate, they can be found [here](http://imgur.com/a/ehqEM). Dont mind the values, they dont represent my invested value.

With 3.0% withdraw rate I am able to get half of my initial investment out in 10 years and with 7.5% I get my initial investment out in 10 years. If this money is not re-invested,  there will be some serious profit gap (as seen in the graphs).

I still have to decide what strategy I am going for. I am leaning towards removing 3% yearly. But I am really interested what other strategies are possible and how these strategies are working out for you. So, what strategies are you currently using to reduce risk? Are you taking a certain percentage out yearly? Or are you using any other strategy?",finance,1465730909

&gt; Dear Huachi

&gt; During events such as the upcoming Brexit referendum, market movements can be significant leading to the potential for large profits, but also large losses. To help ensure our customers are more insulated from such movements, **we will be temporarily lowering the maximum leverage available on GBP pairs to 20:1 after the market close on June 17, 2016**. The affected pairs will return to prior leverage levels after the market close on June 24, 2016.

&gt; As a result of this change, you may need to close trades or add funds to your account or risk a possible margin closeout if you currently have an open GBP positions with higher levels of leverage and do not have enough funds in your account to cover the increased margin requirements. To determine the impact this change may have to your margin, you can use OANDA’s margin calculator.

&gt; Margin rates on pairs not containing GBP will not be affected.

&gt; If you have any questions, you can contact our Client Experience Team whenever markets are open.

&gt; Regards,
&gt; The OANDA Team


And FOMC? The June FOMC is not just any FOMC, it will really be a bellwether for 2016 for the Fed's direction with interest rates until election and Christmas.  Will they stick to their word and raise rates?  Or change course and have a flat rate, showing their weak hand?  There are estimates in both directions (some showing preciptious cliffs, some showing seismic movements back and forth), but again, unless you are confident in your analysis, market intel, and skill set, *pay attention because the June FOMC has a potential for a radical whipsaw*.

I was able to use savings to pay off two of the years for state and implemented a payment plan to finish off the third year. In the past year I also was able to finally get a real job again but it doesn't pay well and no benefits. I received a balance of about $500 owed to state on 2015 taxes.

I'm sadly not in the position to pay off the new $500 bill so I called state and asked that I add this to the balance of the current agreement. The woman was nice but informed me that to do so would require the old installment agreement to be closed out, listing it as that I defaulted on the agreement and a new agreement put in place for the new balance. This does not sound right to me. 

The accountant who did my taxes insists I should keep calling and talking to different people but I was wondering if anybody has had a similar experience or any knowledge of something along these lines. I'm currently in the process of getting mega-rich and building my empire but need to make the best decisions going forward before the wheels fall off the bus.

Thanks so much!",finance,1465759247
personalfinance,NYC: Estimated Income Taxes (FT Employee v. Independent Contractor),"Please Note: We live in NYC so there are Federal, State and NYC income taxes.

-

My wife has the option between two jobs and we're having trouble telling the difference in income after taxes. I already reached out to a CPA I know but he is away until Tuesday. We could use some general advice from the board TIA.

-

Option A: Work FT for a company and make $65,000. There are no bonuses, no retirement plan (offered by the employer) and she would have to contribute to her health insurance (the employer contributes ~$350.00 per month). There are no other material benefits at this company.

-

Option B: Work as an independent contractor for two places and make $80,000-$87,000. She would have to get her own health insurance and I believe her Self-Employment Taxes would be higher as an independent contractor. I honestly don't know.

-

Question 1: Without any deductions or health insurance costs, what are the income taxes due (Federal, NYS and NYC) for each Option above? Does that include Self-Employment Taxes?

-

Question 2: If she chooses Option B and makes $83,500, what can she do to limit her tax burden that she can't do under Option A?  Maybe some other things we should consider?",finance,1465759470
personalfinance,"Sober and broke, how to rebuild?","TLDR: Drunk me wasted too many years on poor habits, current me trying to figure debt management out.

I'm a year sober last month, and it's really hitting me hard that although I've left that life behind (glass of vodka ""to help me sleep"") and have gotten my anxiety and depression to manageable levels in a more healthy way now, I'm still dealing with the repercussions of my late teens/early 20s. I didn't even spend it frivolously on dresses or anything, but mostly car repairs, medical bills and college expenses, but yeah, drinks too. I've got several thousand ($5500) in credit card debt with not good interest rates :( on top of about $7500 in federal and personal student loans. Now that I've got a job I can get by on, I need to figure out the best way to pay these off without having to have a panic attack every time the mail comes. I know there are others in worse off positions, but this is becoming overwhelming when I need to decide between new school shoes for my daughter, dentist appointments or making the minimum payments on everything.

I feel like I need to transfer the credit card debt somehow, but am not sure if I open another card for the 0% interest on transfers how that will affect my credit and if there's anyway to get better interest rates on my personal or federal loans. I appreciate any advice! I've read through the faqs but it's hard to figure out what I need for my situation. I was raised in a home where it was ""improper"" to talk about finances, especially for girls, so I feel like I'm really in an uphill climb here on many fronts.",finance,1465760041

personalfinance,"Best value housing for someone who will be gone half the year or more. Also, how best to deal with taxes when working and living in different states (or not really working in a state at all).","Hey /r/personalfinance,

I live pretty frugally, and I'm on the path for FI, but I thought this would be best suited to this sub. 

Background: I work in commercial fishing in Alaska. I do about 2 contracts per year, around 75 days each at $300/day. I have been vandwelling and living in company housing in Seattle since January 2015. I had a storage unit, since we aren't allowed to store things at company housing, and I have too much stuff to keep in the van only. I just finished a contract and don't have to go back to work until November or January. 

Current situation: I just moved out of my storage unit and into a sublease in Fort Collins, CO until June 31. I might like it here enough to stay; I like it so far, but haven't been here long enough to know for sure. 

So assuming I do want to settle down here (or anywhere really), where do I start? What are my options? Should I rent a room somewhere with roommates? If I do that, am I liable if one of my roommates breaks their lease/sets the place on fire/etc? What red flags should I look for in potential landlords/roommates? Should I get a 1 bedroom and use AirBnB when I'm gone instead? Buy a place, and use a property manager to deal with stuff? I've never rented before, aside from on-campus apartments in college, an old lady I rented from under the table, and an RV park I used to rent a space at. I don't have any references from a long-term lease, will this be a problem?

This will be my first time finding a proper place to live as an adult; my living situation has been rather chaotic since college. I'm completely new to renting/leasing, so its a bit scary to decide to throw such an huge chunk of money at something long term like that, especially something I won't be using for a large part of the time that I am paying to use it. I realize that it would be cheaper to get rid of stuff and have just the van with no storage, or to move in and out of temporary housing as needed, but I'm craving some semblance of stability when I come back to civilization from a long contract at sea. Thank you for understanding. 

Also, to shift gears completely, what are the tax implications of this arrangement. I was hired in Seattle, the boat docks in Alaska, but we fish in US waters. I still have a Washington drivers license and plates. If I move to Colorado, would I have to start filing taxes there even though I don't work there? I pay federal taxes, but both Washington and Alaska have no state income tax, so I haven't had to worry about it up to now. Can I keep my license and plates from Washington? I've also heard of people claiming partial residency since we're away so long, but I have no idea how that works. 

It's a rather unconventional situation; I'd appreciate any insight. Basically, if I decide to find a permanent place to call home, what do I need to be concerned about right away? Thanks for reading!",finance,1465797505

personalfinance,Uncertain Future For My Dad And Me Since Mom Died,"I brought up my fears in a posting before my mom passed away and I'm kinda facing them head-on since she passed. 

She was a retired teacher with a monthly pension ~$3000. She'd been comatose basically for a while and passed a month ago. My dad has a myriad of early dementia and Parkinsons-related problems. Caregivers come for a few hours a day to keep him clean. I barely sleep some nights.

A family trust agreement was set up my mom didn't really involve me in it (but I am the beneficiary after dad). I think it might've helped us before with state insurance (California) but dunno.

She had a life insurance surrender value of $22,000 and we're waiting on that. We put a lot of our medical expenses on credit and the debt service has been bearable with her pension but there's the uncertainty now.

She has a one-time death benefit of ~6k and half credit for a month since she died around the middle of the month. We apparently need to pay back an auto-payment they made to the account at the beginning of June. 

The papers CALSTRS sent us said there was a 50 percent survivor ""option"" which just brought me more stress. I dunno if that means we need to trade one option for the other. We have an emergency savings around 20K too. But that feels very small with our medical debts.

I dunno if there is anything I should know, focus on or say to make sure my dad is taken care of. Half mom's pension would be managable since most of it went to the caregivers for mom. He has a federal pension a little less than hers and I'm scared that money may impact what he can get as the surviving widower. I have an expensive insurance although I filed for Medi-Cal years ago since I wanted a safety net in case I had to drop it.

We also are being hassled by AMR bills for four ambulance rides they verbally promised to us would be covered for transport to Stage 4 wound care for mom. Each is over a thousand dollars and soon be headed to collections. The woman at AMR has told us again and again she would take care of it but I'm scared of that expense. We paid over 4K for her end of life care to do our best for her and a modest 2K for her funeral expenses. The mortuary person said we might consider selling her plot since she was cremated but I dunno.

I am even more lost now than when she was slowly dying. Any advice or help would be appreciated. 

I have a Masters in English and wouldn't mind working at anything but dad needs assistance. Over half my life since 1997, when I was 15, has been in service to their failing health. I barely take care of my own health. I heard horror stories of a college roommate's partner who was in my same situation and just dropped dead one day. I love writing and have made several books I want to polish up to publish somewhere but the last few months have exhausted my soul and I can't get up the heirarchy of human needs to get my mind in the right place to do anything lately. 

I find myself visualizing the least painful ways I can die and maybe find some release. I know so many people have it worse than me but I dunno what to do right now...",finance,1465807561

personalfinance,Lending Club CC Debt refinance: is this a terrible idea or a not-so-terrible one?,"Hey, folks.  I'm here to pick your brains on how terrible an idea this is.  My husband and I are trying to get rid of some nasty debt we incurred while he was out of work last year that we can't seem to bounce back from, and we're looking into a Lending Club loan to wipe it all out at once with a better interest rate and smaller monthly payment than what we're doing now.

**Income/Debt:**

* Combined gross income from 2015: $78,500
* Card 1: $4,000 with 15% APR (avg $300 paid per month)
* Card 2: $700 with 15% APR (avg $200 paid per month)
* Card 3: $1,020 with 22% APR (avg $600 paid per month)
* Card 4: $900 with 0% APR (promotional; avg $100 per month)
* Student Loan: $8,000 left with ~6% interest rate ($300 per month)
* Mortgage: $114,000 at 4% interest ($1,100 monthly payment)

**Bills:**

* Heating/Electric: usually around $700 total per month
* Groceries: between $200-300 per month
* Gas/Car Maintenance: between $200-300 per month
* Car Insurance: $230 per month
* Home Insurance: $60 per month
* Childcare: $790 per month during the school year, up to $1500 per month for summer full-day care
* Savings Goal: $300 contribution per month (this is for my SIL's destination wedding, so it's kind of non-negotiable savings)
* Roth Contribution: $100 (I've had the account since I was 20, everything's something.  We each have 401Ks through our respective employers as well.)

Right now both the childcare and the heating are linked up to cards 1 and 3 respectively.  We have about $1,000 in various savings accounts; $800 of that is tied up saving for my SIL's wedding.

I'm looking at a $6,000 loan at 6.8% interest (9.4% APR) and a $180 per month payment (as opposed to the thousand or so I'm throwing at them all now), which would knock out cards 1 through 3 (the ones with gross interest rates) and leave the 4th, with 0% promotional interest that I think we've got another 6 months on.  That shouldn't be a problem to get paid off.

I know if you look at the numbers objectively we *do* make enough to pay these off conventionally, but getting a loan to wipe them all out at once makes a huge difference in what we'd have left over at the end of the month-- and in turn what we'd be able to roll over into the next month.  

We make a considerable amount and I hate that we're living paycheck to paycheck.  Right now it feels like everything we make is just thrown at these credit card bills and we never seem to get anywhere.  If we can get those payments off our backs, we can start to build up our savings/emergency fund again, and be able to handle the oil bill and childcare payments directly from our checking account rather than buying time by putting them on a credit card.  

So, /r/personalfinance, what do you think?  Is this a terrible idea and we should just stick it out doing what we're doing and getting stressed about paying everyone on time, or does it at least *sort of* make sense to go for the fixed payment/lower rate to try and build ourselves back up?  I want to emphasize that we do NOT plan on using the cards until the rest of our debt is good and properly gone, at the very soonest.

personalfinance,What to pay off first? House vs. other debt.,"So here's the thing, I have several student loans, and husband has a car payment along with our mortgage.

My original plan was to pay off my student loans, then transfer the   $408 I was paying towards his car payment in addition to the minimum $180, then once that is paid off, transfer the $588 towards our mortgage (which is about 64k.)    

The question is, should we take the ""extra"" that we've been putting towards our mortgage and apply it towards my student loans to pay them off faster, and roll it forward to the truck, then roll all of it towards our house at once? 

I like the idea of getting equity into the house as quickly as possible rather than putting it towards a non-tangible like student loans or a depreciating asset like the car, but the math seems to tell me otherwise.   Is there something I'm not taking into account?

Its worth noting that the house is the 2nd highest interest rate (4.25%) out of all 5 student loans and the car.",finance,1465840286

Although everything I have is fairly low interest, I think it would be best to withdraw the $200 I have sitting in my IRA since it isn't being invested- most of the options on Fidelity have a $2500 limit and I don't see myself hitting that anytime soon. I googled it and I can't figure out the answer myself. Are there any penalties for withdrawing non-invested money from my Roth IRA? Do you think this would be a good idea to help pay off debts or should I just leave it in my IRA and keep paying them off out of my checking as I have been? 

Thank you for any and all advice! I know $200 isn't a lot to a lot of you and I'm sure you're thinking ""why is she freaking out over this?"" but my current goal is to pay off debts and have a positive net worth. That $200 could pay off 1/3 of the remaining balance on one of my credit cards.",finance,1465841566
personalfinance,I have some federal loans peaking at more than 6.3%. Is it possible to refinance them at lower rates during/after my grace period?,"I just found out about refinancing and I'm sure I'm missing out on some key information but I don't really get why anyone wouldn't do it to replace their higher interest rate loans.

Any insight into why this isn't more popular. Or why/why I shouldn't do this?

I'm going to avoid consolidating until I've paid off some of my higher ones but I'd rather refinance the higher ones and have an overall low rate to consolidate at.

Is there some extra benefit to keeping your Federal Loans I'm not considering?

personalfinance,anyway to access 401K without penalty?,"hi all.  I'm 33 and in debt.  I owe about $9K on a short term loan and about $5K in credit card.  I also have a student loan of about $22K but that is the debt I am least concerned with because of the low interest rate.

I have a 401K through work that is worth about $10K. Is there any way to access the money with no penalty (like rolling it over into another account and being able to withdraw it without fees?)  I also have a pension through work that I cannot and would not touch.  

I just really want to pay off this debt because it would free up at least $700/month that I could turn around and throw at my student loan and put into savings and or investment.  

I know nothing about finance or anything so if this is the dumbest idea ever, let me know. I just really want to get rid of multiple monthly payments and use that money to build an emergency fund and pay off my bigger student loan faster.  I am not looking for debt consolidation, as I have already done that.

personalfinance,My girlfriend needs private student loans but doesn't have a cosigner. Where else can she get money for college tuition?,"Hello all,

I will try and keep this brief.  My girlfriend recently graduated with a health related undergraduate degree.  She wants to go into a health related graduate studies program.  Her undergraduate GPA is not good enough to get into said graduate program, so she needs to retake some classes to make her more competitive.  She is not eligible for any federal loans/financial aid since she will be taking these classes while NOT in a degree program.  She is simply taking the classes to raise her GPA.

Since she can't get federal loans/financial aid, her next option was to try and get a private student loan.  She cannot do this because in order to get said private loans, she needs a cosigner.  Her parents cannot cosign since they have terrible credit.  Nobody in her family will cosign for her.

She really needs to retake these classes in order to move on with her life and get into grad school.  She needs about $6,000 total for all the retakes.  Keep in mind she is taking these outside of a degree program (meaning, she is taking them while not enrolled in any degree program), hence why she isn't eligible for any federal financial aid loans.

What are her options to get this money?  One option I thought of is one of those credit cards where they don't charge you interest for 18 months.  Although I'm not sure if she would be eligible for one of them.  She works part time, 20 hours a week at about 12 dollars an hour.  She has one credit card that she is responsible with, and has built a good credit score with.

What are some other options?  Why do these private loans require her to have a cosigner even though she has a good credit score (~750)?

stocks,New investor looking for strategy tips,"Just as background (not a discussion topic, I see rule 4), I got started trading 3 weeks ago using Robinhood with the intention of trying to **mostly swing trade, occasionally day trade if a good opportunity arises and won't flag me as a pattern day trader, as well as hold a few long positions**. I'm aware of the many complaints about its lack of performance and features, but so far, they haven't been a hindrance to me buying and selling when I want (other than access to smarter order types, I suppose). For a while, it seemed to be going pretty well overall, but the last 3 days have been [really rough](http://imgur.com/QBAeD4u), relatively (key word, I know it gets much worse), and I was hoping to get some tips on my strategy, particularly on discovering companies to watch.

Despite my untrained eyes, I've had a pretty good grasp on fundamental analysis thanks to Khan Academy and Investopedia, and while I could dig a bit deeper into fundamentals, I don't think that's a *big* part of my problem. Over the weekend, I vastly improved my grasp on technical analysis, thanks to the friendly reddit user who does [The Active Investor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqT84mLVw4ZtqmcuxjJ39fw). I've got a TradingView chart set up [like this](http://i.imgur.com/R0Vnkrj.png), with moving averages, weekly (purple) and monthly (pink) Fibonacci pivots, MACD and RSI, which maxes out my free 10 indicator limit. The chart definitely makes me at least feel more informed so far, and looking back at the past few weeks, I see a lot of places where it would've been pretty helpful to have. 

**What feels like my biggest *hurdle* right now is trying to find companies to analyze. I've got a growing watchlist, but most of it has been companies I'm interested in (mainly tech and biotech, where my background is) or have seen pop up in news on Yahoo Finance and RobinHood as companies to watch, but none of them have proven particularly interesting thus far. Similarly, I think my biggest *problem* is gauging market sentiment, both in regards to specific companies and as a whole.** For example, recently I've read about the job report and speculation regarding the federal reserve rates, which has seemed to weigh on a lot of the market, but I have no idea how little or much that might've affected my recent holdings.

I'd love some recommendations to take a look at, but it'd be even better to have some better tools to do it on my own. **I've looked into the FDA catalyst trackers for clinical trials, but I'm not sure what other kinds of tools are out there. I've never been one to seek out business or finance news, so I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of potential by not having less sensationalized, more reliable and up to date sources to gather ideas from. If anyone could give their two cents on the current state of the market with the pending federal reserve decision, that'd be much appreciated, as I've only come across very sensationalized articles so far.**

For what it's worth, I've already got stop losses placed a little below support levels for everything, so I don't expect to lose too much more, but I'm starting to question the potential for gains. With my job, I only really get 10 minutes at 10 and 3 EST to take a break where I can look at the market, plus lunch, so I don't get as much exposure to analyzing the markets and keeping up to date as I'd like. Fortunately RobinHood supports Android Wear, so I can keep an eye on things from my wrist and step in if needed, but **I'm still interested in other platforms, particularly if they have order types that can be leveraged to counter my limited exposure time during actual trading hours. I'm comfortable with the idea of things going in the red, but just want to cover my bases to make sure I'm not doing anything foolish. I'm having trouble deciding whether I want to stay diversified into some of the ETFs below, or if I should use that money to focus on more calculated moves.**

**Any suggestions on how to plan for a dollar value to place a sell order at would be very helpful as well. I'm thinking maybe near resistance, but then you lose out on the potential of it breaking right through, at least with RobinHood's order types, I'm not familiar with the way more I know are out there.**

**TL;DR** - I'd appreciate if you read the bold.

personalfinance,Potential Fraud and how to clear it....?,"Hello, 

So this is a pretty strange situation, for me at least. I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post this in, if not I hope that someone can point me in the right direction.  

I went to my local police station to get finger printed to take a board exam. The lady taking my payment asked me if I had ever been a victim of identity theft. I explained that I had, nearly ten yrs ago but that situation was cleared up. She then told me that there was an arrest warrant outstanding, someone has stolen my identity and my credit is in jeopardy. I then asked for details and she told me it was from state X and that she couldn't provide me with any additional information. I spoke to two supervisors and the first one told me she couldn't provide me with additional information b/c it was from state X. The next supervisor told me it was b/c they couldn't give out my personal information b/c they can't confirm my identity (the issued me fingerprint cards that have been sent to the FBI, I had my birth certificate, passport and drivers license on me). She then told me that I should go to state X and figure it out. This was after I asked if they could just tell me the county that this happened in so I could contact the police there. 

I called a few police departments in state X. Every officer who ran a check for warrants said that there was nothing active for me. I checked my credit report and there's nothing strange. I contacted the Federal Trade Commission fraud department, as recommended by the lady at the police station. They gave me a link to a website that would help me ""find out more information"". The link basically tells me that I need to contact the police department in county where the fraud happened, but I don't know any information other than it occurred in state X. I know how to conduct a background check. I did one on myself, and it says nothing. Which is not surprising b/c active warrants don't generally come up, arrests do.

personalfinance,How much can I reduce my taxable income by with retirement contributions?,"Like everyone here, I'd like to map out the best possible future for myself. This includes retirement contributions and minimizing tax liability. 

I don't make a lot of money, and I support my wife and myself - she has a small business, but she pretty much breaks even. She doesn't have to get a job at this point, since we're comfortable enough.

Right now I make a bit over $45k, and have applied for a position where I'd make more. I love my job, and don't plan on leaving my employer unless something monumental happens.

I'm a government employee, so I contribute a certain percentage of my paycheck to the pension. That's mandatory, and we have a very healthy pension system where I work so it's quite likely that it'll be around for me to collect when I'm 65/6. 

However, we also have the option of contributing to a separate deferred compensation plan. There's no match, but it's easy to tweak what comes out of my paycheck. 

Right now I'm using it in combination with the IRS withholding calculator to get myself as close to $0 as possible for taxes next year. For example, instead of withholding an extra $10 from my paycheck for Federal tax (married 3, plus $10), I put an extra $10 into the deferred comp plan. 

What I'm wondering is is it possible for me to contribute significantly more to that plan so:

* I lower my tax liability and have less tax withheld from my paycheck. Right now I have about $70-80 w/h for Fed. tax every paycheck. What if I jacked up my contributions to $100/check?

* I put aside more money for retirment

personalfinance,Things that John Oliver got Right and things he got Wrong......from someone who actually works in this area.,"First off, this post is not to bash on anyone, but I got a ton of calls today asking about John Oliver's expose, if you will, so I thought that for the sake of the community, I'd clarify some things and approach this all with a level head. 

(x-post with some additions from an earlier response I gave someone)

Here's what I've learned:

 * ***Absolutely start saving as early as you can.*** This is the biggest mistake most people make. Bare minimum, contribute what your company matches if you have this option. Ideally, you should be in the habit of saving anywhere from 10-20% of your income. Yes, you won't be able to do all the little things you fantasized about doing when you got this job, but in the long run, it's crazy how much earlier you may be able to retire, and how little you'll be stressed leading up to and into retirement.
 * People have never been so empowered to save and invest on their terms as they have now. But this also means the onus is more on you now. You have the freedom to choose whether you're going to be that 60 year old who works at walmart because you have to, or be the retiree who isn't stressed about getting their bills paid. No offense to the 60 year old walmart worker, but do you really want to be there? I didn't think so.
 * You, also, have never been so empowered legally. People aren't aware of this. More on this below.
 * ***The earlier you have a plan and act on said plan, the less impact external factors will have on you. The better your plan, and made with an advisor/planner, the more secure your retirement/goal will be. ***
 * I have absolutely seen ""fiduciary"" advisors be total s#!t idiots (not that their clients knew) and totally send clients down the wrong path. These idiots don't care about you. You're just a number in a sea of employees that they advise. WTF do they know OR care about you? Want an example? Ever been to the Veteran Affairs? How many of those workers do you see actually care about what they're doing? Most don't give a (insert here). They're set! (That being said, I have family members who work for the VA and do actually care about what they do. But generally speaking.) Same thing. Fiduciary Advisors already got paid, and not by you. What real incentive do they have to see your portfolio grow or expand their know-how? Generally speaking, they're advisors that just spit the same info you could have gotten off Investopedia. That being said, there ARE ""fiduciary advisors"" who aren't strictly just fiduciary advisors, but have other individual clients as well. Ask if you can be their client and what that entails (KNOW YOUR ADVISOR!) such as fees (if any), etc. 
 * The best thing you can do is know your state's laws (as well as federal, though state level is easier to get things done) regarding advisors. Many times, if you actually have a lawsuit, 9 times out of 10, the arbitration will rule against the advisor. Why? Because, usually, if it's gone to that level of conflict, it means the advisor was an idiot, didn't write anything down and/or was colossally terrible. Issues almost only arise when you're losing money. A lot of it. 
 * If you're super upset about something and there hasn't been an attempt to rectify the situation, **Write. The. Complaint. Down.** This immediately launches an investigation by the firm. That being said, don't do that for stupid trivial things. If you just leave a voicemail expressing your displeasure or that you want to talk, most advisors will bend over backwards to make time for you. 
 * Fees, while keeping them low is a concern, is not as big of a concern when we're talking about stability of your investment.
 * The fees in which John Oliver is talking about and the fees that you're talking about are completely different fees. WHAAAAAT??? Yeah, he's sensationalizing the fees a bit. The fees in total may add up to over a million in 30 years, however, a large majority of the fees is made paid by the employer and not the employee.
 * Here's an illustration: Say you're moving. You've got a 1 bedroom apt and not much stuff. How big of a moving van do you want to rent? A HUGE semi moving truck or maybe a small mini uhaul truck? The small one right?, because while both can do the job, one is more expensive than the other in a significant way. In a case where you're being asked to handle so many people's money, and do the investing for them, well, there's a fee for that. And 1-3% is nothing compared to 10% (theoretically based upon highest rated funds' returns projections for the next 10 years), **EDIT: This fee is generally for individual asset management**. An employee's share of the fee in a 401(k) is usually under 1%. ***End EDIT***

**Edit 2: Seems like people are really getting hung up on this point. Not speaking of an actively managed fund that's being day traded or traded at consistent high volumes. I agree with John Oliver in this case that these are not really good funds and the risk is very high. BUT *someone* has to oversee your ETF or Mutual Fund. You know how the S&amp;P adds or drops stocks from their list? Someone is managing that. The 401(k) is still being watching over and SOMEONE is making sure that the investment options are up to par with regards to the client's (which is the employer, NOT you) stated objectives.**

 * There may be multiple reasons for why your fee is what it is. For one, if I was an advisor for certain firms, I would advise clients under a certain threshold to save their money till it was a suitable sum for funds. This tends to accomplish two things: A) Gives us a nice spread in which we can fully diversify holdings evenly and appropriately; anything less, and we have to start choosing where to put stuff. And B) eliminates low balance fees. Yes, there are low balance fees. Typically, a threshold is about $5,000.
 * You're losing money because the stock market hasn't been performing well (recently). So it's not surprising. (Plus, any fees that may be applicable.) But as long as you're buying positions, when the market pops back up, you should be in prime position to rise along with it. You've just started, but if you were to take a 10 year look, your portfolio should look like a yo-yo traveling up an escalator; many ups and downs, but the general direction being up. The biggest problem people face is lack of consistency in their contributions. This is what causes people to fail in planning and action for retirement.
 * ***And the BIGGEST LESSON: Find an advisor that you jive well with. This is very much a relationship. You need to be able to understand what he's saying and what he sees and why, just as he needs to be able to understand you, what you want and why.*** This is the number one reason for failure, next to failure to act/plan. People don't understand each other and therefore feelings get hurt and people get angry. Then they jump to another advisor that promises them the moon, but they run into the same issues of communication and the cycle starts all over again. Don't be afraid to shop advisors, but when you finally decide on one, commit to them! At this point, there isn't much difference in what advisors do, but rather it's their personality and attention to things that matter. If you find an advisor that matches your concerns and ways of communication, then you'll sleep so much better at night and not worry about retirement, therefore being more open to other investment options, thereby, generally, increasing your odds of successful retirement/whatever your financial goals are.
 * **Should you have an advisor? YES.** A huge chunk of people who call me are people who tried to DIY their financial/retirement planning, only to find that they missed something huge and are wondering what they can do. They aren't stupid or idiotic, they just weren't aware of one thing or another. Do you have to get the most expensive advisor? No...absolutely not; go with one that fits your needs. Each suggestion an advisor makes should be something they can back up and point back to something in your need/want list. It has to makes sense. Can you do everything yourself? Sure, you could. But do you want to? If you're doing it right, at some point, this becomes another job for you due to the complexity and size of your portfolio and all it's legal implications. Also, there are a lot of techniques and strategies that you may not know about that completely suit you and what you care about. 
 * Contrary to his recent findings, as you get older, converting your holdings to bonds may not be the best approach. This was fine when social programs such as social security, pensions, Medicare/Aid were still functional, but these days, not so much. Again, this is something that is dependent upon your situation and what you're concerned with. There are plenty of examples of people find that they can't support the retired lifestyle on bonds/fixed instruments and then have to go work. DISCUSS YOUR PLAN OVER WITH YOUR ADVISOR.
 * Ask if your state has any special provisions that you should know about! (Texas, Nevada, and Florida, especially.)
 * THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Your situation and JohnnyKnowsItAll from Reddit have totally different situations. What you're concerned about may not be his concern so his investing philosophy maybe completely different and not suit you at all! This is what an advisor is for. To know and understand you and create an investing/financial plan that suits you and fills the needs and possibly your wants. Basically, what matters to you. A ROTH is ***NOT*** always the best tool, as awesome and amazing as it is. Vanguard is ***NOT*** always the best place to put someone's money, as amazing and awesome as the company may be.

MM S&amp;P 500 Index(Northrn Trst). .22% net total annual fees. I previously had a lot in 2050 retirement because it averaged a much higher % of returns but have changed it due to having almost 1% in fees and returns lowering. Is this a good place to keep the money? There is also a guaranteed 3% returns option:

&gt;MassMutual

&gt;www.MassMutual.com/FF/RM3500.PDF

&gt;3.00% Semi-annually The rate of return listed was effective beginning on 12/31/2015, is reset Semi-annually,
and is calculated net of certain contract expenses. Under the terms of your group annuity
contract, there is a guaranteed minimum gross interest rate of 1.00%. Although the gross
rate of return provided under the contract will never fall below 1.00%, the net rate of
return may, in some instances, be less than 1.00% after applicable expenses are deducted
from the contract. 

How do I find these expenses? They are not in the provided table like all of the other allocation types. Are these plans a good idea when the market is performing so badly? 3%(is it actually 3 % if its semi annual or is it more like 6%) vs .5% or whatever sp500 got last year.


Also, my contract has this:

&gt;If the Plan's Sponsor directs MassMutual to deduct the fees for this service from participants' account balances, the fees will be deducted on a pro rata basis. Your share of the
expense will be determined by multiplying the fee by a ratio that is equal to the value of your account balance divided by the value of all participants' account balances under the plan.

personalfinance,[x-post from studentloans]How to combine/consolidate student loan debt/CC debt... what do I need to ask/know?,"Orig. posted in /r/studentloans as the bulk of this references my student loans but didn't know if someone had more input towards the ability to combine all the debt with the credit union and if it can all be reduced together and who to ask, what to say...etc? Just trying to get educated on my situation before doing something I'll regret. 

I came here looking for some straight forward answers on options I have, what is or isn't possible and what questions I need to ask either myself or my bank/lender.

Facts: I have a student/personal loan (co-signed by my parents) for four years of my undergraduate degree. The loan is with Wells Fargo.

I have a federal student loan for my Master's Degree.

All together the student loans were approx 60k upon graduation (I deferred payment of the loan with the bank while doing grad school)


I have (and my parents) been paying for the loans on time and in minimal payments up until now (4.5 years?). But with some life events I will need to take over payment of both loans in full and I simply can't afford that at my current rate.

What are my options to consolidate the two together? 
What questions do I need to ask of the bank/government to get the best ""deal""? Or what info do I need to know to make an educated decision to do so? 
What factors do they use to determine if I ""qualify"" for consolidating or reducing my monthly payments?

What qualifies you for loan forgiveness? Does this occur with bank and federal loans? I also accumulated a larger amount of debt on a CC after leaving service in the Navy while I was unable to obtain a job. 
(literally tried to obtain any job for over a year and just no one wanted a veteran with a masters degree apparently) 
Would I be able to work this debt into a reduction in payment as well? or are student loans worked differently than CC debts?

My CC debt is also with my military credit union and didn't know if I could combine my student loans and or all debt with my military credit union for a better situation?

I guess I am looking for the place to start and the questions to ask the people I will speak to on the phone about this. Any advice or experience with this would be greatly appreciated and help alleviate some stress.

I have a question in regards to a situation I presently find myself in. I will attempt to make this as brief as possible, while still being detailed enough to fully explain myself. Here goes:

I recently came into a small sum of money, which I used as a down payment for a new car, my very first time doing such a thing. My credit is absolute garbage, but I was able to get approved for a loan with my fiance. Because we are idiotic, we put the incorrect address on the paperwork. I put that address that I have on my ID that is no longer accurate. I did this because (probably because I'm an idiot) I always run into trouble when my address on paper does not match the one on my ID. For reference, the address on the ID, the address on the dealership paperwork, is my mother's previous address, where I lived most recently. 

Also (because I am an idiot) my fiance put the same address as to not complicate the paperwork and because we thought it was the easiest thing to do.

So, the bank has asked the dealership for proof of residence, which I can furnish, because the majority of my mail still goes to that address, but my fiance cannot. Am I able to request a change of address form or something to that effect from the dealership? Will they hunt me down with pitchforks upon divulging this information. How do I divulge this information to the dealership? If it makes any difference, the car is currently in our possession.

personalfinance,Putting My Money to Work,"Hi everyone,

I've recently come across this subreddit and have been following the conversations here with respect to long term saving with interest.  (This is a throwaway account to protect my personal information from my normal account.)  I have a fairly large saving account balance at the moment and I'm feeling like I can do some things to make that money work for me.  I have some thoughts, but I wanted to run it by you folks first (and then perhaps a professional in the business if needed).  

Some details on my current financial situation:

1) Net monthly take home wages after taxes, other deductions, and all standard living expenses is roughly $1900.

2) No debt: No student loans, no car payments, no mortgage, no outstanding credit card debit.

3) I have roughly $50,000 between savings and checking, and most of that is in savings.  It earns 0.6% interest there.  This translates to a liquid emergency fund of well over 1 year.

4) I have an employer-sponsored 401(k) that I am maxing out every year.  The employer matches the first 4.5% to 100%.

5) I am in my mid 20s.

As you can see, I have a lot of cash sitting around and not doing much.  I'd like to start trying to change that.  Having read the ""I have $x dollars"" post and doing some research, I have a started to develop a plan and I was hoping to get some feedback on it.

I was thinking about doing the following.

1) Open a Roth IRA with Vanguard or Fidelity (the latter holds my 401(k) at the moment, but I've had Vanguard in the past for this and they're just so easy to use).  I would then place the federal maximum limit into the account immediately and continuing to do so every January 1.  Assuming I would go with Vanguard, I've been looking at either their targeted retirement date fund or their Growth LifeStrategy fund.

2) I'm looking at trying to save for major life events that I might expect to show up in the next 7-10 years, things like buying a home, setting up college funds for future children, and the like.  I would be open to suggestions on what sorts of investments would be a reasonable, low risk method for this sort of savings.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the above.  I'm also open to any other suggestions you folks have.  Your advice to others always seems to be very well thought out and I'm looking forward to talking with you!  Thanks!",finance,1465946208

personalfinance,Using a 401(k) payout for student loans - tax and interest rate questions?,"I'm 22 and I have a closed 401(k) account with a previous employer through MassMutual. The current balance is $1451.59, and because the balance is under 5k I have to take a lump sum payment in either check form or rollover to an existing IRA/my new employer's 401(k). All of this is currently invested in ""AmerCnt One Choice 2055 Ptf Fd."" 

I won't be eligible for my current employer's 401(k) until next March, and my understanding is that I have too small of a balance to open a new IRA. I'm set right now on taking the lump sum payout (please tell me if that's a bad idea!), but I have a question about fees. 

I know the mandatory 20% will come out as federal income tax prepayment. However, I plan on use the check as a student loan payment - is there anyway for me to properly document this so I avoid the 10% early withdrawal fee? 

My last question is what loan to apply the payment to. I have a Parent Plus loan in my mom's name for $5,891 at 6.59% interest and a federal direct consolidation loan in my name for $22,206.55 at 5.25% interest. If I have a (maximum?) 30% penalty on the lump sum, I'm looking at $1,016.11 to apply to one of these loans. Would one be better than the other? It would be a 17.25% payment or a 4.56% payment of the total balance. I know that paying down the higher interest rate first is always a good idea, but I also like the idea of having less debt in my mom's name.

Recently turned 28 and living with family.  While I am on good terms with my family and staying put is an option, I would feel more comfortable and more ""myself"" in my own space, and ideally without roommates.  Moving out by year's end is a short-term goal I set for myself back in January.

I make about $42,000/yr and have $20,000 between savings ($17k) and checking ($3k).

I apologize in advance if this is TMI, but I wanted to be as thorough as possible.

* CarPayment - $212/mo payments, $7,500 principal @ 3.29% for 33 more months (second highest monthly payment)  

**Questions**

Given that moving out is a short-term goal, would it be reasonable to pay off my car right now?  Ideally I should be throwing money at my high-interest loan (StudentLoan2), but paying off my car right now would free up the most money per month per dollar than any other loan, and I figure I'm gaining time value out of the money I free up now by being able to put it towards something that I believe will make me happier and less inhibited.  Is this a reasonable thought?

Or even better question...  Say I do pay off my car, and I now have ~$950/mo available.  In the Chicagoland area, is it realistic to try living on my own on that much per month?",finance,1465953896

Here are the details: I am 22 years old, and have a job that will bring home $45,000 a year after taxes. I have other monthly bills (apartment/utilities = $900), student loans ($80 a month ($8k with 3% for 10 years)), food ($200), car insurance ($145) plus whatever else per month. So every month, I am spending about $2000 at the max which allows me to put $1750 towards savings. 

I am debating whether I want to get a CPO Honda 2013 Accord EX-L with 28,000 miles for $20,000 which comes with monthly payments of $360 for 6 years (will try to pay off in 5 years given my position within the company) with 6.9% interest rate and with $3500 down payment 

**or**

if I want to go with a lease on a new Honda 2016 Accord EX-L with $340 a month with a buyout price around $16,000 (12,000 miles a year) which I can refinance by then with an assumption of a stronger credit history.

I do plan on having the car until the wheels fall off considering that my friends and neighbors had their accords for 15+ years. The difference is whether I want to pay $20,000 for an used car @ 6.9% interest or if I want to pay $28,000 for a car that is 3 years newer. In addition, I can possibly get a better buyout price at the end of the lease which brings the $28,000 down to possibly $25,000ish - so $5,000 for a newer car in the long run...

personalfinance,PSA: PATH Act May Affect Some US Federal Tax Refunds Filed in Early 2017,"The Internal Revenue Service has announced initial plans for processing tax returns involving the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) during the opening weeks of the 2017 filing season.

This action is driven by the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act) that was enacted Dec. 18, 2015, and made several changes to the tax law to benefit taxpayers and their families. Section 201 of this new law mandates that no credit or refund for an overpayment for a taxable year shall be made to a taxpayer before Feb. 15 if the taxpayer claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit on the return. This change begins Jan. 1, 2017, and may affect some returns filed early in 2017.

* To comply with the law, the IRS will hold the refunds on EITC and ACTC-related returns until Feb. 15. This allows additional time to help prevent revenue lost due to identity theft and refund fraud related to fabricated wages and withholdings.
* The IRS will hold the entire refund. Under the new law, the IRS cannot release the part of the refund that is not associated with the EITC and ACTC.
* Taxpayers should file as they normally do, and tax return preparers should also submit returns as they normally do.
* The IRS will begin accepting and processing tax returns once the filing season begins, as they do every year.
* The IRS still expects to issue most refunds in less than 21 days, though IRS will hold refunds for EITC and ACTC-related tax returns filed early in 2017 until Feb. 15 and then begin issuing them.

personalfinance,"New grad with ~84k in loans, advice and critique of plan would be greatly appreciated!","Greetings, I have been lurking for about half a year but now that I graduated, I can finally apply the things I have been reading.  
I am 23(M), about to turn 24 in a month, and just graduated with a degree in health sciences.  My company is offering $91,520.00 annual salary with a 32 hour work week (~$114,000 per 40 hours if additional hours are available).  
The job requires me to commute to work (as far as 2 hours away one-way).  I do have a reliable car and will be living at home with my parents, so hopefully I will be able to pay off these loans ASAP.

First year estimates:
$91,520 in gross income (assuming I only get the guaranteed 32 hours)


- ~27,000 in taxes
- ~3,600 for transportation (assuming two fill-ups per week, might be overshooting)
- ~3,600 traditional 401(k) contribution (4% matched by employer), invested in SP500 index fund (expense ratio: 0.01%)
- ~5,500 Roth IRA
- ~5,000 Emergency Fund


This leaves about ~46,500 to pay off my loans

Fortunately, because my parents have been able to help me out with tuition and with grants + financial aid, my loans look like this so far:

Direct PLUS Loan | 	Jun 2015	 | 	$10,714 | 		7.2%


Direct Unsubsidized Loan | 	Sep 2010 | 	$2,758 | 	  6.8%

Direct Unsubsidized Loan | 	Aug 2015	 | 	$21,192 | 		  5.8%


Federal Perkins Loan  | 	Sept 2010  | 	$1,000 | 	5.0%

Direct Subsidized Loan | 	Sep 2010	 | 	$3,500 | 		  4.5%

Direct Unsubsidized Loan | 	Sep 2013	 | 	$2,197 | 		  3.9%	



Guess my question would be, would it be reasonable to just pay off the highest interest rate loans (the 6-7%) first, then possibly just invest my money in a low cost index fund through a broker and hope for yearly gains of &gt;3-5%?  If my calculations are accurate, then I would be able to pay off the 6-7% loans within the first year.  Then I could just do minimal payments on my loans rather than throw every penny into the low interest ones.  
Also, is there anything else I should consider adding into my budget or anything as a new grad. in general?  This is my first time earning a paycheck.  I was thinking I would put aside a chunk of change per month that I could just spend on myself (maybe $500-1,000), but I will keep that out of the budget until I can get some insight.

finance,Question regarding inflation and interest rates.,[removed],finance,1465982164
personalfinance,Question regarding the relationship between interest rates and inflation.,"From what I understand, if interest rates rise, two things happen:
- investments held will earn a higher rate of return (bonds, CDs, bank deposits, etc.)
- it’s harder to borrow money

Vault is a book I'm reading.

Vault says: If inflation goes up, interest rates go up. I am guessing their explanation is that since it’s harder to borrow money, spending will reduce, and therefore inflation will not spiral out of control.

Investopedia says: Also, vice versa, if interest rates go up, inflation goes up , since people will have greater rate of returns on their investments.

okay, these explanations make sense. But I don’t understand how they CHOSE the explanations out of the two consequences of higher interest rates.

Recap: Inflation up -&gt; interest rates up (must control inflation by limiting people’s spending, since borrowing is expensive)
	Interest rates up -&gt; inflation up (because higher rates of return on investments = spending more money = inflation up).

Ok makes sense. But what about the other consequence of interest rates for both scenarios?

If inflation goes up, interest rates go up. How are you limiting people’s spending if they have greater returns on their investments?

If interest rates go up, inflation goes up. How are people spending more money if higher interest rates means greater difficulty of borrowing money?

See what I mean? I don’t understand how they chose the explanations when the other one counteracts it. 

Not sure if I explained well enough so you understand my confusion

personalfinance,Can I get by just saving without actively participating in the stock market?,"After witnessing the losses incurred by retirees from the financial crisis, I have naturally developed a VERY high risk aversion to investing. Not least because I am not interested in stock markets...
I am required by law to invest a percentage of my income to a retirement account. So far, the portfolio I have chosen for it is the conservative type (very liquid assets and bond holdings). The return is pitiful but it's only been 3 years.

Question, given current economic circumstances (Europe/China slow down/uncertain global economy), should I switch to a riskier portfolio which will incur higher unit costs but may possibly generate a higher return in the future? Or should I stay conservative (which satisfies by risk appetite and causes less anxiety about stock market crashes/interest rate announcements) and practice frugality?

The answer seem to lean towards taking more risks but my vicarious trauma from GFC is really holding me back so I would really appreciate some informative input.

First all local Visa cards were blocked, then some Mastercard, then American Express. Uber started to charge from abroad to jump the blockade, but Uber international charges were later blocked too. Now practically all local credit and debit cards are not working.

This makes Uber difficult to use for Argentinians, and at this moment only tourists and locals with cards from abroad can use it. Also, since Uber is processing the charges outside the country, the blockade is global, and Argentinians are not able of using Uber not only in other Argentinian states, but in the whole world (you have to call the bank and tell them you are travelling to use it, many started to call lying saying they were travelling even that they were in Buenos Aires using Uber, and now most banks do some checks before enabling Uber for any caller).

As we know, Bitcoin is the perfect solution for this, but Uber doesn't work with it. Also, many bitcoiners here have Bitcoin debit cards from [SatoshiTango](https://satoshitango.com/) and [Xapo](https://xapo.com/), but Uber didn't work with [MyChoice](https://www.mychoicecorporate.com/), which is the card provider for both of those companies.

Yesterday the situation changed, SatoshiTango had an agreement with Uber to make it possible to use their Bitcoin debit cards with their service. They say it works locally only, Uber seems to have some reservations with those prepaid cards, but Uber even setup a discount code for them, a Bitcoin company.

I happily tested the service yesterday, it works. Not everyone will get in the process of learning about Bitcoin to use Uber, but some will, so I expect some new Bitcoin users in Argentina these days. :)",cryptocurrency,1465996819

personalfinance,"Buying duplex from landlord. First time buyer, credit is rebuilding, FHA qualified. Where do I start?","Hi, pf. Something has come up, so I've finally come out of the shadows to make my first post on Reddit.

My family and I occupy the upper in an upper/lower duplex. We occupied the unit that the landlord himself unoccupied, and we've had a very positive relationship with him in the two-plus years we've lived here. We're awesome tenants, and he's an awesome landlord.

He wants to get out. He doesn't like that he lives a half hour away, and in the last two months, between occupancies, he's spent way too much time away from his family rehabbing the lower unit in preparation for the couple that's moving in next week because the last tenants were shitbags. He loved it when he lived right here and could just pop downstairs and do what needed doing, but now it's a one hour commitment just for the drive, and then whatever work needs doing is on top of that.

He wants to give us first crack at it. We were surprised-not-surprised.

For the last several months, I had been kicking around the idea of asking him if he might be interested in setting up some kind of land contract, but I never did get around to it, and never really give it any serious thought. Also for the last several months, I'd been getting more and more okay with the concept that for the rest of my life, my living situation might be Shelter-as-a-Service. That is to say, I have a home and never have to worry about it at all - someone else always takes care of it. I'm very handy and generally do all the fixing that I'm capable of and send material receipts with rent when necessary, but the furnace? Nope. Water heater? Nope. That sort of thing.

So here's the situation.

We had terrible, terrible credit. We filed for bankruptcy in late 2010. Since then, we've turned things around in a big way and are going to crack $100k this year for the first time. We have what I consider to be a lifetime of student debt (second reason for previously awful credit - we had defaulted on all of it) and are on thirty-year standard payments that total to $450/mo between the both of us. We're paying $550/mo on two cars (split roughly equally); one loan is about a year away from payoff. The car loans have punitively high interest rates as a result of very poor credit at the time. We have three credit accounts that are less than a year old that we fully revolve every month.

Perfect payment histories on the following:
Rent (the biggie)
Credit cards
Both car loans

I have a 583, my wife has a 640. That gets us in reach of an FHA loan @ 3.75% with 1.5% required PMI with a 3.5% down payment. The house is listing for $180k, so that has us putting down $6.5k. That's not currently saved, but it's a trivial matter to get that piled up in a few months, and the landlord is completely fine deferring the sale while we save that up. He's also OK with transferring complete (physical) responsibility of the building to us in lieu of rent payments during that time to accelerate the time frame.

We currently pay $875/mo in rent. Mortgage + escrowed taxes + escrowed homeowner's insurance + PMI comes out to around $1350/mo. Lower unit rent is $950/mo. That leaves a shortage of $400/mo. My thought is that I pay the mortgage out of lower unit income and a portion of the rent that I'm not paying anymore. Then, the remainder of $875-$400=$475 goes into a savings account tied to the LLC (because landlord, OMG) so that I have money for the purpose of covering major repairs, a few months of an unoccupied lower unit, or, barring either of those, improvements. In this manner, my living situation and personal finances remain unaltered, and if all goes well, I am saving a huge chunk of money every year by default.

The landlord has said his realtor is kind of keen on the idea of selling the house to us, because then they don't have to market or even list the house. In that case, she's willing to shave something like a point and a half off of her fee.

How can this go wrong/sideways/sour?

Inspection comes back bad: Well, I already live here. Someone will have to deal with it, anyway. Cross that bridge if we come to it, I suppose, but I'd make sure he takes care of it.

Lower unit goes unoccupied for too long: Then I need to reexamine my asking price and/or how selective I'm being with prospective tenants.

Major repairs come due before I've saved enough: I can mitigate this by writing ""Seller buys home warranty"" into the offer. It's also possible that it can be covered by a 203(k), but that's not likely. 

Anything else?

Something else to consider: If I had $180k cash in hand, would I buy this house right now, or a different one?

That's not a fair question. I'd absolutely go snag a beautiful $180k single-family home. However, while we love this place (I mean, really, the apartment is wonderful), we can't reasonably afford a $180k single-family mortgage. It doesn't kill us, but even a $130k mortgage is pushing more than I'd prefer. The thing that makes this work is the lower unit income. That, and the very special arrangement with the current owner. While it seems that my wife and I could get an FHA loan in this range and pick up any duplex anywhere in town, there's the added benefit that we're getting fresh new tenants downstairs on a brand new lease who are an elderly couple who plan on living here for several years at the very least. 

And, we don't have to move. Out of a place that we really actually love living in.",finance,1466010730

personalfinance,Trying to decide between home refinance vs. equity loan/line of credit,"OK so I am 5 years into a 30 year conventional mortgage with no mortgage insurance.  initial amount was for 300,000.   current primary balance is 260,000  interest rate is 4.25 %.  I think my monthly payment is like 2000.  
There is an estimated 100,000 in equity in the house,  and it needs some updates.  I am thinking about starting the updating process to get the home ready to sell and move,  but I don't have a specific timeframe for that yet.  We definitely will need to move in the next five years though.   The house needs one bathroom redone,  and the kitchen at least partially redone

So anyway I was recently given a quote for a refinance with or without cash out.  closing costs are like 3500 (seems high?) my interest rate would decrease to 3.625-3.5 %  and my monthly payments would decrease to 1800-1600,  depending on if I took a 34,000 cashout to use on fixing up the house.  I don't need to lower my monthly payments, I'm comfortable where I am,  but since I would be decreasing my interest rate anyway,  is there a downside to refinancing now?  
Or should I just take out a home equity loan or line of credit on the equity to use for remodeling and skip the whole refinancing process?  I have no idea about interest rates and such with regards to that,  I haven't really started researching.      Thanks!",finance,1466014641

personalfinance,Surprise! It's defaulted student loan debt! How to pay them off without screwing my wife?,"My wife and I are recently married.    The in-laws stopped by the house last night and dropped off some letters that she'd accrued since she moved in a few years ago.   Things like her National Geographic subscription that she never changed the address on, etc.

And 2 letters from the Dept. of Education which, roughly translated, stated ""Hey, you owe us 25k for your student loans.   You haven't paid us.   Ever.   Pay up or else.""

We have ~10k in our ""OH SHIT!"" emergency funds.
We currently have $20k left to pay on our $60k mortgage.
We have no other debts, and my Credit score looks phenomenal.    We haven't looked at hers yet.  We're honestly a little afraid to know just how bad it is.  We'll be doing a full audit of her debts ASAP to make sure there's not something else lurking in the shadows.
I have a job which brings in ~$500 in income per month which is not already being spent on bills/food/etc.   My wife is unemployed, and is not likely to be employed in any significant capacity anytime soon (I will refrain from my ""the way we handle health issues in this country is bullshit"" rant.)


I immediately called the collection agency in charge of our debt, and after they gathered some numbers about our income and our monthly budget, they offered me 3 options.

* The first option, was to Settle with the state.   They'd knock 5k off the asking price, and I'd have to give them the remaining 20k immediately (within 90 days)
* The second option, was we could Rehabilitate the loan.  There were a whole bunch of caveats, but after listening to the agent and reading [This website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/default/get-out)  It basically boils down to ""Pay us $400 every month for the next ~10 months, and we'll remove all the bad things from your credit history since you went into default, and act like this default thing never happened.  And then you can go back to making payments on your loan like every other broke college student.""
* The third option sucks and is just ""pay us whatever you can afford to pay per month.  Repeat till the debt is paid off or you die.  The latter is more likely.""   Even the debt collection agent told me that it was a terrible plan and I shouldn't choose it.   

My bank offers a program where we can take out a loan against our house (Even while the mortgage is still on it)  Equal to 90% of the houses worth (minus what I still owe on the mortgage)   So I can raise $20k and pay off the loan in its entirety, consolidating it back at my Bank.   The interest rates for that look much nicer than the rates the loan currently sits at.... 4.5%  Vs. the 6% of the loans.

The thing that concerns me, however, is that paying the entire thing off at once does not include the nice ""We tell the credit reporting agencies to ignore the fact that you defaulted"" Thing that rehabilitation does. 

SO my options, as I see it, are

* Go to my bank, take out a 10-20k loan, Pay off her student debts now.   This saves $5k immediately, and saves significantly more money in the long term thanks to a lower interest rate
* Pay them for 9-10 months till they expunge bad things from my wife's credit history, and THEN move the loan over to my bank, costing me money in the long term but repairing my wife's credit.

I'm not too terribly concerned about my own Credit score... Since the whole debt and default thing happened before we were married it shouldn't really affect me.   But I also don't want to screw my wife's financial situation up.  That'd be bad, both in a ""Her finances are tied to mine from here on in"" sense, and a ""I Like this person and don't want her life to be suffering"" Sense.

I plan on meeting with my bank tomorrow to discuss exactly how they can help me with this situation, and to see if they (With their greater financial knowledge) can come up with any better ideas than I did about how to consolidate our debt into a nice easily paid off package.

The crux of my question to you, Reddit, is ""Just how bad is this bad credit?""   Is it worth the 5k+ Dollars to try and get that default record expunged?  It's not going to do anything for the missed payments which caused the default in the first place, so I don't even know if it'll help.

This whole situation has been a roller coaster of emotions.  I apologize if I wasn't clear anywhere...  I just... Don't really know what to do and am trying to make something work here.  I appreciate any advice, no matter how basic.",finance,1466020129

personalfinance,Should I go to college using student loans?,"Quick background: I'm 23. I was kicked out of my parents' house at 18 with no money, no car, and no education. I got my GED and finally got my AA in accounting last year. It's pretty much my dream to get my bachelors. I would love to pursue science or engineering, but I don't have most of the math prerequisites due to my AA being business related. I picked accounting because it was practical and I needed to support myself, but golly is it ever dull.

On to the financials: My take-home pay is currently about $2400 a month.

I have about $3500 in credit card debt: terminated a lease early to get out of an abusive relationship, rented an apartment with my sister, and paid cash for a beater car (my ex had insisted on driving me everywhere, so I didn't have a car). 

Monthly expenses:

Rent &amp; utilities: $675
Cell phone: $115
Health insurance &amp; meds: $280
Car insurance: $140
Gas/oil changes: $120
Subscriptions/Netflix: $50
Cat food/litter: $70
Shampoo/toothpaste/toilet paper/such items: $150

With the rest of my money, I split it about 50/50 with groceries/misc and a credit card payment. It depends on if I have any extra expenses, like I need new pants or I want to go to a concert or something. I'm as diligent as I could be but I try. I'll be honest, this is the most money I've ever had I went a little crazy when at first. The past couple of months I've been trying to cut my spending and reduce luxury items. 

Hopefully some of that was relevant. Here's my question: I want to go back to school full-time for Computer Engineering. If I took a really heavy course load it could be done in 3.5 years. The cost for courses alone would be about $30K. Looking at my expenses, I think I can live off of $20K a year, plus a little extra from freelance bookkeeping work (I have a few potential clients lined up). My course load would be too heavy to work much more than a few hours a week. 

That would mean I graduate with almost $100K in debt. I might be able to get scholarships or financial aid, but currently I make too much for federal aid. I'd rather over-estimate my debt than under-estimate.

The total repayment estimated difference is $400. My question is: should I contact my loan provider and ask to have it changed back before it takes effect (change completes in a few days, according to site) or let it stay as-is and just make more than the monthly payment when possible? 

The loan in question has the lowest balance (combination of 2 loans, principal amount of 5,500) with an average interest payment of 6.20%. Other loans include Great Lakes-controlled Direct Sub/Unsub loans (combination of 8 loans, principal amount of 23,750 with average interest of 4.46%) and a WellsFargo private student loan with 4,500 principal and 9.49% interest (my priority as it has the highest interest rate of any individual loan).

investing,"Court Backs Rules Treating Internet as Utility, Not Luxury","&gt; High-speed internet service can be defined as a utility, a federal court has ruled in a sweeping decision clearing the way for more rigorous policing of broadband providers and greater protections for web users.

&gt; The decision affirmed the government’s view that broadband is as essential as the phone and power and should be available to all Americans, rather than a luxury that does not need close government supervision.

&gt; The 2-to-1 decision from a three-judge panel at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Tuesday came in a case about rules applying to a doctrine known as net neutrality, which prohibit broadband companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of internet content to consumers.

&gt; Those rules, created by the Federal Communications Commission in early 2015, started a huge legal battle as cable, telecom and wireless internet providers sued to overturn regulations that they said went far beyond the F.C.C.’s authority and would hurt their businesses. On the other side, millions of consumers and giant tech firms rallied in favor of the regulations. President Obama also called for the strictest possible mandates on broadband providers.

&gt; [The court’s decision upheld the F.C.C. on the declaration of broadband as a utility, which was the most significant aspect of the rules. That has broad-reaching implications for web and telecommunications companies that have battled for nearly a decade over the need for regulation to ensure web users get full and equal access to all content online.](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/technology/net-neutrality-fcc-appeals-court-ruling.html?_r=0)

We need to consider any tax efficiency we can, and we are already maxing out retirement accounts.  

We have saved enough cash to buy a new home.  It is a spec home and building will be completed early January 2017 and the purchase price is $458,000.  Our current home is worth $210,000 and we owe $160,000.  The mortgage is 15 year and we pay $1500 per month. (We still have $2,000 per month left over after all bills to save). Rather than sell, I am considering renting it.  A long term renter would probably pay $1700/month to live in it.  I think I could revenue about $3000/month via an airbnb rental (keeping in mind there are more costs like utilities, basic cable, cleaning, furnishing).  I haven't decided yet since I have to consult with a CPA on tax implications and such, but in general does this seem to be a decent idea?  I have set a ""make me move"" price on zillow in case anyone wants to make us an offer on the house sometime in the next 6 months.

Here are some other costs of the property:
$2,400 per year property taxes
$900 per year homeowner's insurance
4% interest rate on the $160,000 balance.  
Purchase price was $190,000 5 years ago so depreciation would be $7600/year based on the 25 year schedule.
Lawn mowning:  $700/year
electric, gas, water:  $3,000/year (this would be a write off if airbnb property I am assuming).

Advantages of selling the property would be getting about $40,000 to put into the new house or pay off a vehicle that has $800 per month payments.  We could pay this vehicle off anyway once the March 2017 bonus arrives but cash sooner is always better than cash later I guess and I do want to kill the high car payment.

My financial situation at the moment: I've been working for a well established company for the past 8 months, making 40k/year. I am well regarded at my company, and I do not anticipate leaving for another year or so (I'm also anticipating a raise at some point in the next few months, probably to $45k/year). My employer pays for my insurance, phone plan, and some other smaller perks. My monthly expenses total about $1500/month, so I've socked away an average $900 a month for the past 8 months. I also recently inherited $12k from a life insurance policy on my grandmother (who passed away). So at the moment I have almost $20k liquid in my savings/checking account.
  
I went to a public college, and my parents helped me pay, so fortunately I only have $17K in student loans. It's four loans, all run through Nelnet. The loans break out as follows: $2100 @ 4.5%, $5400 @ 6.8%, $7500 @ 6.8%, $2500 @ 3.8%
  
I'm wondering if I should pay off a chunk of this now. Maybe pay off the two loans with the higher interest rate? I know I should keep a portion of my savings liquid in case of emergencies. Perhaps $8k? If I applied the rest of my savings to the loans, that would allow me to almost pay off the two loans at 6.8%.

I have never even made any payments on my student loans, I've just been deferring and forebearing them (I know, I know). In 2013 I believe, my loans were either transferred to or bought out by FedLoan. I called US Dept of Education, and they have no knowledge of any history of an account with me. I called FedLoan and they have no information or record of any late payments. So I called TransUnion to dispute the late payment (I believe I was awaiting Forbearance or Deferment for the period, which was granted), and they have no knowledge of any account with US Dept of Education. But when I look at my credit report with the Credit Karma app, it says I had seven accounts with US Dept of Education, all ""closed - transferred"", and all with a red mark for a single 90-119 day late payment. How could they not see this when I called? I was about to just file the dispute online, but was worried they would only remove the late payment mark from one of the loans and not all seven.

However, my parents do not have any money in their savings account (a paycheck to paycheck lifestyle) nor do they make enough to save enough money for a down payment within their lifetime. Because I start medical school this fall, they wanted to see if I could take out a student loan under my name from a bank so that they could use it as their down payment. They do not want to take out a loan under their name because of the amount of credit card debts they have. I'm not sure how much debt they have but I would guess it to be around $20-30K. I don't know their credit score. 

I was looking at the numbers for this (interest rates and such), but there are so many variables still for our part that I was getting confused. I was wondering if anyone here had some something similar and if anyone could answer my questions.

1) Is this legal? All the money I take under my name would be used as a down payment.

2) If I do this, how will it affect my federal loans? I have already received and accepted my financial aid (in forms of unsubsidized federal loans) for 2016-2017 school year and I have chosen to accept the max amount I can get. If I get a private loan from a bank, am I required to report it when I fill out taxes next year (I don't think I have to report my federal student loans)? Will it affect the amount of financial aid loans I receive next year?

Personally, I do not think it is a good idea. My parents have never owned a home/condo (we did rent a house for the longest time). I think it'd be better if they could wait 7 ish more years until I become a full-fledged doctor and I can buy them a house with my salary.",finance,1466031147

The interest rate under my newly minted Direct Consolidation Loan is 5.500%, which seemed higher than I was anticipating. When I calculated my weighted interest rate before beginning the consolidation process, I figured it would be 5.387% (a 0.113% difference between actual and expected).  

What I failed to realize (my fault for not reading all the words) was as part of the terms of the consolidation, the weighted interest rate would be rounded up to the nearest 0.125%.  Basically, the Dept. of Ed charges up to an eighth of one percent to consolidate your loans.  This might not seem like a lot, but for me it amounts to an extra $76.36 per year and $2290.80 over the course of 30 years.

personalfinance,"Current home should be condemned, looking to buy with bad credit in PA","I'll try to keep the background short but I feel it's all pertinent to my financial history. I currently live in a trailer with my 70-year-old mother. She got cancer in 2008 shortly after we moved in and has been unable to work since. I was still in college at the time and we only had my part time income for bills so I started paying for food, gas, extra bills, and some of  her surgeries with my credit cards. By 2012 I had accumulated 40k in credit debt and stopped paying that year because I couldn't even afford the minimum payments any longer. 
Fast forward to now, our trailer is in disrepair. We've had water damage from the horrible winters and pipes bursting. Part of the floor is falling through in my old bedroom and half of the electricity doesn't work. We can't use our kitchen sink because of the pipes and I sleep on the couch because it wouldn't surprise me if mold was growing where the floor is buckled from water damage underneath the carpet. I know it would make more financial sense to fix this place but we also hate the property owners. My mom broke her arm this winter because they don't allow us to use any chemicals or salt to melt the ice because they say it will pollute the ground water. Plus we paid 6k for this trailer and it would cost thousands to fix.


I own the trailer but would not make anything substantial upon selling it. We pay 350/month lot rent. 
I make about 22k per year in human services and my mom brings in close to 12k per year from social security. Rent for a decent apartment is 800 but actual houses in the next town over sell for much less than 80k. 
My brother actually agreed to help me and we found a house for 50k but he can't get the FHA loan since it wouldn't be his primary residence. He told them he'd basically be renting it to me which they don't allow income properties even though I'd just be paying the mortgage as if it were mine. My credit score is about 610 so I thought I couldn't get any type of loan. I basically only needed his name and credit score and I would pay for everything else since total it'd be less than 500/month. Property taxes are about 900 per year on this 50k home and it's in very good condition.

I'm confused by the whole process of home ownership but it seems like I could at least get an FHA loan with a 610 credit score. I read the rest of the side bar and I should probably add that I don't have a 401k, I'm not paying my credit cards (some debt has fallen off already, 2 months ago my credit score was 550). I'm on income based repayment for my federal student loans so I actually pay nothing for that because my income is so low. I have 2 personal student loans (17k) bought by AES that I stopped paying 15 months ago when I switched jobs so they're probably in default. I also have about 2-3 thousand in unpaid medical bills for myself when I had surgery in October but they don't appear on my credit report. 

Anyway, if you're still reading I'd love some advice on my options for buying a home since rent is so expensive. Yes, I'm very poor so I do have a part time job in addition to my full time job and will get a 3rd job if I have to. I just want a safe place for my mom to live. We will never leave this area so buying seems like a better investment and better option for her because she can't go up many stairs like she would have to in an apartment. 

To summarize, my more specific questions are:
should I wait another 2 years until the rest of my credit cards fall off of my report and raise my credit score?
Would I even be able to get an FHA loan since there are so many things I've not paid?
Are there any government programs to help us? (we live in the Erie, PA area but in a smaller town)",finance,1466047583

financialindependence,Handling of Family Finances - Death of a Parent,"**TL:DR: Cancer sucks. Caring for your parents and tending to their finances should have a human element. Don't assume that your priorities are their priorities. I miss my dad :(**

**Introduction:**

About 22 months ago, my father was diagnosed with cancer. 14 months ago, we discovered it had metastasized. He passed away about 5 months ago at the age of 65. I have been responsible for familial finances in his absence, and visitors to the forum expressed some interest in some of the challenges that have arisen as a byproduct of all this. While this doesn't relate directly to FIRE, I think a lot of us are of the age where we're beginning to look towards the finances of our parents - whether due to ailing health or poor planning - and hopefully this can help someone overcome some of the challenges I faced in this process.

**Background:**

My dad was a very successful senior executive at a publicly traded company. He handled 100% of my family's finances, including bill payment, insurance payments, and financial planning. Over the course of the last 5 or 6 years, he and I have been discussing portfolio optimization strategies as he attempted to reduce his exposure to the company he worked for (prudent for anyone who receives equity compensation), but prior to his cancer diagnosis, all of our conversations had focused pretty exclusively on the benefits of passive, ETF investing.

**Cancer Diagnosis and Planning:**

As soon as he was initially diagnosed, we immediately shifted the scope of our conversation from portfolio optimization to how to best take care of my mother. My father was a wonderful teacher in so many ways, but one of the single greatest lessons that he taught me was the difference between ""capital R"" Right and right - meaning, at the end of the day, not everyone sits around for hours everyday thinking about ways to maximize their portfolios returns, and that if I didn't consider the human element, I would never be effective in carrying out my father's wishes to take care of my mom in a responsible fashion.

There's almost nothing good about cancer, but one thing it does give you is ample time to plan. During my dad's illness, we were able to consolidate the bulk of his liquid net worth into a small number of accounts, check (and double check) life insurance policies and payouts, establish how we wanted to handle the probate process, and, most importantly, put a plan in place for how to handle finances in a way that would keep my mother feeling comfortable and empowered. 

For our situation, we settled on a monthly ""salary"" that roughly equates to a 1.5% withdrawal rate on my parents' liquid net worth annually.

One other big component of our planning had to do with a policy that was unknown to me prior to dealing with all this - assets held by one spouse experience something called a ""step up in basis"" once transferred to the surviving spouse. To give an example, if my parents purchased a house in my father's name for $250,000 in 1980, but it was worth $1,000,000 in 2016, upon his death, the home's cost basis for tax purposes would be stepped up to $1,000,000. For join assets, they receive a partial step-up in basis - in the example above, the basis would be reset at $625,000. This is applicable to investment vehicles as well, and it definitely presents an opportunity to lower an estate's eventual tax burden.

**Unexpected Challenges:**

A number of things came up in the aftermath of my father's death (above and beyond what you would expect) that I think are worth mentioning here. 

**First** - expect every service associated with a deceased person to be shutoff. While we anticipated certain things, quite a few took us off-guard. The main credit card used by both my parents had my father listed as the primary cardholder, meaning it was shut down within a week of his death (causing my mom to call me in a crying panic when her payment was denied at the grocery store). Even worse, my dad's Bank of America online account, which contained all the bill payment information he used to pay for housing expenses, was unexpectedly shutdown, with Bank of America refusing to transfer that information to an account we setup on my mother's behalf (despite her status as a joint account holder on the underlying checking account). My advice here would be to take care of as much of this stuff ahead of time as is humanly possible.

**Second** - be diligent with respect to identify theft. Apparently, there's an subset of the population that uses information contained in obituaries to perform identify theft on the recently deceased. We had an incident with some unexplained charges in the weeks after my father's death that were immediately resolved, but I caution everyone to be extremely diligent when it comes to this.

**Third** - patience. Given all the planning I was able to do with my father, I had a strong desire to get everything done as quickly as possible. With everything else going on - the probate process, spending time with friends and family, acclimating to a life without her partner, etc. - my mom was not interested in moving quickly. Every time I felt frustration or annoyance, I just remembered the point my dad hammered home time and time again - the ""right"" thing for my mom wasn't always going to be the ""Right"" thing objectively.

**Estate Planning:**

Someone yesterday mentioned having an interest in the generational component of our plan. Without going into too much detail, there are a few standard things going on that might be of interest to the community here.

Beginning in 2010 or 2011, my parents took out something referred to as a ""Second to Die"" Life Insurance policy. The life insurance policy pays out to their children when the second of my parents die, and is funded using the annual gifting exemption of one parent to each child (presently around $14k per person).

Additionally, as discussed above, my mom's 1.5% withdrawal rate all but guarantees that my parents estate will continue to grow even as we lose my father's W-2 income. As such, we've begun the process of discussing early use of the unified tax exemption - basically, every person is entitled to give up to ~$5.45mm to the next generation prior to paying federal estate taxes. 

While we've entertained some conversations on it and have a long-term plan (it will likely involve outright gifting and the use of an instrument called a ""GRAT""), we are being purposefully slow in implementation. The difference in waiting a year has almost no impact financially, but it has a huge impact in solidifying my mother's comfort in the ""new normal."" 

**Final Thoughts:**

I've never seen my mother more vulnerable than she is right now, and being able to provide a level of comfort and security through assuming financial responsibilities has been one of the few things to bring me happiness and a sense of accomplishment in the aftermath of my father's death.

That said, there's a huge burden in holding the trust of my mother. I've had to think about her finances in a fundamentally different way than I think about my own, and while I've instituted basic best practices where appropriate, I've also been VERY careful to make sure that I'm making the best decision for her, and not for a situation where I imagine myself in her situation. 

I'm happy to answer any more questions that people may have, but hopefully this provides some information that is helpful for anyone who is faced with a similar situation.

- I drive a 2008 car w/ 140k miles.  Wife just sold her 2007 160k mile car and we're looking to buy a new(ish) small SUV for upcoming baby.
- experienced homeowners.  we both just sold out old properties and moved across country to TX and are looking to purchase a new primary residence.  
- I have student loan debt, ~$40k still, but low interest rates ~3.5%


So not sure what to do here.  We could easily purchase the property outright or we can do a traditional 20% downpayment mortgage and put all this extra $$ elsewhere.  What do you think?  Not sure where to invest at the moment outside of my regular 401k/IRA/HSA options.

Would it just be better to put it in the house 100% and not pay that 4% (or whatever I qualify for) mortgage?  If we own the house 100%, doesn't that give us a lot of powerful leverage to use against loans for purchasing further investment properties?

economy,Don't fight the Fed,"So, in general it is almost always true that fighting the Fed is a losing battle. If the Fed wants asset inflation they *will* get it, eventually.

In a loosening cycle it's just silly to be short because the Fed will continue to loosen until asset prices inflate. In a tightening cycle it gets harder because while the Fed is no longer your friend stock may still go up anyway due to an improving economy.

However, where are we now? Yesterday's Fed announcement sounded to me like the start of another loosening cycle or at a minimum the end of tightening. Is the Fed going to start to target asset prices again? I may start to bias toward long positions if the Fed is either on hold or moving to a bias of getting easier.

But it's really confusing right now. The fed can only cut rates twice before they're at the zero bound again. And they've said so much bad stuff about QE I'm not sure it's politically feasible that they restart QE in the absence of a really severe crisis. Where are we?

I'm planning on going back to school online and while tuition is cheap enough (24k for a B.A.) for a loan, I'd prefer to go through FASFA and get financial aid. I've applied for financial aid in 2011 after high school, did a year of college for a certificate, thought I wanted to get an associates at the time, and dropped out about 2 months after the new semester began.

Early 2015 I was sent to collections over a remaining balance on a phone bill I put off and didn't pay. Not really the most mature thing to do, and now I may be paying for it. I don't want to have to go through a bank or Quicken Loans, etc because my credit isn't in the best shape and I'd like to work on that before applying for a loan that will just give me laughable interest rates and very well may not even allow me to get one. 

Just recently I decided I want to go back to school and now my biggest worry is wondering if FASFA will deny me financial aid because of my credit/collections history. Of course applying for a loan is the last option for me so I'd like to explore all my options. I don't live with my parents anymore and I file independently when tax season rolls around, I'm not married and I have no kids.

I've read online it depends on why you were sent to collections, by whom, is it school related....etc.  Thankfully I haven't been sent to collections for any school reasons and all I owe to the college I went to is about $1k.

Is this just a case of it ""trading on technicals"" where the price is determined by people randomly drawing lines and not looking at the bigger picture, or is there really something systemic going on that the market knows that I don't?

I'm bullish on the US economy. We're one of the only major economies to not offer negative interest rates on bonds, and I firmly believe we'll see interest rates raised this year, possibly multiple times. People are losing their shit over these interest rate ""hikes"", which are going to be like 10 -20 basis points, at most. It's not going to crater the global financial system to go from .25% to .5%

The US isn't growing at light speed, but it is growing, so I see that at a bullish indicator for the years to come.

Regardless, I'm in it for the long haul. I'm dropping 5k in it as soon as my money is cleared with TD Ameritrade.

ethereum,Where is the central NEWS from main developers? Too many unanswered questions.,"Hi guys, please don't take this is as FUD as I have 1. invested in ether and 2. integrated it into our websites as a merchant.  But what is most important to me is When will this POS shift happen are there any recent estimates on how this casper is coming?  Where the heck is the central hub of information from core developers at? cause ethereum.org is not very busy with new info. 

I am loving the speed of ether for our website and the smart contracts offer amazing potential but I'm far from being able to program that at the moment.  

I run an ether full node and noticed doing a personal_signAndSendTransaction returned insufficient gas as I left it to default and tried to sweep an account leaving 5 cents usd buffer for gas fees I was amazed that the fee was &gt; 5 cents usd (just yesterday) So now I tweaked the app and we allow for 10 cent usd for gas fee..  but it leaves me a bit miffed

Is there a geth or api command that can estimate gas needed? I need to automate this so i can simply manually recompute fees all the time LOL.. This is my frustration very hard to get support to specific questions. Maybe I'm not smart enough but I shouldn't have to be :( 

Is there a formula and way to query a dependable source on the blockchain stats to compute gas needed Or via my node? cause otherwise its a nightmare trying to sweep an account to achieve a zero balance.

Also is there a way a smart contracts for dummies tutorial anywhere?? 

I'm very excited about ether even though I hold mostly BTC as an investor but what concerns me is no HARD ROADMAP to inflationary figures.  Everyone uses the analogy of GAS but that's not really good.. Gas in the real world is CONSUMED but gas in ether is just shifted from one player to the next.. Unless I'm mistaken.. yet again another unanswered question leaving uncertainty.  If Gas is simply shifted from one to the next and never actually burned up then we need to FIX the supply (inflation rate NEAR ZERO). Without a fixed supply it PUNISHES holders of ether and that is counter productive. With wei 18 digits there is NO reason what so ever to even have inflation beyond maybe covering for lost coins.

Anyway hope some of you Ether Heads can point me in the right direction to more certain news from the core devs and a roadmap as well as how in the heck to computer gas etc etc..

Thanks guys (and gals)

personalfinance,"4 person company looking at 401k options, meeting with current adviser next week, need help.","I am part of a small accounting firm (4 people) and we have a 401k plan with Wells Fargo.

I have been doing some research and watching some videos such as:

[PBS - Frontline: The Retirement Gamble](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/retirement-gamble/)

[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Retirement Plans (HBO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZSpET11ZY)

and from what I can gather, the expense ratio is a HUGE deal when it comes to investments.  Also, the cheaper Index Funds are generally just as good as the high costing actively managed funds.

I was blown away by some of the numbers (I am numbers guy so it was easy to follow but at the same time, it was very eye opening) and how investing in funds with upwards of 2% expense ratio over 30-50 years can cut your investment IN HALF OR MORE!  And it made sense.  If a fund has a 2% exp ratio, and you subtract 2% of the total value of your investment in that fund each year, after 30+ years of losing 2% annually, plus missing out on the compounding of these investments, for a 31 yr old such as myself, we're talking potentially hundreds of thousands lost!

Here is a good calculator I used to compare my current options and the Vanguard options I found online:
http://www.begintoinvest.com/expense-ratio-calculator/

So I talked to my boss and had him call our 401k guy for his annual phone conference and I was explaining to the guy that my aggressive portfolio that he suggested to me has nearly a 1.5% weighted average expense ratio and that seemed incredibly high and when looking over the online Vanguard options for example, the expense ratios of the funds that we have cost 10x more than what I found from Vanguard (Wells Fargo averaging around 1.5% with Vanguard around .15%).

Here is the entire list of available funds in our current plan:
http://i.imgur.com/Ad5thlc.png

Here is the list from Vanguard I was referring to:
https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/list#/mutual-funds/asset-class/month-end-returns

His response was that the 1.5% average expense ratio that we have in our plan is comparable to the market and don't seem high to him.  The 2% of the Federal Kaufmann small cap funds were a little high but the market was around 1.5% on those too.  He pulled something up on his side that ranked the top 10 or top 1% funds in the small and large cap categories based on returns the last 5 years and he started listing off expense ratios that were within .1-.3% of what Wells Fargo offers, which with someone such as myself with limited knowledge on the subject, felt like I missed something or I misunderstood something going into the meeting.

He also said that when we first setup the 401k plan for the firm, that we setup the most cost efficient plan so that may have limited our options (ie as you see we have no index options, no target date options, etc.).

He will be looking into different plans that may have more options available, maybe some with lower expense ratios, some with index and target date options and we'll call him again next week to discuss.

My plan is to call Vanguard tomorrow and talk with them on their different options as their annual cost is similar to what we have now, only incurring a $1,500 transfer fee, which if I am reading these expense ratio comparisons correctly, will be easily absorbed within a few months from the additional savings.

Is there anything else I should do to be prepared for the meeting next week? 

Because we are so small (&lt;.5M), are we really stuck in such limited (and extremely high costing) options for a 401k plan no matter where we go?

Am I looking at the wrong thing with these Vanguard Mutual Fund options and the average expense ratio for comparable funds to what we are being offered really 1-1.5%+?

Thank you for your help!

EDIT:

Thank you all for the very helpful advice, I am glad I took the time to do the research now as it seems like best time to invest properly is like the best time to plant a tree, 20 years go, however the 2nd best time is today.  I feel good about the future of our plan and I want to thank PF for helping me.  Here is the update:

I spoke with my boss about Employee Fiduciary and he's feeling a little reluctant to go with a small no-name company, however after speaking with Vanguard, I was very surprised what they would be able to offer and it sounded good to both my boss and myself.  At this point, we are waiting for our current 401k guy to call back to see what he is able to come up with, but I doubt that he would be able to match what Vanguard is offering, even with the transfer fee.

From what the local Vanguard guy said (if I understood him correctly):



* one-time transfer cost of $1,500

* Annual cost of ~$3,500 which does NOT include an adviser though the guy I talked to said he would help them through the process of the initial picking of the funds.

* We would have ~150 open Vanguard funds available to choose from

* We would select ~20 for our pool (a few from each category, ie index, small, large, int'l, etc.) and then we would invest in those 20 (with target date funds counting as 1 total)

* Their average index exp ratio is ~.1% (our current plan doesn't even have index funds available)

* The average overall exp ratio of the 150 options we have is .18% (our currently plans overall average is ~1.5%)

* They also have for a very small fee (% of plan assets) a 3rd party adviser (fiduciary) that will help us along the way.

* Lastly, I didn't even know this was possible but it interested my boss, for a small annual fee on a per participant basis, you can add an individual stock to the plan that you can allocate a small portion of your contributions to.",finance,1466106542
personalfinance,Handling of Family Finances - Death of a Parent (x-post from /r/financialindependence,"Hi Personal Finance!


I made this post in /r/financialindependence, and /u/drovemychevytothe suggested I cross-post it here, so here it is! Hopefully, you guys find it useful and informative.


**TL:DR: Cancer sucks. Caring for your parents and tending to their finances should have a human element. Don't assume that your priorities are their priorities. I miss my dad :(**

**Introduction:**
About 22 months ago, my father was diagnosed with cancer. 14 months ago, we discovered it had metastasized. He passed away about 5 months ago at the age of 65. I have been responsible for familial finances in his absence, and visitors to the forum expressed some interest in some of the challenges that have arisen as a byproduct of all this. While this doesn't relate directly to FIRE, I think a lot of us are of the age where we're beginning to look towards the finances of our parents - whether due to ailing health or poor planning - and hopefully this can help someone overcome some of the challenges I faced in this process.

**Background:**
My dad was a very successful senior executive at a publicly traded company. He handled 100% of my family's finances, including bill payment, insurance payments, and financial planning. Over the course of the last 5 or 6 years, he and I have been discussing portfolio optimization strategies as he attempted to reduce his exposure to the company he worked for (prudent for anyone who receives equity compensation), but prior to his cancer diagnosis, all of our conversations had focused pretty exclusively on the benefits of passive, ETF investing.

**Cancer Diagnosis and Planning:**
As soon as he was initially diagnosed, we immediately shifted the scope of our conversation from portfolio optimization to how to best take care of my mother. My father was a wonderful teacher in so many ways, but one of the single greatest lessons that he taught me was the difference between ""capital R"" Right and right - meaning, at the end of the day, not everyone sits around for hours everyday thinking about ways to maximize their portfolios returns, and that if I didn't consider the human element, I would never be effective in carrying out my father's wishes to take care of my mom in a responsible fashion.

There's almost nothing good about cancer, but one thing it does give you is ample time to plan. During my dad's illness, we were able to consolidate the bulk of his liquid net worth into a small number of accounts, check (and double check) life insurance policies and payouts, establish how we wanted to handle the probate process, and, most importantly, put a plan in place for how to handle finances in a way that would keep my mother feeling comfortable and empowered.

For our situation, we settled on a monthly ""salary"" that roughly equates to a 1.5% withdrawal rate on my parents' liquid net worth annually.

One other big component of our planning had to do with a policy that was unknown to me prior to dealing with all this - assets held by one spouse experience something called a ""step up in basis"" once transferred to the surviving spouse. To give an example, if my parents purchased a house in my father's name for $250,000 in 1980, but it was worth $1,000,000 in 2016, upon his death, the home's cost basis for tax purposes would be stepped up to $1,000,000. For join assets, they receive a partial step-up in basis - in the example above, the basis would be reset at $625,000. This is applicable to investment vehicles as well, and it definitely presents an opportunity to lower an estate's eventual tax burden.

**Unexpected Challenges:**

A number of things came up in the aftermath of my father's death (above and beyond what you would expect) that I think are worth mentioning here.

**First** - expect every service associated with a deceased person to be shutoff. While we anticipated certain things, quite a few took us off-guard. The main credit card used by both my parents had my father listed as the primary cardholder, meaning it was shut down within a week of his death (causing my mom to call me in a crying panic when her payment was denied at the grocery store). Even worse, my dad's Bank of America online account, which contained all the bill payment information he used to pay for housing expenses, was unexpectedly shutdown, with Bank of America refusing to transfer that information to an account we setup on my mother's behalf (despite her status as a joint account holder on the underlying checking account). My advice here would be to take care of as much of this stuff ahead of time as is humanly possible.

**Second** - be diligent with respect to identify theft. Apparently, there's an subset of the population that uses information contained in obituaries to perform identify theft on the recently deceased. We had an incident with some unexplained charges in the weeks after my father's death that were immediately resolved, but I caution everyone to be extremely diligent when it comes to this.

**Third** - patience. Given all the planning I was able to do with my father, I had a strong desire to get everything done as quickly as possible. With everything else going on - the probate process, spending time with friends and family, acclimating to a life without her partner, etc. - my mom was not interested in moving quickly. Every time I felt frustration or annoyance, I just remembered the point my dad hammered home time and time again - the ""right"" thing for my mom wasn't always going to be the ""Right"" thing objectively.

**Estate Planning:**

Someone yesterday mentioned having an interest in the generational component of our plan. Without going into too much detail, there are a few standard things going on that might be of interest to the community here.

Beginning in 2010 or 2011, my parents took out something referred to as a ""Second to Die"" Life Insurance policy. The life insurance policy pays out to their children when the second of my parents die, and is funded using the annual gifting exemption of one parent to each child (presently around $14k per person).

Additionally, as discussed above, my mom's 1.5% withdrawal rate all but guarantees that my parents estate will continue to grow even as we lose my father's W-2 income. As such, we've begun the process of discussing early use of the unified tax exemption - basically, every person is entitled to give up to ~$5.45mm to the next generation prior to paying federal estate taxes.

While we've entertained some conversations on it and have a long-term plan (it will likely involve outright gifting and the use of an instrument called a ""GRAT""), we are being purposefully slow in implementation. The difference in waiting a year has almost no impact financially, but it has a huge impact in solidifying my mother's comfort in the ""new normal.""

**Final Thoughts:**

I've never seen my mother more vulnerable than she is right now, and being able to provide a level of comfort and security through assuming financial responsibilities has been one of the few things to bring me happiness and a sense of accomplishment in the aftermath of my father's death.

That said, there's a huge burden in holding the trust of my mother. I've had to think about her finances in a fundamentally different way than I think about my own, and while I've instituted basic best practices where appropriate, I've also been VERY careful to make sure that I'm making the best decision for her, and not for a situation where I imagine myself in her situation.

I'm happy to answer any more questions that people may have, but hopefully this provides some information that is helpful for anyone who is faced with a similar situation.

personalfinance,Determining Student Loan Payment Amounts,"Hello personalfinance!

I'm a recent grad who is walking into his first ""real"" job in two weeks. While I am confident I can figure out most of my financial situation, I am unsure on how best to tackle my student loans. 

&amp;nbsp;

I have read about both the avalanche and snowball methods of paying off debt, understand both, and have seen the flowchart in the ""How to Handle $"" post, but I'd like some further direction. Namely, the things that I'm trying to figure out are 1) how much of my monthly income should I contribute to my loans, and 2) what kind and how much of an emergency fund/savings should I have built up before I begin aggressively paying my loans. While I understand that these questions depend on the exact state of my financial situation, I am looking for more general guidelines that I can employ to help me develop a monthly budget.

&amp;nbsp;

In addition, I'd like to better understand how student loan consolidation works. AFAIK, the consolidator basically takes on the burden of your debt and pays off the current amount for you, giving you a different (usually lower) interest rate than your current loan provider. In return, you now pay the consolidator every month, and the consolidator makes back their money (and their profit) from these payments. Is this correct, or at least an ""ok"" way of looking at the process? In addition, can loans from companies like SallieMae and Navient be consolidated, or is it only federal loans? Is it beneficial to consolidate all of my loans into one, or are there more things to consider? Can I choose to pay more than the monthly payment given to me by the consolidator? Lastly, are there any advantages to consolidating at one time versus another time? (For example, my research into one consolidator shows an average of ~4.5% reduction in interest if I were to consolidate my loans today. Would waiting longer have any effect on my interest rate, or is it all based off of that finicky thing known as ""the market""?)

financialindependence,Is it worth paying off my new mortgage?,"Hey Everyone, so I just bought a house! Now the question is, what do I do with any extra money: Pay off the mortgage or Put away in an investment account?

A few details:

- Loan amount is $146,300

- $63/mo Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)

- 3.75% APR

Now I know that paying off my mortgage would be great psychologically and financially. But I don’t think the math adds up. If I pay off the mortgage, I gain a guaranteed 3.75% return on my investment + $63/month PMI after a while, and I cut interest paid / time invested significantly. 

Meanwhile, if I pay into an investment account, I gain a hypothetical, say, 7% inflation adjusted return from an S&amp;P 500 index fund, plus I’ll save on taxes a bit in the final years of the loan, minus the 3.75% return that I could have gained above. 

To me it seems like paying off the mortgage early is an advantage of the past, when interest rates under 10% were not to be found. Am I missing something? Is it just so that when FIRE comes along I don’t have a house payment and therefore have less risk?

Forex,Any advice?,"Hi,

I apologise if this is really newish or inappropriate to this forum. I am relatively new to Forex trading or any trading really and I was just wondering if anybody could tell me if I am pointed in the right direction. 
I intend to keep an eye on the Macro Economics, inflation figures, interest rates etc. 
Like for example today the Eurozone inflation figures were weak so I waited 5 minutes (past the crazy phase) and then shorted as I was reading stuff about the figures being bad and Europe suffering from deflation etc.
Does anyone know if this could be a profitable strategy. I intend to wait for significant news events (CPI, GDP) that report figures that are of a significant deviation from expected so that the direction the currency will move will be reasonably predictable or at least more predictable than if I was in trades closer to the expected figures.
I don't have a lot of education so I'm not really on top of all the reports. I feel quite stupid sometimes as I don't fully understand the terminology but I have an idea if what they are referring to. 
I have always had to work hard to earn some money from a young age due to coming from a pretty shitty background etc but I think I might have the ability to do this. 
Does anybody have any advice as to whether I am right in thinking along these lines or whether I'm just totally barking up the wrong tree and would be effectively throwing money away.

Her car and my car sustained a decent amount of damage.  I should note that I drive about 30 minutes (one way) to work on a daily basis, so this vehicle was necessary for me.  It is a 2007 Chrysler 300 with 150,000 miles.

USAA, my insurer, accepted the claim and recommended a body shop for me to take my vehicle to for an appraisal of the damage.  Today, after having my car for two days, the body shop called me and said the damage would cost about $5600 to repair.  They said that it was above a price threshold, so they were required to get approval from USAA to begin work.  The tech told me he considered the car a total loss, in his opinion.

No sooner had I hung up the phone, there was an email from USAA telling me that my car ""may be a total loss.""  It had some other details regarding the settlement, and a contact name and number.  I have called and left multiple messages with this person, with no response.

About an hour ago, another USAA email appeared, asking me to accept my settlement for my total loss.  I was somewhat confused, as they never told me (in clear language) that my car wouldn't be receiving the body work.  USAA offered me $5835 for the vehicle, which includes all deductibles and such.

Now, at the bottom of that page, is a ""Do you accept your Net Settlement?  Yes/No"" question.  

If it was up to me, I would pay my $500 deductible and have the work done.  On the other hand, at 150,000 miles, the car may have been approaching the end of its natural life.  It was running relatively well up until this point, though.

With my savings and the settlement, as well as a 1.8% 36 month auto loan from Navy Federal, I can afford about a $20,000 new car.

I guess my overall question is this: should I accept this settlement and purchase a new car this weekend, or is there room to push back to USAA for them to authorize the body work?  I really appreciate any and all advice.

Having said that, here is my situation.

I have created a $5,000 safety net for my self and with my current income I can keep that pretty well secured and still be able to put a few hundred bucks into a savings account every month. From what I've read that's Step One to conquering personal finance.

Admittedly, I have not created a budget. I know I need to do that but again I am not great at finance or math so I feel as if it will be a pain.

I know the next step after creating a budget is getting any debt paid off. I finished law school last May, passed the Bar Exam in October, and started working at a job that pays $52,000 before taxes. I have six loans that I received through the federal government which are all handled by the same provider and they total over $145,000. Here is the general breakdown of the amount of the loans and the interest rates:

1.) Outstanding Balance of $17,000 with an interest rate of 7.900%

2.) Outstanding Balance of $22,000 with an interest rate of 6.800%

3.) Outstanding Balance of $27,000 with an interest rate of 6.410%

4.) Outstanding Balance of $21,000 with an interest rate of 6.210%

5.) Outstanding Balance of $38,000 with an interest rate of 7.200%

6.) Outstanding Balance of $19,000 with an interest rate of 5.410%

I am tempted to put all of the $11,000 I have in savings straight towards one of these loans and then put a serious effort into paying off the loan that I put the $11,000 towards. Then, I would give my self time to build up another lump sum of cash and put it towards another loan with the same idea of aggressively trying to pay it off in full thereafter. Is this a good strategy?

If so, I was originally thinking loan #1 because that would only leave me with about $6,000 which I could hopefully pay in full in a few months. However, it does look tempting to cut $11,000 out of loan #5 given the large amount of money and the 2nd highest interest rate. 

Also, I'm hoping to buy a house in the somewhat near future. Realistically, I'm hoping in roughly 2 years. If I put all $11,000 towards one of these loans, I'm worried I won't be able to have enough saved up for a house. 

Again, I know little about personal finance and I try to read up on it in this subreddit a little bit, but any thoughts are greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Balancing crippling student debt with buying a house,"So after many years of jumping from apartment to apartment to condo and now rental house, the amount a rental house costs per month is now getting ridiculous enough for us to consider other options.  We didn't think about buying a house before because of uncertainty of our jobs and if Washington was a good place to live, but now we're feeling pretty comfortable to at least spend another 5 years here.  

We currently have about $30,000 in student debt with a interest rate of around 6.5% and currently make around $6,000 a month.  We try to make payments of about $1,500 to our loans and now our rent suddenly increased to $1,450 per month.  Looking at current mortgage payments for a house costing around $250k over 30 years it looks like a better option since we plan on being here for awhile.  

So my question is how do I effectively save for this in the upcoming year, or if I should at all.  Someone mentioned they didn't save much for the house (lower than 5% I believe) and got a loan for the house no problem.  This is my first house, but I've never heard of this before and overall this sounds like a bad idea.  That said, with my current student loans being at a interest rate that most loans will never breach, would this be the better option in my circumstance?",finance,1466127850

personalfinance,[Housing]Is buying a house the right option for me?,"I currently make about $100,000 a year and my current rent/utilities are $1400 a month. I also have a $290 monthly car payment.

I have roughly $80,000 in student loans: $40k private loan at 6.5%, $20k private loan at 7.5%, and $20k federal loans at 6%.

I have $20k in a 401k and $12k in my company's shares (that I buy for a discount).

For family reasons, I am transferring offices and moving back home to help my mother and grandmother. They currently pay rent for $1100, and I'm deciding to buy a house with my mom. My mom has $50k in savings she can put down as the down payment, and I have $12k from my company shares; although the goal is to save at least $10k of the total for repairs and such on the new property.

The housing near where my family lives (central NJ) is quite expensive and has high property taxes. Nothing like a major city, but still high for a house in the burbs.

The houses we are looking at are in the range of $250k - 300k; with property taxes + mortgage I'm calculating the monthly costs to be around $2100 per month (including home insurance). 

Is buying a house a good idea?

I feel like it is because if I moved back home, I would definitely need to rent a bigger apartment or even a house; a one bed-room apartment wouldn't work with me + my mom + my sister + my grandmother. It would have to be a 3 bed-room apartment/house which would be $2200. 

But I'm not sure if I want to settle down in NJ for the long term. How long would I have to hold the property for my investment to break even when I sell the house (e.g. how long would it take to recoup broker fees, interest rates, maintenance costs, insurance, etc.). The housing market in central NJ is pretty stable, so I am not concerned.

btc,"It seems negative interest rates, low interest rates, and even high interest rates all give a bullish outlook for bitcoin.","Some people seem to have the idea that high interest rates aren't as good for bitcoin as low ones because low means inflation. I think this might be wrong. Consider that interest rates don't necessarily control the money supply. Open an econ textbook and it says 3 things do that: Discount rate, reserve ratios and open market transactions. But the key point people might be missing is that with high interest rates it could actually be very bullish for bitcoin because it will cause the artificial bubble in the stock market to pop . All the wealth creation and surge in stocks that lead to gains for the haves instead of the have-nots means that a high interest rate is bad for stocks. At the moment bitcoin is mostly an investment vehicle so the thought that high interest rates means low inflation means bitcoin isn't so great because that is why it was created (To combat inflation) is the wrong way to think. The people that are using  bitcoin now are mostly the ""haves"" because it is like any other investment and those people might diversify into bitcoin. Higher interest rates and risky markets means even more possible incentive to invest in bitcoin.

Negative rates are an obvious case of why bitcoin could reap benefits. If you have to pay banks to hold your money then nobody will want to keep large amounts of money in banks. If the war on cash succeeds then there won't really be alternatives besides gold and cryptocurrency. Since gold isn't very good as an actual money this mainly leans towards cryptocurrency and specifically bitcoin.  People probably won't be able to get away with continuing to use cash for too long because it has its own host of problems: People don't like change, large amounts of cash raise the suspicions of banks and TSA and government which means your privacy might be invaded, cops can literally rob you of cash if it is a large amount, travelling with cash can be problematic as mentioned,  and some places may simply not accept cash because in the future it might be considered suspicious. There are probably those who think negative rates won't come to the US but I would bet against that... it is happening all over the world and it will happen here. It's amazing what people are able to adapt  and get used to without revolting.

Low interest rates are also good because it incentivizes spending and the buying of a store of value such as gold or bitcoin is a form of spending that is deferred into the future. The sole purpose of a store of value is really to relay the power of spending into the future and to potentially gain a slight amount from the opportunity cost you are losing by the joining of someone else in the future also willing to defer their spending and buying your share for a little more.",cryptocurrency,1466136257

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Refinancing vs. Consolidation,"Hello,

I just wanted to know the difference between credit card refinancing and consolidation.

For starters, I've always had a high credit score and have never made an interest payment in my life. I currently have approximately $7,500 in credit card debt due to an overseas relocation.

I've spoken with my bank (Citibank) and they've advised that due to my high credit score, they're able to offer an installment plan which waives the standard 24% APR (credit card interest rate) on the outstanding balance and instead they bill you at 0% interest + an upfront processing fee. There is no impact to my credit score if I enroll in this program, according to Citi. 

My concern is that I work in financial services and I understand that many firms do background checks on whether or not you've had any debt consolidated.

My understanding is that this is considered to be a refinance rather than a debt consolidation because it's not distressed debt. Is that correct?",finance,1466136662

(NV, USA)","I'll keep this intro fairly short. I just broke up with my girlfriend, so I'm moving in with some friends of mine. Additionally, I just got a job paying a bit more than I've ever made. Between the reduced rent/bills from moving in with my friends, and the increase in income, I'm going to have a fair amount of extra income that I can use to fix my credit. In the last year, I've been able to get it my score from under 500 to just under 600, want to finally get it to a place where the collections accounts aren't dragging me down. 

Here's where things stand: 

Income 
&gt;$30,000 gross (PaycheckCity's calculator says I should bring home right around $1900. 

Bills: 
&gt; Rent $350

&gt; Car $312. Details below. I can't get rid of this. 

&gt; Insurance $145. This is the best rate, by far, that I've been able get. Everyone else wants between $250-$300/mo for the coverage my car finance company requires.

&gt; Phone $60. Not going to get rid of this, as it's the cheapest plan I can find with unlimited data. 

&gt; Cable/Net $175 (This will drop significantly since my ex is not around. None of my friends or I watch TV, so we're cutting that out and dropping the overall internet package significantly. Should be closer to $60, split with my friend.)

&gt; Electric and Groceries are still up in the air, but both combined shouldn't be more than $100.

&gt; Benefits TBD as I have only signed the offer letter, haven't been to orientation yet. 

Debts:
&gt; Car $10,000 at 17%. No feasible way to get rid of this as I'm upside down in the loan. The car, in perfect condition (which mine isn't) is only worth $4,000. 

&gt; Student Loans $1,500 Defaulted, don't think I'm accruing interest on them, and I'd like to focus on those so I can go back to school this fall and actually get a degree. 

&gt; Collections 8 different accounts. Lowest is $53, highest is $3,900 for trucking school to get my CDL. All in collections, don't think any of them are accruing interest. Total amount is $9,357, I may be able to get a pay for delete or at least a settled in full with a lower payment on some of them, and I'm disputing a few where they keep selling it to extend the 7 Year clock. I've successfully gotten over $1,500 removed so far. 

&gt; Credit card $300 secured card. I've had it for around six months, paid in full every month. 

Given that my income is around $1,900 and my bills are around $1,000, I have roughly $900/mo that I can use to pay off something on that list. I'll know more once I get my first check, but it shouldn't change too much especially since I'll be getting just basic health/medical/dental, and only doing employer match for retirement right now until I've cleared some stuff up. 

So, my ultimate question is where do I put the extra money? Do I pay off the car first since it's actually accruing interest? Do I try to get rid of the negative shit so my score goes up and I can refinance the car? I don't know where to start and I'm a bit over my head, but since I finally have the means and ability to fix it, I want to.

personalfinance,Advice on which student loans to pay first while still listed as dependent on tax returns?,"Hi all. So, normally I know it would be best to pay down my student loans beginning with the loans with the highest interest rate - makes sense. However, my parents still claim me on their tax returns (this will be the last year they are doing so), and so I cannot deduct paid student loan interest on my tax returns. Next year I will be able to as my parents will no longer claim me as dependent; currently they help me pay my rent for my last year of grad school, so they should definitely be claiming me. 

Due to this, I am questioning if it would be better to pay off the principal on old student loans that are either not accruing interest (subsidized) or have a low interest rate, and later pay my higher interest loans when I can deduct the interest on my taxes (I believe you can reduce your income subject up to $2500).

All my loans are federal. I have been paying off my loan interest while in school, but have not been able to make a dent in the principal balances due to this. Perhaps it would be wise to save paying off some interest until I can deduct it?

personalfinance,Urgent Help With Car Situation [Auto],"**TLDR:** I commute about an hour every day to my summer internship. The car I drive is experiencing both engine and transmission problems (I believe). I have $3,500 in my bank account and $30,000 in student loans. I don't know what to do.

**Background**

I'm a 22 year-old college student. I have two semesters remaining, so I will be graduating in May 2017. This summer I landed an internship with a DoD contractor. The commute is roughly 50 minutes, but I've been carpooling with my friend, so I'm only making the drive two or three days a week. However, after my first week I'm having major car trouble. I have an appointment to get it looked at tomorrow at noon (that's the soonest I could get in), so I'll know definitively whether or not it's even worth getting work done on it. It seems like it could be engine and/or transmission problems, both things that aren't cheap to my knowledge. 

It's a 2000 Chevy Metro that I got a few years ago for roughly $4000, so if the estimate is +$1500, it probably won't be worth fixing in my eyes. It had 66,000 miles on it when I bought it, and now it's sitting around 88,000. A lot of that is  from commuting to-and-from home when I was visiting an ex on weekends for a while who lived about 140 miles away.

I knew I was going to be driving a lot this summer for the internship, and my car had already been experiencing this problem with the engine thumping every once in a while when it slowed down. I took it to Firestone to get it looked at last week, and they even had it for two days, but they couldn't get it to act up in the way I had described. Thinking that my car would fine for the commute this summer, I paid ~$100 to get the AC recharged, so I wouldn't be dying of heat exhaustion five days of the week on the long summer drives home. A few weeks ago I also dropped about $300 to get things done in order to pass inspection.

So now to my financial situation. From student loans and such, I'm in debt around $30,000. I've exhausted my federal aid since I've been in school a little longer. However, my father got a job at a university that I've since transferred to, and that allows me to have my tuition waived. I usually end up paying only a few hundred dollars in fees and books each semester. I have about $3,500 in my bank account. 

My parents are not very good at managing their finances, and they're pushing me towards making payments on a new or new-ish car. To quote my mom: ""Everyone is in debt for the rest of their lives anyway, that's just how the world works."" No, that's not how the world works. I don't want to be in debt for the rest of my life. I don't want to follow in their footsteps. I know people get out of bad situations; I've seen in first-hand on this subreddit. I want to graduate college and pay off my student loans, so that I can be debt-free.


Depending on how this summer goes, I may be able to work more during the upcoming semesters. I have enough credits to graduate at this point, it's just two or three required classes holding me back (I can't finish in one semester because of how the classes are offered). I could potentially go part-time as a student, and work 2-3 days a week at the place I'm doing my internship. I took an 8-month leave from school two years ago because I couldn't afford it anymore, so I used up a good amount of my grace period. Luckily my dad got a job at a university which I was able to transfer to. That being said, if I were to go part-time I'm fairly certain I would have to start paying back student loans almost immediately due to my grace period being used up. I don't know what my payments will look like, but I'm planning on calling today since I have the day off.


**Options**

The way I see it, my options are:

1. Pay to have current car fixed.


2. Ask friend to drive every day in exchange for compensation.


3. Buy another used car outright.


4. Make payments on a newer car. 


Option #1:
I won't know how much this will cost until tomorrow. There is an amount of uncertainty associated with this option, since there's not saying that something else won't go wrong the next day, but I'll have a better idea of where I stand which this option after tomorrow.

Option #2:
I'm not sure if he would mind, but his car is a lot more reliable than mine. In addition to that car, he has another car that his parents bought him that they only let him drive once in a while because it's so new. So the wear and tear on his ""beater"" car doesn't matter too much to him. Of course he has no obligation to help me out and the decision would be completely up to him. The downside with this option is that it doesn't address the issue with my car. I could keep it and use it for personal use until it dies, or I could try to sell it to get some cash and save up for a better car in the future. During the semester I could get a ride with my dad to and from school, but if I work during the semester I would have no safe way of getting to and from work. Essentially this option buys me a little time.

Option #3:
In my price range, I won't be able to get a car in much better shape than the one I'm currently driving. Everything in my price range is early 2000's with +100,000 miles. So I run the risk of finding myself in a similar situation after a while. It's a gamble buying used, which makes think this option is about equivalent to option #1, but will cost a little more.

Option #4:
This is probably the safest option in terms of having a reliable way to get to and from work. However, it's also the biggest financial commitment. I'm already $30,000 in debt, and locking myself into a car payment will end up adding roughly $10,000-$15,000 if I want to get a decent, reliable car from what I'm seeing. If I choose to go part-time as student in the upcoming fall and spring semester and work more, it makes me nervous to think about having both a car payment as well as a student loan payment every month. Plus I'll have to pay for insurance, books, and fees for school. The upside is that I won't have to worry about getting to and from work and school and other obligations. I'm on my own and parents can't help me out financially in any way.

The consensus on this subreddit seems to be to invest instead of paying off your mortgage, since the stock market has historically had greater returns than the current interest rate on my mortgage (2.1%).

But how does that change with a variable mortgage? I have flexible and generous options to make lump sum or monthly contributions to the principal of my mortgage. More than I could ever feasibly save in a year, so assume that ALL of my savings can be put towards my mortgage.

I understand that if interest rates never change, I'll effectively only be earning 2.1% on my extra payments. But what if interest rates go up in 5 or more years?

I got a 30 year loan in December 2010 for $212k at 4.25 interest rate.  Monthly payments are roughly $1050.  I have been paying $100/month extra for most of the loan (minus maybe a year or so at first) so I am about 6 - 6.5 years into the loan according to my estimates.  With such low interest rates right now I am considering going to a 15 year loan for the remaining balance of $185k.  Quotes so far have been anywhere from 2.875% to 3.00% interest rates.  According to some mortgage calculators, my monthly payments will be about $1275/month, not much above the $1150/month I currently pay (which includes the extra $100 per month).

From everything I've seen the amount of money saved on interest by going to a 15 year will be a no-brainer, even comparing to upping payments to $1275/month on my existing 30 year loan.  The thing I am unsure about is calculating the scenario of selling my house early.  I will most likely be in this home in the next 1-2 years, but with my ""significant other"" in the equation I don't really know for sure how long I will live here.  I am unsure what the break even point will be when accounting for the closing costs, which I have so far been quoted anywhere from $1500-2000.

It seems so much easier to calculate the break even point when refinancing to lower monthly payments, however I am not sure in my situation of increasing payments and shortening the loan.  Can anyone assist?

I signed up for a Capital One card that offers a 0% intro purchase and transfer interest rate. (after that it goes to 23.24%, which my current card is anyway, so it's not any higher)

I was hoping to be able to transfer my whole balance of $9500 over to the capital one card to have about a year of interest free payments, but I was only approved for $3000.

My current minimum payment is $280 for my Freedom card. I know that's based on the current balance, but I don't know the equation they use to determine that.

So I have two questions:

- How can I determine what the minimum payment of each card would start out as, if I transferred the $3000 to the Capital One card. So that I can make sure the two together won't exceed $280/mo?

- Does the credit limit only apply to purchases, or just the total balance? (i.e. can I still transfer the $9500 to the Capital One card, and just won't be able to use it for anything else? [which i'm perfectly fine with]) -- Because then I would only have the one payment.

personalfinance,Understanding APR and Mortgage Rates,"I want to make sure I understand APR and how it works related to a mortgage. APR is showing the true cost of the mortgage that takes into account the money borrowed plus any other fees and costs associated with the loan – most often closing costs. Is that a correct statement?
If you’re comparing mortgages and one has 5.000% interest and 5.250% APR and the other has 5.000% interest and 5.300% APR – this means the second mortgage has higher costs than the first?

Ex. $100,000 mortgage with $5,000 closing costs with an interest rate of 5.000%. APR would be 5.430%

investing,"""Guide To High Yield Investing"" Opinions?","The original post is here: http://seekingalpha.com/article/3981535-guide-high-yield-investments-starting-american-capital-agency 

Author also gives an example for a preferred stock.

Here is the relevant bit:

Investors have been starving for yield over the past couple of years. In a low interest rate environment, nothing looks attractive. Even if a dividend focused company could afford to hike dividends, they often chose to take advantage of the low cost of debt and expanded instead, sometimes leading to disastrous results (see Linn Energy (NASDAQ:LINEQ)). What's worse is that even when the management seems to be committed to dividend investors (e.g. I've warned investors many times about ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP)), they can go back on their words in an instant, leaving investors to deal with the consequences themselves.

It is a treacherous market indeed.

Can one safely invest in high yield securities? To answer that question, we first have to define what is ""safe."" If you subscribe to the idea that safety is the lack volatility (which is completely fine), then I say you should not be looking for high yield investments in the first place. Securities that offer high yields are often cast aside by the market, people can't wait to get rid of them. When you are going against the crowd, there is no practical way to guard against volatility (unless derivatives are used, but that's a whole another topic). However, if you are willing to accept that the market is sometimes wrong and high volatility does not entail risk, then we are talking.

The second question we have to answer is whether the dividend is a return of capital or a return on capital. If a dividend is merely a return of capital, then a decline in the security is completely justified. If you had $100 in your bank account (the stock) and you withdrew $10 (the dividend), then only $90 would be left in the bank. However, if we determine that a dividend is a return on capital, then the security is worthy of further analysis.

However, things are rarely this clear in reality. For example, if a cyclical company posts a money losing quarter, yet still chooses to pay a dividend, is this a return of capital or a return on capital? To answer this question we must recognize that capital and earnings are intertwined. For example, the dividend can be treated as a return of capital as the company did not generate earnings in the most recent reporting period. However, it could also be viewed as a return on capital as the company has generated profits in previous years. How do we deal with this situation?

Rarely is a company immune from cyclicality (if you do find one please let me know), especially if they are high yielders. In this situation, we would need to make a decision whether a loss was the result of secular change or a temporary hiccup that it can recover from. If the loss is the result of secular change, then we have to determine if the current yield provides a satisfactory margin of safety (e.g. you would still be willing to invest even if the yield is cut in half). My belief is that dividend investors would do well to stay away from companies with deteriorating prospects (i.e. secular change), especially when dealing with the common stock, as subsequent declines in profit often accelerate much faster than anticipated.

When we deem a loss to be transitory in nature, then we must analyze the company's near term financial obligations. ""But wait, I thought investing is about focusing on the long-term?"" That is true, but only if you are investing for growth or total return. For a dividend/income investor however, a company's ability to honor its payments is of utmost importance. Furthermore, high yielders often plunge after a payment is skipped, hurting investors twice in the process.

This is still a consensus network. The police aren't going to do it, because we are the police. There's something we need to decide. It isn't every decision in the future, its only this decision right now. 

This decision is whether or not you want to let thieves steal innocent(albeit naive) peoples money. That's it. We aren't putting Trump, or Clinton or Bernie in charge, or creating a Fed Reserve. We collectively stopping a thief, because if we the people who control this capital don't there isn't anyone else who will.

The estimated payment is about$465/month, but I've just been doing $500/month to help speed that up a little bit.  The other debt that I have is a federal student loan at about 3.3K @2.75 apr (out of ~70k original loans; $50/month payments for like the next 6 years).

Earlier in the year I picked up a **Barclay cashforward mastercard** because it offered $200 credit if I spent $500 in the first three months.  Since that was a pretty low amount of spend for a huge payoff, and I could afford any associate credit hit, I went for it.  

Now, the Barclay card has cash rewards of 1.5% flat out, but it's not as good as the **citiadvantage mastercard** with 1% cashback at purchase and an additional 1% cashback at repayment (I never carry CC balance/ pay infull every month).  So in short, I don't put any purchases on the Barclay card, because it just isn't as good.

personalfinance,"Refinance ""Second Home"" to Pay Off Student Debt","Hi all,

I posted this question before, but have some additional details to provide and would like some feedback.

&amp;nbsp;

As a recap, I have about $100,000 in outstanding federal student loans, varying from 5.0% to 7.5% (weighted average of 6.8%). I'm currently on the PAYE plan and will no longer be eligible this upcoming year as my income will exceed the threshold. Once ineligible, my standard repayment will be $1100 a month.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm lucky enough to have a second home property, being rented to a family friend, that I co-bought with my parents (I paid the down, they support the mortgage and receive all tax benefits) worth about $400,000, with $177,000 left in outstanding principal. 
Therefore, the property has about $223,000 in equity. The current interest rate on the existing mortgage is 4.375%.
We have talked to our bank and they are able to give us a lower interest rate of 4.125% for the remaining property principle + $100,000 for student loan repayment.  They will do this for free, with no closing costs.  The only upfront cost we'd incur is an appraisal.  My monthly payment for the additional $100,000 would be $366 a month.

&amp;nbsp;

By refinancing the mortgage at 4.125% I would be effectively reducing my interest rate by ~2.5% compared to my average student loan rate. Additionally, all the mortgage interest is tax deductible versus the $2500 a year deduct for student loans (which is nothing for me since my loan amount is large). 

&amp;nbsp;

It also would extend the loan term to 30 years and allow me to save more money now for retirement, etc. I understand extending the life of the loan will ultimately cost more, but the intent is to sell this property within the next 5 years and use the proceeds as a down payment for when I move.

personalfinance,(UK/EU) Advice on investing and paying off student loan,"I hope I am posting this in the right place, I know it involves a student loan, but there is also an investment aspect to my question. Mods, let me know if I should move this to r/studentloans

I am a European student studying in the UK, moving to the US for my job after I graduate this year. My student loan is in pounds, but all my money is saved in euros. My main question is about trying to take advantage of pound being weak this week before the brexit vote and whether to invest my money that isn't making interest or start paying off my loan (I don't have to start paying for 6 more months)

Assuming the pound euro exchange rate is 0.79 I have

* Savings 18k euros (14k pounds) interest on this account is now down to a terrible 0.35%

* Mutual funds 15k euros (11k pounds) I started investing right before the various recessions in 2008ish so I didn't break even again until about 2011, but including that initial period my funds have had a return of roughly 7%

* Student loan 39k pounds (49k euros), 3.9% interest rate, once I graduate it will stay at that rate because of my salary and I will be required to pay back at least 470 pounds per month

Ok so now my questions

I have just opened a uk bank account that will get me 5% interest on up to 2000 pounds, provided I pay 500 pounds per month into the account. I plan to fill this account up, and then pay 500 in each month which I then use to pay my student loans. So the account level never drops below 2000 pounds. Since I am getting practically no interest on my savings now, should I try to take advantage of the pound being low and fill the account up to 2000 now, or just add an initial 500 pounds? (Money transfers in the european money group have no commission, I hope that would still be the case after brexit)

Invest my money or start paying off the loan? I am getting some conflicting advice about whether to try and pay off the loan early. Unless I am making more interest on my savings than my loan, it makes sense to pay off the loan right. Currently, my savings are getting next to no interest, so I am planning to invest a portion (2000 pounds will go into that 5% interest account and I would like to invest 5000, leaving 7000 for me to try and find a better savings account to put it in). Other advice I got is to always try and pay off your debt so you never pay more interest than you need to. Any advice for the 5000? 

One other thing to note is, that once I start my job I have a decent relocation package and bonus, so I think 7000 pounds in liquid savings is plenty to get me through the next 6 months (I will be living at home during that time with next to 0 expenses).

One resource I looked at which is specific to my UK loan is (http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/student-loans-repay#tabThree) I have the post 2012 type loan. Paying the minimum amount dictated by my future salary would take me 10 years to pay off.

personalfinance,"Self employed, and money is tight right now. Considering not paying quarterly taxes and taking the penalty as a short term ""self loan""...is this a terrible idea?","So the first 27 years of my life I was financially idiotic. I spent way beyond my means, didn't save, and am now paying the price.

I have ~8k in CC debt that is my primary concern to get rid of . Roughly $2k of that is under 0% balance transfer. For the rest, about $2k has ~21% interest, and $4k has %15.5. I'm thinking about re-financing the rest with a personal loan through lending tree or other online lender. 

I also have about $44k in student loans... $33k is federal consolidation ...the rest are private loans, with the highest interest rate about 8% (high schools and parents REALLY need to do a better job of teaching 16 year old students applying for college how taking on that kind of ridiculous debt will impact their future)

Earlier this year, I left my full time job to build my freelance business. This was not a financial decision, so much as I was literally emotionally broken at my other job and could no longer function there. But I'm actually on track to make more than I did this year than last year...I hope to end up somewhere around $55-60k when all is said and done. 

Problem is, I owe quarterly taxes...and frankly can't afford the whole amount right now. Based on my expenses/deductions, my taxable income will probably be around $30-35k for the year. I expect the bulk of my business to come the 2nd half of the year as several key clients/projects come in...I've only pulled in about $23k total from January 1 - May 31st.  

I have around $2k I put away for taxes so far.  I've been told that the penalty for not paying quarterly taxes is fairly small.  I'm wondering if I would be better off using that 2k to pay down my higher-interest CC debt now, and using my higher second-half income to pay my full taxes by April 15 deadline.  My inclination is that the penalty will be less than any kind of further loan or debt I'd have to put myself in to pay it in full.

ethereum,"I am not a lawyer, but I'm a law student and I'm thinking ""the attacker's"" legal argument is not as clear-cut as he/she claims. Can we start a smart contract to crowdsource funds to fight his claims in court?","If the attacker is trying to lawyer up, perhaps it's in DAO holders' best interests to lawyer up as well? 

From what I've followed in this area of law, the issue of whether exploiting a weakness in code is a criminal offense has been addressed in one federal case in Nevada, where a person exploited a weakness in a slot machine's code by entering a certain sequence of button pushes to receive an unwarranted pay out (see US v Kane, D Nev 2014). The DA ultimately dismissed charges of wire fraud and hacking, so the issue has never been actually ruled upon in court, and could conceivably go the other way.

There are also a number of civil issues that might apply in this case that I don't think have ever been ruled upon (ie interpreting a ""smart contract"", tortious conversion, a few others). 

(Assuming that open letter is legitimate), I'm thinking that if the attacker tries to use the courts to get his way like he's suggesting, they will have to identify themselves to file suit. I'm not sure what the requirements are for remaining anonymous as a plaintiff, but that seems like a stretch that the attacker would be in any more danger than any other plaintiff who files an unpopular suit (see: https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/suing-as-a-john-doe-plaintiff-404766.html).

So once he/she does, we hand the matter to the police. This will freeze up any evidence involved and may create one form of repayment, and the possibility of which might force the ""attacker"" to the negotiating table while they are still anonymous.

They can also be named in a number of suits. The issue of whether code is all that applies in a real court or if clear intentions not explicitly mentioned has never been settled. A famous contracts case is Spaulding v. Morse, 322 Mass. 149, 76 N.E.2d 137 (Mass. 1947), where the court found that clear intention can be read into a contract where it is not expressly mentioned. There's never been any DAO conversation about how anyone *should* attack the DAO in the instant fashion, and lots about how splitting was installed as a mechanism for simply withdrawing your own investment, so there is a chance the attacker could be sued for breach or bad faith performance.

Again, I'm not a lawyer (nor a coder), so none of this should be considered professional opinion. But if we do want to play hardball with them, even if consensus is never reached in the matter of a fork, individual token holders may have plenty of legal action to take. Given that this may require an expensive suit and we want the best most expensive attorneys fighting in this gray area, using a smart contract to legitimately/inexpensively raise funds could bring credibility back to the process/ethereum/smart contracts. It may also force the attacker to negotiate for a bounty and keep their identity anonymous than risk legal action (or whatever else someone might have planned).

ethereum,"Smart Contracts and Ethics : If someone signs a contract to be enslaved, should a third party intervene?","To all those that will be deciding whether or not to do a hard fork or a soft fork, I'd like for you all to think of the ethical ramifications of that decision, especially with all the capabilities and possibilities that Ethereum introduces.

The smart contracts themselves are written law (or that's the way we can think of them) since they can independently enforce themselves, are agreed upon by all parties, and the terms and conditions can only be understood one way (not subjective). However, what if the law itself, was ""wrong"" or unethical (a subjective issue)?

I see that some among the group that is arguing against the fork, are arguing that a contract is perfect, and must be enforced 100% to keep the integrity of the system, and this belief that everyones contracts will be enforced as it is written, is what gives confidence and credibility to the platform itself. If an individual chooses to engage in that contract, they have made the conscious decision to agree to all of that contracts terms and conditions. The Ethereum platform itself, must not intervene in this agreement, only facilitate in the enforcement of the contracts within it.

However, what if there is a person who has signed a contract to be enslaved to another individual or even an organization?  Should the platform intervene? Should it still intervene if the language within it states that the individual to be enslaved is someone whose signature is not even required in the contract?  A contract that requires someone to hurt someone else?  If one can agree that an intervention should occur in some cases, where does it begin, and where does it end?

A contract is created in which both parties accidently agree to delete all of their holdings, should Eth intervene? A predatory lender loans someone money at an interest rate of 3000% a year, should Eth intervene? A contract is written in which someone sells their body, should Eth intervene? What if they were selling someone elses body, should Eth intervene then? Where is the line that we draw in which our countries laws must be followed on the platform? If we do follow our countries laws, whose jurisdiction do we follow when a contract is made by international parties? What do we do about international commerce laws?

Ethereum has introduced an interesting new concept in law, terms and conditions that are not subjective, that will always be enforced if the conditions are met.  When you are making the decision to do a hard, soft, or no fork, please think about these things.

When it comes to our current problem, the question is this : If this is a glitch in the system, and not a contract that all parties wanted, should this be reversed? Like a bank that secures your money for a large fee, and unknowingly, their backdoor is left open all night, should you both agree to reverse the contract if it will return the funds? If this ""glitch"" is just a clause that an unscrupulous lender had purposefully placed in the system, and people blindly signed it, should this be reversed?

In the end, when making this decision, you are deciding the future of Ethereum.

Should it be a platform free of intervention? Whose terms and conditions are ""perfect"", something never before seen in our world when it comes to objectivity with no biases. A just mediator if you will, who has no critiques or quams about the ethics within the contract, only that the contract is enforced if both parties agree to it.

Should the platform allow intervention when it comes to fundamental human rights? Rights of Life, Liberty, and Property/POH? Should it go even deeper then that and enforce all the laws within ones country?

If we want Ethereum to grow and be utilized by the masses, I highly recommend that there are safeguards in place to protect the individuals within it. If we want it to remain a niche system, one in which the words within it are law, then the number of adopters will be limited to those with the capabilties and the reasons to utilize it.

Final thoughts: Why not both? Certain DAO's will have certain oversights and protections. One can be for mass consumer adoption, and another can be a wild west of sorts for any and all contracts (whose to say this can even be stopped, or if a duplicate platform doesn't just handle this niche?)

Whatever you decide, understand that this decision is made by the community itself, something that is as complex as the ethics of smart contracts itself.",cryptocurrency,1466271151
MachineLearning,What is best practice for the data pipeline in large dataset neural network training,"For instance, right now I am trying to train a colorization network, I struggle between 2 extremes

1. Store straight up images. Process, prepare, etc. data all as its being fed in as a batch. Currently the batch generator has to do many things: download the image from s3, create a numpy array, convert it to LAB, reshape it, transpose it, categorize the output colors, and feed the input grey values into a separate model to predict hyper columns. 

pros: can store lots of data, can change model/approach without reprocessing data. 
cons: the processing time/tax on the system that has to preprocess the image and then feed it into the network each time. Hard to run more than 1 image per batch. 


2. Process everything beforehand and store it as hdf5. That way the batch generator just has to download a part of the file off s3 and feed it into the network. 

Pros: Less tax on the system that is doing the training. Can experiment more with batch size, etc. 
Cons: Larger memory tax when feeding massive arrays into system. Training data takes way more space. 

Then I could fall somewhere in the middle - perhaps the image LAB data in hdf5 but wait to extract the hyper columns until training time.

I am 27 and currently have about $60,000 in student loans (variable rate private and fixed rate federal) ranging from 5-6%. I have a decent emergency fund (4 months expenses) that I'd like to grow a bit more and my company offers a 401(k) with NO match.

If I were to pay the loans down aggressively I'd be about 34 once I start saving for retirement. Probably sooner with raises.

The dilemma I've seen brought up in various articles is that I can't go back with all my newfound excess income in seven years and dump it into the IRA retroactively.

personalfinance,Emergency Fund vs. Paying Off Debt,"Hey all,

So, I am finally going full time and getting a 36% raise at the same time.  Yay!  So now I don't *necessarily* need to live pay check to pay check, which I have been doing, prioritizing making payments on my credit card and my car because I have good credit, damnit, even if I was making less than $200 a week after taxes T.T

Anyway.

So I will be making at least $420 after taxes and health insurance per week, with a strong potential for an additional $120 depending on the week and if I car pool with someone who is salaried and works 9 hour days regardless.

Because it's important to know, I live with family and have functionally NO financial responsibility apart from what's listed below.  I don't pay for my phone, my auto insurance, my food, or even clothing if I need it because my family is incredibly nice and teaching me that I never need to be financially independent *even though I want to be so **SO** badly*

My credit card debt is not impressive.  With the payments that I made today that haven't posted yet, about $600.  I'll admit some of the spending on them was out of pure frustration but I didn't come close to maxing any but my very low limit card from the bank.  Even if I make barely more than minimum payments, I would be paid off in less than a year, and as it stands, I will be paid off by Nov.  I'm not very worried about it because I've been known to get irritated and throw whole paychecks or refund checks at debt to get them out of my hair, and this is low enough for that to be a viable option.

I owe $1360 in student loan debt that has a 4.5% interest rate and around $18000 (give or take a couple hundred -.-' ) for an auto loan at 2.7%.  My student loan is actually paid ahead until March of 2024 because of an Americorps grant, so I don't have a monthly payment and have been ignoring it in order to keep up with my car and not die of the sheer boredom that comes from never spending money on anything.  My car payment is $367 a month.

Before you ask, no, I will not sell my car.  It saves me an incredible amount of money on gas and *I don't even need to buy my own food.*  I know there some stuff about a car not taking up more than 15% of your income but since I don't need to pay for anything else I feel like that doesn't quite apply.

I am also starting a graduate school program where I will need to pay between $1875 and $3600 per semester depending on how many classes I take, and the option of monthly payments.  I am pursuing scholarships because I still don't make a lot of money, and I am comfortable with the idea of taking on an additional 1-2k in debt per year for additional breathing room, which I can prioritize and pay out of existence between semesters.

My question is, in my situation, is it worth prioritizing an emergency fund?  I understand that it is supposed to catch you when you fall, and I am all for it, it would be great to have 6 months worth of expenses saved up, but is there any point when my only real expense is paying off my debt?

**INVESTING**


My parents gave me a Morgan Stanley brokerage account with funds that my grandparents had saved for me, which were put into this brokerage account after they died. I got primary ownership a year ago when I turned 21.  My parents seem to have always used Morgan Stanley and they are in an okay financial place (they raised me in NYC and have substantial retirement funds). 

They don’t have time to really explain what this brokerage account is (I don’t think my mom even knows really). 

-
Since 2009, when the account was formed, it has grown from $35k to around $55k today, with about 6k of that being cash. So from my rusty calculations it’s growing about 7%-8% a year which I read is normal. I can PM specific securities and the amounts if needed.

After the posts last week about how fees really hurt returns and the consumer in general I have been worried, so I called Morgan Stanley(in hopes to speak to the financial advisor that I’ve been trying to get a hold of for the past year since I got rights to the account, but instead I got the client service center again after battling with the robot voice) to figure out what I’m paying for my account, and what kind of account it is.

* On the website it says it’s an AAA account, but the lady on the phone said it’s just a brokerage account.

* I pay $150 annually to just have the account with Morgan Stanley, and for their online service and supposedly for a financial advisor that I have yet had contact with. 

* The fees to trade stock were around $29-35 as a flat rate.

I am considering trying to transfer the account to somewhere else. 
I read that having over $50,000 is good for certain investment banks because they give you benefits or cash back idk. 

I was also looking at Vanguard, since everyone seems to really like vanguard, and they offer a financial advisor, at a .03% of the money you have with them but that would be $165 and I feel like that would defeat the purpose of moving from Morgan Stanley if I’m just paying more.


I know people really like Vanguard and Fidelity. I already have a high yield checking account with Charles Schwab because they have no foreign transaction and ATM fees are paid back, and I was studying abroad so it was ideal. 


-

**Planning**

I have a checking account with Chase and Charles Schwab(I was studying abroad for a while and their checking account had no foreign transaction fees, and a 5% interest rate which seems pretty good).

I have a savings account with Capital One 360. Not much saved really, though I’m working on building an emergency fund now. I just started an internship as an analyst for the the summer, that pays 18 and hour.

My parents were kind enough to help pay for most of college, so I’ll graduate spring 2017 with about 25K of federal student loans, which have a 3.86 to 4.66% interest rate.

I’m getting a BA in Economics with a focus on global economy and policy (I never took finance or accounting, though maybe I should), and I’m hoping to make 40-60K starting salary out of school as an analyst or researcher. Possibly buy a house with my SO in a few years.

**QUESTIONS**

Should I transfer my funds to a different brokerage account? If so, which one do you recommend and why?

-

Should I look into a financial advisor or planner to figure out the next steps I should take? Do you have any experience with the ones provided by investment firms? 

-
Should I open a retirement fund after I finish my funding my emergency fund? Or should I wait till I get a job where they match funds? Or should I start paying off the loans instead?

-

Where can I learn more about this stuff? What podcasts/books/websites/people do you recommend?



TL;DR Brokerage account fees seem unreasonable and planning for the future is confusing and prioritizing is hard. Any tips or tricks? Personal experiences or suggestions would be much appreciated.

personalfinance,A question about balance transfers on credit cards. Am i missing something or is this against some rule that I haven't found yet?,"Okay so to make a long story short, I'm 22 and trying to build credit.  I have 2 store credit cards, 3 consumer credit cards, a student loan, and an auto loan.  My total credit limit on the cards is about $5,000.  My usage is about $1,200.  I'm trying to keep about 15-20% revolving credit for a while to build credit.  My question is this though; One of the cards has no interest for 1 year if paid in full, and lower interest rates than all the other cards, and a better cash back option.  The downside is the card has a high balance transfer fee, high enough to counteract anything that would be saved from the cash back and lower interest.  However, what is to stop me from getting a payoff amount of the other cards, paying myself with the one card via a service like paypal, and using that  to pay off all the others?  That way I essentially consolidate the credit onto one account with lower interest and cash back incentives.  Is this considered fraud or such? or is it a loophole in the policy or is there something I am missing?


edit: Hmm the more you know i guess.  I was always told wrong or i misunderstood what i was told, even though it made sense to me that creditors wanted to see you have balance and having to pay interest as good for them, but it makes more sense the way y'all explained it to me on here.  I never spend on credit what i don't have in the bank to cover it so I can pay em all off right quick and start the process y'all have explained instead :) should save me a chunk of change in the long run",finance,1466318562

Look, if you are new, ***STOP TRYING TO GET RICH OFF OF THE BREXIT VOTE.  STOP THINKING OF A BIG WIN.***  You need to concentrate on slow, consistent gains, not huge pay outs.  Brexit is spooking everyone, and I keep seeing posts here and on other sites asking how to go all in and retire with Ferrari money, or at least ""how to play it"".  If you have to ask us ""how to play it"", you need to step back and reassess your skill level, because the risk here is a move that blows well beyond your margin call, into negative account balance.  I have seen two posts so far by people asking ""how to play it"", and those posters do not even understand how a stop loss works, and more importantly, what it *doesn't* do......

*You are far more likely to lose big if you gamble with the Brexit and you do not know what you are doing.*

Brexit could be completely underwhelming.... but the general thoughts on it are *at least* a radical whipsaw. The Brexit vote is one of those events that can cause such precipitous damage to accounts that **Brokers are limiting retail leverage and raising margin rates:** (from Oanda)

&gt; Dear Huachi

&gt; During events such as the upcoming Brexit referendum, market movements can be significant leading to the potential for large profits, but also large losses. To help ensure our customers are more insulated from such movements, **we will be temporarily lowering the maximum leverage available on GBP pairs to 20:1 after the market close on June 17, 2016**. The affected pairs will return to prior leverage levels after the market close on June 24, 2016.

&gt; As a result of this change, you may need to close trades or add funds to your account or risk a possible margin closeout if you currently have an open GBP positions with higher levels of leverage and do not have enough funds in your account to cover the increased margin requirements. To determine the impact this change may have to your margin, you can use OANDA’s margin calculator.

&gt; Margin rates on pairs not containing GBP will not be affected.

&gt; If you have any questions, you can contact our Client Experience Team whenever markets are open.

Bitcoin,"I think I messed up, Need help","So I'm just going to cut to the chase and explain everything that happened.

So I've been using an app on my phone that pays me credits and at a certain point I can cash them out. I usually choose PayPal for this app and just use PayPal to receive the money and I spend it normally. 

Well yesterday, I decided I would check out bitcoin to possibly start saving up small amounts and use it, honestly it seemed really interesting. I had $10 saved up on the app and I knew it wouldn't get me much, but I still wanted to try it out so I decided I'd get bitcoin. 

I checked everything out online and most services that I found to buy bitcoin with PayPal had small fees that wouldn't matter if you getting a lot of it, but I only had $10 so I decided I'd get the most bitcoin for my money by cashing it out through the app since it doesn't have fees. 
Here's the huge problem though, I'm only 16 years old. The way the app works when cashing your money out is it sends a message to your email containing a link. If you say, got your money in the form of a gift card, it would send a email with a link to the gift card code that you can use on websites or whatever the gift card is for. When using PayPal, it just deposits it to your PayPal using your PayPal email. But for bitcoin it made me join a whole new online service called SnapCard. It's a website that in order to use my bitcoin, I have to first confirm my email and phone number, which is hard enough right now since I don't have phone with service. The next steps are confirming my identity. I honestly can't really do that because it requires a lot of personal info I just dont have being 16. I feel my parents wouldn't like it if I asked for my SSN to use on a website. I then have to take a selfie with my I.D. to prove who I am, again being 16 this really screws me since I have to use a Federal issued I.D. My current job didn't require me to have an I.D. like most of my friends do because I work for a parents friend as a car detailer and the payment is under the table. 

I'm not trying to complain because I guess I could get this information and an I.D. but I still don't think my parents would want me to use sensitive information on a website. I should have done more research, but i even downloaded another wallet called coinomi and that didn't require any verification so I assumed I was in the clear and id be able to send it to that wallet instead of having to follow their exact instructions. I only seen what I would have to do after they sent the email.

Does anyone have any ideas on what to do? The bitcoin is non-refundable as it states in the email they sent, but would I possibly be allowed to have my mom or dad confirm their identity on the website?

I know I'm young and pretty naive for this, but please don't insult me, I'm just looking for help whether it be I absolutely cannot get the bitcoin, or any ideas on what to do even if it's a long shot. Thank you.

tl;dr I'm 16 years old and somehow got forced to use a certain bitcoin wallet that forces me to send sensitive information to confirm my identity that wouldn't be easy for me to get because of my age.

gaming,What can I do to be more involved in my younger brothers' lives?,"Ok, so possibly misleading title in that it implies I am not involved in their lives. We're actually indoor rock climbing together at the moment.

Here's the scoop:

- I'm 29. They are 12 &amp; 13.

- My wife and I live right up the street from them.

- Dad recently passed away and mom is ultra-conservative, paranoid, and very reclusive. I love her to death, she has some serious PTSD / mental illness due to severe childhood trauma and it's only gotten worse since her husband died.

- Both are homeschooled.

- One is ultra-athletic with Aspergers. The other is absolutely uncoordinated, but smart as a whip and could probably already host his own Mythbusters show.

- Both are very in to video/computer games. I was a gamer up to PS3/Wii, but I do keep up with lots of indie games.

- Both have almost no social life (no school, no church, no clubs, no sports, no neighbors) and have recently begun to exhibit some of the ""cringe"" traits you see joked about (fedoras, wanting mustaches, obsessed with swords, dropping Japanese phrases...). Even my wife had begun face palming during family meals.

Obviously I already do as much as I can with them. I know I might only get a few responses here, but I'd love to hear any off the wall suggestions for meaningful, bonding ideas. I've thought about doing different things like getting them trophies and adding dated plaques every time they complete a video game challenge I give them. Or maybe a ""scout's sash"" with ""badges"" every time they complete a game. It would be super easy with all the fan made pins you can buy and hopefully give them some meaningful memory for all the time they spend gaming.

personalfinance,My parents want to take out a home equity loan to help me and my siblings cover parent plus student loans. Is this a good idea for them?,"My parents helped me and my siblings go to college by taking out Parent Plus loans which had a better interest rate than we would have been able to get on our own. We all agreed to pay back our portions of the parent plus loans after college. The total of all the loans is ~$190,000. My parents have a lot of equity in their house, and now to make things easier for me and my siblings, they want to take out a home equity loan reduce the interest rate from ~9% to 3.5% and help speed up the repayment process. We would still pay the same monthly payment each month, but we would pay my parents instead of the loan company.

I don't know what to think about this. I appreciate their generosity, but I'm a little uncomfortable with them putting their own home equity on the line for what is essentially our debt. We are all paying back the loans pretty aggressively, and my parents want to cover the interest portion for us, so essentially all of our payments would go toward principle, cutting our repayment time significantly. My biggest fear is what would happen if some/all of us lose our jobs, since there is no protection of deferment or forbearance.

My father passed away in March, and I learned a couple months later that he had a life insurance policy through the last place he worked at, and I was the beneficiary. Now that my lawyer aunt has helped me through filling out the forms properly and getting them to the right people, I'm expecting a big check pretty soon. According to the aunt, the employee life insurance policy is one year's salary, which is probably somewhere between 25 and 40 thousand dollars.

Now, college. After grants and scholarships, I was still about 16k out this year. I've accepted federal work study worth about 2.5k, and 8.5k in loans. This puts me with $5000 unaccounted for. Because my dad wanted any money he left me to go to my schooling, I think I'm going to use the life insurance money to help me this year.

So what do I do with the rest? The standard advice seems to be ""put it in a savings account and don't touch it."" I talked to a trusted and knowledgeable friend who recommended splitting it across two or three savings accounts for a reason that pretty much went over my head. I've never had any real money before. Even when growing up, my family never had an excess of money even close to this amount. I have four years of school and the loans that come with that to think about.

I went from having just over $350 to my name to having saved up to just over $1,200 as of today! (granted... I did have a birthday somewhere in there. About $300 came from that)

*****

Now that I have come this far, I have some questions (Edited in some of the most helpful answers so that others can see):

-I do not have a credit card.~~I was considering~~ I will be getting one, ~~although I am **incredibly** hesitant to do so.~~ What should I take into account?

* From /u/ROUGH_BOOK : Do you live in the US? If so, you NEED credit. So yes, get a credit card. Use it wisely, or don't use it at all. It'll still get your credit rolling.

* From /u/VanWesley : Go with a student card first. That way, (later), you'll have a credit history and it'll be easier to get a better credit card... http://www.nerdwallet.com is a good resource to browse through and compare/contrast different credit cards.

* From /u/zzzz_z : ...the massive information leaks that have been happening... If you use your debit card online instead of a credit card, you're (dramatically) increasing the chances of (theft)... With a credit card, you can dispute the charge and not lose a penny... what if your money gets stolen today and you need to pay a bill tomorrow?...All they need is the number and the code on the back.

-I have about $8,500 in federal student loans. I will not be adding to the principle. I ~~would love to make it my goal~~ could *seriously* do without the worry of this debt, as I will be working abroad for the church. *What could I begin doing* to have 75% of that paid off before I graduate, even if I don't reach that, it is what I want to aim for. ~~*even if it is tough*. In what ways can I go about doing that?~~

-Other than my student loans, I have no other debt. I make *roughly* $240 a week throughout the year, and an additional $400-$650 a week for 6-7weeks in the winter. *(Edit: We're looking at a rough gross income of $14,000 for the next year)* If I wanted to begin investing in 10yr/15yr-term investments, what would be some good ways to go about doing that?

-~~Is it legal/good/smart to begin paying off my loan with 70-80% of my income and use the remaining amount to pay monthly payments on a new credit card?~~ ~~My understanding was that credit card debt is much easier to deal with than student loans. What do I not know?~~

* From /u/whiteraven4 : Credit card debt is probably the second worst kind of debt possible after payday loans... You shouldn't be making monthly payments.

* From /u/Klopsnittle : You need a CC to buy plane ticket, rent a car, rent a hotel room, etc. Just pay it off in full each month... Some things (may be OK to pay) off in a (short) series of payments...But CC are not good for long term and they are not a safety net.

-What other advice would you give to me?

* From /u/cz75Dcompact : Don't forget about your emergency fund. (This is my next step)

* From /u/rizzo1717 : Get a credit card with a low limit... I would use a third to a half and then pay it off completely (I paid it in full every 3-10 days). Now 5 years later I have awesome credit and $2400 cap.

* From /u/PennRobotics : (I have no idea if this is useful, but I will be looking into this) I do not and will not pay more than the minimum on my student loans. The interest rate is low and the interest is tax-deductible, which allows me to pay down higher-APR debt or invest in low-fee index funds (VOO or PREIX) using Robinhood.

* From /u/Ifkl : ...Take a look at /r/financialindependence ; you may be in a very good position to get an early jump on retirement... credit cards well, you generally won't want to use them to hold other loans... chances are the credit card is going to cost you much more money. Keep credit cards paid off monthly if at all possible. You can decide if the 'snowball' or 'avalanche' methods of debt repayment work better for you.

personalfinance,Sell the house or hold? (x-post from r/realestate with edits),"We bought the worst home on a nice street 3 years ago for $280k. Spouse got transferred for work a year after we bought, and we moved to a beach community five hours away where we have been renting a great place for $1850 a month. We easily found renters for our home; they also pay $1850. 

We like our new town and want to stay, but we can't afford to buy anything but a tiny condo there without selling the house. We'll rent as long as we can, but we don't know how long our landlords will let us. 

We put our house on Zillow's Make Me Move for $350k just to see. We got an offer immediately - without them seeing the home - for $350k. Post-inspection, they want us to give them 25k in credits - for repairs (10k), realtor fees (10k), and closing costs (5k). We owe $250k. Our net, after taxes and those credits, would be around $60k. 

We know there is almost no inventory under $400k in that neighborhood and believe the neighborhood will continue to improve. Given the speed of that first offer and the fact that we're gaining equity, I'm thinking we've got a good thing and should hold. We know the home needs more work and we could do those over time while we rent and continue to build equity. 

On the other hand, it's a 1950s house that needs a lot of updating. I'm waiting for something expensive to drop or a giant tree to fall. Renting has been mostly fine, but not painless. We'd be relieved to get rid of it. And we could use the profits to pay off debt and have a down payment for something else, either near the beach or not. 

We make $150k a year from work. The rental income is a wash with the mortgage interest and repairs. 

Expecting $15k bonus at the end of the year

Debts
$18k in credit card debt (12% interest) 
$40k in auto debt (2 cars at 2% interest rate)
$150k in student loans to be forgiven in 2 years under PSLF program 
$25k in private student loans at 8%

We are paying off debt at $800 a month and will put the bonus on debt too. 

We are also expecting a baby at the end of the year. 

The two other wrinkles, if we decide to sell, are 1) whether we should take this deal or go through the hassle of listing and see if we can get more, and 2) whether we should buy on an island. I'm pretty sure this area of the coast where we would buy will be under water in 30 years, so maybe buying is dumb. We do love it though, and might stay til then.

personalfinance,American Student Loans in Canada,"I asked this in PersonalFinanceCanada, and I had a response that suggested I post this here as well: 

I'm a recent lurker to Reddit...and came across this community....hopefully someone can help!

My Husband just immigrated to Canada last month from the USA. While prepping for his arrival, I researched the bank(s) that would allow him to pay his student loans while in Canada. There aren't a lot of great banks that will do this...all the banks have USD accounts, but only a few will let you do bill payments from them. I bank at a credit union...so paying for an account makes me die a little inside, but we landed on the TD cross border account that lets you transfer Canadian dollars to the USD account, and pay bills.

It took forever, but we finally got that set up. I sat down to make a budget, and while I knew what the total amount of his student loans were, I didn't know that the interest was absolutely terrible. Here is the breakdown:

State Loan- $7700.00 @ 6.8% min: 97.00 Federal Loan- $27500.00 @ 3.4% min: 54.00 Private Loan- $19000.00 @ 9.4% min: 180.00

I'm shocked that his minimum payment on his federal loan is 54.00....which doesn't even cover the interest for the month. After doing the math he needs to start at just over 500.00 USD to do a pseudo debt snowball (80.00 to Fed, 200 to state, 225 to private), because the interest rate is so high on the private.

I asked him to call the bank, to see if they would reduce the interest on the private loan, and because he doesn't live in the USA, they can't do anything (do they want him to pay??!). So after conversion to Canadian dollars and fees, this has now totalled almost 700 a month. He just started a job, and doesn't have full time hours yet...so it's getting tight.

I found it really difficult to search this topic...is there an easier way to get the funds to these institutions, other than the TD cross border plan? Further, if anyone has better suggestions on the payment amounts or anything else, I'd greatly appreciate the help!",finance,1466379875

personalfinance,How much of our savings should we put into our house down payment?,"Apologies if this has been addressed elsewhere. 

I'm 32F. Government job, making $65K/year, with opportunities for higher rates of pay. My partner, 34M, is the same. (Met at work, actually.) He has about $70K saved up, all in the bank. I have about $25,000 saved in cash and $40,000 invested. Neither of us has any debt. Both of us have pensions, although I would like to open additional retirement accounts just in case. Also, it is likely we will want to have kids in the next 5 years and I'd like to set up college accounts for them.

We're looking at buying our first house sometime in the next year. I've gotten some mortgage quotes and between our interest rates and the tax rates in our area, we would want to spend no more than $300K on the house. So my question is, (let's assume the house is 300K) should I put all or mostly all of my savings (cash + securities) into the down payment and then work on building back my savings from there? Or should I put some other lesser amount down for the house and keep the rest in investment accounts? Thanks in advance.",finance,1466396074

personalfinance,At what interest rate is it reasonable to stop pouring money into loans?,"I am not hard pressed for money, but I have a goal to be debt free soon, but I'm wondering with the interest rates whether or not its smart to continue to pour money into my loans.

My Debt:

1. 7.8k (currently) at 2.25% - Student Loan
1. 16.5k at 0% - Student Loan (Owed to my parents, bought out a much higher interest loan)
1. 22kish at 2.99% - Car Loan

I make 93k/yr currently, and in the past 18 Months, I've put over 30K into student loans, not including the monthly payments, not including car loan, which is 500/mo.
In a bit more than 6 months, I have a large amount of stock vesting, and also expect a bonus, so I believe I will have the student debt paid off by January.

~2k in betterment.
I currently do not have a Roth or traditional IRA.
I have ~23.6k in my 401k and another ~8k in an ESOP program I wasn't able to rollover (Does anyone know much about esop? I'd like to have all my retirement in a single account, but they say I can't do anything with it even though i'm no longer with that company)

With regards to priorities, should I focus on becoming debt free then putting more into investments?
If I cash out the stock, and depending on the bonus, I will hit the income limit for a Roth, what are the other options? Should I try to work towards maxing out my 401k?

Are the interest rates low enough on my debt that perhaps I should just start focusing on the investment side of things?

I can add additional information if needed.

Thanks for the advice in advance!

I currently feel a bit of a mental burden with the debt so at the moment I'm leaning towards getting rid of the student loan debt, and perhaps just living with the car loan.


Edit: Thank you for all the great advice! I think I'm going to just pay the minimum on the remaining Student loan and car payment. I'll focus on Maxing a Roth and my 401k Contribution, and keeping on track with paying my parents back. Any additional money that would have gone into the other loans will be put into savings / investments.

I used Circle pay for numerous transactions for a few months up until recently. I am under the impression that my account was hacked/or information stolen. Several transactions from my bank account were made to Circle Pay for roughly $1000. I contacted Circle immediately. They replied with threats of legal action and also claimed that all activity on my account was on my hands. They also said all of the transactions violated their terms of services as they were to gambling sites. I talked to my bank, which is a major one, and am unsure what to do. The most recent 3 transactions for Circle I did NOT authorize. My coinbase account was also compromised during this time and I filed chargeback claims with them. Here is what Circle said:

$34,000 - Perkins loans unsubsidized under my name.
$44,000- Parent plus under my dad's name.
$102,000 - Parent plus under my mom's name.

-What is my best course of action for repaying these loans?
-Do I have any options for deferment of these payments for a bit longer?( I don't have to start paying till December)/ is that even a good idea?
-Is there a way for me to refinance these loans for a lower monthly payment?
-Is it possible to combine these loans into one monthly payment?
-And finally, because I have to ask, is federal loan forgiveness in the future even possible or is that something I should stop dreaming about?

You guys are awesome and I have a complex issue I could use your help with.

Approximately 1 month ago, I closed on an investment property which realised good returns. Prior to closing, I identified a replacement investment property in which to reinvest funds via 1031. All was going well until recently when the seller proved unable/unwilling to furnish necessary legal documentation. (This documentation is neccessary to ensure current usage of the property, as allowed to the seller by grandfathering under the current zoning ordnance, transferrs to me upon purchase.) At this point it does not appear the seller will be able to secure documentation within an allowable timeframe (per 1031 rules).

As Im quickly approaching the the 45 day limit to identify a like-kind replacement property/investment, Im looking closely at upREITs to defer capital gains tax (amounts to approximately 30% when state and federal are combined). 

Is there anyone out there who can provide guidance on upREITs, recommend any good ones, and/or 1031 to upREIT transactions? (In regards to returns, at this point Im more interested in tax deferral and security than dividends so low risk upREITs seem to by the way to go.)

personalfinance,Serious financial aid difficulties with a university,"I've been having serious financial aid difficulties with my university for the past year.

To start, I was originally an undergraduate matriculating student. My program, which is a certificate, started August 2015 and ends August 2016. (3 semesters). The university switched me to non-matriculating without my knowledge until I applied for a private student loan to pay for the program. The university said even though it's a certificate program, they would accept the student loan BECAUSE it's part of the undergraduate portion of the degree.

I was denied the private student loan at first because I was apparently a non-matriculating student. Then, I reached out to the university constantly, who took FOUR MONTHS to formally accept me into the program so I would be able to receive aid.

Now it's almost July, and I am running out of time. I applied for two MORE student loans. Student loan #1 is for $6,000 through a private bank. The bank informed me the would only be able to certify their loan from January 2016-May 2016. Then, the university terminated this loan because the dates were incorrect. I had to reapply for the loan and use the time period from August 2015-August 2016.

Loan #2 was from August 2015-August 2016. This loan lender, a private company, informed me that they would only be able to certify this amount ($6000) from May 2016-August 2016). 

I am not able to apply for federal aid because I misplaced my W2 from 2014. The university will not accept my 1040 or tax transcripts from 2014, they want each W2. That's 5 different companies. That's basically impossible to get right now with time running out.

I'm extremely frustrated and aggravated by this entire process. My question is, will I be able to get the private student loan (either one) to pay this program balance and finish? What do I need to do in the meantime?

My last resort option would be finishing the program, not being able to sit for my licence (this is a healthcare program) until I worked and made the $6000 to pay. I would need to work 4 months to pay the rest of the balance off, delaying me by 2 months.

My mother and I came to an agreement of what amount of this loan I would pay and what she would pay. She has been sending me a portion of the payment each month. 

She will be getting a large amount of money in the coming weeks and intends to pay off her portion of this debt. She'll be paying about $20,000 of roughly a $24,000 debt. 

I have a few questions about this.

1) What are the tax implications receiving this? Legally the entirety of this debt is in my name. Will this be eligible for income or gift tax?

2) Is there any advantage to having her make this large payment directly vs having her put the money in my account and me making the payment?

personalfinance,Spouse credit card situation,"Over the last month, I have learned that my spouse's credit card balances are about $6,000 higher than I thought they were. This, after we *just* finished paying off $5,000 in balance transfers from when the same thing happened 2-3 years ago. Needless to say, I'm feeling disappointed and defeated but that's a story for another sub. 

Over the weekend we made about $2,500 in payments to the cards with the highest interest rates, which brings the total balances down to about $12K 

Half of this remaining $12K was charged to a single credit card,  whose 0% promotional interest rate ends in a couple of months,  for a major emergency purchase we made for the house. I had intended to have mostly paid this off before this series of other balances came to light. Fortunately there is no deferred interest, but the ongoing interest will still be extremely high. 

Any ideas on how to best tackle this would be appreciated. The possibilities we've explored so far are:

- Another balance transfer, although I fear this just kicks the can down the road and sets us up to probably be in the same situation in another year. 

- ""Borrow"" about $5K from savings ($8K in cash, $5K in CD) and reimburse ourselves this coming fall/winter. We have about $1,200/month in definite disposable income in the fall and winter months (summer is our lean time, income-wise).

- Obtain a personal loan for $12K to pay off everything, leaving us with a $350-400/month payment for 48 months. We are already allocating $400/month for minimum payments, and typically spending more, so this fits well. We are finding options in the 6-8% range. The major drawback is that I will need to co-sign to meet income requirements.",finance,1466433004

I assume this is will be considered ""gambling winnings"", but I don’t know if im going to have to pay taxes in two states and federally etc.

Looks like I skimmed [the fine print](http://i.imgur.com/eOyIDSJ.jpg) too quickly.  The scratch off means nothing.  The dealership has some ""board"" that you match your code to which then determines your prize.

The 2016 Presidential election is shaping up to be one of the more interesting this country has seen in decades.  While the candidates and their supporters spend the coming months campaigning for the highest office in the land, we thought it would be fun to take a look at the Presidents throughout our history and how events during their administration impacted politics of their time as well as how they affect the politics of today.

Each week we will feature *at least* two presidents for you to discuss (if discussion goes stale we will move on to the next one early). We'll list a few common things about each one ; age, term, political affiliation, etc.  In addition we've chosen 4 things that happened during the presidents campaign or administration as starting points for your discussion.  In some cases we've chosen those things because they are significant events/firsts in US history.  In others we chose them because we thought those things would be of interest to you, the /r/politics subscriber.

We wanted to keep this simple and relatively easy to set up each week so we didn't write out a bunch of text on each president.  Instead we linked to primary sources (where available) or a wikipedia article in a crunch.  You're more than welcome and encouraged to discuss other events that we didn't list.  Please remember our [comment civility rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_comment_rules) are in effect.  Have fun!

I have saved over $100,000 (cash), which doesn't include investments or anything like that. I have two credit cards (Chase and Capital One) and have never missed a payment*. I never carry a balance on my credit cards. I've had the Capital One card for 12 years. I'm 30 years old now. My salary is $140,000.

My credit score is 767. I've read that my score is ""low"" because I have relatively low credit limits (between the two cards only ~$12,000) and not enough history.

In theory, I could pay cash for the car, but since all I read about are ""historically low interest rates"" and ""negative interest rates"", it feels smarter to me to borrow and have peace of mind, ""just in case"". I can always pay back early.

So what gives? I was going to try visiting my bank (HSBC) next to see if they can give a better rate. I would think (hope?) that with $100k on deposit they would have no reason not to give me the best rate on a $30k loan.

EDIT: Oh, just a BTW: I have tried to raise my credit limit, but it's always denied because of something like ""you don't even use the credit you have, why do you want more?"" Seems like a scam, need a higher limit to get a better score but won't give me one because I don't ""need"" it.

Not sure if there is anything we can do. She figured it was a total lost cause but she has no technical inclination and doesn't even use a computer. She wouldn't even be able to find a phone number on Google. I told her I'd dig into it.   

**A little background about the man**. He was always kind of odd, a bit of a loaner, and only returned home to visit every 7-10 years or so (I am 30 and I think I met him 3 times). He would call or email various brothers and sisters maybe once a year or so. He was a lifelong bachelor, never married, nor had any kids. He had lived most of his adult life on various islands in the Federated States of Micronesia. He was a very smart guy and was a CPA for the Goverment there. Which I am still unclear if that was a US Fed position, contractor, or if there is some kind of local non-US gov entity there. FSM is an independent sovereign island nation and a United States associated state consisting of four states – from west to east, Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae – that are spread across the Western Pacific Ocean. United States provides defence, funding grants and access to U.S. social services for citizens of these areas under the Compact of Free Association.  

**His death** - His death really seemed to come out of the blue, but like most heart problems that tends to happen. Apparently they have pretty terrible healthcare out there and I guess he wasn't the type to really seek medical attention much. He was a little over weight and I think pretty had a pretty sedentary job and life. So a heart attack is definitely not out of the question. I nor anyone else really suspect foul play (as far as the death goes). It was so spur of the moment and so far away, that none of the family was able to go to the ""funeral"". His friends on the island had a little service for him and skyped it so some could watch. One of my aunts did have the wherewithal to ask for a photo of the body (to at least kind of make sure this was on the up and up).   

**Financial state** - this is the one that seemed most odd to my mom. I'd never really concerned myself with this or even asked my mom about it. She had some of his stuff out this weekend and mentioned it though - it does seem very strange to me. None of the family was really in need or want of money so it was never pursued. Supposedly he only had about $4k to his name when he died. After the funeral, cremation, misc, administrative stuff there wasn't much left (I think they donated a few hundred to a local charity or something). It just seems odd that a almost lifelong CPA, with a decent job (i'd think), working for the gov, would only have $4k left when he died. That said, the people he worked with and lived with on the islands were sort of his adopted family. He was a very giving guy and I guess would often buy rounds for people at the local bar. My mom doesn't think it would be out of the question at all, that on his death bed, he gave away all his money to the locals or some organization (and that's totally cool if he did). What I would want to try to uncover is if he was extorted or robbed on his deathbed somehow.      

**Questions** - What can we do to obtain financial, bank, investment, employment, and tax records? My Mom, along with her brothers and sisters, are his next of kin. Both parents have passed away. I was just thinking we may see some odd withdrawals or something that could possibly indicate some foul play. I can probably obtain his Social # and death certificate if various organizations would need it (my mom could).",finance,1466444769

personalfinance,"Soon to buy a house, am I making a mistake?","As the title says, I'm looking to buy a house relatively soon (as in, perhaps putting in an offer in the next week or so), but before I do, I want to make sure that I'm not about to make a mistake and end up over my head.

Starting with raw details.  


* I (27 M) have already been pre-approved by my mortgage broker for a $280,000 house.
* The house I'm looking at is $140,000.
* Gross income ~$72k, take home is ~$44k after taxes, insurance, 401k, etc
* I have ~$23k is savings total
* ~$9k is student loan debt (3.5-4.5%, will be paid off at the end of next year).  No other debt.
* Credit score is 780.

I live in metro Detroit, where the cost of living is (relatively) cheap compared to other major cities, and I'm not planning on leaving for the near future (5-7 years minimum).  

I'm planning on putting down only 5% on the house, financing the rest, meaning about $7k down.  Hoping closing costs will be around $6k, this leaves me with ~$10k as emergency fund, immediate repairs (not expecting much, houses I'm looking at are move-in ready).  

With my credit score so high, my mortgage broker is offering a conventional loan with lender financed PMI, at an exchange of 0.375% interest rate increase.  If my math is right, with taxes, interest, and insurance, my mortgage payments should be around $900 / month. As I'm currently paying $1160 / month for rent, this is an improvement!  Even after I factor in utilities plus the extra commute time from moving further away.

Worst case, I'd be paying the same amount for a mortgage that I am currently for rent, except now I'll have much less in my savings.  Sure, I'll be able to rebuild it.  I know it would be better to wait until I could have more for a down payment, but with a looming (maybe) federal interest rate hike and a fairly hot market in metro Detroit, I could very well find myself priced out of where I'm looking by the time I'd have 20+% down and/or be looking at higher rates and payments?

So, here is my concern: am I spreading myself too thin, or does this seem like a solid plan?",finance,1466446469
personalfinance,Credit Card Interest - High Balances or High Interest,"Hi all,

I'm having difficulty figuring out what I should pay off first.  I have a card for roughly $7500 at 13.24%, and another for $4500 at 14.49%.  All of the conventional wisdom says that I should pay the highest interest rate first, but I was looking at the interest charged between the two cards and there's a huge difference (about $200) for the payment of interest between the cards.  The higher balance one I've paid more interest on in the past 6 months.  Should I pay that one down first?

personalfinance,My loans have the same interest rates - should I pay off the smallest first?,"I feel like this is a really dumb question that, as a college graduate, I should be able to figure out myself, but...

I have been paying off my student loans for about three years now - federal, unsubsidized, Stafford Loans. I have two accounts to pay towards: one loan with about 5.2k left, and one that comprises three loans with about 18k left. They all have the same interest rate of 6.8%.

Up to this point, I've always paid a little extra to both accounts (about $75 extra dollars a month total), but I plan to start putting even more extra money against my monthly payment now that I'm more financially secure. I want to make sure I'm doing this right.

I would go with the avalanche method, but since they all have the same interest rate it doesn't really matter. What's the best way to distribute my funds? Pay the same extra amount to all of them? Put all of the extra money to the smaller one?

-I graduated from my undergrad with about $12,000 of student loan debt. My parents are well off, but I am in that stupid range where my dad makes too little money to be able to help me out with my education costs, but still makes too much money for me to qualify for any decent grants or federal funding.

-I currently have about $700-800 in credit card debt that I am working to pay off. My goal is to have it all paid off before I move to law school.

-I also have a car loan that I owe about $12,000 on. My father has been helping me with that, but once I move, it will be my responsibility.

As my moving date quickly approaches, I have begun to experience severe anxiety as I think about the responsibility that comes with being financially independent. I have no idea how to do this, or what to do. I need any help and advice I can get now. I know that I am already in debt, and that that debt is going to increase over the coming years. I want to know what I can do now to pay off that debt and to better plan and prepare to be financially stable during my three years on my own in law school - and in the future beyond that.

I will not be working during the first year of law school. Hopefully if I do really well, I can get a scholarship increase to substantiate some of the rooming and living costs. I currently have two part time jobs right now, and I make about $1,500 on a good month. Granted, I'll only be working until August 4, and then I'm moving.

I need some help. Budgeting, planning, saving, spending. I need help.

I have tried different budgeting apps before, but have ended up procrastinating and eventually just giving up. I tried Mint, but it was complicated and the syncing was too slow and I just gave up. I tried collecting my receipts and keeping track of my expenses that way, but after a while it became confusing and cumbersome to track my paper receipts and my online receipts and I gave up. I need some sort of system that will help me budget and closely track my expenses, so that I don't spend too much money during this fall semester of law school and run out during the next year.

What can I do? I'm sure this subreddit has seen many people in similar situations as me. What can I do now to best get my house in order? and prepare for short term and long term financial stability and success?

**TL;DR** Starting law school in two months. Have some debt (credit card, student loans, car loans), will be getting into more debt once school starts.

personalfinance,House went up 120k in 1 year what do we do now?,"First time listener, long time caller... Sorry that was in honors of father's day yesterday. 

Anyways, my wife and I bought a townhouse last year for 625k. It wasn't a house we loved but agreed it was a great investment because it wass at the bottom of our budget and the absolute perfect rental unit when we do decide to move out. (3-5 yrs)

The issue now is prices are blowing up and we want to make sure we maximize our leverage into the next house. Two years our particular floor plan was selling for approximately 500k, we bought a year ago for 625, and now one just sold for 745 in 5 days. My wife and I agree this house is not worth that type of growth and is most likely caught in a bubble because of the housing shortage here in LA. 

Since we know we don't want to buy in this market one option would be to rent until the market drops [Yay market timing :-(] and continue to build our down-payment which would be at approximately 250-300 after selling and fees. 

The other option would be to refi pull out the equity(to grab the perceived ""equity"" at a low interest rate, begin renting it at 4k, and then just wait until the true value catches up with the market (i.e. wait out the dip) because it's paying for itself anyways. This would also require us to save that money so we could never go underwater and then use it when the market dips to have cash immediately and get a better deal.

Sorry for the ramble but basically my options are:

1. Shutup and stay, we got lucky with the house and no one can ""time"" the market
2. Sell now @ 745k and Wife and I rent until market drops
3. Refinance now and pull all equity out, Wife and I rent, and rent out the place
4. Refinance now and pull all equity out, wait for market to drop, then rent out the place and buy a new place.

personalfinance,What does it mean for a savings account to have dividends that compound daily?,"Hi PF,

I'm looking at opening up a savings account with my local credit union for my emergency fund. My bank has awful interest rates for savings (0.01%), so I'm looking at some different credit unions. One states that the account's dividends are $100, compounded daily. I know what interest compounding daily means, but I've not heard of dividends compounding. So I'm assuming that this means I would be getting about $0.27 per day ($100/365 days). Can that be right?

personalfinance,Need advice on how to proceed paying for college,"Hello, so I'm a rising junior in college, Mechanical Engineering major, 20 years old. Up until now my grants and federal loans paid for my college and housing. However, things have began to unfold. Last semester I did horribly and as a result I lost one of my grants which gave me a good 6.5k a year. Which typically paid for my housing. Now without it I get roughly 12.8k a year. which pays for my schooling but leaves only 3.2k for my housing a year. On top of that I cannot get on campus housing because when it was time to apply for it I was not able to pay the 200 dollar fee. So I have to look to  off campus housing which is not bad, I've found places that would require the same amount; however, I don't have those funds anymore. So I looked into the Perkins loan which is a federal load with a 5% interest rate but my school does not have anymore funds to give out for this loan. I would do the parent PLUS loan, but my moms is a business owner filling for bankruptcy; I don't want to add anymore financial strain to her. We also have to pay a majority of my summer schooling out of pocket as well.  I would just go home and save the 3.2k but my mom and I live with my sister. I sleep in the guest room. I also don't have a car so commuting to school will be an issue. I use to commute last summer for my summer classes; I had to wake up like 5 am to get ready and to be on time for my 8 am class. On top of that my sister has a family the house is usually loud and distracting not to mention my relationship with my sister is not the best; last summer we had some issues . I can't get any work done there and considering how bad I did last semester I need to be focused.  I do work but minimal hours (during the school year, I probably make 250 a month) ; on top of that I support myself with my paycheck meaning I buy groceries, toiletries, etc. for myself. I had to buy a credit card because I get paid bi-weekly and I can't not eat for a week while I wait for my next check and this helps me save money too. Plus side I have good credit (706/ Fico) now.  I've tried my best to save what I can but it's not enough for monthly rent. So my options now are taking out a private loan (right now I'm thinking discover; decent rates + rewards+deferred payment) or to join the Navy which I'm actually in the process of doing. I was thinking of going the reserve route for some extra income (another 250 a month, while working only one weekend a month) and then maybe going active after I graduate. However, navy reserves does not have tuition assistance or access to the post 911 GI bill. With that being said I was thinking that I just join the navy as active duty. Then be able to utilize the GI bill. Outside of those option I really don't know what to do; I might have to suck it up and go home but I know my schooling will suffer more as a result of that. I'm very scared of accruing too much personal debt as well, but at the same time I feel that I got to do what I got to do to get my education.  Any advice, sorry for the long post.

I have been looking into opening a savings account for my emergency fund with a decent interest rate, and I've heard a lot of buzz about the Ally savings account (1.00% APY). I looked into it, but the downside is it can take 3 business days to transfer funds into a non-Ally account. Seeing as this is my emergency fund, and I would need access to it probably quickly, I wasn't feeling it. I spoke to a representative about this, and she recommended the MMA, which includes checks and an ATM card, and offers 0.85% APY, and no minimum deposit/balance. Same rules of 6 withdrawals per month apply.

Is there anything I should be aware of? I know most MMAs typically require a larger deposit, so this seems weird to me.

55.00/mo - Phone (I get 20% off with employer. I'm estimating this might be the post-tax amount. I have bare-minimum plan with ATT).

80.00/mo - Internet (I'm estimating this. Seems to be the price these days.)

50.00/mo - Estimated avg. amount for various car expenses.

100.00/mo - Estimated avg. amount for gas.

600.00/mo - Food (estimating)

No CC debt (just paid off 6,500 of it actually). No car payments. Lots of student loans though. About 90k total. Yes I was very irresponsible and went to an expensive school. Various interest rates ranging from 3% up to a whopping 6.8%. Minimum monthly payments are about 780.00. I plan to pay 1000.00. I work for a non-profit so I guess loan-forgiveness might be an option but given my salary probably useless. I plan on getting married and having the ability to pay loans more aggressively once we go duel-income. Coupled with stable employment (no one gets fired from here) I was wondering how irresponsible it might be to pay 800-1000 instead of a more aggressive amount until then.

Employer matches 10.5% to my 4% 401k contribution (over 200%!!) but this great benefit does not kick in until a year from now. Until then no matching. I am not contributing at the moment but they contribute 2.5% anyway. is that OK? I plan on contributing the full matching amount after that benefit becomes available to me. (1 year from now).

They're paying for my MS 100% including textbooks and whatnot.

Area is DC/Baltimore area. Rent is high. I have relocated from a very pleasant Canadian city and would like to spend a bit of a premium for lifestyle (most choices are suburban).

There is a place that is 1750.00 a month which includes all utilities and is in an ideal location. I could pay probably 1100.00 + Utilities if I tried to live frugally but that would require living in the Suburbs. Yow.

personalfinance,"What looks better when applying for an interim construction loan + mortgage. A fully paid off house/property, or money in the bank?","My wife and I are working towards building a home. We own the land (less a mortgage for about 30% of the current value) and have about 55% equity in our current home. We also have a substantial amount of cash/stock saved up to use as a down payment.

Here's the question. Financially we can afford to build now (no debt other than the mortgages we're discussing here, retirement well funded, HSA funded, insurance is all set, etc. We'd be pulling our emergency fund for the down payment but that gets replenished when the current house is sold), but we're having trouble finding interim construction financing (nobody wants to finance an earth bermed dome house. Go figure. Incidentally, if anyone's interested in providing that kind of loan, PM me). In the meantime, we could use some the stored up cash to pay off either the remaining amount on our property (which has a higher interest rate), or use all of the cash to pay off our current house. We'd then begin making those monthly ""mortgage"" payments into our savings accounts rather than the bank. Coincidentally either of these options would save us around $300 in interest per month due to the differing amounts + interest rates.

So here's the question. Do we look better from a bank's perspective (especially on the interim construction side) with a large amount of cash, or with a fully paid off home/land? From the mortgage side of things I assume that it's basically a wash; we'll sell our current home and roll most of that (less the 3-6 emergency fund amount) into the new home + land mortgage.

I know that there are tax considerations; no mortgage interest means no interest deduction. Additionally there would be slightly increased interest payments on the eventual construction loan due to having to borrow more before we sell our current house.

After waiting over 10 business days for them to respond, I have confirmation they got the letters through UPS, and after not receiving any response from the person Mr, Varnell referred me, I have decided to share this conversation. My hopes are to show the mindset of the creators behind the game. A mindset that seems to be more interested in thinking their is nothing wrong with the game over actually possibly fixing the game.

&amp;nbsp;


Here is the conversation I had with Rany Varnell over Reddit on Between May 24th and 25th. (typos, errors and all)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----Me:
 I saw that you had a Gearbox icon by your name so I believe that means you work for them. I am contacting you because both steam and 2k support say there is nothing they can do and Gearbox has been ignoring my other messages.
I would like a full refund for the deluxe edition of the game I bought on steam. The game is far from meeting any kind of standard and expectations I have for Gearbox. It was clearly rushed and is not worth the 80$ price tag. It would need a full rework from the ground up to be worth that price.
Gearbox has spent my goodwill in order to make some quick cash, in order to get that goodwill back I will need some kind of action of good faith from the company. A full refund, hell even a 50% refund would show me that you are about the game and not just about squeezing money out of your fans.
I eagerly await your response, thank you.

“I'm sorry that Battleborn is not meeting your expectations. And I'm not in customer support, so I have no ability to help you out.
While you're disappointed with our result, all I can say is that the game was neither rushed or a money grab. I can appreciate that you might disagree with that. But today, on my birthday, after four years of pouring my heart into the work on this game, I'm here answering you, even though I have no power to help your specific problem. That's the most earnest answer I can give you.
I would be interested in hearing what you think was ""clearly"" rushed. We're working on taking care of some issues we did not intend to have in the launch of the game, and specifics sometimes help us to prioritize.”

&amp;nbsp;


-----Me:

If what you say is true, I can respect your dedication, but your company has been treating me very differently. But if you want to hear the feedback I can help with that.
It's funny actually, your support said it was not their problem either and so did steam. I have never asked for a game refund before you know, and part of the reason I am so angry is because everyone has been saying its not their problem and its no ones responsibility.

&amp;nbsp;


You want feedback, ok, the list is below but I would appreciate some kind of gesture of good faith from you or the company, seeing as my good faith/will with the company is kind of spent after this whole ordeal. At least get me into contact with someone inside Gearbox who can help me and provide a refund (full or partial). Like I mentioned, the reps who answer the Gearbox support site say they are 2k support and claim they have no way of helping either.
The item system. The items have never felt entertaining to me and there is no point in using Legendary items. The current meta seems to just use free grey items as they can provide more benefit in pvp than any Legendary. If there is no reason to get Legendary items than there is no need to farm points to buy packs and if I don't need item packs than I really don't need to level nor do I feel accomplished by obtaining either packs or levels. (shoots shift codes in the legs too) The reason I feel like the item system was rushed is because people figured out greys where worth more within a couple of days of playing.

I recommend doing something like what ""darkest dungeon"" did with their items. Give more + percentages with - percentages items, like some grey items you already have in game. You should do away with paying crystals for items and just have the cost for each item be the negative stats you take. Also character specific items should not be the super rare achievement items, they should be 50% of the items given. Using ""Darkest Dungeon"" as an example again, they have plenty of universal items but also a great many class specific items, many of which focus on specific builds. (Like the items for the healing class that gives them a huge negative to healing but also a huge plus to damage abilities. That item now allows for a whole new way to play that character.)
No catch up mechanics in pvp. This was a huge telling sign that the game was rushed out the door. While everyone says this game is not a moba, like a moba it has characters level up and gain power during the course of the match, so Battleborn will have some of the issues that is derived from style of game. Namely the problems of feeding and snowballing. If there is no way to turn a game around, once someone is fed thats it, game over, no way to turn it around. This problem is something that should have been addressed in the alpha or before, but sadly it has not been. To use an example, the game Smite and League of Legends both have designed their games with catch up mechanics. I have rarely if ever had to surrender in a Smite game.
The story is the main reason I believe the game to be rushed out the door. I was under the understanding that the story would start with us first arriving in the solar system and the factions fighting each other before the grand betrayal by lord vampire whatever. But no, we are told to do these things because they are important to the factions, but those factions don't really make their presence known. We have only the minions and some lumberjack soldiers frozen in the snow to have any hint that people actually worked or lived in the places we went. I honestly can't have any faction pride in this game. even League of Legends gives people more pride in playing a Demacia or Noxes than Battleborn and they only have sound bites to build up faction pride.

&amp;nbsp;


Those are the main issues with the game I see and why I believe this game was rushed, all three lack depth and the first two it seems like they where not tested well enough. That or the testers feedback was ignored, as someone who did work for a game company I know that is a very common occurrence.

“Thank you for the details!
For a support contact inside Gearbox, you would want to speak with Joe King our Community manager. I'm not sure what he can do, but that's your best bet. He's on the Gearbox forums, and you should be able to find his information there.
For the Gear thoughts - sorry you don't like it. Though, I disagree with your belief that there's no point to using gear other than commons (white, not grey). I run loadouts with mixes, depending on the mode and character type I'm playing, but usually have a white or green, a blue or purple and almost always a Legendary. For Capture, I do run three whites, as the mode is short and shards are often more of a struggle to obtain consistently. But, we're in opinion land, so I can't really argue with you if you're having a bad time. Just know that not everyone shares your sentiment.
For catch-up mechanics in PvP - there are actually multiple, including experience rubber-banding, which is not evident unless you look closely. Meltdown has this type of mechanic built intrinsically into the mode with the gate shifting at the mid-score point, and we did make a number of changes after our CTT last October which has resulted in far more comebacks in this mode. Incursion had some issues at launch, but it should be much better after this week's patch. I believe if you look at LoL's release 7 years ago or Smite's release 4 years ago, you'll find they had similar issues at launch as well, and made multiple adjustments over their first year to balance the modes out. Expect us to do the same.
For comparison, more games of Incursion were played during the first day of launch than we were able to play for the more-than-a-year this version of the mode was in development. There's just an amount of data and creative exploiting that we can't test fully until we get it into the wild, and once we do, we fix things as fast as we can find a solution and get it into the wild.
For the story - again, all I can say is that I'm sorry this didn't meet your wishes. With a game that has as much fast action as Battleborn, and especially with co-op play that can lead you quickly away from scenes and encounters, we always debate how much talking, scenes, and explanation to set up. Sometimes we do okay, sometimes we don't.
Again, thanks for taking the time to reach out and write up your feedback.”

Thank you, I will contact him.
I will simply agree to disagree with some of the points you bring up but I must say, you are sounding a lot like the Diablo 3 devs around the time they launched as well.
But I understand, I worked as customer service myself for Blizz and know devs have to always defend their games.
Thank you again for your time and Happy Birthday.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;nbsp;


His response to my feedback is what I really wanted to dissect. This is the first time my feedback/suggestions have received counter arguments after all. I have always had a ""thanks for the feedback, we will consider it"" or ""we really care about feedback from our players"" response, that's what made this so very odd.  I guess I should be more grateful he did not just BS his way out of the conversation, but I get the feeling he is more trying to convince himself the game is a lot better than it actually is than he is trying to convince me I am mistaken and should continue to play.

&amp;nbsp;


So about his first counter argument. I mentioned in my message how it's a problem that legendaries are not very valuable in the game and that the popular strategy at the time we had the conversation is to not use common items over legendary items. Diablo 3 had this problem at launch as well, the devs thought it would be clever to make lower quality items more useful than legendary items. It did not work for them, and it is not working for Battleborn. In Mr Varnell’s counterpoint, he states how using only commons is not what he does- except that he does do that. That is still a rather large problem; having a system where the lowest common items are more useful than the rarest items, except in the super rarest of circumstances, throws a wrench in the very reason people like farming and rarity loot systems.

&amp;nbsp;


The whole appeal of having an item system like this is to hunt and farm better and stronger items, players find a sense of accomplishment in finding that super rare item after all their hard work. But if you make the hardest to get items, the items you mark with that legendary orange color, weaker and less desirable than the common items, than you lose the sense of accomplishment felt when finding those rare items and destroy the desire to farm them. It is also very important to make those legendary items far more potent in almost all scenarios than common items; if they are not, then they are not really legendary items, are they? The whole system feels like they included the higher rarity items for some kind of placebo effect. To get players feeling accomplished for finding these items but for them to not really be that useful.  Blizzard ran into the same exact problem during the launch of Diablo 3, but Gearbox seems to have made the same mistake but far worse.


&amp;nbsp;


The item system issue is what I found most frustrating about the game, because I know Gearbox is capable of making a good item and loot system. They have done so several times already in the Borderlands series.  Do they  think people would have been excited about getting the legendary ""conference call"" shotgun from the last boss of Borderlands 2 if it was less useful than any of the other more common items? Don't  think too much about that, the answer is no. A part of me is afraid that Mr. Varnell, based on how he responded to me,  might have actually tried to make a case that for that.

&amp;nbsp;


In the second argument Mr. Varnell seems to try to hide behind the predecessors in the MOBA genre in a very misleading way. I had mentioned how both League of Legends and Smite have really great comeback features for their pvp games. While what he said is true about how long it took them to get where they are today, there are some very huge differences between the circumstances of all the games involved. League of Legends and Smite where both free to play games that did not charge a 60$ plus entrance fee to start playing.  Battleborn does, and that means a lot more is expected of it. What he seems to be saying is that the game is not finished. There are certain classifications for games that need that much more work after their release, early access games.  If Gearbox wants to charge full retail price for a game, they need to properly warn players how unfinished it is and not having a proper balanced pvp system is a pretty big missing piece in a game that advertises itself as pvp heavy. The fact that League of Legends and Smite were not as refined as a full price game was forgivable because of their free to play model.


&amp;nbsp;


Another important factor when comparing League, Smite and Battleborn is the order which they have been released. While I understand that that both Riot and Hi-Rez are separate companies from Gearbox, the first two have paved the way in the MOBA genre. That means Gearbox should have learned from their mistakes and should have expected to run into the same issues the other two companies did. Just because the other two companies had time doesn't mean that Gearbox didn’t have the same amount of time to figure things out. Infact they are expected by consumers to figure that kind of problem out before launch. Games released today are going to be judged and compared to versions of games that are out right now - not to the versions that were out four to seven years ago. These lessons of the MOBA genre  that Gearbox seemingly ignored was another reason why Battleborn seems rushed. It's as if Gearbox did not study what made current MOBA's work, and expected a ton of leeway that free to play games got but still thought they could get away with charging full price.

&amp;nbsp;


His last defense, wait never mind, he had no defense. Just a weak whimper of an excuse about ""fast paced action"" and not having room for story. What's that players? You want the stories and lore behind all those colorful characters? Well you're going to have to do certain actions over and over and over again. Even after all that , is the player treated to a cutscene, an animatic or a soundbite of some kind? No, they get a wall of text and maybe a picture. The example I used of lore done better was League of Legends. Yeah I am kind of surprised as well, a game that had to scrap its old lore and totally rework it did a better job at their ingame story than Battleborn. Still, what few lines you did get in League from each character gave a lot more depth of character than anything battleborn seems to have provided. Where Battleborn is more interested in making pop culture references,  League of Legends  has their characters express who they are, what they stand for and who they stand with all in just a few spoken sound bites. The champion Garen from League of Legends is far more memorable because of yelling ""Demacia"" when using his ultimate instead of something like ""Where's the beef?"" or ""OH YEAH BROTHER!""

&amp;nbsp;


Just as with the item system and the loot system, Gearbox knows how to make proper ingame stories and how to build a connected game universe. They have done it before, that's kind of the reason I thought they would be able to do it again with Battleborn.
Needless to say I was not very convinced by what Mr. Varnell had to say and honestly a little confused why he felt like he needed to provide counters to my feedback.  Maybe I am reading too much into it and he simply saw it as a chance to school someone complaining about his game, pride in your work and all. I might not be right about all my points, but whether Gearbox likes it or not, Battleborn is not doing very well. Even specials that lowered the price by 30% to 40% did not help and after a month's time the game struggles to keep more than 1,000 PC players on during beak hours (http://steamcharts.com/app/394230#All). So while Mr. Varnell can argue with the feedback he asked from me, for whatever reason he chose to, he really can't argue with the numbers.

&amp;nbsp;


It's so bad I truly believe their best course of action is to apologize, refund players and take the time to rework the game from the ground up. Like Square Enix did with FFXIV, A Realm Reborn.  I hope that is the course of action Gearbox takes, but I doubt it will be. Battleborn is,after all, not their flagship IP, nor have they ever displayed the attitude needed for such a humbling action.

&amp;nbsp;


P.S. Another happy birthday to Mr. Varnell. While I don't agree with everything he said the fact he took time on his birthday and at such a late hour to respond does show a lot of his character. I genuinely believe he thinks the game is great and that it just needs some work.

personalfinance,"Need advice, please help: My family is at a financial cross roads and we do not know the best path forward.","My family is at a financial cross roads and we do not know the best path forward. We feel that if we make the wrong decision, it could lead our family to financial ruin.

We live in the Dallas Ft Worth area in Texas and housing pricing are rising on a daily basis with any nice house in the $250k range having bidding wars when they go on the market (several major corporations have, and are moving to the area causing a big sellers market).

Several of our home owner friends are saying to buy now before it gets worse, however I still get that sinking feeling in my stomach that getting in debt with a $300k mortgage is all a scam and to buy a home now is the worst time. My wife wants stability and a home that is ours.

**In our area, the only way to avoid a bidding war is to:**

- Purchase a more expensive home that may have been sitting on the market longer.
- Purchase a home with issues that others have passed up, or to build with a housing developer (McHomes with tiny back yards for $270k in a bad location away from highways, or $311k near the highway)
- Build a McHome in Ft. Worth for $270k in an area that could rise in value (ft worth is growing thanks to Amazon, Facebook, and other companies that are moving there…we have been told...)

**What we would like, however may not be the best for our family:**

- Have 20%+ down payment to not have to pay private mortgage insurance
- For my work, I design, build and sell physical widgets (lately is 90% sales for my salary job).
    - It’s a salary position and I can work on my own stuff on the side.
    - In a perfect world, I would have a 1,000 - 2,500 sq ft insulated workshop (Heat &amp; AC) on a property that we can have all my equipment, materials, and a design/development studio with a house on the property for my family in a good school district or close to good charter schools (Wife, 2 kids, mother).
- Continue to do great at my salary job, build, and grow my own businesses.
- Have some chickens on the property for the fresh eggs, etc.

**Family Details:**

- My credit score 800+, Wife: 770+
- Wife and I are in mid 30s.
- Me: Salary Job making $125k annual (decent medical insurance but no 401k), Have job security for rest of year, 2017 should be ok for job security, 2018+ all determined on my performance, luck and our industry.
- $4-10k per year from second jobs, selling stuff online, delivering pizzas on the weekends and afternoon, my own business sales.
- Wife is out of work and pregnant with our 2nd (due in Jan)
    - Wife has good prospects in getting a job in the next 2 weeks making $15-$17 an hour without benefits (I don’t see them hiring her full time because of the pregnancy)
- We have one 3 year old child (no pets)
- We help take care of my mother financially, she has minimal social security income and no savings (she is retired and not able to work, however is able to help with our child).
- Debts: Condo with tenant (we currently break even from rent for the mortgage, insurance, property tax, and HOA)
    - $72k left on mortgage at 8% interest rate (have not been able to refi because the value of it the last few years has been under 75k, it just recently shot up to 120k zestimate and that may not be the actual comp due to all the repairs it may need. refi’s for investment properties are stricter then conventional)
- Car, 3k left on loan at 1.74% interest
- No credit card debt
- Wife has 40k student loan debt that we pay $240 a month on, it’s a useless degree that has not helped her much in getting a job, however it is a degree from an accredited state university.
- Cash Savings (bank, savings accounts, emergency savings): $67k
- Retirement (Roths and IRAs): $38k
    - ***We would like to avoid using $20,000 from our retirement accounts for the house down payment that the government allows for a first time buyer to use without penalty (we have to pay taxes on it and cannot withdraw any earnings)
    - We don’t see how else to come up with the down payment for a more expensive home, unless we can purchase a home under $250,000 (older smaller home without a workshop).

**The Challenges:**

- My current workshop that I work out of is at one of my co-worker houses.
- Co-Worker is getting older and frustrated with this setup and wants to move to the country in ft worth or somewhere else in the next few years or sooner.
- I may need to be more self reliant to build my own personal business and to do my salary job.
- My mother lives at my co-workers house that we use as our workshop.
- Finding a house with land and an already built workshop within 20 miles of my co-workers house is proving to be difficult.
- Found one property with workshop and land for 350k that may work and others for $500k+ that are not possible for us to afford.

**Potential Options:**

1. Buy a 4 bedroom 2,200 sq ft house with a workshop and 1 acre land for $350k
2. Buy a 4 bedroom 2,000 sq ft house with 1 acre of land for under $270k, may not have a workshop (or maybe a small 500 sq ft one) and would need to build a propper workshop on the property in the future.
3. Buy a small house with 4 bedrooms 1,800 - 2,200 sq ft of space for under $250 (no land but may be able to use  small garage as as tiny storage/workshop)
4. Kick out our tenant of 10 years and move into our 2 bedroom 900 sq ft condo (72k left on the mortgage with 8% interest rate, zestimate of 120k, however it needs a lot of work to get it fixed up to sell or rent again). Would be rough to have wife, 2 kids in a small space.
5. Hope my landlord is open to selling me the 3 bedroom 1,400 sq ft house I am renting for under $225,000
6. Buy a track home in ft worth for $270,000
7. Find a property in the Dallas Ft Worth area with enough land to build a workshop in the future around $250,000 and commute to my co-workers house workshop until I can transfer everything over in the future when I can save up to build a workshop. I would potential need to have a long drive to my co-workers house for work.
8. Keep renting our current 3 bedroom house, refinance our condo to a lower interest rate, and keep saving
9. move into a less expensive rental property, refinance our condo to a lower interest rate, and keep saving
10. To be determined!

**Refinancing our Condo:**

- We know we need to do this, we just don’t know when to do it based on what the best path forward is.
    - If we refi today, if we are going to buy a house, we limit our down payment amount and maybe mess with our credit score (hard credit pulls, less money in bank).
    - If we refi after we purchase a home, then we may need to wait a bit to afford the refi costs.
    - The condo breaks even currently with our tenant.

**Potential Tax Benefits:**

- We have a company we formed in 2010 that is on a shelf.
- If we reinstate that with the IRS or form a new corp, we should be able to deduct a good portion of our mortgage, property and expenses for a workshop.
- We spoke to a CPA and he confirmed this should be possible.

Thank you for reading this wall of text, this has been a great exercise to write out our options.

**TLDR:** Should we buy a house or not in the crazy Dallas FT Worth area?  Baby on the way, never feel like we have enough money, would love to own a 1-2 acre property with a workshop for my job and personal business, however going smaller with less debt may be the better option.",finance,1466473661

ethereum,Comparing DAO incident to Cash in transit robbery,"Ok I would like to start off and say I bought into the Ethereum project last August as a good friend of mine was constantly going on about it. I am the first to admit I didn't really understand the whole concept but it sounded like a really good and interesting thing to be involved in. Since then I have tried to educate myself more about Ethereum and I like more now about it than I did last August. And yes if I could make some money on it would also be great. At the end of the day I have a family that needs a house to live in and put food on the table. My life savings didn't go into buying ether only what I was prepared to invest. With all that has happened over the last few days again I'll admit do not really understand the Soft Fork or Hard Fork question. A little but really not much.
My question is can ether have an individual code associated with it, so anybody that buys ether whether it be 1 x ether or a 1000 x ether. Each 1 would have some sort of code or serial number attached to it for some type of identification. For example if a gang robbed a cash in transit van and ran away with a box stuffed with cash. They find a quite location break open the box and instantly red/pink dye showers the money inside rendering said money useless as it can't be washed out and no bank or retail outfit would accept said cash as they are running to the phone to call the police. So could ether have something similar associated with it. With that in mind the guy or girl who obtained those ether tokens whether correctly or incorrectly, would it therefore be plausible if ether tokens were somehow assigned a code or serial number they could be rendered useless as the gang who robbed the cash in transit van found out when red/pink dye sprayed there windfall useless.

I chose HR Block Online, as I found out that I qualified for their totally-free e-File service.  In 2015, I started the year in NC, then moved to OH mid-year to transfer to another office at the same company.

Company provided me two W2's - one that included Federal &amp; NC info, and the other that just gave OH info.  Went through the guided help of the HR Block site, telling it I was a partial resident in both states, and it told me I could expect the following:

Confused, I verified that I'd entered the info correct, and for additional troubleshooting even made a mock return via TurboTax.  The refund numbers were slightly different, but close enough.

After I sent in a paper file to NC (including all the info requested in the instructions), I get a letter back from the Dept of Revenue saying there was a problem, and to send another copy to them.  I sent Federal, Ohio, North Carolina, and I think another document to them as requested.  Today, I get a letter in the mail advising that my expected refund turned into a balance owed to the DOR of $20.  

**I've compared 2014 &amp; 2015 W2's to see what I could learn.**  
In 2015, it appears my employer withheld about $150 (OH &amp; NC combined) less than in 2013.  Yet I made almost $2000 more this year than last year due to an increase in pay.  I'm not sure what these comparisons indicate, if anything, but I found it interesting.  

With my total 2015 refund (Federal &amp; state combined) equaling about $2000 according to HR Block (my 2014 refund was ~$1600), that $400-ish increase in refund seemed to equate with the pay raise.  
With the adjustments mentioned in the letter, that would effectively bring the 2015 total refund to about $1500, by removing the state refund &amp; tacking on the $20 payment request.

**So, to the point:**  
I'll say that sometimes numbers make me go cross-eyed, and I've always heavily relied on the hand-holding of tax software, but when I sit and focus, I can usually power through learning something.  Any thoughts on what I can do to either:  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  A) Validate the NC DOR claims of funds owed AND figure out how HR Block got it wrong,  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  B) or more preferably, determine how NC DOR got it wrong, and request my refund be sent, post haste?",finance,1466485563

personalfinance,Buying my childhood home from my Dad. Looking for advice on my situation and the best possible way to structure the transfer.,"My wife and I are looking into buying my childhood home from my Dad. He owes 330,000 and is willing to sell it to us for this amount. The house appraised 3 years ago for 525,000. We have discussed some options with a lender and discovered, that, to avoid mortgage insurance and ""100% financing"" we will need to increase the loan amount by 20% to get our actual purchase price. The actual loan amount will still be 330,000 but the purchase price would be 20% more to satisfy the 80/20 Loan to value ratio. This 20% would technically be categorized as Gift Equity from my Dad. It really makes no sense as to why it needs to be done that way, but I do understand the process if that's what they need to do. 

We would like to take some of the equity out and put back into the house which is in good condition but sadly still back in the 80's and would benefit greatly from some modern touches from this next generation (childhood dreams could be come reality). Because of the early inheritance we would fortunately receive, we feel like we could safely take money out down the road and be able to efficiently complete projects in a reasonable amount of time.

Part of the deal will include my Father staying on the property above a large two car garage. An apartment will be built for him to live in rent free.

My first question is how should we transfer ownership? 

We have thought about just getting a loan through the same lender who is carrying the current loan. We would essentially be transferring the mortgage into our names, receiving our own interest rate and probably having to pay some closing costs and fees. All well worth it considering the rest of the deal.

Are there any other ways to go about this? Anything we are not thinking about that may inhibit us from getting this done?

My second question is what would be the cheapest option in the long-run for dipping into the equity of the home? We won't start any remodels for about a year. We have thought we could take out a Home Equity Line of Credit when we are ready to start remodels. That way we can have a certain amount that can be used, but we don't pay interest or payments on it unless we have used it. Could be very useful for a multi stage project that we know will take long term.

Would it be better to just refinance about a year out and take out a lump sum to start remodels. Do HELOCS carry higher interest rates?

My third question is about property taxes which I know is specific to my county so it may be difficult to answer. Does anyone have any specific experience in the exemption for reassessment for property taxes? I have heard that we are eligible, but I have also been told we wouldn't be eligible with poor explanations. Trying to make my own conclusions with your help.

Thank you for any advice you can give.",finance,1466489767

personalfinance,"Use money to pay back loan, or keep it in an old account with good interest?","Hello! Not from the US, so sorry if I use some incorrect terms, but my question is so general it shouldn't be a problem. 

My partner and I just bought a house. We took a loan for 240.000 Euros with a borrowing rate of 2,00 percent/year. Next to the monthly installment, every year we can make a special payment to reduce interest.

I have a bank account my parents set up for me where they have deposited 50 Euros every month. So far there are about 7000 Euros in that account. It has a 3% interest rate, which is fantastic nowadays. I can't put more money in there than 50 Euros every month (I talked to the bank and they told me this, it's a special kind of contract but I don't want to go into the details).

So my question: Would it make sense to either

* keep paying 50Euros/month into that account because the interest is so good and use it as a savings account
* take the money from that account and make a special payment to our loan, and also take the 50Euros/month for additional payments?

The normal rule of thumb is get rid of your debts first, but then it's 3% versus 2%, am I right?

investing,Tragic death of Sanjay Valvani,"It is with a very heavy heart that I read about Sanjay Valvani's death. The pressure of a federal indictment is immense (I would know). I have chosen to treat it as what I view the very definition of business: another challenge in a series of improbable successes. I couldn't be more saddened to see this process destroy someone.

I am certain Valvani felt tremendous shame for disappointing those around him, including his Visium partners, who must be feeling quite sorrowful at this moment. Valvani helped grow Visium to a $10bn company. Hedge funds are valued at roughly 10% of AUM, so this $1 billion valued business has disappeared overnight. 

Unfortunately, Visium's disappearance is not solely due to Valvani's actions, and insider trading is an occupational hazard for any high-performing fund manager. I'm sure there were countless times when Valvani was able to insider trade (this is very common in hedge funds) and did the right thing by ""restricting trading"" in those securities. I doubt he even knew what he was doing was strictly illegal. I'm not sure the SDNY knows after recent losses in these cases. Insider trading is a very unclear legal territory--the facts did not seem promising for his case, but SDNY has lost insider cases in recent history and he had a fighting chance. Based on USSG, I suspected a 7-10 year sentence for Valvani. He was 44.

I ran into Valvani occasionally and communicated with him from time to time on AOL Instant Messenger (used widely by hedge funds). I was closer with his other partners, recently even funding one of their projects. Visium was a leading light in the community I was honored to be a part of (healthcare hedge fund investing). He and Visium will be missed but not forgotten. I'm certain the Visium partners will forge ahead with a new fund and continue their very successful track record. I hope Valvani's family can find the strength to get through this terrible tragedy.

Am I correct here or am I just missing something? Seems like a lot of interest money my loan servicer is just fine with not getting.

With some luck, I got a starter home when the market was down and now I want to leverage it to upgrade. 

Currently, I owe about $230k on a townhouse worth about $500k (so I have about $270k in equity), and I'd like to upgrade to a bigger home for myself, while keeping the townhouse as a rental. I don't have the cash for my next down payment, and I don't like the higher interest rates of home equity loans, so I'm thinking about a cash-out refinance on my townhouse as a way to raise the money. 

Using some loan calculators on Bankrate.com, it looks like if I refinanced the townhouse up to a $350k loan, and reset my loan maturity date from the current 19 years out to 30, it would only increase my monthly payment from $1725 to $2000 a month. I can afford that slight increase, and the townhouse will easily be rented for $2600 a month. This would get me the $120k in cash I want, and I could then turn around and shop for my new home at my leisure.

Am I missing anything, or is it just that simple? The only obstacle I am unsure about is whether my plan to rent out the townhouse would disqualify me from refinancing as an owner-occupied dwelling, and instead I'd get a worse APR refinancing as an investment property. The thing is, I will still be living there when I refinance, and likely for at least a few months (or even years) after while I shop for a new house. Needless to say, this isn't a question I can easily ask my loan guy, he's probably not supposed to hear it if I have a secret plan to move out soon after a refinance.",finance,1466538902

We feel that if we make the wrong decision, it could lead our family to financial ruin.

We live in the Dallas Ft Worth area in Texas and housing pricing are rising on a daily basis with any nice house in the $250k range having bidding wars when they go on the market (several major corporations have, and are moving to the area causing a big sellers market).

Several of our home owner friends are saying to buy now before it gets worse, however I still get that sinking feeling in my stomach that getting in debt with a $300k mortgage is all a scam and to buy a home now is the worst time. My wife wants stability and a home that is ours.

**In our area, the only way to avoid a bidding war is to:**

- Purchase a more expensive home that may have been sitting on the market longer.

- Purchase a home with issues that others have passed up, or to build with a housing developer (McHomes with tiny back yards for $270k in a bad location away from highways, or $311k near the highway)

- Build a McHome in Ft. Worth for $270k in an area that could rise in value (ft worth is growing thanks to Amazon, Facebook, and other companies that are moving there…we have been told...)

**What we would like, however may not be the best for our family:**

- Have 20%+ down payment to not have to pay private mortgage insurance.

- For my work, I design, build and sell physical widgets (lately is 90% sales for my salary job).

- It’s a salary position and I can work on my own stuff on the side.

- In a perfect world, I would have a 1,000 - 2,500 sq ft insulated workshop (Heat &amp; AC) on a property that we can have all my equipment, materials, and a design/development studio with a house on the property for my family in a good school district or close to good charter schools (Wife, 2 kids, mother).

- Continue to do great at my salary job, build, and grow my own businesses.

- Have some chickens on the property for the fresh eggs, etc.

**Family Details:**

- My credit score 800+, Wife: 770+

- Wife and I are in mid 30s.

- Me: Salary Job making $125k annual (decent medical insurance but no 401k), Have job security for rest of year, 2017 should be ok for job security, 2018+ all determined on my performance, luck and our industry.

- $4-10k per year from second jobs, selling stuff online, delivering pizzas on the weekends and afternoon, my own business sales.

- Wife is starting new job in July (work from home) making $15.50 with benefits and is pregnant with our 2nd (due in Jan).

- We have one 3 year old child (no pets)

- We help take care of my mother financially, she has minimal social security income and no savings (she is retired and not able to work, however is able to help with our child).

- Debts: Condo with tenant (we currently break even from rent for the mortgage, insurance, property tax, and HOA)

- $72k left on mortgage at 8% interest rate (have not been able to refi because the value of it the last few years has been under 75k, it just recently shot up to 120k zestimate and that may not be the actual comp due to all the repairs it may need. refi’s for investment properties are stricter then conventional)

- Car, 3k left on loan at 1.74% interest

- No credit card debt

- Wife has 40k student loan debt that we pay $240 a month on, it’s a useless degree that has not helped her much in getting a job, however it is a degree from an accredited state university.

- Cash Savings (bank, savings accounts, emergency savings): $67k

- Retirement (Roths and IRAs): $38k

- **We would like to avoid using $20,000 from our retirement accounts** for the house down payment that the government allows for a first time buyer to use without penalty (we have to pay taxes on it and cannot withdraw any earnings)

     - We don’t see how else to come up with the down payment for a more expensive home, unless we can purchase a home under $250,000 (older smaller home without a workshop).

**The Challenges:**

- My current workshop that I work out of is at one of my co-worker houses.

- Co-Worker is getting older and frustrated with this setup and wants to move to the country in ft worth or somewhere else in the next few years or sooner.

- I may need to be more self reliant to build my own personal business and to do my salary job.

- My mother lives at my co-workers house that we use as our workshop.

- Finding a house with land and an already built workshop within 20 miles of my co-workers house is proving to be difficult.

- Found one property with workshop and land for 350k that may work and others for $500k+ that are not possible for us to afford.

**Potential Options:**

1. Buy a 4 bedroom 2,200 sq ft house with a workshop and 1 acre land for $350k.

2. Buy a 4 bedroom 2,000 sq ft house with 1 acre of land for under $270k, may not have a workshop (or maybe a small 500 sq ft one) and would need to build a propper workshop on the property in the future.

3. Buy a small house with 4 bedrooms 1,800 - 2,200 sq ft of space for under $250 (no land but may be able to use small garage as as tiny storage/workshop).

4. Kick out our tenant of 10 years and move into our 2 bedroom 900 sq ft condo (72k left on the mortgage with 8% interest rate, zestimate of 120k, however it needs a lot of work to get it fixed up to sell or rent again). Would be rough to have wife, 2 kids in a small space.

5. Hope my landlord is open to selling me the 3 bedroom 1,400 sq ft house I am renting for under $225,000.

6. Buy a track home in ft worth for $270,000

7. Find a property in the Dallas Ft Worth area with enough land to build a workshop in the future around $250,000 and commute to my co-workers house workshop until I can transfer everything over in the future when I can save up to build a workshop. I could potentially have a long drive to my co-workers house for work.

8. Keep renting our current 3 bedroom house, refinance our condo to a lower interest rate, and keep saving.

9. Move into a less expensive rental property, refinance our condo to a lower interest rate, and keep saving.

10. To be determined!

**Refinancing our Condo:**

- We know we need to do this, we just don’t know when to do it based on what the best path forward is.

- If we refi today, if we are going to buy a house, we limit our down payment amount and maybe mess with our credit score (hard credit pulls, less money in bank).

- If we refi after we purchase a home, then we may need to wait a bit to afford the refi costs.

- The condo breaks even currently with our tenant.

**Potential Tax Benefits:**

- We have a company we formed in 2010 that is on a shelf.

- If we reinstate that with the IRS or form a new corp, we should be able to deduct a good portion of our mortgage, property and expenses for a workshop.

- IRS allows up to 10k in deductions for Farms per year.

- We spoke to a CPA and he confirmed this should be possible.


Thank you for reading this wall of text, this has been a great exercise to write out our options.


**TLDR:**

personalfinance,"(SWE) Parents gave me 64k $ in mutual funds with 1.5 % expense ratio, sell and transfer to index funds or not, connected to student aid","I am in a very fortunate setting, where after my 18th birthday, I got access to some mutual funds, where my parents and relatives have put in money since my birth. However, they are rather expensive. 

* **Mutual fund 1** 56443 $, 33744 $ latent, 1.5 % expense ratio
* **Mutual fund 2** 3515 $, 1127 $ latent,  1.85 % expense ratio
* **Mutual fund 3** 4265 $, 1865 $ latent, 2 % expense ratio

The expense ratios are rather large, and I am thinking of transferring them to (global) index funds instead. Furthermore, they are nordic funds, and I would like more diversification. There are nordic index funds available for 0 % expense ratio and global and regional index funds for 0.15-0.35 % expense ratio. 

However, the tax situation in Sweden is such that to transfer, you have to pay full taxes. And the taxes are 30 % of the latent profit. So I would pay

* 0.3*33744 = 10123.2 for mutual fund 1
* 0.3*1127 = 338.1 for mutual fund 2
* 0.3*1865 = 559.5 for mutual fund 3

and have 

* 46320 $ left for mutual fund 1
* 3177 $ left for mutual fund 2
* 3705 $ left for mutual fund 3

, so that's quite a lot of taxes. I don't really know what to do. I know the investment time horizon plays are role here, but of that I have no idea. The idea is to use the money to (partially) buy an apartment or house. Currently I live at home for free and will study for 5 years starting this fall. Sometime during the study period, I will move out and will likely be renting cheap student apartments.

To further complicate the issue, there is a questions of student aid. Tuition is free in Sweden, but for living costs you get a 341 $ grant and 858 $ loan at 1 % interest rate. If you earn too much money, both the grant and the right to take out the loan will be lowered progressively. The complete latent profit of the mutual funds counts as income, which would disqualify me from the student aid for a half year. That means, if I sell before 30 June, I will be able to take out the complete student aid, but if I sell after, for half a year I won't get any student aid. I am in no real need of it, I will survive anyway, but I like to maximize my financial prospects. Don't worry about the moral aspect of it, in Sweden this aid is seen as a right and everyone takes it, even the wealthiest.

gaming,A few concerns i have about the new Injustice game.,"So i've been playing Injustice: Gods Among Us again recently and i thought of a few issues i hope Netherrealm fix in the new game.

This post will probably be quite long, sorry. 

#1: get rid of teleporting characters. This is top of the list for me as one of the most irritating things in the first game, especially during online play. Many of the characters in Injustice have an ability that allows them to teleport or jump to the other player from across the map, dealing massive damage at the same time. Scorpion and Doomsday are the worst offenders here. This attack needs to go or be nerfed or something, i can't tell you the irritation of losing to a Scorpion player who just tele-punches his way to victory.

#2: fix the block system. I'm sure many of you fellow Injustice players will agree with me that the blocking system is absolute DOGSHIT. Unlike the Mortal Kombat games where you press a button to block an attack; Injustice requires that you actually move backwards to block an attack. This leads to instances where you become trapped in a corner, or are unable to counter attack. This needs fixing in the second game.

#3: FIX THE DAMN NETCODE. This for me is something i hope Netherrealm improve DRASTICALLY in Injustice 2. The online play in Injustice 1 was, lets face it, utter garbage. It took ( and still takes) minutes to find a match, and having multiple players in a session such as with KOTH or Survivor just fucks your connection completely. Worst of all though, is the input lag. In a game like this where timing is crucial to execute a combo, having an input delay of at least a second ( a second and a half in the worst case) makes it impossible not only to execute a combo, bur to effectively block or counter an enemy attack on time. This needs fixing for Injustice 2 if it is to survive online.

That pretty much somes up the problems i had with the first Injustice and what i hope they fix for the second game. Let me know what you guys think and if you agree with what i said!",technology,1466547918

personalfinance,"One month pregnant, and wife mentioned working half time for a year after maternity leave. With large lifestyle changes can we swing it?","When we purchased our house two years ago, my wife[30] agreed that she would continue to work after having kids. We bought the oldest, cheapest non-teardown 2.5 br house in a highly desirable neighborhood. My wife is a teacher, and the timing should have her maternity leave back up with summer break for an almost 6 month paid maternity leave. 

Wife mentioned how one of her co-teachers is 4mo pregnant and they were talking about teaching half time together. That would mean $30k, half benefits and would still need daycare half day every day, or a nany split. 

Full tome childcare is $1800-$2k monthly in Seattle. I have not been able to figure out what kind of savings it would be to hire a part time nanny/daycare or nanny share.
  
Our DINK food budget and pampered dog will have to change. If my wife were to stay home it would reduce our dog expense.

As you can see, we can afford daycare, and some of those expenses can easily be reduced. I just don't know about losing $2k per month on wife's salary (down to $6k net) and still having to pay for some childcare. Wife would need to work for a half day every day. Realistically, half day means she is working 5-6 hour days instead of 9-10 including the time spent grading and answering emails.  

Other changes:
My healthcare expense would go up a couple hundred dollars if wife went half time. 

The extra money each month has gone to almost completely pay off our student loans (we are done paying them down, the interest rate is lower than the mortgage on my last loan.)  We also took a big vacation recently, and then built up savings for a bit. No more big vacations for a while, and our date night/eating out budget will be much lower with a baby.

My wife will be paid full time through September 2017 so we can save up. 

Another factor is that she has summer and breaks off. If she works full time during the school year, during the breaks she is still paid full time even though we wouldn't pay for childcare. If she works half time, she is paid halftime during the summer and breaks. Basically she is paid for the work done, but it is spread out over 12 months.
    
Is it possible for wife to go halftime, or should we stick with the original plan and go with full time daycare?

personalfinance,Help me figure out how to afford a house loan in a HCOL area.,"My husband and I live in Orange County, CA where the average price for a home is over $600,000, however right now we only make $62,000 a year right now. By the time we are even somewhere close to looking to buy a house, we plan to not have a car payment, car insurance/medical insurance $250/month, student loan payments will be at $200/month but should be paid off in the next 6-7 years so may be gone by the time we are looking to buy, and credit payments may be about $100/month but could fluctuate if a huge emergency comes up before then. Obviously utilities can vary due to the size of the house but from what I've gathered $350 is a good estimate. We also want to be contributing to savings. Rent for us right now is $1500. 

In the next couple of years, I expect both of our incomes to increase a little but for the foreseeable future, I see our income peaking at about $75,000-80,000 depending on how much I can grow at my company, and if his employer expands, allowing higher up positions for him to open up. Basically to me this means we can't afford a house here unless we start making almost double what we make now. Moving out of county/state may be an option later down the line (not preferable) but besides that, and saving everything we can, do we have any options? I am trying to plan ahead for when we are ready to start looking for homes so we aren't shocked. I'm interested if we would ever even be able to afford a $300,000 house.

personalfinance,"Experience in an area that I love, but have no idea how to enter properly","Hi, this year I'm graduating high school, and thus far, I feel I've done everything correctly, but a couple nights ago, I had this nagging feeling that I might be doing something wrong. This year I'm going to start attending William Paterson University with no out of pocket cost for tuition (a couple scholarships and Federal Aid with no loans paid for it).

In high school, I was part of our school's CAST (Communications Arts and Science) program for three years. The first year was a class that I'd taken to just fill my schedule, but during the second year of the program, I absolutely fell in love with the work. Soon, Tv production was something that I absolutely loved to do everyday. Naturally, when my teacher offered to put me in the honors level course, I agreed wholeheartedly. Not only that, but he offered me an internship which netted me 10 credits.

The internship really highlighted everything I loved about the work. Being one of only two interns this year and being in the studio's honors class, I had a lot of work on my plate each day, so I spent a great deal of time working on everything our studio had to offer. On-set productions, remote productions, working every position in producing our school's morning news, editing said morning news, creating various cg pages for use in the news program, troubleshooting general issues, working studio lighting, filming stage productions, and doing general post-production were just some of the various jobs I undertook.

This is the root of my problem. In gaining all this experience, I never asked my supervisor what would come next. Taking on the internship really solidified the fact that I wanted to work in television production, but, I just have no idea what to do next. William paterson offers a tv prod program, which I want to take.

Given all of this though, I guess my question is, where should I go to really start my career? I want to start early to gain the necessary experience and savings to continue to follow my passion, even if it means working as a cable runner. Having the college courses is great and all, but outside of management, the degree won't be as important as experience.

Any answers from those in the field will really help me solidify what I could do next to start planning for my economic future and the future of myself in general.

If this question doesn't really fit for this sub, I'd also appreciate if someone can point me to the right sub.

Also, I am living at home, and am still financially dependent for the time being. Medical bills really hit home, and although we live comfortably, there's not really much money left for mucking around with.

ethereum,"This online exchange I recently had shows the lackadaisical attitude and irrelevant arguments of a Solidity language designer who apathetically acquiesces in the pitfalls of the procedural paradigm. Followed by a 20-minute video showing the actual state of the art, of which he is apparently unaware.","https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4opjov/the_bug_which_the_dao_hacker_exploited_was_not/d4ge4lp

This procedural programmer has no sense of priorities or urgency: Note how he irrelevantly mentions being able to ""go right down into the assembly"" as if it were some kind of benefit instead of actually [being a borderline bug](http://www.loper-os.org/?p=55).

And the most damning thing of all is that he makes his arguments apparently blissfully unaware of the state of the art of the industry in which he is attempting to operate (smart contract language design) - which is magnificently on display in the following inspiring 20-minute video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeg_Q5uN73Q

(You can ignore the brief video-within-a-video towards the beginning, which had bad audio.)

The languages used in that 20-minute video are *not* procedural, they are **functional**.

And as the video shows, the finance industry knows that the important thing in smart contract language design is *not* whether you're able to dip into the underlying assembly language. 

**The most important thing in smart contract language design is *provable correctness*.**

Until we start designing contracts using functional languages - which are the only languages that support automated formal **program verification** to prove that a contract is ""correct"" before running it (ie, that it satisfies a certain specification or certain invariants, or never gets into certain 'prohibited' states), then these kinds of totally avoidable disasters and debates (the draining of the DAO, and the dilemma of what to do about it) will unfortunately continue to happen again and again.

Now, due to certain technical aspects of language design (which I try to explain below in the section further below, called **How can we make programming as perfect as math?**), **program verification** can effectively *only* be done by using *functional* languages - mainly because functional languages prohibit the arbitrary *side-effects* and *control flow jumps* that make it practically infeasible to symbolically traverse the entire [Kripke structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripke_structure_%28model_checking%29) of all of a program's possible future behaviors - ie the (possibly infinite) time-branching *semantics* of the contract's state space, as expressed by its (finitely presented) code or *syntax*.

**Mathematics and markets**

Verifying a program is equivalent to proving a theorem. 

Everyone knows that for all right triangles, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 is always true - and we know this because we have a mathematical proof of this. 

In fact, we also know that every single thing in the entire edifice of mathematics is also always true - again because we only allow things to be added if we have a mathematical proof that they are true.

The question humanity is facing right now is serious but simple: **Do we want our markets to be governed by the perfection of mathematics (which is always right), or by the apathy and unawareness of procedural programmers** (who think it's fine to be wrong, as long as [they apologize politely afterwards to the community](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4p521a/to_the_community/))?

Mathematicians never have to write blog posts or tweets saying ""Sorry, I fucked up"" - because they're not allowed to submit *any* work product that isn't accompanied by mathematical proof of its correctness.

Software developers doing procedural programming, on the other hand, are held to a much lower standard. They routinely ship buggy code. This is because there is no tradition of requiring mathematical proof that their code is correct. But this is a socio-political problem which can easily be remedied, by simply requiring that *programming* be held to the same standards of proof that *mathematics* is. 

**How can we make programming as perfect as math?**

The answer is somewhat subtle, but simple: We must use *functional* languages, which are the only languages which support **program verification**. 

Note that most of mathematics is generally *not* procedural - it is typically *equational* (which is actually similar to being *functional*).

When solving an equation in mathematics, you usually don't say: ""assign this value to this variable"" or ""go to this location"". In other words, when solving an equation in mathematics, there is no variable assignment and there is no control flow. Instead, you just keep applying a certain kind of transformation over and over again - in this case, ""doing the same thing"" to both sides of the equation.

It doesn't really matter *what* you to to both sides, as long as you do the *same thing* to both sides. (In fact, this class of transformations constitute a nice example of *a language which is restricted but sufficiently powerful to do the job*.)

Of course, when reducing an equation, it is normally recommended that you should have a strategy in mind: ie instead of aimlessly applying random transformations (which you *could* do if you wanted to, without ever changing the ""truthfulness"" of the equational term), you are instead advised to strategically choose do to precisely those transformation which will eventually isolate the *x* on one side: and then you're done. 

Notice that in all of this process you actually never ""assign"" a value to a ""variable"", and you never have to ""go to"" a particular predetermined ""place"".

You instead treat the equation *as a whole*, and you keep attacking it as a whole, transforming it into another whole, until that whole is in a form that you like, which you consider to be the ""solution"". 

It doesn't even matter what order you do the operations in. You might choose to first subtract the same thing from both sides, and then divide both sides by the same thing - or you could just as easily reverse the order of these transformations - and you'd still ultimately get the same result. (This is an important property of mathematics and functional programming, called ""convergence"".)

And finally, no ""exceptions"" can ever occur, because the set of transformations which you're allowed to apply - ie, your ""programming language"" - is so restricted (you're only allowed to ""do the same thing to both sides"") that nothing you could ever do could even ""throw"" an ""exception"".

**Functional programming is based on mathematics. Procedural programming *looks* like it is, but actually it isn't.**

Solving an equation (ie, reducing an ""equational term"") is similar to the way functional programs work. 

Unlike procedural programs, functional programs usually don't need to assign different values to variables, and they don't have much of a notion of a sequential control flow where you ""go to"" any particular location - determined in advance, or determined by a test.

Sometimes it might *seem* like you have to ""go to"" a particular place in the code of a functional program - but this is just an illusion. For example, you may have noticed that most functional languages usually do have a construct saying ""if ... then ... else ... endif"" - just like most procedural languages.

But there is a major (but subtle) difference! The functional version of that construct is actually already a *value* (and there is no assignment going on, and you don't have to ""go to"" a particular location). Meanwhile the procedural version of that construct is a ""control statement"" which doesn't have a value of its own - instead, its semantics (behavior) depends on producing side effects (assignments to variables) or making the program's control flow ""go to"" a particular place.

By the way, for anyone that uses functions in Excel: the ""=IF()"" function in Excel is *functional*, not *procedural*! It ""is"" its own result, which gets slotted into the overall term within the cell. Excel is actually a very good example of a functional language - which should be encouraging news to any procedural programmers who think that functional programming might be difficult!

So in functional programming you just keep doggedly applying certain transformations pretty much anywhere you want within a term, until that term is eventually reduced to a simplifed form which you recognize as the ""solution"". There is a simplicity and a unity, a timelessless and a placelessness, in mathematics and functional programming - unlike the sequentiality and locationality of the imperative style of procedural programming, with its unnecessary, distracting and confusing additional bookkeeping involving ""update this value"" and ""go to this location"". 

By contrast, notice that the ""value"" of an equation (or of a term being reduced in a functional program) never actually changes - since you're only allowed to apply operations which *reduce* (simplify) it, never *update* it. Likewise the notion of ""sequential execution"" in solving equations and functional programming is also irrelevant: you are free to reduce (simplify) *any* location within the term, in any order - because all possible reduction paths are guaranteed to eventually converge on the same solution.

What all this means is that functional programs are much simpler than procedural ones - because there's so much less to keep track of. There are vastly fewer actual different ""states"" in which a functional program can ""be"": values never get re-""assigned"", and control never has to ""go to"" any particular location. Instead, permitted transformations can arbitrarily be applied anywhere, usually even in parallel, and in the end all the various possible sequential paths of possible transformations which can actually occur are guaranteed to eventually converge on the same final result anyways. 

So when solving an equation in math (or reducing a term in a functional language): there's lots of equally valid paths to the final result, and lots of locations within the current equation (or term) where you can choose to apply transformations, usually even simultaneously (in parallel) - but there is no predetermined sequential flow of control, and the value of the term is the same before every transformation and after - it's just more (or less) ""reduced"".

It is precisely this simplicity of functional programming which makes it possible to perform **program verification.** (And, by the way, this simplicity is also what makes functional programming better for doing parallel or concurrent computation - which is probably something Ethereum should also be shooting for.)

**Functional programming - not procedural programming - is the right tool for writing *safe* smart contracts**

Getting back to smart contracts: if you run a **program verifier** on a smart contract, it can prove that certain things about it are ""true"" (eg, an attacker can never drain funds from it, etc.).

Just like there was a hidden flaw in ""The DAO"", there is a hidden flaw in the hype around Solidity and smart contracts and all this hot air about ""code as law"": They're selling this stuff to us as if it were as rigorous as *mathematics* - when reality it's just the usual sloppy software development that's typical of *procedural programming* - where bugs are expected, and schedule and budget overruns are the norm. (See [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4opjov/the_bug_which_the_dao_hacker_exploited_was_not/) for a bunch of examples of this lackadaisical attitude - scroll down to the section called **""More examples of failed projects and ""lethal software""**.)

As the above [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeg_Q5uN73Q) shows, for a certain restricted class of programs (which is broad enough to encompass any contract which we could possibly dream up), it is quite straightforward to pass a smart contract through a **program verifier** before running it, to check whether there are *any* 'prohibited' states which the contract might ever end up in.

This kind of **program verifier** produces one of two outputs: either ""no 'prohibited' states found"" - or it gives an counter-example: a path leading to a 'prohibited' state. 

Conceptually, such a **program verifier** just uses symbolic computation to do a brute-force combinatorial attack simulating all possible future branching paths which the program could ""go down"", trying to *refute* the proposition that ""this program can never reach a certain 'prohibited' state.""

In other words, a **program verifier** uses a ""refutational style"" to try to push the program into a 'prohibited' state - and if it manages to succeed (with the limitations of space and time you give it), then it tells you.

**People writing high-value mission-critical software are routinely doing *program verification* now**

**Program verification** is now being routinely done for all mission-critical software, in fields such as [avionics and aerospace, hardware validation, cryptographic protocols](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4p0um9/why_turingcomplete_smart_contracts_are_doomed/d4heh97), etc.

But this kind of **program verification** is *only* practical for languages without arbitrary side effects and control flow jumps - and basically this corresponds with the family of languages called ""functional"". 

This ability to perform formal reasoning and verification *before* running the program is actually the *main reason* why functional languages are for these kinds of high-value mission-critical applications.

**Procedural programmers can usually learn functional programming quite easily**

The *syntax* of a functional language doesn't look all that different from the syntax of other languages - so it's usually not a big leap for a programmer to start using functional languages. Remember, the ""if ... then ... else ... endif"" construct in the example given above looked pretty much the same in a functional language versus a procedural language (but the semantics are simpler for the functional version, making it easier to do **program verification**). 

Or, to take another example, an ""iterator"" in a functional language will typically have similar, easily recognizable ""parts"" like a ""loop"" in a proceural language - but the ""iterator"" can be treated (by **program verification** tools) as a *pure value*, while the ""loop"" must be treated as *a kind of funky rickety sequential/temporal control flow thingamajig which eventually (if it doesn't hand off control to some other faraway part of the program due to throwing an exception) destructively assigns a value.*

It is precisely this timeless, locationless simplicity of every immutable ""value"" in a functional language - versus the massive complicated sequence-dependent location-dependent complexity of most mutable ""values"" in other languages - which makes it possible to perform automated **verification of programs** written in functional languages - something which is practically impossible to do for programs written in procedural languages.

The challenge is: making procedural programmers understand *why* they need to make the simple conceptual leap to functional languages - if they want to work on high-value mission-critical projects.

**Procedural programmers doing smart contract language design need to make the leap to functional programming now.**

Most programmers fail to grasp the *feasibility* and the *necessity* of using the functional paradigm on these kinds of projects.

I think in large part they just need to realize how *feasible* **program verification** is when using a functional language - and how much safer it is compared to the semi-formal ""testing"" they sometimes use with their procedural or object-oriented languages.

Functional programming isn't much harder than procedural programming. The only real hard part is learning about monads - but there's [tons of monad tutorials out there](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=monad+tutorial&amp;ia=web), and eventually you realize that it's just a generic way of baking certain frequently occurring types of control flow and value assignments into a generic, reusable structure. The simplest example of monads - the Option - is very easy to learn first, and you will quickly appreciate how much better it is than the procedural approach of using exceptions. (Basically an Option is something which either returns a value which can be either something or nothing. This makes exception handling much easier, since it's baked right into your data.)

The procedural programmer I was talking to online mentioned that one of his colleagues favors functional languages - but the procedural guy didn't really see the value in it (even though he has used Rust.)

Many procedural programmers who have tried a functional language typically only learned the *first-order* stuff (how to write programs in it) without ever learning the *higher-order* stuff (how to formally **verify programs** written in it).

But as [the video at the start of this OP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeg_Q5uN73Q) shows, being able to perform **program verification** is the real payoff of using functional languages. 

So I hope that if more procedural programmers see videos like this, they'll have that ""aha!"" moment where they see the real value of functional languages, and they'll make the leap.

**Because when it comes to high-value mission-critical projects - such as smart contract language design - the benefit of *program verification* is not ""optional"", it is *mandatory*.**

Last February (2015) my old '94 Ford Escort (paid cash) was on its last leg, body falling apart, suspension groaning with every little turn, blown head gasket etc.

So what does a kid who comes from nothing do? He goes to the dealership and proceeds to get completely mollywopped by an auto finance guy. I came out with an $8000 car financed at 25% interest over 6 years. Ouch.

I've had my financial house in fairly good order for a while, but I was still paying off about 60k in unsecured debt my wife and I racked up while we were young and stupid. Due to high utilization, my credit score was pretty crappy. It's important to state that for the last 8 years or so, we've been living within our means, we had a good emergency fund prior to the windfall, I'm maxing out retirement savings, etc. We just had this debt on our backs dragging down our credit score. We haven't added to the debt in the past 8 years; all our spending was on an Amex charge card that we (had to) pay off each month. 

This isn't a ""what do I do with this windfall"" question. The money is being professionally managed, and I'm not going to go blow it on a Ferrari. I've just been used to having fairly crappy credit for so long, I'm not sure if I should do anything now that I'm considered an excellent borrower. I don't have a single late payment in my 13.5 year credit history. 

We both have cars we like, bought used, with payments well within our means (prior to the windfall), but I suspect the interest rates could be a little lower: they are at 4.75 and 4.89 percent. Should I try to refinance them? 

We recently refinanced our mortgage (prior to the windfall) and got a rate in the 5's... Is it worth looking into doing that again?

We both have plenty of available credit, we don't need any new cards, and have no intention of ever carrying a balance again ever, but should I apply for some über-card I never would have qualified for a few months ago? Should I request limit increases on the cards we have?

The only concern I have is that I have 5 inquiries on my Equifax: 3 from the house refinance, and 1 from each of the car loans. The oldest one is from Feb, 2015. Should I incur more inquiries in order to make use of my new score?

personalfinance,Large Student Debt - Seeking Advice,"**Introduction:**

Hi all - this is a throwaway account I'm using to pose this question and seek advice in optimizing my student loan repayment and meeting my obligations for a debt-free future.
Specifically, I would love to hear your advice on:

•	**Ways to change my budget and/or reduce my expenditures (trim the fat, cheaper alternatives)**

•	**Optimal loan repayment strategies (10-year, 20-year, PAYE, IBR, ICR, private consolidation, etc.)**

•	**Investment and/or savings (should I or shouldn’t I?)**

•       **Renting vs. Owning (take a mortgage?  when, what kind, etc.)**

•	**Risk-management and planning (what if I lose my job?)**

If more detail is required for responses to be accurate, please let me know, and I’ll edit in more complete breakdowns.  I kept the details intentionally aggregated and short for easy viewing.  Thanks in advance for your insight!  

**Personal Information:**

I'm a recent law school graduate.  I took out loans to finance my undergraduate and graduate school tuition.  I have no savings - I worked to pay my expenses and applied all surplus towards my tuition in order to reduce my borrowing.  I have no credit card debt.  I have an offer for a job to start in the Fall – the attrition rate appears to be about 50% every 2 years.  I’ll be living and working in NYC.

**Expected Income:**

•	Annual: ~ $180,000 (not including bonus - all bonus will be 100% applied towards high interest debt)

•	Estimated Take-Home: ~ $9,800/mo

•	Estimated Raise: ~ 10%/year

**Federal Loans:**

•	Total: ~ $211,000

•	Net Effective Interest Rate: ~ 6.233% (interest varies from 5% to 7.2%)

•	Estimated Repayment: ~ $2,200/mo (Standard 10-year)

**Private Loans:**

•	Total: ~ $75,000

•	Net Effective Interest Rate: ~ 2.5% (interest varies from 2.25% to 2.75%)

•	Estimated Repayment: ~ $800/mo (Standard 10-year)

**Expected Expenses:**

•	Total ~ $ 5,700/mo

o	Health Insurance ~ $300/mo

o	Cable/Internet ~ $100/mo

o	Restaurants ~ $200/mo

o	Groceries ~ $500/mo

o	Rent ~ $2,700/mo (includes utilities)

o	Hair, Laundry, Work Clothes ~ $200/mo

o      Vacation Allowance ~$200/mo

o	Emergency Fund ~$1,500/mo (for 10 months)


•	Missing Items (**should I get these?  anything I’m missing and should consider?**)

o	Renter’s Insurance

o	401k, IRA, Roth (employer does not match)

o	Other Investments

o	College Fund (for future children)


**Expected Surplus:**

•	Total: ~ $1,100/mo

**Final Thoughts:**

I have no plan for the surplus.  I am an investment novice.  My goal is to be debt-free as soon as possible, but I would like to pay off my student debt optimally.  **Is there some threshold at which investment is better than prepayment (for example, prepay loans with interest in excess of 6%, then make minimum payments on the loans and invest the rest)?**

I hope to stop renting and own a home as soon as possible.  **Any thoughts on obtaining a mortgage (30-year, 15-year, fixed, variable) and what a reasonable first home in NYC would be (studio or 1 bedroom)?**

Thank you all for taking the time – I appreciate your advice!

I know obviously the most financially sound decision would be to stay at home and pay off all of the loans and save more, but I feel like I am missing out on an important developmental milestone by not moving out.

My student loan payments are $196 a month and it will be paid off in 5 years. If I get really strict I could probably put $200 per month additional against this debt.

I have $4,500 in stock, there would be long term capital gains.

I have $5,600 surrender value in a whole life policy, very minimal taxes would be taken out as there are some dividends in the policy but as of now there are no proceeds so no tax.



My thoughts are:

A) Put the Whole Life into IRA or Roth and keep paying off the student loan debt.

B) Put the Whole Life towards the student loan debt and continue making payments on the balance.

C) Cash out the stock and put that and the Whole Life together to wipe out the debt in one shot.

I go back and forth between options A&amp;C. Historically my IRAs/retirement investments have made double the 2.95% interest rate on the loan. But then again it is an additional $200 a month that I could re-invest or put towards my mortgage.

Anyways I'm throwing $2600 into a ROTH IRA every year(only been with him for 8 months so far). And plan to increase as I go along here. As of now I have holdings in CAFGX and VNR. Both he said were bought due to their low price and decent returns. I have a little knowledge on investing but not enough to refute what he says. The only fee currently is the annual adviser fee of 1.5%. Just from the little research I have done has showed me that CAFGX isn't very popular as far as being well known, and VNR is just straight being hated on. I know with my current setup I am on a good track to retire early but just need some fine tuning. And before anyone says anything, I am considered an intern at my place of work and will get a matched 401k within a few months when they hire me as an employee.Also it has come to my mind that he has not really bought much. I get an email anytime he makes a trade. I have the initial trade and then 3 more after that. I just feel like there should be more but I don't know. Really any feedback would be great.

personalfinance,My boss (direct report) just asked me to take on more responsibility because one of our key technicians is leaving. Pay was never mentioned and I'm struggling with when to bring it up? What do i do?,"I feel as if i was promoted without being promoted. I basically have what is considered an ""entry level"" job position and was just told this at the end of today. My boss caught me off guard and portrayed to me that they needed me in this position because of the technician leaving (We are completely understaffed and often work 12+ hour days and weekends). I had been busting my butt in hopes to be recognized and hopefully compensated accordingly because at first I took a rate that was far below what i was comfortable in order to ""get my foot in the door"". Basically 25% above minimum wage because it was an ""ENTRY LEVEL"" position.         

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, they're asking me to take on this technicians responsibilities, become a leader in my role to make decisions in favor of the company's interests and to learn whatever I can because I am going to be ""observed"" by the higher-ups to make sure I'm the right one for the job. They have sent me to another facility this week to become familiar with their equipment because it will become part of our inventory in the next few months and i start training on the previous technician's duties starting Monday. I am totally okay with the added tasks because I have a background in what the previous tech was already doing. I just need to fine-tune what I know and apply it to this job. 

&amp;nbsp;

When the topic of pay was brought up my boss mentioned how they had never asked for a raise in their life and they just accepted what was given to them. They also told me to ""pick my battles carefully"" which seemed to be some sort of threat. I left the office with feeling as if I wouldn't have been able to ask for a wage increase even though I am being stacked with all these responsibilities.

&amp;nbsp;

As of now, I am under the assumption that I will not be getting a wage increase. And when I had requested for one around the time of our reviews, they would not grant me one (not even a cost of living increase) because I was ""too new of an employee"".

So, I'm stuck. I don't know what to do and when to bring it up and how I can bring it up again to revisit the topic of pay. It seems as they are desperate for someone to fill this position and I want to be able to leverage myself into a place where they are able to meet what I would like for this type of work.

After lurking around on this subreddit for a couple years wondering what I'd do with a pile of money dropped on my lap, it suddenly happened to me. 


In January, my father passed away. My mother recently received the life insurance, and she has given me 10,000 cdn.
 

Currently, I pay approximately 705 cdn a month for bills (that includes placing 100 in a TFSA, which now has 1800 in it). FYI, I'm originally from Canada!  


I now live and work in Switzerland. After paying all my bills each month (which includes sending the 705 cdn to Canada) I usually have 1000 francs leftover that I place in a Swiss savings account, which now has about 3000 francs. I plan to be moving to another location in Switzerland Feb 2017, so slowly gathering a little bit of money for that. 


On top of this, I have 3 loans that were taken out for university.
 
1. Federal and Provincial loans (which I clumped together since I don't have to pay interest): 18,403.88. On a monthly payment plan, included in my monthly Canadian bills
2. Credit line from my bank: 11,863.52 with an interest rate of 3.70%. I haven't placed any money in this credit line for about a year, I have been paying interest.

As of now, this lump sum of cash is currently sitting in my bank account. I think it might be a good idea to place all of it into my credit line, and basically pay it off, but I worry that I wouldn't be using the cash to its full potential. Go on a vacation? Invest it? Blow it on hookers? Use only little amounts at a time?

My Fiance and I (both 25) both have good paying jobs but between living in a high COL area and focusing on retirement savings we have been living a fairly frugal lifestyle and don't have much saved up.  My fiance had some bad luck with a used car purchase and my 250k mi beater from high school finally bit the dust so we both had to finance new cars in the past year.  

Recently he got a significant raise and right now he maxes out his company matching for 401k and maxes out his Roth IRA.  He also puts $300 into a savings account for emergency fund.  I put $200/mo into my Roth IRA and $200/mo into savings.  I also have a government pension through my job that will pay out ~$55k per year when I retire (no guaruntee obviously).

In 6 months we will have completed our Emergency fund , be completely student loan-free, and I will also be making an extra $200/month after taxes.    We both have car loans with good interest rates (2.84% and 2.5%).  We are going to try not to change our lifestyle at all and continue to spend the same amount, so the question is what to do with the extra $700/mo once the emergency fund is complete.  Given the good interest rates on the cars it seems to be a pretty low priority to pay them off early.  I think the best thing to do would be to put an extra $250 into my Roth IRA, which would max it out and put the other $450/mo into a new savings account for a house down payment.  Right now we pay $1400 just in rent and we would pay much less on a mortgage on a small house or condo so I think it is a good goal to have.

HOWEVER, each of the 3 credit agencies shows this loan as $58,000 on my report, conveniently missing a 1. The caveat to this is that the amount paid per month is accurate on all 3 as well (Which is obviously way too high for a 20 year payback period as reported)

If I do indeed refinance this loan (I've been pre-approved with SoFi and Earnest), will my credit score take a serious dump because now it will be reporting 158,000$ rather than the current 58,000$?

Should I wait to refinance until after we close on a house?

$500 towards debt consolidation loan


$100 for Savings Account (currently, I have about $500 in there now... pitiful, I know)


**Potential expenses coming down the pike for me:**


My car needs some work done. Right now, it's worth $1,000-$1,500. I'm willing to put some money into my car because I really don't want to have to get a new (used) one. I don't have a car payment at the moment and I'd like to keep it that way so I can focus on paying down my other debt.


**Medical bills** I recently had a heart attack and was in the hospital for 2.5 days. I haven't received my bill yet but I'm thinking that I will owe around $1,200 after insurance. I will continue to have bi-monthly medical appointments for the next 12 months. Additionally, I spend $18-$25/month for medications. My HSA will be depleted after this. I had saved $1,300 over four years so I will need to build that back up again. I haven't factored that into above yet, however.


One other upcoming change to my income... starting with my July 2016 paycheck, I will likely receive a small bump to the tune of $100 extra/month for performance and cost of living. This would bring my net income to about $3,200. If that's the case, where should I direct that extra $100?


So what do you all think? Am I on a good path? What would you change? Thank you in advance for your advice and guidance. I'm committed to paying down this debt and eventually, getting rid of it. I'm embarrassed that I let it get to this point and I want to make this right and get my credit score back up.",finance,1466603715

I want to get a new (used) car in the $10-11.5k range, just something to hold me over until I'm done with my masters degree and maybe a couple years after. My options are to sell my current car for 2-3k and use that as a down payment, then pay $150-175 a month on the financing, or save $$ and drive my car until it inevitably dies or the repairs are worth more than the vehicle (it has 180k miles, I give it a year at best) and take the residual value of the scrap/parts, then use the money I saved for a down payment. 

As of right now, I moved back in with my parents because I didn't want to have to take out loans for my housing on-campus anymore and my parents live 15 mins away (stupid financial decision, but I was 17 at the time), so I have no rent expense. My only other fixed expense is $140/m car insurance which I'm expecting to raise to about $200/m once I'm forced to add collision/comprehensive coverage since I'll be financing.

I want to rearrange some debt payments, and I'm not sure how it will affect my credit score. My auto payment is $400/mo and I've been paying $450 every month. This has left me a couple of months ahead in terms of payments due.

The interest rate on the loan is only 1.99%. I have a student loan at about 6%. What I'm thinking is I can stop making auto payments for a couple of months and put an extra ~$900 (450 payment x 2 months) toward the student loan since it has the higher interest, then once my auto payments are no longer ahead of schedule, I will go back to paying the minimum $400 on that and put the difference ($50) to the loan.

Numbers-wise, it's a no brainer. My question is will the lack of a couple months of payments have any impact on my credit score? I won't have ""missed"" any payments, since the money is not due, but I will have 0s for the payment amount.

I work for a promising hardware start-up and was given stock options totalling around 15,000 shares at an offer price of 0.30/share.

I am coming up to my 1-year cliff and have the ability to purchase 25% of my shares. The price, since the offering, has risen to 4x the price and I expect the price to keep going up, as we are performing very well and expanding at a great pace. 

My question, is should I buy the stock now? My understanding is that I would have to not only pay the price per share, but also federal taxes on the increased value. (0.30/share to 1.20/share). If the prices keep going up, I would want to exercise sooner rather than later right?

The other important thing to note is that it is a private company. There really is no way for me to actually sell the stock, regardless of its value unless the company is bought out, or goes public: neither of which is in the foreseeable forecast as far as the goals of the company.

I can see the company selling somewhere very far down the line, and I would be fine waiting to exercise the options until I'm sure such an event as a buy-out or IPO is imminent, but the offer price vs. current valuation taxes has me nervous.

2) Try to refinance those $10k in loans to an interest rate &lt;4%, make minimum payments, and stick the $10k in retirement

I'll probably be looking into refinancing either way because even if I put the $10k towards my loans I'd have a $10k+ private student loan at an interest rate above 5%.

Additionally, does the ""pay off all debts above 4%"" rule of thumb change with student loans because of the tax break? When that's taken into account the effective interest rate drops 15% or 25% for most so the initial interest rate could be in the 4.7-5.3% range and still have an effective interest rate below 4%",finance,1466617506

The thing is, I've looked into it, and you're ineligible for re-fi if you are currently a student. is it advisable to maybe take some time off of school, and re-fi. and make payments to try and get some of this principle payed off? Or is it better to just keep paying it? My loan is used up, and I've been paying for school out of pocket for the most part, which is also killing me.

&amp;nbsp;

Due to a falling out with the other joint account holder- we have not spoken for some time- within the past year, I no longer wish to have access to this person's checking account. Currently I can access it via the bank's online portal and with a debit card with my name on it. I was originally added as a joint account holder roughly four years ago, and both of us went in person to a branch to do this. Prior to my addition as a joint account holder, this person was the sole account holder for roughly twenty years. It may also be relevant that the account has no debts associated with it and that this is in Illinois.

&amp;nbsp;

Within the past week I visited a branch in person and spoke with the Branch Manager (BM) about having myself removed as a joint account holder for this person's account. The BM said that since I was a joint account holder it was technically *our* account, and that I was limited to two options:

* 1) Both of us must visit a branch in person and sign documents saying that we both agree to have me removed as a joint account holder.
* 2) As a joint account holder, I can close the checking account on my own without any consent from the other joint account holder whatsoever. I could then have the closing balance sent as a check through the mail to either the other joint account holder *or myself*.

&amp;nbsp;

The first option is not on the table right now, although I accept that it may come to being the only practical option. As to you all, I told the BM that it would not be possible for that to happen right now, after which, he mentioned the second option. It's obviously an easy way to do it for me, but has the potential to create massive and unnecessary hostilities between myself and the original account holder, and I expect there could be legal ramifications for that as well.

I asked why simply having myself removed as a joint account holder requires both of us to agree that I shouldn't be one anymore, yet I can drain and close the account on my own without any input from the other joint account holder whatsoever. The BM confirmed that I had the second option right, and said that it was a bank policy, and that it was a bank policy because of the potential for one joint account holder to incur fees and debts and then leave the other joint account holder financially responsible for them. I was a little flabbergasted by that and just asked for the contact information for the next person above him and then left.

&amp;nbsp;

While I can understand the policy behind the first option, it doesn't mesh very well with being able to potentially steal someone else's money, or make the very permanent decision to close someone else's account without their input. I'd really appreciate some help in understanding how these two options can coexist with the reasoning the BM gave me.

&amp;nbsp;

I intend to get all the information I can together and continue speaking with people at this bank, however, I'd like to know a few things.

* At no point did the BM mention any state or federal laws and regulations for the reason of the policy. Are there any laws or regulations on any level of government that require this be how joint access to a bank account is handled?
* Are there any such laws or regulations (or lack thereof) that could help me in convincing the bank to have me removed as a joint account holder, given that I was very recently added in this accounts lifetime and the account has no debts or issues associated with it?
* If I am unable to have myself removed as a joint account holder and the original account holder incurs debts with the bank that this person cannot pay, can the bank hold me responsible for the debts?

personalfinance,38 yrs. self-employed musician. My cash/savings outweigh investments I NEED HELP.,"Obvious throwaway, as I want to list a lot of my personal financial specifics!  

I'm 38 male, Self-employed musician and artist living in the North West.   
No kids (or desire for them), single, no need to save for taking care of my aging parents,   
they are covered (but no inheritance to speak of).  
  
I bought a house 12 years ago in my college town.   
Refinanced, and now my monthly payment is $1100/mo  
I rent it for $1900 (but may up it to $2000 the next school year).   
So after bills and things I'm making about $800/month as a landlord.  
  
On top of the rental income, I make an average of $1000-$2000/month   
with touring, sessions, gigs, or other projects I can bid.  
  
Last month I had the highest paying job ever, a 3-day $12,000 payoff,   
and also toured the whole month, so today with that payment coming in,   
my main B of A checking account is at: $33,000.  
  
  
I have another savings account at a credit union at: $10,000  
  
  
My cash savings (which I like to have a healthy amount of) is at $15,000  
  
  
Paypal is around $2000  
  
  
My portfolio which is essentially a Roth IRA is at $19,000  
  
  
So I'm liquid at about $58,000  
and invested at $19,000  
  
So my a monthly income is anywhere from $800 minimum to $2800 max     
(not including occasional windfall months like this last one.)  
   
I own my car, and pay about $700/month rent.  
I eat out sometimes, but my budget is pretty low.   
I don't spend a lot of money on things- maybe musical gear computers etc...   
but I don't generally blow through money by going out to bars or buying   
$20+ bottles of wine at the grocery store.  

My tax burden last year was about $350,   
as I can write off just about everything- from owning a house,   
to my renting a room as a business expense, my per-diem being on the road...   
plus $300 to the accountant.  
  
  
**WHAT I'M ASKING FOR**  
  
  
Where do I put my money???  
  
  
It is silly to have currently essentially $43k in checking!  
I probably have too much in cash emergency/ fun/ untraceable funds too at $15k  
  
However I don't want to lose all of my liquidity,     
as I need to be prepared to be ready at any given time for a emergency on my house   
like a new roof, paint, new windows etc... all these will need to happen in the not so distant future.   
(btw, I have a principal balance of 104k, a 4.875% interest rate, and 20 years left on the loan.   
I throw about $75/month extra at the principal.)  
  
  
So if you were in my position, and the possibility of maybe more income coming in over the next years-   
as I'm diversifying a bit, how do I work on growing my money for the future?  
  
I'd love to buy another house to live in or rent.   
I'm very handy and can do most of the work,   
however the real estate in the North West right now is crazy,   
and the MAJOR factor is that although I have outstanding credit,   
and have at least $150k equity on my house,   
I don't show enough income for a bank to give me a loan.   
My debt to income ratio has been like 70%     
(as through all my deductions I've shown a net loss on my ""business"" the last decade)   
compared to the 43% that banks need to give a loan.  
  
I'm thinking I should take less deductions   
and just simply pay more taxes to the government to show more taxable income-   
if getting a loan is what I want...  
Is this a good idea???  
  
  
How should I expand my investment portfolio??  
(which is currently with Chase, who also has my mortgage)  
  
  
Should I look for a  different investment manager   
who can see my unique financial situations and lifestyle   
and cater my portfolio more to me than just the ""cookie cutter"" portfolio    
I currently have with Chase??

Given the provincial and federal income tax rates, I believe I will be taking home ~$3,600, less $600 rent, $400 groceries, $200 gas, and $600 liquor/bars. This leaves a total of ~$1,800 left over each month to pay towards my goals.

First of all, my student debt is quite low, and carrying a friendly interest rate of 5.7% so I don't think it will take long to tackle that.

Secondly, I'm looking to acquire an economical, very reliable vehicle that will last me for the short-mid term, up to 5 years. My research has shown that I could expect to pay between $5-8k.

Finally (and once both 1 and 2 are paid in full) I intend on buying a place. As a first time home buyer, I'd like to minimize risk, and intend on doing so by buying a cheaper place. For example, a reasonable mobile home in a nice trailer park goes for about $30k in this small town I'm moving to. So to take out a ~$30k mortgage and move into a place that would finally stop my years of endless rent-paying is very attractive to me. I'd intend on renting out a bedroom as well for ~$500/month and I know that pad rental rates are about $300/month so renting would almost cancel that out. I'm convinced that being such a small investment ($30k), it's inherently lower risk, knowing that I could make payments easily and quickly.

If anyone could give me an objective opinion on how this looks, that would be great. Is this a reasonable plan? Am I moving too quickly? Too slowly?

I'm certain it's my father's, as I've had to address it in the past.  Last I heard (about 8 years ago), the lien was filed in 1996, when I was 12.  The bank can't give me any information about the lien they are looking at for some reason.  
On credit karma, I see my transunion score is 688, equifax is 723.  My only derogatory mark is a collections thing in Wyoming from 2010 that I didn't know about.  Which means the lien is probably only showing up on Experian.

I can't talk to the IRS.  In Colorado, no one is working phones and most of the offices have shut down.  Meaning there is no way to speak with any IRS employees directly without going to an office, the nearest one is over an hour away.  I've sat on hold for hours on the 'basic' IRS line, and been forced to give up.  Literally hours.  

I'm unsure where to start with this.  I can't seem to find it on any basic credit reports, but this isn't the first time I've ran into it.

personalfinance,How best to pay back these loans?,"Hi all, 

Like many other recent grads I have a ton of student debt.

I currently have four private loans all through the same provider: SallieMae.

Their totals and interest rates are as follows:

$22,000 - 9.375%

$18,000 - 8.250%

$17,000 - 9.250%

$16,000 - 8.250%

Now these were all made possible through a cosigner who makes significantly more money than I - I believe this affects the interest rates. Is there any way to get these interest rates adjusted to a more manageable amount for my income which is only 44k a year. I've tried SallieMae's support line - but they've been very unhelpful and I was wondering if anyone knew a process that exists that their support might be less likely to mention to me.

Thanks!

So first a bit of background.  A few years ago my wife and I were recovering after my position was cut at the company I worked for and we were both about to start new jobs making decent money again, nothing extravagant but it would put us back in a place where we weren't just paying bills and we could go back to overpaying on our debt to knock it out.  Before our insurance kicked in she got sick, back to back for separate issues within about a month, each needing surgery.  While our work was very flexible about accommodating the time we needed to help her recover the resulting medical debt was immense.  We spent a few months trying work with the various people sending us bills (why a surgery at a hospital is not just one bill to the hospital instead of one for every person you talk to still boggles my mind but I digress)  so that we could pay them back.  I have always lived with a very ""Lannister"" philosophy of always paying my debts, even if it means doing without or having to sell things to make sure I fulfill my obligations.  But they would not budge and several were already making it very clear that after 1 year if they were not paid that it was going to collections and on our credit regardless of us paying at least the minimum each month.  Long story short we ended up having to file bankruptcy.  I wasn't happy about it at the time and still have issues reconciling it but it really was the only option we had and either way our credit would have been ruined.

Fast forward to now, a little more than a year after the bankruptcy, we are still with the same company, restarted our savings, and generally doing well.  But the bankruptcy was a real wake up call for me, and really lit a fire to push my career further so I started looking into going back to school and found coding bootcamps.  I program nearly daily at work but I am entirely self taught and I realize that I need something to help take me to the next level.  After months of research I picked my bootcamp, took the tests, did the essays, and completed my interviews and was accepted.  Afterwards I went to apply for financing through Skillsfund which is one of their partners, for the $10,000 tuition.  Even after the bankruptcy my credit score is 685 and we have very little debt (one car payment and a bed that's on 0% interest).  I was approved, pending the addition of a co-signer.  

As I am sure everyone here is aware, everyone tells people to never cosign for anything so those that could help me won't and those that will have terrible credit.  It sucks because for over a decade I have never missed a payment on anything, and the only black mark I have is the bankruptcy but no one will help and Skillsfund wont make an exception on the bankruptcy = cosigner policy.  I have since checked with banks and other lending agencies and everything is the same.  The car I have paid of isn't enough collateral, I rent so no home to pull against, and even though I have more than enough money to cover even a moderately high interest rate loan payment each month there doesn't seem to be any option for me.  

I really want this to happen so I can get my wife and I into a more secure place, but saving $10,000 is going to take quite a while, and I would want to have more than that so we didn't have $0 left to fall back on.  Are there options that I haven't considered?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, but I understand if there's not much help to be given.

If you need any more info or need clarification on something just let me know and I'll answer and update the main post.

I also included a few questions to better understand the demographics of the Ethereum community. And to better compare this poll today to ones in the future. Obviously, this is a non-scientific poll. All answers except for Question 1 were randomized to not bias any specific answer.

I also tried very hard to make sure all the questions and answers were as neutral as possible.  I will also continue to do polling in the future with some of the same questions to measure values over time.

I imagine these are people looking into crypto or ETH, are temporarily on the sidelines, interested in the development but not quite involved... etc... Also, age groups are diverse and will be interesting to compare to future polls.

Heres the situation (from what I understand):  Several years ago she consolidated her student loans, or so she thought.  It turns out that she had only consolidated her Federal Loans and somehow her Private (Sallie Mae at the time) loans were not included, she had moved a couple times and because she assumed the loan was included in her consolidation she stopped paying Sallie Mae.  Somewhere in the process of changing addresses and/or phone numbers Sallie Mae lost the ability to contact her regarding the missing payments.  Fast forward a couple years later her ~$60,000 student loan has ballooned to close to $200k.  Since she was made aware of the situation she is making the minimum payments but lets be fair on a teachers paycheck she sees no way out.  

She has contacted a couple student loan consolidation companies regarding trying to renegotiate the amount and try to get it back down to the original balance but most of the places apparently dont handle private loans.

We did a cash out refinance to still have 20% equity in our home, received $57k after fees and our mortgage payment went up $31 a month. 

My questions is how to best use that $57k to restructure/payoff our debt. 

Between my wife and I, we have $67k in student loan debt, with $47k of that at a 6.55% interest rate. The rest is below 4%. Monthly payments for student loans total approximately $1200 a month. They are a mixture of 10 and 20 year loans with us being 6 year into paying them off. 

We have two car payments each with approximately $10k left with them being paid off in a year. Both car loans have 1.9% interest and have $570 a month payments.

So as far as I can see I have 3 options: 

I payoff the cars that frees up $1140 a month to put towards investments/paying off loans and leaves $37k to put towards student loans. 
I put all the money towards student loans and keep the car payments for another year.

personalfinance,Creative ways to finance a home renovation,"Reddit: I am in the process of purchasing a new home at a very low price for the neighborhood that needs some renovations (that will add square footage and increase appraised value). I am purchasing with a conventional mortgage but am self employed so I couldn't qualify for a Homestyle Reno loan or FHA 203k.

We are hoping to put about $100k into the home and will be able to cash flow about 30% of it but would like to hold on to cash if possible. I'm going to apply for a HELOC but will probably only get $20k with that.

I've also looked into personal loans (like one through Lightstream) and was approved for $40k with a 10% interest rate, but was wondering if any of you had any other ideas for financing?

Last resort would be credit cards which I have a couple with 11% interest and limits up to $50k which would definitely cover the cost.

personalfinance,Help with debt consolidation/payoff,"I have a ton of debt that I need to payoff. Debt is from past troubles to bad habits when I was younger. I'm married and my wife is debt-free. Together, we have gross income of about $125k (I bring in about $50k personally). Although she is willing to help me, I hate to put her in the position to use funds to pay this debt from pre-marriage. Here's where I'm at (note all are credit cards):

* Loan 1: $11,902 @ 0%
* Loan 2: $10,408.44 @ 16.24%
* Loan 3: $7,291.18 @ 5.99%

* Loan 6: $3,489.77 @ 0%

I also have student loans of about $20k left, but am currently consolidating them through the fed program at a low rate and low monthly payment ($150ish).

I cut up all of the cards except for 1 in the event of an emergency, but haven't used it in quite a while.

* Car: $330/month
* Utilities &amp; water: $300/month (I pay this full bill) 
* Cable/Internet: $145/month (I pay this full bill) 
* Cell phones: $150/month (we have 4 lines including children - this is my half of the bill)
* Insurance: $130/month (my half)
* Child support: $400/month (past marriage)
* Food: $200/month (my portion)
* Other random expenses: $250/month

I need some serious help and guidance to pay off these debts. I would love to be able to get a personal loan for $40k and throw $1k/month at it, but I'm guessing the interest rate would be too high for it to be worth it.

personalfinance,"125k in Student Loans, considering my options. I'm open to any suggestions.","Hey, 

I graduated last year from Full Sail University with a bachelors in Computer Animation. I currently owe roughly 100k in private and 25k in federal loans. Not having enough knowledge on loans when I starting college and I didn't do enough research. Bad planning on my part. The three private loans are 8-10% interest rates. All of which are currently in forbearance because I haven't found a good enough job to make 1k+ payments a month. I have six more months of forbearance left. I'm currently working part time as a librarian and once and while a freelance graphic artist. Meanwhile, I'm waiting to hear back from other positions I've applied for while living with my parents. I've been sending out my resume like its a flyer for cars. 

Fortunately, I recently had a second interview with a company for a position ""somewhat"" in my field and I'm waiting to hear back. Its a fairly big company and they're looking for someone to grow with them in the that position. However, the position would be paying roughly 16 dollars a hour so maybe around 28-30k annual total. While living with my parents I don't know if that will cut it and I'm looking for more options. 

I've considered joining the military, but I think that's my last resort near the end of my six month forbearance. Being a college grad I could go commissioned and have the chance to be an officer. I'd prefer Air Force because they're ""supposedly"" more education based, although, Army offers more assistance towards Federal Loan help. On top of that, I think I would have BAH and BAS after basic so I wouldn't be necessarily paying for my living expenses and I could use my pay check for majority of my loans. On top of that each branch has federal loan assistance so I could knock those out with my four years of service. Also, if I did do this, the devil, Sallie Mae would cap my interest at 6%, which would help. This option is a double edge sword because I'd be getting out when I'm 31, I have a slight issue with authority and taking orders but I might see the world some and get more disciplined? Hah...

personalfinance,Health care billing question,"I have been fighting with my insurance on this for so long that my bill has been sent to collections. 

Also, just turned 26 and this was coverage under my dads plan, so I am no longer a subscriber as of the beginning of this month. I now have a plan with a different company. 

Also, I have almost no money to my name. Simply paying these without a monthly plan is not an option. I'm a bit of a financial mess right now but I managed to get another job, and that should help. 

So, I need advice. 

Last year I had my annual physical which also included lab work. 

Since I did not know a. to go to a more ""insurance friendly"" lab than my hospital lab and b. that vitamin d tests aren't covered by my insurance I got a bill for $236.98. 

I called my insurance because I thought one physical a year was supposed to be 100% covered under the ACA and they keep throwing me ""yeah buts"" keep in mind, this was an in network hospital. 

The last time I called they told me I needed to prove that I didn't know vitamin d wasn't covered and they wanted to conference with my doctor to see if they'd gone over pricing. Seriously. 

I asked them how it was possible to prove that I did or didn't know about the costs and the guy was dumbstruck and couldn't give me an answer.  

I have always been told I'd be called back and I never am. 

Meanwhile my bill has been sent to a collection agency and my credit is fucked. 

My question is, since this was ordered during a physical and I was not briefed on healthcare costs and coverage is my insurance company responsible for this bill or am I? 

If I am responsible, how are collection agencies on negotiating monthly payments? 

I also have a similar problem where labs ordered around the same time from my OBGYN. I took the (none of us knowing it would be an issue) to the hospital lab. That bill is for $427.65 for glucose levels and a couple of other things (tl;dr I worked with both doctors to find out I have PCOS). I know it doesn't matter, but for almost $500 I let an intern draw my blood. That was covered 60%, leaving me with 40% of the bill. This was an in network hospital. 

Is there anyway to negotiate this bill with my insurance or am I stuck with the hospital (who is making me jump through hoops to verify my income to lower the bill). 

I've tried to release information from my insurance to my dad so he can call and try to help (he's the subscriber) but they NEVER send me the paperwork. 

Thank for the advice! 

TL;DR: insurance refuses to 100% cover blood tests  from physical because I didn't get them at an ""insurance friendly"" lab and apparently they don't cover vitamin d screening. (I don't know what the doctor ordered I just went to the lab). And is there any way I can get them to look at that $430 bill from the other hospital for a ""non friendly"" lab?

personalfinance,Personal loan from parents instead of a mortgage?,"This is borderline personal finance and legal advice, so I may post in both locations.

My wife and I are thinking of purchasing a new home as we have a growing family and need more room. We've been in our current home for a decade with a traditional mortgage. This time around, one of our parents have offered to give us a personal loan at a lower interest rate than we could get with a traditional mortgage. It most certainly would be a loan, not a gift, and we'd have a contract drawn up by a lawyer with a standard amortization schedule, etc.

There is no issue with obtaining a new mortgage. We have plenty of funds to use as a down payment, in addition to the equity in our existing home. Both of our credit scores are excellent (800+). It's truly a matter of this parent wanting to help us by offering a significantly lower interest rate.

I'm wondering if this is a good idea to consider or not. What sorts of pitfalls might we run into? If we went this route, could we still deduct the interest we pay on the loan, similar to a mortgage? The parent is in retirement age (65+), if they were to pass before the loan was repaid, would the contract still be valid or would we have to immediately pay back the amount in full to the estate?

With significant savings on the table over the course of 20-30 years, I'm trying to do my due diligence and consider why NOT to proceed down this path. Any thoughts /r/personalfinance?",finance,1466718064

I had consolidated my loans about a year ago after graduating and my interest rate is crazy high- I wanted to see what I can do to better my situation.  Please advise!  Here’s the situation:
I had a bunch of small and medium sized loans under my dad’s name as parent plus loans.  My mom said it would be better if we consolidated it, so we did. The problem is my dad can’t pay for this loan, the interest rate is 7.750% and every 31 days the interest amount is around $570.  I have been paying for it, but I have recently been laid off.  In addition to that, when we originally consolidated the loans, Great Lakes (my dad’s loan servicer) forgot to add one loan to the consolidation process so they had added it 2 months later after the consolidation process.  Adding that loan increased my Accrued Interest and for the past year (while I was still employed) I have been making payments to the accrued interest- not even denting the principal amount which is now around $87k.  I have around $930 left in the accrued interest before I can make a dent in the principal amount and that’s only if I pay more than $570 every 31 days.  I have been dipping into my savings that I have saved up since my layoff and it feels like there is nothing I can do at this point to make it any better.  Since its all under my dad’s name, me being unemployed doesn’t change the status of the fact that I have to continue repaying the loan otherwise it would ruin my dad’s credit.
Is there any way to lower the interest rate? Or is there a way to put this consolidated loan under my name? If that’s possible is that even a good idea?  What is the best financial solution for this case? Can someone please advise!

Due to circumstance, I am still home.

I had grad school on my mind despite this, but I decided to sign up for 2nd degree in comp sci at my old school. I don't know if this is a great decision on paper, but I know that at 60 credits, my local state school cost will be around 20k in 5 semesters of straight course work. this can become more expensive by another 2-3k if I take the offer later on in coursework to get a masters in comp sci instead.

 I do, however, qualify for 15 months of DEA/chapter 35. However, the catch there is that the money for it is awarded monthly during school time based on course load. This can be between 1k~ or 760~ USD per month that can be put toward school expenses. However, the offer goes away in 2020. Because of this, there may be a possibility of having to take out loans (preferably federal) and immediately repaying them starting with any that can accrue during school time.

However, this number does not include housing (which is something I will likely need because I live 2-3 hours away and any vehicle I have access to is not reliable enough to make such a trip regularly. I should note I have no intention of staying on-campus because housing expenses are quite a bit more there than off-campus, and the deadline to apply has passed anyway) or books. I would postpone the process of going to college for a few years but a few things worry me about that: Firstly, I have earned a scholarship which would cover roughly half of my tuition over four years and from my understanding the scholarship would not be available if I didn't start college ASAP. Second, I have completed an A.A. degree program while in high school, taking mostly classes which would transfer/apply to my chosen area of study (psychology) and I am worried that if I were to postpone the process of going to college that the classes would not necessarily transfer as easily, furthering my financial burden later.

As it stands right now, neither my mother nor my father are expected to contribute much toward my tuition. I am still waiting on financial aid because I had to go through a federal review process (from what I understood they wanted to verify that the information I gave was correct, I cited around $10,000 per year for a family of 6 in a single parent household-which is true) but I do not know what to expect to get given that the process is taking so long, and I expect most financial aid available has already been allocated for the most part to other students.

To make a long story short, I am not sure whether I should:
1. Attempt to go to college given the circumstances. I do not currently have a job but am hoping to get one by the beginning of July, and saving literally every penny until late August, and continue working while in college (I don't know how maintainable that lifestyle would be, I've never had a job which I regret entirely. I wish I had personally started saving earlier).
2. Postpone going to University at risk of losing a scholarship and easily transferable credits from an A.A. degree earned while in high school.

Tl;dr: Didn't save any money for college- no expected parental contributions and dubious amounts of financial aid, if any. Could postpone going to college at risk of scholarship and easily transferable credits already earned. Could also attempt to work while going to college, but I don't know how likely that is to maintain, especially starting so late in the process

personalfinance,Advice on what to do about my financed car.,"Background: Back in November, I got a ""new"" car. The car I traded it in for was an absolute mess and would've ended up killing me or someone else once it started to rain more often (I already slid around every time it rained). 

I ended up with a 25% interest rate on a 60 month loan. I still owe about $9300 on my loan, which is about $3K more than it's worth.

Currently, with all my bills and debts, I have zero savings. I'm paying $300/month for insurance with the bare legal minimum in California (that my loan allows). 

I pay more for my car payment and insurance every month than my rent, and I live in one of the most expensive states, in one of the most expensive areas. I feel like I'm drowning and I've started having panic attacks at work because if anything happens - anything at all - I'm screwed. I have nothing to fall back on.

personalfinance,"Thoughts on refinancing with Guaranteed Rate? or, Should I refinance?","I got an solicitation to refinance my mortgage with this company called Guaranteed Rate.  According to the guy I've been emailing with, it costs $3000 in closing costs.  The rate is better than my current rate, which I didn't even realize was possible.  This seems too good to be true, so of course my BS alarm is ringing.  

I've never heard of this company, but they seem to be a real company.  Has anyone dealt with them at all?  I've never refinanced before, so I don't know if this is reasonable or not.  

Here's the details on the closing:

* Lender fee - $1190
* Appraisal fee - $450
* Title fee - $588
* Title insurance - $615
* Recording fee - $115

Total = $2958

And here's a comparison of the new mortgage in comparison to my current mortgage:

  | Current | Refinance
---|---|----
Loan type | 7/1 ARM | 7/1 ARM
Initial rate | 3% | 2.625%
Max year-over-year adjustment | 2% | 2%
Max lifetime adjustment | 6% | 5%
Payment (monthly) | $2799 | $2550
Overall cost of mortgage (with overpayment) | $952,054 | $925,827
(The overall cost makes the assumption that interest rates are constant. Obviously they won't be constant over the 30-year loan, but the two loans would adjust the same amount, and the new loan has a lower maximum).  

I'm 2 years into my current mortgage, so it's not set to adjust for another 5 years.  

I also always overpay on my mortgage.  Right now, I'm putting an extra $300 per month, which goes straight to principle.  By refinancing, I could keep my payment the same, and overpay by $450 every month.  

I think it will take me 20 months to break even on the refinance, right?  But it also extends the fixed interest rate for 2 more years more than what I currently have.

personalfinance,Are these sensible ETFs?,"I've been a lazy investor so far. I had some monthly savings going into various bonds and stock funds over a few years now. Didn't pay much attention to those. They don't have huge yearly expenses but aren't not cheap either. All are between 0.5 % and 1.1 %. They are also a bit light on the stocks as there was uncertainty on the Chinese market back then and I was thinking I'd focus more on the stocks during the next downturn. (I have since read that trying to time the market is stupid...) 

Anyways, I found out about the Nordnet bank that operates in the Nordic countries (I'm finnish) and offers rather low expense funds. Also some money has accumulated on my bank account so I'm now looking to invest it in some of those new low cost ETFs from Nordnet. My question would be, are these sensible choices?

For stocks I found the following:

- DXET (euro stocks, 0.09% TER)
- EUNL (world stocks, 0.20% TER)
- SXR8 (USA S&amp;P 500, 0.07% TER)
- IS3N (Developing world stocks, 0.25% TER)
- Super fund Finland (no costs at all for Finnish Nordnet customers, follows the Helsinki stock exchange 25 index)

Also for bonds:

- ISOX (or is it IS0X not sure, world corporate bonds, 0.20% TER) 

I chose the above funds because Nordnet allows monthly savings into them with no buying fee. (Is that the correct term? In finnish it would be ""merkintäpalkkio"".) Here is the list of funds that do not have this buying fee for monthly savings: https://www.nordnet.fi/etf/newspdf?id=5342

(It is in finnish, but the annual costs and fund names should still make sense, also osinko = dividend, kasvu = growth, epäsäännöllinen = irregular)

I'm 36 years old. Also I own about two thirds of my own home already and have a nice low interest rate of 0.4% on the housing loan currently so no hurry to pay that back. Currently about two thirds of my money is sitting on bank accounts with the rest on the old bank's funds. 

I'm thinking of keeping the funds I already own in the old bank while taking another third of the money from the bank accounts and putting it into these Nordnet funds. Since the old bank funds are currently about 30% stocks and rest bonds, I am thinking Nordnet should be the other way around with 70% in stocks split evenly among the stock ETFs listed above. While the rest goes to this ISOX. And I would also set up a monthly saving plan in the same ratio to accumulate these in the future.

Does this seem like a sensible plan? Is that ISOX alone a safe place to put my bonds investments or should I seek out sovereign bonds ETFs as well? Or should I put more or even all the Nordnet money into stocks since I already have a good amount of bonds in the old bank?",finance,1466778126

1. Completely pay off the discover card.

2. Make the same payment I would've made on my discover but do it for my Visa instead then transfer the discovers balance onto the Visa.

We did a cash out refinance to still have 20% equity in our home, received $57k after fees and our mortgage payment went up $31 a month. 

My questions is how to best use that $57k to restructure/payoff our debt. 

Between my wife and I, we have $67k in student loan debt, with $47k of that at a 6.55% interest rate. The rest is below 4%. Monthly payments for student loans total approximately $1200 a month. They are a mixture of 10 and 20 year loans with us being 6 year into paying them off. 

We have two car payments each with approximately $10k left with them being paid off in a year. Both car loans have 1.9% interest and have $570 a month payments. 

I am torn between maximizing monthly cash flow and getting rid of higher interest student loans whose payments seem to be all interest in my eyes. 

So as far as I can see I have 3 options: 

I payoff the cars that frees up $1140 a month to put towards investments/paying off loans and leaves $37k to put towards student loans. 
I put all the money towards student loans and keep the car payments for another year. 
I pay off one car and put the remainder towards the student loans.

So, I am to the point where I need some advices (my bank is pretty poor for that) about my situation.

- Income : 4 700

- Rent : 1 000
- Loan : 190 (15 months to go)
- Car lease : 260 (2 months to go)
- Tax : 1000 (yey)
- Other outcomes : approx 200

I paid neary all my loans, there is just something like 3000 to be paid which is quite a good new. In 2 months my car lease will end and I need a bigger car. All that was proposed by the car seller is too expensive for me so I will go a used car as I think this is the best option.

I have currently in savings (thanks to a good bonus last year):
- 3K on an account
- 4500 of savings in funds (monetary, and specific actions funds, quite well performing) 
- 3000 of silly investment in stocks and bitcoins done in the past (poor performance of stocks, quite well performing in bitcoins)

I save approx. 500 a month. 

I am considering selling the stocks, coins, buying an used car (which would cost something like 15000), so it would add another loan, but I am wondering if I should first pay off the current loan (5.4 % interest rate), or use my cash as an advance to the new loan (proposed at 4%), or any other option... 

What would you do ?

My goal is to save for future investment and security and freedom (especially because I am studying a new field with less paying job and my situation can change)...

*$160 on a 7.4% student loan for 10 year repayment
*$70 cell phone

*$45 medications
*$70 car insurance 

*Rent* is $700... will only be paying another $700 for the month of July, lease ends in August and will be getting security deposit back of $700

*Savings* Money market of $4000

**Credit card**

Currently hold no credit card debt. I have a $3500 credit card limit, and I would be putting $3000 on the credit card to pay for the class. Monthly payment is $60, interest rate of 8.45% (ballpark, I know it's like 8 and change).

**Personal loan**

Personal loan of $3000 at 12% for 36 months, roughly $100 a month to pay back. 

**Question** What is the best option for me? The personal loan OR the credit card? I'm leaning towards the personal loan, since I will have the credit card as a backup if something happens since I will essentially be wiping out my money market savings. I would like to put $1000 on the credit card, $2500 in cash, and $2500 from the personal loan towards this program. The leftover $500 from the personal loan I would just pay back into the loan.

If anyone has any improvement suggestions, please let me know.


&gt;I would like to submit my opposition to the proposed update of Rule 41 of the Federal Rules Criminal Procedure.

&gt;This proposal contains sweeping threats to the 4th Amendment as well as other rights entitled to U.S. citizens. The content states:

&gt;""...a magistrate judge with authority in any district where activities related to a crime may have occurred  has  authority  to  issue  a  warrant  to  use remote access to search electronic storage media and to seize or copy electronically stored information located within or outside that district...""

&gt;In addition to previous conditions, this amendment allows this warrant to be written if the data has been secured in any way ranging from encryption to virtual private networks (VPNs) and more. This concept is similar to allowing police to search your house simply if you have locked your door. Encryption and VPNs are the backbone of online security used for everything from banking to protecting private information, so this impacts countless users.

&gt;Also, VPNs and other privacy services such as Tor work through a complex connection of multiple computers. As such, the amendment implies that every computer part of that network can be searched with a single warrant. Many Americans generously donate computer resources to strengthen this network but they will soon have their privacy invaded if one of the hundreds of computers that pass through the network is suspected of criminal involvement.

&gt;This power is granted to over 550 part and full-time magistrate judges, which provides ample opportunity for abuse of power and risks the integrity of core security systems.

&gt;Lastly, this proposal harms those who are unknowing victims of a botnet. A botnet is a network of computers that have been infected by a virus or malware. The host computer (who released the virus) can use system resources of victim computers for malicious purposes. Unfortunately, most victims do not know that they are infected and carry on with their normal activities. However, Rule 41 grants the 550 judges authority to search computers suspected of being botnet victims. This simply adds insult to injury by violating the privacy of those already harmed. Due to the numerous victims per botnet, this rule is unnecessary as one would expect a portion of the infected to willingly agree to a search in the hope that their computer will be safe again.

&gt;The proposed update of Rule 41 of the Federal Rules Criminal Procedure violates the privacy of a large portion of Americans and adds considerable risk to digital security itself. As such, I urge you to fight against this amendment.

My question is whether I should build one now, as I have no debt and still another year or two until I am working full time, or should I use that money to pour into an IRA?

personalfinance,Help me PF! Thorny question about where to put $75K. (Financial idiot here.),"Hey PF,

Long time lurker. Created a throwaway since I'm sort of embarrassed about where I landed myself.

I'm 45 and a long-time creative worker in NYC. My income has always been spotty and uncertain, so I've kind of socked away what I could in work-related 401Ks ($80K now) and kept debt minimal ($6K in grad school loans).

But suddenly things started going pretty well. Who expects that? The $$ started piling up there and I just sort of let it, first as an emergency fund, then as a possible down payment for a house. I've got $6K in a separate emergency fund, and $75K in checking. Yup. In checking. 

I finally decided I didn't want to buy an apartment here. Many threads in PF convinced me that if a house in my range would make me miserable, add to my commute, or be a burden if I needed to move, it wasn't a good investment. So I've given up on that. I'm in a rent-stabilized spot that I love, so I'll stay there.

But holy crud. Now I have to make grown-up decisions about what to do with the cash. HELP!

I think I'm following the rules. I have my 401K match maxed at work, and amped up to where I'm almost making the $18K tax free annual contribution. 

I would just sock everything into an IRA, but my work is very uncertain. I worry that I could get fired tomorrow, and need my fat cushion. And in terms of financial goals, I have a fantasy of taking a year or two off to write a book, sooner than later.

What's smartest for me to do with that $75K? Most of it in an IRA? Some of it in like a Vanguard index fund? Gold? Magic beans? 

There is a husband, but he's also a happy creative worker who pretty much just manages to keep himself fed and pays some of the rent. I know I should be saving for both of us for retirement, though he is convinced he will just work until he drops. (Wouldn't surprise me.)

personalfinance,Car Buying Tips From a Semi-Professional Automotive Buyer,"Background: I've worked in Purchasing/Supply Chain my whole career and I've gotten very good at negotiating.  I started my own business three years ago buying cars for people on the side.  It was great because dealerships are open late and on the weekends so I could keep my regular job.

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: My business works thusly: My clients tell me what they would like to buy (make, model, year, mileage range, or a description of capabilities), I find cars for them, and get them the best offer.  They also tell me HOW they would like to buy the car (buy/rent/lease/tradein/whatever).  I do not claim expertise on any of these things.  This post will focus on NEGOTIATION TIPS.  Do not think that this is a guide to get you through the car buying process from soup to nuts.  Not even close to that.  I don't claim to know the arguments of lease/buy.  You'll have to see other posts for that.  Sorry for ANY confusion on that topic.

This post does NOT address used vs new or lease vs buy because I am NOT experienced enough on those things to talk about them!  My strength lies strictly in finding cars and negotiating the best offer for my client.  These are NEGOTIATION tips.

Here's my advice:

1: Get multiple quotes on comparable vehicles/the same vehicle (if new) from multiple dealerships.  Always try to get as close to apples to apples as you can.  This does two things: Gives you leverage and also gives you a better sense of where the market is at.

2: THIS is probably most important.  DO NOT GO IN to the dealership until you have a price and a warranty under which you are willing to buy the car if it's in good condition.  They use all sorts of manipulation tactics that ONLY work in person.  I won't even go into them because they only work in person.  So just DON'T go in until you are ready to buy the car at the price and warranty you've been given.  They'll ALWAYS try to bring you in for a test drive and pressure you.  A seasoned buyer won't be affected, but the best way for you (or anyone) to avoid this nonsense is to simply not give them the opportunity.

Make it very clear that you will only walk in the door after negotiations have ended.  You can even lure them by assuring them that if the price is right, you'll go in, test drive the car, and leave with it that day if it's to your satisfaction.

3: Don't pretend to find things wrong with the car to negotiate.  *If there's something wrong, tell them to fix it and you'll come back.*  If there's not anything wrong, *don't make it up.*  Particularly if you're buying under warranty.  Because then you'll just look like a fucking sucker.  Think of it this way: If you're getting a warranty it is in their best interest to ensure your car is in tip top shape.  Because any problems with it when it leaves the lot are really THEIR problem; not yours.  Depending on the comprehensiveness of the warranty, obviously.

Basically, making up shit about the car is a very predictable strategy that people try.  It's only effective at making you look like a damn fool.  You shouldn't have to ""trick"" them into your price.  There's nothing wrong with saying ""This is what I'm willing to spend.""  Nothing shameful about that.  So don't waste their time and your time with bullshit.

4: Quote ladder.  This is an age old tactic in Procurement that is sort of like the crossbow of buying.  In that even a peasant can be trained to use it pretty effectively with very little effort.  Remember those quotes you got before?  You're going to show the person with the highest quote, your lowest quote and tell them to beat it.  If they do, you're going to take THAT quote to your NEW highest quoter and tell them to beat that.  And just keep doing that until you don't get anything else.  Try to get the mileage and year to be as close to identical as you can so they can't weasel around and make it very clear that if they do not beat the quote, you won't be considering them any further.  It lacks nuance, but for someone who's buying their first car, it can save them a lot of money.

5: Don't trust the finance office.  If their interest rate seems high, challenge them.  Do not buy ANY of the extra shit they offer you.  I'm serious.  Anything.  The sale is not over until it is OVER.  If they keep trying to sell you horseshit, threaten to leave.  The finance manager is in a predicament because if he blows a sale, he's going to have a very angry salesman hollering at him.  They typically back down pretty quick in my experience.

6: If you're making a downpayment try to make it on your credit card.  Gets you points and cash back in many cases.  Certainly did in mine. If you've got to write a check it may as well be to your credit card company.  Obviously only make the down payment if you're not going to have to pay interest on it.

7: Negotiate trade-ins at the end.  Don't let them know you have one til after you arrive at a price.  And better yet, look into selling your car on your own.  You'll usually be able to get a better price.  But there's something to be said for the convenience of ""I'll give you my car if you knock off three grand.""  Just know the value of your car and subtract an estimation of the value you place on the time you'd have to invest to sell it.  If you can get another five hundred bucks but it'll take you eighty hours of effort over the course of months to sell it, maybe you just take the dealer's offer?

To end, I hope these tips are helpful.  They've helped me in my work.  I don't claim to be an expert and I had to learn each of these the hard way at some point or another.",finance,1466827177

I just graduated from college this May, and I was just recently offered a job with a salary of 65,000 a year and full benefits package, great. That will probably begin in the next couple weeks.

Like any recent graduate, the weight of student loans is heavy on my shoulders and I'd like put together a proper plan of attack and get on top of this before it gets on top of me. 

A little about myself; I am engaged with a 2 year old daughter. We currently live with my parents. We both work, and have been saving as much as possible. My parents are awesome, and don't require us to pay rent or anything, but we try to help out whenever we can (housework, groceries, etc.). Thanks to my parents, I currently do not have any monthly bills. I've paid off my car already, and have been saving as much as possible for a house, wedding, etc. 

Current financial status:

Account 1: Checking - $10,025.75   Savings (Money Maker) - $10,938.10

Account 2: Checking - $1,290.44 - Money no longer goes into, or comes out of this account. It is just sitting there collecting dust, perhaps I should invest it?

Account 3: Retirement Fund - ~$2,000 or so I believe. I worked many years during HS and part of college for the town that I live in and was able to put aside some money in their retirement plan. 

Fiance status: I want to say she has around $17,000 saved up herself.

I currently have a Direct Stafford loan of $21,491 (interest rate 5.160%) and a Grad Plus loan of $28,810 (interest rate 6.960%). I have no issues paying the minimum monthly payment and I'll be hitting my emergency fund goal ($12,000) next month, which is in a money market with a 1% APY. I have no other debt other than my student loans (credit cards have always been in good standing). I also have a 403b that I have been contributing to with no employer matching, and I have about 3.5k saved up there as well. I'm considering adding a Roth IRA to my portfolio eventually, but after I pay off my aforementioned loans.

I plan on paying off my loans by aggressively attacking the Grad Plus loan first (paying around $1400 extra a month on top of the minimum payment). I recently found out that I can pay for my loans via credit card and I'm interested in applying for the Southwest credit card (premier and plus) to earn the companion pass to rack up points with my usual expenditures and my student loan payments.

However, I've been advised by one of my finance savvy friends to forgo that plan and just re-finance my student loans with Earnest for a lower interest rate in the 2-3% range and pay my loans the old-fashioned way (no credit card payments) and pay my loans off. I was planning on paying the entirety of my loans off by early 2018 with my original plan.

A little back story, I have just graduated a private college with a degree in the medical field. The tuition was high, and I took out extra loans (grad plus loans) to compensate living expenses. I currently have $269,000 in federal loans with interest rates between 6% and 7%. I know that's crazy, but I have been offered a job starting at $127,000 per year. By the end of this summer, the only debt I will have will be the student loans and my house, which is at 6.35%, but I plan on refinancing once I start my job. 

This huge student loan is pretty daunting, and I want to pay it off quickly.  My goal is &lt; 7 years.  I've talked to several other people who work in the same position that I will be in, and they went on the same school, so about the same amount of debt, but they laugh at me when I tell them this.

Even after 30% taxes and 5% to 401k (that's my max), I could pay $4,000 per month to the loan and still be left with around $2,700. House payment is currently $800.

2 220k this is where my wife and I live ~4% and 200k removes PMI. Mortgage is $1550.

I was curious if it'd be a good idea to pump money into the rental house to try to get rid of PMI or if money would  be better placed elsewhere. Really trying to turn around some bad/late decisions and prep for my family.

personalfinance,How do I invest such that any return on investments stays ahead of potential future inflation raises.,"Please forgive such a very ignorant question since I don't really understand how this works.

My question is about staying ahead of inflation. I have been listening to podcasts on investing and someone had mentioned that you need to calculate your ROI such that it stays ahead of inflation which makes sense. What I don't understand is how exactly does one go about doing that? 

Obviously it would have to be something that is higher than the current rate of inflation but how do you know if that such a rate will not change in the future and how do investors account for a rise in interest rates when locking in an investment with the the best ROI related to this particular factor of staying ahead of inflation?

Frankly it's stressing me out but I also tend to overthink.

Due to parent's divorce happening soon after entering college (partially due to money reasons) and the rocky situation that followed financially for both parents until the proceedings were over, I am in the situation where virtually all of my tuition and living expenses were forced to be covered by loans. I do not want to be criticized on this point, as my mother assists where she can (car insurance and phone bill, which I plan to assume once I graduate to ease the burden) and I have a strained relationship with my father who has repeatedly insisted he is unable/refused to help with college expenses. This summer I am living at home to save as much internship salary as I can, however I am uncertain what the total will be. This will help lessen my loan burden next year, but I would like to stick some into savings although I am unsure how much.

I am guessing (will not be sure of total amount for a few weeks) that I will have roughly $45,000 in private loans (Texas CAL) and $30,000 in Federal loans. The Federal loans are a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized.

What can I do now to get a better grip on the situation and lessen some of the stress? I don't exactly have any job offers as its way too early for that, but I also cannot guarantee any offers once career fair rolls around either. Can I do much of anything right now to prepare? I've read about consolidating loans but that it's not helpful. I'm not sure if its possible to develop any sort of plan but I figure this sub will be able to give some advice on how to prepare/tips and strategies once the time to pay up comes due.

personalfinance,Advice for a messed up human being,"Need advice. Here's my story. My life was sort of messed up and I had a terrible phase of life when all this happened. Pls. do not judge. The details here are to the best of my knowledge.

I am not an American citizen but was here till 2009 on a Work visa. During that time, I purchased a car by taking an auto loan and have two(or more) credit cards. I had to go back home due to some family emergency. Due to family problem back home, I had to stay and couldn't return. A month after leaving US, I contacted the bank and asked them to take back the car. They took possession of the car and auctioned it. They warned me that if they do I would get minimal amount for the car. Since there is no way I could pay the debts, I agreed to it. To my knowledge, I should be in the range of $10k-20k. I am not even sure how much the actual amount is. All this happened prior to May 2009.

From 2009 till today, I am still back home and hadn't returned to U.S. My circumstances are improved now and I am now thinking of applying for a visa and working in the U.S. I would eventually want to settle down in U.S and become a citizen.

I checked my credit report today on AnnualCreditReport. The following is the status:

I found the following potentially negative items.

* 1. Civil claim judgment against me filed in May 2011 to the amount: $2355
* 2. Write off by a bank on credit card. Balance and write off amount was $4000 as of August 2011.
* 3. Write off by the same bank on Auto loan. Balance and write off amount was $2500 as of August 2011. (I thought my auto loan was much higher, but the credit report says the write amount was only $2500. Is this the amount I'm due?)

In the Account Reviews section, I see that several debt collection agencies (I assume judging by the names) made inquiries in my credit report. The inquiries started in 2014, several in 2015 and a couple in 2016. I dont know why so many of them are trying to access my credit report.

I did some reading on the internet about debts, credit report, statute of limitations etc. I have some questions and appreciate any sort of information that I can get to get my life back on track. As I said, I am planning to come back to the U.S next year.

My Questions.

* 1. The statute of limitations has expired for all the debts (My debts are only credit card and auto). Can the debt collectors still contact me about these debts? Am I obligated to pay them?
* 2. How can debt collectors contact me when I return? Is it based on the info in the credit report? What If I don't pick up their calls. Will they contact my employer?
* 3. The judgment amount needs to be paid eventually, right? I also assume that the amount mentioned in the credit report is excluding the interest accrued since then. What could be the interest rate?
* 4. Also, while checking the credit report, I gave my last stayed address and the credit report made it current. Will the debt collectors try to contact that address?
* 5. Also, there's only one judgment. Why didn't the debt collectors get judgment for my other debts?
* 6. How would I know the total debts that I owe? The credit report shows only one judgment. Does that mean the rest of them expired because of statue of limitaions?

personalfinance,How can I cover more of my student expenses while avoiding private loans?,"Hello,

So a quick summary of my situation:

I'm a 23 year old independent student going to college this Fall. I've been working in less-than-stellar fields and am ready to take the plunge to better myself so I can move on to better things. I'm currently enrolled in community college and have been for the past 2 years. I have about 2.5 years left in school (including one summer for an internship) before obtaining my bachelor's degree.

My calculated costs (including food, housing, gas, tuition, fees, and all of the rest) comes out to about $21,000 for the Fall/Spring. I chose an off-campus housing option, as it is less expensive than on-campus housing (almost $2,000 less for the full year). 

My parents are not helping me with any of the school, due to them not having the financial ability to do so. I joined the US Navy a couple of years ago in hopes of obtaining the GI Bill and having most of my college paid for, but I ended up receiving a medical discharge in recruit training. Therefore I do not qualify for any of the benefits that one would normally receive. I did, however, manage to qualify as an independent student and qualify for need-based aid.

So I received my financial aid award on Friday afternoon. I was given $7,000 in Federal unsubsidized loans and $5,500 in Federal subsidized loans. This is for the entire year. That means I'm almost $9,000 short for the year.

I have applied for grants and a plethora of scholarships, both through my university and through other sources, but have not heard about any of them. I also plan on doing work-study to help pay for expenses. I also project myself having roughly $5,000 - $6,000 in savings by the time I leave for school. I looked up private loans, but that is a slippery slope that I would like to avoid if possible. The advice that seems most common is to max out federal loans before looking at private loans.

So I guess here are my questions:

1. Is it possible to ask my school, or ask the government for more federal subsidized loans? I've never used any of the loans before, so I should still qualify for the full course. I shouldn't even max them out at all before I graduate if I can manage a few scholarships. I've been working full-time and paying out of pocket for the community college.

2. If I do have to go with private loans, what would be the least terrible place to obtain them? I bank with Navy Federal Credit Union, and I think they offer student loans. Would that be a good source, or should I look into places like Sallie Mae?

3. I am familiar with the repayment programs for the Federal loans, but not with private loans. I'm not too worried about finding work placement when I graduate, as Computer Science is a booming field and I found that I have a knack for it, but I want to make sure I can keep my head above water.

4. I've never been in debt before. Do student loans hurt your credit score?

5. Anyone who has done a Computer Science internship, were you compensated for housing and expenses while you were there? Or was the pay you received expected to cover all of that?

Thank you all.",finance,1466890390

investing,Japanese Public Debt more like Portugal than Greece: What's the move?,"&gt; As seen in the chart below, decades of government borrowing and essentially no change in nominal GDP caused the country’s gross debt to rise to 250 percent of GDP in 2015. Among advanced economies, the next highest debt level is Greece (197 percent), followed by Portugal (128 percent). This very high debt level means that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates on government debt would cause the share of taxes required to pay interest on the debt to rise by an amount equal to 2.5 percent of GDP. 

&gt; Fortunately, the situation is not so dire since the government earns income from its asset holdings, making net debt a more appropriate measure of the tax burden. The Japanese government owns equity shares, has deposits in banks, and holds the country’s foreign exchange reserves ($1.2 trillion as of April 2016). This last entry is somewhat unique, as most advanced economies put their foreign exchange reserves on the central bank’s balance sheet. In addition, a substantial amount of government debt is held by other parts of the government. Together, these assets produce a net debt of 126 percent of GDP. [By comparison, Greece has net debt equal to 194 percent of GDP while Portugal has net debt equal to 121 percent.](http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2016/06/the-rapidly-changing-nature-of-japans-public-debt.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+LibertyStreetEconomics+%28Liberty+Street+Economics%29#.V28fQMH6vy6)

I've been reading the sidebar guide for the step-wise what to tackle first, and I'm mostly through the beginning parts- budget, rent, groceries, essentials, health care, minimum payments on loans, non essential bills, emergency fund are all squared away. I'm at the point where I do have a bit left over that I can use for the following steps. 



According to the guide, it seems like the current best plan of attack now should be to just throw everything I have into the student loans until they're paid off, while ignoring my 401k since they aren't going to match me. However, I've been having heated discussions with my father (whom I still like to confide in since he is more financially knowledgeable than I am) about this, and he's against me doing this. He says that a better approach would be to still pay off the student loan BUT split at least some of my extra income into the 401k, even though they won't match me for a few reasons. 1. To save money on income tax and 2. To at least have an investment which can grow over the 5-10 years I'll be paying off the student loans. 



I tried to go with the reasoning that any extra money put into the loan is a basically guaranteed return on percentage of the interest rate, but I do not have the adequate financial knowledge to compare that ""gain"" to the amount that might be gained in the long run due to less income tax via 401k non matched contributions combined with whatever the 401k return might be over time. My father also brought up that the 6.8% interest return on the student loan would not be as much as I reach the later terms of the loan because as the capital goes down, the amount I pay in interest also goes down (and therefore so does my ""gain"" from paying off the loan faster).

personalfinance,(x-posted from r/investing) Can anyone explain what a Corporate Investment Grade bond is?,"So I have $1000 to play around with and rather than letting it sit in some savings account or risk a volatile stock market, I looked into Vanguard CDs and bonds. I was surprised to see ""Corporate Investment Grade"" bonds having such high interest rates, with a one-year rate of 1.98%.


I clicked on the 1.98% and Vanguard showed me 53 different corporate bond choices with all this complicated information I had no idea what it means. I also have no idea how to actually purchase a corporate investment bond through Vanguard, how I actually make money, and, most of all, is it worth doing?


So first, can anyone explain what a corporate bond is and what all this information means: 

Qty bid ask 

Min. qty bid ask 

Maturity Coupon (with a date and a number) 

Price bid ask 

Yield to worst bid ask 

Yield to maturity bid ask



Second, does this mean if I randomly choose one of these corporate bonds, in a year's time, I'll get 1.98% interest back plus principle?


Third, is this a dumb idea? What are the pros and cons here and should I just leave my money in a savings account or a 1-year CD?",finance,1466964980
personalfinance,"Need advice from the Reddit Gurus: Put additional money solely towards my student loan debt, or pay the minimum and invest the rest?","###**General Information**
To start off, I lurked in here for years and I am just finally getting around to voicing up and asking for advice with finances -outside of the family of course.  I budget pretty well since I have been working a variety of crappy jobs across the board since I was 14, 24 years old now, and know the value of a dollar.  

After all my expenses and taxes I have $1000/month extra which is put in a separate account from my budgeted living account that I do not touch (advice found on this subreddit).  That separate account is also my emergency fund which stands at $9000 - 5 months of living expenses.  

- I have no credit card debt.  Everything I spend on my cards, I pay off at the end of every month so I don't accrue interest.  These bills in full are included in my budget. 

- I also contribute 9% of my post taxed salary to a Roth IRA and my employer puts in an additional 4% into a 401k and both invested in the same portfolio offered through my company (56% domestic stock 36% foreign stock 1% bonds 6% short-term, 1% other).  I am young so I wanted a little higher risk investment - this plan with gradually shift to more bonds as I age. I have my personal investing account with just over $2000, however, I am currently not investing additional in the account because I was building up my emergency fund. 

- Personal.finance also pointed out to plan for big expenses in my future.  I want to propose to my long time girl friend in the next year or so.  Also on my list is to purchase a *new* used car, however, this won't be for around a year or so as well.  I own my current car outright, however, miles is at 135K so that is why I am planning to get one when it hits around 150-160K.  I will be adding $500 of my extra $1000/month towards those future purchases.  

- Pay raises in the future will be put straight to my company Roth until I hit the maximum amount, then I will add the remaining to my 401K.  Paycheck to Paycheck it is a relatively small amount and I don't want to think I can spend more than my current budget. 

- I have $8100 debt left in student loans with a minimum payment of $80 (already included in my budget).  Since I have always had a job, I only took out loans with lower interest rates, being 3.15%.  If I pay my minimum every month.  It will be paid off in approx 9yr &amp; 10month with approx $1325 of interest.  


I have read to always pay off any debt (Dave Ramsey's belief), but on the other hand I have read that a diversified profile can yield 5-6% return.  Shouldn't I then just be putting my minimum for the student loan and investing the rest or am I not comprehending something?


###**So Reddit Gurus:  Here is where I need your advice.**
Should I put the additional $500 solely towards my student loan debt, or pay the minimum and invest the rest?  (I would be investing it in a diversified profile again, however not in my Roth or 401k ~~just in case I need to pull funds from it since I'm not going to school or retirement soon- I dont want to be hit with a huge 10% penalty etc.~~ **Edit**Planning on long term investing)

I have narrowed it down to a couple options:  (minimum student loan of $80 already included in budget, below would be an additional monthly payment to the principal)

|Option        |Student Loan|Invest            |Loan time        |Approx interest|
|:-----------|:-------------:|:------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| 1               |$0                   |$500             |*9yrs 10mon* |*$1325*    
| 2               |$75                 |$425             |*4yrs 8mon*   |*$604*          
| 3               |$150               |$350             |*3yrs*             |*$390*
| 4               |$250               |$250             |*2yrs 1mon*   |*$264*
| 5               |$350               |$150             |*1yr 7mon*     |*$199*
| 6               |$500               |$0                 |*1yr 2mon*     |*$144*

I am leaning towards number 4, simply because it is kind of nice to know that i would be completely out of debt in just over 2 years (not including a future car loan which hopefully will be under 3.15% apr since i have a very good credit score).  This would also put a decent chunk to investing while i am still young.  Is there something I am overlooking and should be doing instead of my above ideas?  

Please Reddit, any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.  I don't talk finances with family or friends for good reason and I don't really have anyone that will take me seriously or is cost effective and  I can go to for advice.

personalfinance,P.S.A Being judgment proof and how it might be a better alternative than bankruptcy.,"Lawyer here and for the past week I've been getting call from clients that are senior citizens and they're drowning in debt so I thought I'd just give out some information if you please:

If you don't pay your debts, creditors can get a court order to garnish your wages, but what if your income comes from Social Security? The answer is that it depends on the kind of debt. 

For most types of debt, including credit cards, medical bills, and personal loans, Social Security cannot be garnished to pay the debt. If you owe money to a creditor, the creditor can go to court and get an order to take money from your bank account. If your Social Security check is directly deposited in the bank, the bank is required to protect Social Security benefits from garnishment. When a creditor tries to freeze a debtor's bank account, the bank is required to look at the debtor's previous two months of transactions to determine if the debtor received any Social Security benefits by direct deposit. For example, if you receive $1,500 a month in Social Security, the bank is required to allow you to use up to $3,000 in your account.

**There are certain debts, however, that Social Security can be garnished to pay for. Those debts include federal taxes, federal student loans, child support and alimony, victim restitution, and other federal debts. If you owe federal taxes, 15 percent of your Social Security check can be used to pay your debt, no matter how much money is left.**

**The benefits and retirement funds that are exempt from debt collection include:**

    Public Assistance
    Social Security
    SSI
    Veterans’ benefits
    Child Support
    Spousal Support
    Worker’s Compensation
    Unemployment Insurance
    Railroad Retirement benefits
    Black Lung benefits
    Public and Private Pensions
    Retirement Saving Accounts such as 401(k), 403(b), and Individual Retirement Accounts
    All of the principal and 90% of the payments from a private trust

personalfinance,I am 20 years old and I want to be financially successful. What steps can I take right now?,"Bottom line is I grew up poor and I don't want to end up like my parents. I'm in my 3rd year of college and expect to have approximately $60,000 in student loans, all federal, by the time I graduate. I am confidant in my ability to pay these off in ten years. I am studying to be a fine arts teacher. I plan on working in the public school system long enough to get some of my loans forgiven, but I also plan on eventually getting a masters and PhD, so I don't have to work in public schools forever. I have about $4,000 to my name, working full time until school starts again, and have no problems with my rent, bills, or groceries. I have not been approved for any credit cards, but I'm planning on getting a secured card and getting a credit card in maybe a year, just to build my credit.

personalfinance,Student loan responsibility,"**Background**: Back in 2000, I had a choice to go to a top 10 private school (50k per) or take a full ride to go to a lower end state school (free, but not in top 150 schools).  After touring both, and being an idealistic teenager, I really wanted the better school; plus, the idea of debt sadly meant nothing to me at that time.  My parents were making about 130k combined with 3 kids, me being the oldest.  We got about half the total cost in promised grants, leaving about 25k for the first year.  I  could borrow at an insanely low 2.5% for 9k of it through federal loans, and was promised to earn 4k through work study, and my dad would be left with about 12k.  That was our starting point for a decision.  He asked me at 17 (I went to school a year early) which school I wanted to go to, adding if we ""aren't worrying about the money.""  I naively told him the top 10 school.  So he said, it's decided, that's what we'll do.  He made a big deal about his son getting the opportunities he didn't get, like a good dad often does.  So then I asked, ""How will you pay for it?""  He said, he could cover some as we go, not explaining to me how interest works or that the interest for PLUS loans was sky high and a horrible deal unless you had plans on paying it off quickly.  Thus, I understandably did not get the weight of this decision, focusing more on my bright future.  BTW, my high school girlfriend who was well off enough to pay in cash was going to the same top 10 school, making it an even easier (dumber) decision for my naive teenage self.  Needless to say, we fucked up big time by not taking the free college route.

Reality sets in the next summer when the ""expected family contribution"" goes from 12k to 14k, then from 14k to 16k, then finally to 19k my 4th year, bringing the grand total to 51k in private loans.  Also, my dad went about paying the monthly minimum and deferring when possible for the next 15 years.  He also was racking up credit card debt leading a second life (sort of unrelated).  These crucial facts didn't become apparent to me until 2008, when I was in grad school.  To this date in 2016 zero principle has been paid on his original 51k borrowed.  You might wonder why I didn't start helping him out in 2008.  Well, in grad school I made 20k per year and was paying down my own federal loans, of which all 35k is now paid off as of this year.  His portion of the debt has been weighing on me even still.  In all I paid for 35k, and he took on 51k of it.  If I could go back, I'd have never let this happen, but I can't rewrite history.  I simply wasn't equipped to understand what was happening.  What's more, I was never shown the details of his loan.  He freely admits now that his plan was to die at 65 and never pay it.

**Where I need guidance**:  how much of this now 105k in debt my dad still carries at 64 y/o should I feel responsible for?  On the human level, I will never let him go completely under due to this. I will take him in and tolerate his smoking and drinking and messiness to keep him off the streets or in a shelter.  I've helped him out from time to time in the last few years.  Should I even factor in how he has mismanaged money in other ways the last 12 years: no saving, lots of partying, eating out constantly, divorcing because of infidelity, and just being careless (like having a full cable package without ever using it, despite living alone)?  He doesn't hold it over me or anything, but he's drowning in debt at the moment, and I'm trying to figure out how much of my own income to steer towards him in aid, if there is even is a way to quantify such a thing for someone I love.  The problem is, my own family is running on a tight budget.  We combine to make only 65k with 3 kids.  I have almost nothing to give without damaging our own long-term financial stability.

Your advice on how to approach this is much appreciated.  This is weighing on my conscience.  If you want more detail, I'll add it below.  Thank you, PF.

investing,Great Instability Ahead,"I am writing this as a warning. Most investors on here are relatively young and have only lived through a bull market, never having experienced the full force of a bear market. What is ahead of us may not just a short term downturn like 2000 or 2008 but something greater, this is potentially the reset of the super debt cycle and perhaps even war as well. 

Most people here have applied a successful philosophy of mean reversion or ""buy the dip"", this type of strategy while works in the context of a overall bull market is very dangerous once the fundamentals have changed. I will try to cover briefly why it has changed and why we are in a very dangerous period.

Since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, we have been basically in 6-7 years of soft currency wars, the fed was first to engage in a massive rate cut and QE cycle that pushed the dollar to historical lows, this proved good for corporate earnings and created a bubble in emerging markets. In 2012 EU got into the game with LTRO and Japan in 2013-2014. These created major currency volatility that swing upwards of 20-40%. Why were they doing this? What is the context?

The context is that the developed world has been off its growth trajectory and real wages haven't increased in close to 30 years. Both consumers and governments have tried to artificially boost improvements by taking on debt, but that incremental debt to growth is getting smaller and smaller, and is now having no impact. Governments and central banks know this and are each trying to devalue their own currency to devalue their debts and export deflation to someone else. But now as every currency is trying to devalue, there is no net real effect anymore.

There is now real populist mood brewing in all of the developed world, people who didn't benefit significantly from globalization are actively looking for scapegoats, which immigrants and foreigners fit. We are seeing the rise of ultra right parties in Northern Europe, ultra left parties in Southern Europe and Trump in the US. All of these parties appeal to a anti-globalization demographic that has long been ignored by the elites. The coming 1-2 year will host a number of election cycles in Western Europe and the us, which will have both extreme lefts or rights gaining large legislative blocks. What both extremes have in common is a anti-free trade and anti immigration bent. What has previously been sentiment now have a good chance of becoming legislation in the coming years. The pro-globalization consensus that came about since the end of WW2 is being challenged.

I think it is very likely that the trend is more trade barriers being put up, borders are getting redrawn in the EU, and a resurgence in nationalism. Last time this happened was in the 1930s, the Market crash of 1929 was followed by a depegging from gold (""currency war"") which was followed by the rise of extremist parties, nationalism and rising trade barriers in the late 30s and finally war. While I think the war cycle is much less likely in the context of nuclear weapons, I do think that major trade wars may be coming soon. It is not hard to imagine a China that needs to devalue by 30% to stem its fx reserve burn rate being challenged by a president trump with unilateral duties, sparking a global crisis of confidence. 

In short, the world is becoming a lot more unstable and uncertain. One should be a lot more prudent about ones management of capital. Can you live off of your savings if markets tank 50%, don't recover and you can't find a job for 2 years? These are real questions you should be thinking about that are in the realms of real possibilities when you are planning your portfolio allocation.",finance,1466974318
personalfinance,New job - need help with W4,"Hi /r/personalfinance - thanks in advance for any advice you can give me! 

In mid-april I took a job that pays 110k and when I filled out my federal tax forms I apparently did so incorrectly and took no allowances. Needless to say, when I got my first paycheck I was a bit surprised. 

I plugged all my info into the [IRS withholding calculator](https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/) but here's where I have some questions. In the calculator it asks about gross wages. 

Now my salary is 110k/year but I started in mid April so I will only make approx 78k. When I put 110k in the calculator it says 
&gt;""Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2016 is $23,305. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $27,485 withheld for 2016 resulting in an overpayment of $4,180 when you file your return.""

To remedy this it recommends that I file for 2 allowances, which is about what I would expect and what I have put for previous jobs. 

However, when I put my anticipated earnings (78k) it says 
&gt;""Based on the information you previously entered, your anticipated income tax for 2016 is $14,728. If you do not change your current withholding arrangement, you will have $27,485 withheld for 2016 resulting in an overpayment of $12,757 when you file your return.""

This is more what I expected my taxes to be, but to remedy this it recommends that I file for 6 allowances which is much more than I would have anticipated. 

If I want to maximize my paycheck, how should I file? And if I need to file for 6 allowances, why do I now have to claim so many more allowances?

I bought something from the US a few months ago. I then received a FedEx invoice for $16.58 for import tax. I didn't expect that, but fair enough, I figured it wasn't worth getting sent to collections for 16 dollars. Because I don't have a FedEx account, it seemed the simplest way to pay them was to send a cheque by mail with the enclosed invoice letter, so I did.

A few weeks later, I see that the cheque has been cashed for $76.58! I have a photocopy of the cheque, and there is no way they could have taken the way I wrote the ""1"" for a ""7"", plus it says ""Sixteen"". Obviously I contacted my bank and they cancelled the cheque and the $76.58 was refunded in my account. A few days later I see that the cheque was reposted, and the correct $16.58 was taken from my account. All good?

A few months later I receive another FedEx letter. This is not an automated letter, I can see typos. They say that I received a $60 refund cheque from them, cashed it, and then got my bank to refund the original $76.58 cheque. They want me to pay them the $60 back, plus the original $16.58.

1) I have never received a $60 cheque, it does not show up in my account.

2) They have already received the $16.58 from the reposting of the cheque. The letter says ""Enclosed is the bank notification of returned cheque"" but what's actually enclosed is a bank notification saying ""Your account has been credited for $16.58"", proving me right.

I feel like they're purposefully trying to be obtuse until I give up an give them the money. They have provided me an email address of an employee for inquiries. How can I prove I never received the $60, and what should I say in the email to get them to give up.

I will take him in and tolerate his smoking and drinking and messiness to keep him off the streets or in a shelter. I've helped him out from time to time in the last few years. Should I even factor in how he has mismanaged money in other ways the last 12 years: no saving, lots of partying, eating out constantly, divorcing because of infidelity, and just being careless (like having a full cable package without ever using it, despite living alone)? He doesn't hold it over me or anything, but he's drowning in debt at the moment, and I'm trying to figure out how much of my own income to steer towards him in aid, if there is even is a way to quantify such a thing for someone I love. The problem is, my own family is running on a tight budget. We combine to make only 65k with 3 kids. I have almost nothing to give without damaging our own long-term financial stability.

Your advice on how to approach this debt situation is much appreciated. This is weighing on my conscience. If you want more detail, I'll add it below. Thank you, PF.

personalfinance,(CAN) Should I finance a used car or save up and buy one outright?,"Hey PF,

I'm looking to buy a used car. I had an old one that was completely paid for (my parents bought it for me years ago) but it died a few months ago and I've been taking public transit since then. It is expensive and unreliable, which is making me want to buy a car soon, but I can't tell if it's going to be better/cheaper in the long run. This is my current monthly situation:

Income: $1800/month, currently have $3500 in savings and no debt. I have a credit card that I use to pay my phone bill and for expenses larger than $100, and I pay it off every month.

Expenses:

Rent: $500

Phone bill: $85

Public transit (incl. bus pass, ubers/cabs, and pitching in for gas when I borrow my boyfriend's car): $140

Groceries: $150

Bank/ATM fees: $25

Home supplies: $30

Personal care (meds, etc.): $50

I usually put around $150/month towards things like amusement, clothing, and fast food/coffee.

I also put aside $150/month for ""unexpected"" expenses, so far this has been things like birthday presents, train tickets to visit my parents, and also to help cover whenever I go over budget in a different category.

I have $400-500 left over at the end of the month (on average).

So with this current set up, I cannot afford to pay $5000 for a used car for at least another year, since I'd still like to keep a few thousand in my savings/emergency fund. Last year I asked my bank about a car loan, and the financial advisor told me she didn't want to give me one because the interest rate would be 12%, due to me not having any collateral. Do car dealerships work the same way? Or do they have a base interest rate that would work with my budget?

financialindependence,FIRE / job security complications,"Hi all! I have a general strategy question and I'm not sure what the best route is...

I make a 6% contribution to my work retirement plan and am able to save about 50-60% of my take-home pay per month, the large majority of that payment being a mortgage.

We got together an emergency fund of about $50k (enough to cover a used car for her, repair the roof, and then any other big expenses down the line, and let us coast if one or both lost our jobs). We feel pretty stable for our age (I am 30).

We are particularly frugal, rarely eating out, no vacations, and I skip meals fairly regularly (desk job, don't need the calories anyway), etc.

We felt like we were in a pretty good position and were planning on setting up additional retirement accounts (wife doesn't have one), when suddenly my job security became much more fragile. I'm good at my job and am well-liked with those I work with, always receiving high marks from superiors, but I work in a government-related job and recently the governor of our state drastically cut funding. While I'm currently safe, it really put into perspective how fragile our position was. All it takes is a statement made by a man I've never met and suddenly my paycheck disappears!

On top of this, we decided to have kids around the same time... discovered it was twins!

So now I feel like I'm in a bit of a pickle. We've reduced expenses about as much as we possibly can and I see no real way to increase my income at my workplace (which I like). Our day-to-day expenses are going to increase while my job security is likely going to be decreasing as time goes on.

Strategy A:

* Pay off the remaining mortgage (~$110k) as quickly as possible, despite it's relatively low 3.75% interest rate
* Start retirement saving after the mortgage is paid off

Pros: Reduces impact of losing our job if we get the mortgage paid off, drastically increases cash flow in the future for things like the twins or starting a business / buying rental properties
Cons: Get way less in retirement than we would otherwise

Strategy B:

* Pay off mortgage until we are net positive (savings &gt; remaining mortgage)
* Start retirement accounts when we are net positive

Pros: Helps keep us secure without draining our current quality of life very much, income means less when you're essentially covered
Cons: Technically worst of both worlds; we have to keep a lot of liquid money in savings for like 20 years and get less retirement income

Strategy C:

* Ignore anything but minimum mortgage payments
* Start retirement accounts ASAP

Pros: Get the most out of retirement
Cons: At any moment the floor could be taken out from us and we're at the mercy of our savings / the current real estate market and/or job market


I've looked for alternative ways of making income, but they are few and far between given the amount of time I need. I'm working towards a master's but don't feel it's going to increase my salary all that much, if at all, within the next few years.

If we play our cards right, we can be net positive against the mortgage within 5-6 years without much of a drain on our quality of life. We could have the house paid off within 8, assuming we use some of our savings and have a lower amount of liquid capital.",finance,1467045340

*Average bill is trending 500KWH/mo. 
*Bills do not reflect large increase in A/C usage since this heatwave started.

*Currently on a 4 tier system, allowance is 400 KWH in Tier 1, 200 in Tier 2, and havent reached tier 3 yet, but we are close.

*I'm told we will be changing to a 3 tier system next month. Higher base tier 1, but cheaper tier 2? - SoCalEdison has not given me the details yet.  

*Last bills averaged 85 bucks. SCE predicting June-July bill to be $220. :(

*I do not have certainty I will be in this house for 20 years, but I'd like to be. 


I understand purchasing get's me the Fed Tax Incentives, but I'm not in a position to buy right now. Not interested in a lease with a lien in case we do need to sell someday. Considering PPA as a way to save money, and have a guaranteed rate for next 20 years. Selling house doesnt seem as nefarious with PPA, new owners can take over the agreement, or it can move to the new place (if they are allowed, and 2 x $499 fee's to move it). 


Pricing: 

My current tier 1 price is: .15

My current tier 2 price is: .22

My current tier 3 price is: .26

My current tier 4 price is: .30

Solar City year 1 price is: .1570

Solar City year 20 price is: .2703


My understanding from reading the PPA is that I buy *ALL* the power I generate at the rate of .157 for first year. Whatever excess I generate, goes to the grid, and edison credits me? 


How do these credits work? If I sell them 10 KW/Hrs of excess during the day, and I consume those 10KWhrs in the evening - is it a complete wash?


What are the gotcha's i am missing from the PPA?


They also want to give me a Nest thermostat, but they want to get the data from it - this does not mean they can control it - correct? 


The zero down, zero monthly cost is appealing. They predict my bills to be 80-130/mo based upon my usage and their trends for my zip code.

Now I have been making payments towards my debts but this particular one was a nasty one I got for being in the military and not finishing school about 4 years ago and belongs to the Federal Department of Defense (long story, but not important). I have largely ignored this debt because they would not work with me to make an afforadable payment plan with them. And given my financial mess I prioritized other debts (this one was also interest free so it was my least priority given my circumstances). 

They eventually came after me by garnishing my wages and withholding my taxes, this was ok with me because it was still significantly less than they were asking me to pay in a payment plan. But I changed jobs 8 months ago and have received zero notice on this debt since. My wages are no longer in garnishment, although they did withhold my taxes this past fiscal year. 

Today I was checking my credit report and it says that the account has been charged off as of two weaks ago. The amount of total outstanding debts was also without the $37,000 that I owed.

I took out a private loan for $36,000 that year. After that school year, I returned to a university in my home state since I didn’t want to continue attending and paying out-of-state tuition.

For various reasons, I’ve been in and out of school since then, working random jobs, taking classes part time/full time when I was able to. I am finally about finished and will graduate in August.

In addition to the first loan mentioned, I have two smaller private loans which total ~$8,000, and various federal loans totaling ~$22,000 (which were recently consolidated).

I defaulted on the original private loan that I took out for my first year of college out-of-state, and it has since been charged off. The two other private loans and the federal loans are in deferment since I am still in school.

I am hoping to learn the best way to prioritize my loans, and figure out which ones I should be focusing on first in terms of private vs. federal, and the one that has been charged off.

For the loan that was defaulted on, I understand I am still obligated to pay this debt and that it affects my credit, but should I deal with the other loans first once I am out of school and those go into repayment? In other words, since the first loan has been charged off, should I worry about that last since the damage is already done?

We never *did* get around to retrying.  Life got in the way, blah, blah.

But about a week and a half after trying, she received not one, but two different letters from the bank, each bearing the same congratulatory letters, affixed with two unique credit cards.

This was obviously not our intention.  Each card had the same interest rate and credit limit, but obviously she does not need two credit cards--especially starting out as a teenager/young adult who's never had a bill in her life.

I had her call the bank on speaker so that I may monitor the conversation.  The ""credit card specialist"" advised that having two cards is ""no big deal"" and that it's really a ""blessing in disguise"" (her exact words...).  I got upset at this point and chimed in the conversation.  I stated that the dual credit cards were due to a website malfunction, which was an error on their end, *and* that we obviously didn't ever intend for my daughter to have more than one credit card.  The woman on the phone said that our only recourse at that point would be to cancel one of the cards, which would hurt my daughter's credit, and they there's absolutely nothing that they can do on their end.

Unsatisfied, I requested to speak with a supervisor.  I also started recording the conversation.  When the supervisor got on and introduced himself, I promptly informed him that I was recording the call for our own protection.  His jolly demeanor quickly changed into anger as he shouted at me that they do not authorize any outside recording.  When I reminded him that the prompt at the very beginning of my phone call said that ""this call may be monitored or recorded,"" he quickly exclaimed that it was for training purposes only, and immediately hung up on me.

At this point, I helped my daughter draft an email to the bank detailing the problem.  Within a day, she got a response back saying that ""they'd be happy to review her account on the phone with a credit card specialist.""

So there's the full story.  My question for you all is what *can* happen next?

* Was the ""specialist"" correct in saying two credit cards is ""no big deal""?

* The second card wasn't activated.  Can it still hurt her credit it it's canceled?

* Is the bank *really* powerless at undoing their own damage?

* Should I have her press on further with email?

* Would it be worth it getting a lawyer involved?

* Should we just let the whole thing go, cut up the credit card, and wait a certain amount of time before canceling?  If so, how long?

Thank you in advance.

tl;dr: Online credit card application errors caused two different credit cards to be issued to my daughter.  Bank says there's nothing they can do, but refuse to go on record.",finance,1467059706

personalfinance,Questions about mortgages and home repairs to help develop longterm housing plans for my aging mother,"Longtime listener, first time caller. I’m making a throwaway because I don’t want to get deep into my family’s finances on my personal account.  I hope I’m not saying anything dumb…  I’ve gotten a lot better at budgeting through PF, but I don’t know anything about housing/mortgages.

I’m trying to help my aging mother figure out some longterm housing plans, and I have some questions/need some advice

**Some background:** Currently, she’s living by herself in a townhouse she bought and is still paying on—her payments are very low, which is good…but on the other hand, the neighborhood is going downhill and feels less safe, the house is starting to need repairs, and it has stairs---all things not great for an older lady who lives on her own and who isn’t in terrific health. I don’t think it’s a great place for her to be. If at all possible, I’d like to move her into a small house or condo that doesn’t have stairs that’s a big closer to where I live (she’s currently about an hour away). I think the big concern is finding an affordable place to keep her payments low, as her retirement savings aren’t all that robust.

**The *actual* question:** In order to even consider listing her house for sale the house is going to need about $10k in repairs/upgrades (new floors, fresh paint, siding repair, gutter repair).  She can get a new 30 year mortgage for the remainder of what she owes +$10k at a lower interest rate than she pays now (down to 3.875% from 4.15%) with similar monthly payments; however, this requires her to pay $400 for an appraisal and about another $3,400 in closing costs which will be rolled into the loan. Is the $10k liquid cash for repairs plus the lower interest rate worth the $3,400 she’ll have to pay for it over time plus the upfront costs of the appraisal?
Using money from savings isn’t really a good option for repairs this extensive—she’s only got about $8,000 in emergency savings and doesn’t feel comfortable spending the bulk of it on home repairs, and I agree.  If she doesn’t sell, she can do the bare-minimum-essential repairs from savings over the course of the next few years (will cost about $3,000 as a SWAG).


**Other details in case you want to give me other advice:**

- She currently owes $56,900 on the house. I don’t know what she’d be able to sell it for after repairs…probably somewhere between $80k and $100k  :( 

- She has no other debt. I have to emphasize this because I am so proud of her. When I was a kid, my dad drove our family into bankruptcy. She bootstrapped the shit out of her life and came out on top. Her credit score is very good, too. 

- She’s 65 and hopes to either retire or work part time when she hits 68. She’ll get about $2k/month from social security and, currently, her cost of living is very low and she needs to keep it that way, so any place she moves, she’ll need a low monthly payment.  There are some decently places nearby she could buy for about $100k. Hopefully, I can help her a little with the downpayment. I’m trying to be a disciplined saver so I can help, but it’s going sloooowwwwly (just bought a house myself, so I have lots of things to spend money on)

- She’s got some money that’s put away for retirement but she doesn’t plan to use it for retirement income until she’s older, and I don’t think she’s got all that much anyway.

personalfinance,Paying down student loans with credit card,"Hi folks,

Please excuse the title as I know the knee-jerk reaction will be ""hell no!,"" but I figured I'd pose the question to a bunch of strangers after my parents suggested it was a good idea (they are terrible with money in many ways, very prudent in others).

I hold a credit card at 22% APR, and have used the card regularly over the past 2.5 years. Each month I pay the balance off in full, and thereby have accrued the card's rewards without ever having paid interest. I intend to continue using the card in this manner until I eventually close the account.

Last week I was sent a few checks from the cc company, to be spent on whatever I wish. There's a promotional period of 12 months interest-free, after which time any balance not paid back will be charged my regular interest rate.

Over the past 18 months, I have also been aggressively (sort of) paying off my student loans, some of which were at 6 - 7% interest. I had the idea of paying down my last 6% loan using one of the promotional checks, then just taking the money I would have thrown at that loan to pay off the added balance on the credit card. Is this a sound idea?

Additional info:

1. The loan I would pay of is about a $3500 balance at 5.85%
2. There's a one-time 2% fee for using the checks.
3. In total, I owe just over 11K total on all my loans, down from 20K two years ago.",finance,1467076206

personalfinance,Did my accountant miscalculate what I owe on federal and state taxes for 2015? Receiving assessments,"I'm an independent contractor (real estate agent) and am using an accountant that the rest of my office uses. I made significantly more in 2015 than I did in 2014 (roughly 40K more). While I certainly expected to pay the tax difference (about 14,000), what I was not expecting was to receive further assessments from not only the IRS, but also the state of MA. 

Since filing and paying the balance due 4/15, I have received a notice of assessment from the IRS that I owe an additional $750 and a notice from the state saying I owe an additional $378. What's lovely is that they don't explain how they arrived at these numbers, simply that they are due immediately. My accountant (who I paid $475 to file) has been rather unresponsive and borderline useless in explaining these assessments. 

This is the second time I've ever filed as a 1099 independent contractor and from what I can tell, this guy fucked up.

- No guarantee of success

Just based on the tax differences, where is the break-even point on whether it's worth it to day trade? My household federal bracket is 28%, so that would mean capital gains are 15%, a difference of 13%.

I was fortunate enough to be accepted into Harvard Business School's full-time MBA program. I haven't had to borrow money before and I just wanted to run through a couple scenarios and get some feedback.

Currently have:

* 10k in low interest savings
* 30k in ally 1% savings
* 60k in brokerage account (couple individual stocks, mostly ETFs)
* 60k in Roth IRA
* 35k in 401k

Estimated cost of MBA (/ year) = $102,350. That includes tuition, estimated living expenses, moderate travel budget.

I was awarded $33,900 in fellowships meaning I'll need to finance $68,450.

I decided to use federal Stafford loan which is $20,500 / year at 5.84%.

**My questions are:**

1.) Fixed or variable rate?

2.) Is it a bad idea to borrow the full $68,450 for 2 years ($136,900 total debt) and then when I graduate put savings towards this debt immediately? My rationale is I want to make sure I have dry powder in the bank for emergencies / trips and I've heard some stories of people that start to run out of money after they graduate and before work starts.

3.) I was going to apply with one of my parents as a co-signer. My FICO is 777, mom's is probably low 700s. Her lower score won't hurt me, right?

4.) Any other things I should consider when applying for loans besides the interest rate?

Any advice would be appreciated!

First let me explain my situation. My SO and myself have 3 loans to pay off at the moment. 2 of them are auto loans, and the other is for her student loans.

The first auto loan has $8,000 left to pay off over 3 years. This loan was financed at 4.1%. The monthly payment is $212.

The second auto loan was just taken out last month. It was for $12,000 over 6 years. This loan was financed at 5.1%. The monthly payment is $214. I would also like to mention that we purchased GAAP coverage for this loan, and if I pay the loan off early I will be reimbursed for a proportional amount.

The student loan is for $10,000 to be paid off over 10 years. The interest rate on this is 5.5%. The monthly payment is going to be about $140. The first payment is due next month.

We have around $20,000 saved in the bank right now. We would like to get a house soon, as the housing market is on the rise, and I feel like the longer we wait the more we will have to pay.

We are able to pay all of our bills and expenses each month, and put $500 - $600 into our savings. The advice I am seeking is about whether I should try to pay off one of these loans. I feel like I might want to pay off the $12,000 car loan in order to get the GAAP money back, and also because it is financed at a higher rate. After that is handled, I think aggressively paying off the student debt would be my next move.

personalfinance,To refinance or not? Switch from 30 year to 20 year? Please advise on mortgage and general finances.,"Hi everyone, my wife and I are talking about refinancing. We've lived in our home for 2 years and we're eligible to remove our mortgage insurance. Our home value has skyrocketed due to location and improvements.  Ending MI would save us $115/mo. While I was in talking to our mortgage woman, she said we could probably move from 4.25% to ~3.75% for a new 30 year loan (through 1stnationalbank). Our current home payment is $1609 (now that taxes have increased). Our Loan was originally at $239,875 and is currently at $230,368. Fees for refinancing with that bank are right around $3,500 and could be rolled into the new loan. We'd save an additional $95/mo by refinancing. Our new payment would be $1399.72/mo for a 30 year term or $1671.85/mo for a 20 year term with a 3.5% interest rate.  

We can afford either as our household income is between $103,000 - $120,000, most of which is stable. However,  I do freelance work so some of it is not. It's really a matter of ""should we do this"" and ""If we refi, which term should we go with."" Up to now, the bulk of our disposable income has gone to home repairs and similar efforts, but the large repairs are mostly completed so we'd really like to put some serious effort mapping out a financial plan for moving forward. We could either pay our house off early or take the savings of 200-250/mo and invest it in mutual funds/index funds. I'm favoring the 30 year term because 3.75% is a very cheap rate and because it would allow us to save up for when the furnace fails (etc.) or for when we want to refurbish the bathroom/add a garage.

As far as I know, my wife plans to work a regular career and retire like a normal person. If we get serious planning, this could mean she could maybe retire in her 50s. She works in data analytics and TBH is probably underpaid ATM. She would like to move into management  However, her commute is nice and she likes how things are.  

For reference, of the ~$103k gross my wife makes:
6% (+3% matching) goes to 401k
10% goes to buying employee stock options (which we will be selling when future shares are distributed because we're getting killed on what we held!)
$200/mo goes into our HSA. (She is going to get LASIK next spring. After that we will continue to add some money to the HSA as they're supposed to be pretty good as ~retirement accounts. God knows I have enough receipts to last for a while as I was recently diagnosed Celiac and getting healthy has been expensive. 
After health care, dental care, life insurance, etc., her takehome (biweekly) is around $2200.  


We have CC debt of ~$6500 which I have switched to aggressively paying off now that home repairs are done. Last month it was ~$7500, next month it should be $5000. I'm hoping to eliminate that by year end, then improve my investing again. 
She also has maybe 7k of student loan debt which she pays ~150/mo against. The interest rate is insanely low, like less than 1%. 
We have a car payment with ~8400 remaining. ~$250/mo
Water/sewer/electric= $120-150
Car insurance = $147 (I am 33, but have two motorcycles and 2 cars) 
Cell = $115 (Jesus, I need a new plan)
Internet = $50 (Gotta brag, we get 1GB fiber for that price!)
Gas = 20-80 (Seasonal)
Subscriptions = $35 (amazon/netflix/audible)

What I don't understand is why is there still $34 k left on the principle when they will have paid for 11 years here in couple of weeks. Does the interest really affect it that much? Is there anything I can do with this, maybe some kind of program to get the bill lowered. I don't believe there is anyone in my family that has good enough credit to get it refinanced and if they did I'm not entirely sure they would even do it for us. I don't have any credit at all and neither does my brother so that option is shot, and of course my father and mothers credit is complete shit thats why the rate on the loan was 10.75%!  I am asking all of this because I can only help my dad out for one year before I move off to finish out my degree so I need to know that him and my brother will be able to afford everything with my income missing. The current payment is around $560 - $600 a month. Can anybody help me out??",finance,1467129990

Income is about 85k/year. In 2012, I qualified for 175k loan on our previous house making less than 60k; but because of the new IBR rules, qualification for the same amount on our current conventional mortgage was a nightmare even with higher income and better credit (deal nearly fell through day before closing). I'm in what I think is becoming a fairly common situation for professionals with good credit, good income, but high student loan debt: DTI would be no problem (25-30%) if IBR were used for qualification but is pretty tricky (over 50%) when the new rules (instead of IBR, use 1% of total loan balance as payment) are applied.

personalfinance,Buying a house in the UK now the UK has left the EU,"Throwaway here.

I've been saving up for quite a while for the purchase of a house. I was bouncing back and forth between the ideas of buying for myself (living with parents at moment), or buying to rent out and living with my parents a little longer. Eventually I decided upon the latter; seeing as though I'm living with them for free I can take advantage of this by buying, having the tenants pay my mortgage and eventually make me money/sell off for a nice profit.

Now, after 'Brexit', I'm wondering what to do. I know that the initial outlook has been low, forecasts being that house prices will drop heavily and continue to do so over the coming years. Interest rates have been predicted to rise. Basically, just could be shit for everybody involved with anything to do with property.

I'm completely inexperienced in being a landlord but was planning on getting into it as I say. I'm 24, have a solid enough salary and take care of my money.

On top of this, I was doing some reading recently and learned that the tax conditions on buy-to-let have changed, landlords are gonna be making less money now anyway. Is this basically a stop sign?

Of course, initially I won't be doing anything now this has happened. I was going to start looking around in July but have now postponed any plans.

Where do we go from here? Is it gonna be better/worse for landlords? What about buyers and tenants? Should I change to buying for myself?

(1)Rent is a fixed $900/month and utilities vary from month to month, the $75 tacked on is actually very conservative, it's more close to $60.

(2)I have a Discover card with a $550 limit. I plan on using $500 of it for food/night life/going out and use that limit as my cap for those things.

(3)I have waited a very long time to have access to enough money to travel and now I wish to take advantage of this possibility.

HSA: $10k (maxed to annual contribution limit)

My Roth IRA: $50k in VTIVX  (maxed to IRS annual contribution limit when possible)

Wife Roth IRA:  $0.  Doesn't exist yet, but will as soon as our joint income falls below the contribution limit.

My 401k: $40k in VTIVX (maxed to IRS annual employee contribution limit)

House:  Planned repairs/renovations to house in the next year, call it $30k

Vacations:  Probably a couple of significant vacations in the next couple years, call it $10k.

personalfinance,My parents are about to lose everything. What should they do?,"I’ve only recently found out how dire my parents’ financial situation is and I’m trying to help them figure out some sort of plan to limit the damage. 

**Background:** My parents (Dad is 62, Mom is 64) are immigrants who bought a house in a nice neighborhood in NJ in 1998. Due to very irresponsible spending habits and extraordinarily bad timing, they decided to remodel their home in 2006 by doubling their mortgage to $700k. Their credit was bad but this was 2006 so they were approved for an ARM that is currently at 7.6% interest. My dad was making 100k+ for several years until 2008, my mom hasn’t worked for 35+ years and her English is marginal . Of course subsequently, my dad lost his job and they’ve lived off of meager savings, borrowing from others, and part time work for the last several years. They haven’t made their mortgage payment ($4k+/month) in several years so the house is in the process of foreclosure and I’m not sure how they haven’t been evicted yet. 

**Details of the mortgage**
* Principal: $683k

* Unpaid Interest: $236k

* Unpaid Escrow: $132k (NJ property taxes)

* Total Due: **$1.05MM**

* Servicer: Ocwen (subprime specialist, does participate in HAMP)

* Interest Rate: 7.6% Adjustable

* Not sure if it’s owned/insured by Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae

**Good News:** The neighborhood and the house have appreciated significantly so market value on the house should be $1.2MM or slightly more. There are several houses nearby listed for similar amounts which are smaller/on a smaller plot. Luckily, after being unemployed for years, my dad recently found a job in a southern city (where he’s now renting an apartment) making about $50k/year. 

**Bad News:** They have zero real assets (aside from the house) or retirement savings. My mom is not going to receive an social security benefits and anything my dad gets will be minimal at best. Their credit rating is in the trash because of the foreclosure. I’m not clear on whether or not they’re eligible for Medicare/Medicaid.

**Next Steps:** Clearly, they need to sell the house and move to a lower COL area. They had listed the house last year at $1.6MM coming down to $1.3MM over a year but no takers so it’s currently off the market. Part of the problem is that there are several small fixes that need to be made (some window replacement, paving the driveway, rehabbing the lawn, minor mold in the basement) but they don’t have the money to do any of this. They’ve made vague mentions of an attorney who’s talking to the servicer (Ocwen) about a loan modification but nothing has happened for several months. My parents are financially illiterate and don’t fully understand their options. Since the attorney doesn’t seem to be producing any results, I’ve asked them to take a more active role in the matter. 

**Questions**

* What types of loan relief programs should they be looking at? I’ve already directed my dad to look at the HAMP. Staying in the house is clearly not a viable option so interest rate reduction and lengthening the term won’t help here. A program where they can reduce the total amount due would be ideal.

* Assuming they sell the house, pay off the mortgage, and rent an apartment in the South, what are other steps they should take to put themselves on a more stable path?

Like the title says, I am trying to figure out which option is a wiser long-term financial decision: to sell stock I own to pay for most of the program, or take out student loans to cover the costs.

Here are the details:

It is a 7 trimester program that will cost $102,592 in total tuition.  The Federal Unsubsidized (Stafford) Loan will cover $55,656 of this tuition over the course of all 3 years.  This will leave me with $46,936 in remaining tuition costs.  On top of this, I will also need about $30,000 for living expenses (rent, utilities, food, gas, etc.) during this period.

Essentially I need about $77,000 to pay for this program.  I can come up with this money if I sell stock that I currently own, but I figure I’ll be subject to around 15% capital gains tax… Ouch.  Would it be wiser to take out a secondary student loan with a 7-8% interest rate to pay for this while I let my stocks (hopefully) increase in value as well as return quarterly dividends?  

I honestly don’t understand how interest rates accumulate, so I haven’t been able to crunch the numbers myself.

I recently landed a full time job that will pay ~$2300/month before taxes/insurance/whatever. It's an intro position related to my major with growth potential, so I'm pretty excited. I start at the beginning of August and I will be seeing paperwork about the specifics of my salary, health insurance, retirement options, etc... in the next few weeks, so I will have a more concrete picture of what I will be making each month. However, I won't be graduating until December of this year, so I don't have any required student loan payments until 2017 and I will have additional tuition payments later this year for my final semester.

Currently, I live with a flatmate who plans to stay leased with me until the beginning of next year (probably through the end of Jan. but they may pay the month-month rate for one month, still waiting for a concrete answer on that...) Once they leave, I plan on continuing to live in the apartment and paying the rent and other bills on my own. 

With my flatmate, my current bills typically total $850-$875 per month, which is about what I make at my current job. When the flatmate leaves, I expect all of my monthly expenses to be closer to $1300-$1400 per month. 

I have a spreadsheet in Google Docs that I've been using for about three years now to budget everything, but that's almost entirely out of necessity. I have no idea how to budget ""extra"" money (even though I know it's not extra, since I owe a nice chunk in loans.) If I didn't budget every penny I earned, I would never have been able to pay any of my bills. I'm not in a situation where I can ask other people for money if I get into a tight spot, and I assume I have no credit because I've never been approved for any loans (though I have only ever applied for one private loan and that was about 5 years ago.) 

In August, my income will almost triple and my expenses will not change for at least 6 months. Should I put this extra income towards saving, student loans, or split it between the two? I've heard arguments for all three answers and since I've never had extra cash, I've never had to decide what would be the better/smarter option. The only other major expense I sometimes worry about is my car. It's been very reliable, but it is old and as of right now, if it were to need any repairs, I don't have anything set aside to pay for them.

(All of my student loans are Federal loans. The loan total is ~$35,000 and interest rates vary from 3.4% to 6.8%. According to the Federal Student Aid website, $1400 of my loan total is just accrued interest. Ughhh. I also plan to accept additional loans for my final semester, which will likely be another subsidized loan for $2700 and an unsubsidized loan for $3500.)

Edit: Another question I just thought of - Should I look into getting a credit card to build my credit? I haven't applied for one and I don't have one. I haven't ever applied because I know my income to debt ratio is super high, since I've been working part-time or minimum wage-ish jobs for the last 9 years, so I just assumed it wasn't worth it. I've also never liked the idea of having them and it just got easier to continue not bothering with it, but a lot of people seem shocked that I'm 26 years old with no credit card(s.)",finance,1467157500

But...my car died. I need to purchase a used car in the $16K range because I need low miles and something that is going to last. My last car had 220K on the odd and I put 200K of that on in 6 years.

So my question is:
Can I take out a loan for a car without it having much effect on my credit so that I can still get the low rate on my refi?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1467160493

personalfinance,Student Loan Question with Wells Fargo,"Hey everyone.

I'm looking at finishing up my final year of college, Computer Science major. However, I will be about $20k short of paying for it.

I am 22 years old, and 20k of debt doesn't terrify me, because I'm confident in getting a job after I graduate (I've got experience and done internshipss). My FICO credit score is currently 772, which could be better I suppose. I tend to max out my card once a month, when I pay rent, but then I pay the balance off within a day or two.

Anyway, I'm looking at getting a loan, probably through either Wells Fargo or Discover Card. I've had a checking and savings account with WF for the past 6 years, and a CC with Discover for the past 2. 

WF interest rates are between 3.74% and 9.74% for the variable, and 6.49% and 11.99% for the fixed interest rate. I can't find out what my actual interest rates will be without them doing a credit check, which as far as I am aware, causes a hit on your credit.

I'm currently trying to apply without a cosigner. 

Is there any way to see what my rates will be without taking a credit hit?


Edit: I should add that I have looked at federal loans, and I don't qualify. My dad makes just above the cutoff for it. I get no federal aid for school.",finance,1467166637
personalfinance,Why does the amount of interest on my car loan vary higher or lower per payment?,"Hello Everyone,

I am hoping someone may be able to help me understand why I am seeing a variance in the amount of interest I am paying towards a car loan.
  
Background: I purchased a used car in 2014 and set up financing through a local credit union. The loan term is 60 months and the interest rate is 4.990%. Minimum payment amount is $266.57.

For the past couple of years I have been paying the $266.57 on time, every month, via direct transfer. Part of this amount goes towards interest and the remainder goes towards the principle. It is my (limited) understanding of loans that, as you pay more towards a loan, your contribution towards interest lessens and the amount going towards the principle increases, due to the decreasing amount of the balance. 
  
What I am curious about is, after reviewing a history of payments as far as I can go back (up to July 2014), I see that the amount of interest varies higher or lower per each payment, instead of steadily decreasing. I don't understand the rhyme or reason behind the variation and am hoping someone can explain it to me.
  
If it is helpful, [here](http://imgur.com/43b6wMn) is a summary of the payments I've made and the amounts going towards interest vs. the principle. No personal information included, just a list of payments made, for reference.
  
If any additional information would be helpful, please let me know. I appreciate anyone's assistance in understanding this better.",finance,1467168085
personalfinance,[Housing] Ten years under water,"Hello PF,

My desire to keep paying my mortgage took a blow recently when we got turned down for refinancing. I am wondering if it is finally time to bail on a home my wife and I bought almost 10 years ago…

The story goes like this. It is 2006 and housing hasn’t crashed yet. My wife and I follow the advice at the time “Buy the biggest house you can, make your payments as small as possible, and sell it in two years for huge profits! Rinse and repeat!” We ended up getting a $300,000 loan for a lot with two homes on it. We figured we could rent out the back house and live in the front.

In 2008 I got offered my dream job (at the time, the shine has worn off) 3 hours away. By this time it was obvious the housing market wasn’t going up any more. Our choice was to cut our losses or try and rent out the house. Going into foreclosure is against our alignment so we tried the renting thing.

We’ve lost about $5,000 a year on the house since then. The home probably isn’t back up to its original value; similar homes out there are going for around $250,000 according to Zillow.

The loan they gave us was about what you would expect. Because we didn’t have 20% down, they loaned that to us separate at a much higher interest rate and, because we were obviously going to sell it in 2 years, a balloon payment after 15 years option.

When we went to refinance that 20% loan is what did the whole process in. For some reason the bank was not willing to take over that debt. I find that really frustrating, and discouraging because we have always paid. They didn’t even give us an option to put money down. They just said, “We are not touching that.”

What do we do? Our current situation is that we own another home close to where we work. I would like to sell this home and then move out of the area. I assume if we walk away from our first home it would making finding a new place to live a lot more difficult.

We both feel like we SHOULD keep paying on moral grounds. On the other hand we aren’t sure how else to get the bank’s attention. I am really open to all suggestions, I am just not sure exactly which route to take and I really hate wasting my time like I did with the refinance misadventure.

Anyways, I apologize for the long back story but I wanted to get all the information in one post.

It's set up for direct debit monthly, and I just paid off 1 of the 3 loans in the bundle, leaving $9900 @ 9.18%.  I'm looking at a possible refi with SOFI, or I could cash out $9900 of the $26,500 I have in my 401k at the job I just left and clear that balance.  Even if I add an extra $100 a month to the current payment schedule, it would take me 5 years or so to clear that balance.

I know I'll take an early withdrawal penalty, and pay income tax on what I take out, so my napkin math says that I'll probably have to cash out about 50% to leave enough to cover the loan.  My limited knowledge of finance says to compare the interest, and if I have interest expenses higher than interest earnings, then clear the debt and turn the savings back into interest earnings.  However, I am most likely underestimating the impact on income-based federal student loan payments, income-based supplemental insurance premiums for my son's autism insurance, etc.

But it doesn't seem to make sense to keep paying, at a minimum for the next 5 years with aggressive principal payments, on the private student debt when I could clear that off the books and put another $150 a month into my Fidelity 401k (which would, in turn, have tax benefits by lowering taxable income).

Is this 6 of one, half dozen of another?  Does it basically wash out either way, or am I thinking the right way?

After paying off cards, cutting my budget (splitting Netflix/Hulu with a friend so we each pay for 1 and not 2, going from cable at $79 per month to PS Vue at $30, tons of other tiny things that added up), and paying bills and other things that come up, I have between $2500 and $2900 left every single month.  I've been tracking this in an Excel spreadsheet I found on here.

Things to note-

-I'm not counting child support in that leftover amount.  The agreement I have states that anything I don't need to use for the kids day to day goes into their college funds

-I don't have a car payment.  My car was paid off by my ex as part of my divorce

-I do pay taxes on my alimony payments, which I've been setting aside quarterly

-My job does not offer any sort of benefits at all.  I qualify for a healthcare.gov stipend but I have a huge deductible.  My kids are covered under their father's job.  I do not get a 401k or anything like that.

-I have a Roth IRA and I already contributed 2016's max of $5500 to it.

-I keep $10k in an easily accessible savings account with a really low interest rate.  I keep 2 months of bills/expenses in checking.  Anything else I've been adding to my children's college funds on top of child support contributions because I don't know what else to do with it.

I want to save more for retirement in particular, but without anything through my job and already maxing out my Roth IRA, what else can I do?  Having $2500+ extra every month is honestly something I never thought I'd see in my bank account.  I live frugally but I do have fun.  I don't know if I should just find a better savings account and redirect the extra there outside of my $10k emergency fun?  Is there another way to invest in retirement funds besides a Roth IRA?  My current mortgage has about $105,000 left on it and during the divorce it appraised for about $225k- should I focus on knocking out the mortgage payment ASAP before I change anything else?

ethereum,Fork == Bailout,"I am new to Ethereum, but want to ask this question and present this argument to the community:

It seems to me that trying to return money to the victims of the DAO hack significantly undermines Ethereum as a platform.

Isn't one of the major points of distributed trust the idea that you can't win by influencing a small group of people?   What if a government puts pressure on Vitalik and others to do another fork with to fight something that is deemed a crime?  What if a criminal organization wants a fork to help it win against a rival?

Secondly, let's consider stake.  If proof of stake makes any sense at all, it would seem that letting the attacker keep his/her well-earned stake in the Ethereum's success is a good thing.  Whoever it was is a valuable friend to the Ethereum community, not an enemy. 

All those whose ignorance about security and general gullibility led them to lose money... well, they are not the people we *want* to have stake, since they have poor judgment.  Of course that is an exaggeration, but if smart contracts are the law it's reality. 

When the mainstream financial system was bailed out in 2008 it was because the honchos running the show didn't like certain prices.  Rather than accept price as information, they wished to use their power to change prices.  To do so they had to bail out major banks and insurance companies, and reward a lot of foolish decisions and sloppy risk taking.  This is possible to some extent in a Fiat system.

But cryptocurrencies do not come with a military... As a result they need to be justly governed and earn their credibility through principled governance. If done well this is the ultimate form of legitimacy, and something we should all be very proud that Ethereum might achieve if we can avoid things like politically-motivated forks.

If the smart contract functioned properly (even if the proper behavior wasn't intended) then the results should stand.  Let us all become smarter and avoid this in the future.  Let us all buy up some extra ether if the price is down a bit. 

There are so many ways to improve the ecosystem after this kind of thing, and a fork reduces (or completely removes) all the good incentives.

Sure, much of the Ether lost was from early adopters and enthusiasts who might be pretty bummed out about it.  I'm sure the Federal Reserve governors felt the same way about their cronies who ran banks that were about to fail due to poor risk assessment decisions. But sometimes the principle matters more than a particular outcome. 

If we Fork whenever there is a subjectively undesirable transfer of wealth, then it becomes completely impossible for Ethereum to to be trusted for anything important. 

Let us not forget that what makes Ethereum interesting is that the code is the law.  The minute we open the door to ""wise elders"" doing ""what is right"" we have a political group with all the downsides... most notably a power structure that claims the moral wisdom and righteousness to play God, when the design of Ethereum is supposed to prevent that!",cryptocurrency,1467215593

Basically, the ECB is going to wait before it changes its QE plan (bullish for the euro) whereas the BoJ is under significant pressure and is expected to take action and ease its monetary policy somehow.
Because of the recent Brexit referendum, I realize that much of the emphasis is on the risk-appetite rather than anything else, so one would have to keep an eye on this as well.
As a result, in the scenario that a good price presents itself, I believe there could be a buy opportunity for the EUR/JPY. There is Japanese CPI data coming out on Friday, and Euro CPI on Thursday. If the deviation comes out to the downside for JPY and upside for EUR, this could create more confluence.

I completed 32 credits as a biology major before deciding college was not for me. My GPA is a 3.5 and i served as a tutor for the Biology department for 2 semesters. I left college and enrolled in a technical college for welding in 2013. I got a job 2 months into school and have loved the welding, machine work and CNC that I get to do. I will be completing my Welding program this summer because it was completely free due to a federal grant. I enjoy my work but to make money requires working 60+ hours a week and the manual labor is already taking a toll on my body. I also find great interest in the planning and design that goes into the work I do. This working experience has helped me find my true calling, engineering.
There are lots of post here about paying off student loans and other debts, if you were to attend college right now what loans or financial programs would YOU use?

Details:

* Have a 765 credit score and over 10 years credit history(mom opened a card in my name for this reason)
* ~$20,000 credit card limit
* Made $45,000 last year ($16h average of 55h a week)
* $15,000 in savings
* $5000 in 401k (move to roth IRA, use for tution, convert to emergency fund?)
* $700 monthly expenses
* (+$700 extra for rent)
* Estimated tuition and fees for both colleges to complete my degree: $40000
* Estimated living expenses(food,rent,leisure) to complete my degree: $44000

Plan:

I will attend community college until next fall to complete my associates while living at home. When I attend University in Fall 2017 I will need about 2.5 years to complete the engineering program. I also will need to rent an apartment. (with roommates)

My mom is on disability with lots of expenses and dad makes 80k+ so I don't receive much in the way of financial aid. They cannot help with much but are open to parentplus loans and may assist with some living expenses.
I'm going to try to stay on with my company at 30 hours a week for this coming year, but will have to find new employment at university and would like to stay under hours a week.

I want to take the best loans and financial path ways for someone returning to school, any and all advice is welcomed. Thank you.",finance,1467217435

Since all credit cards are paid off at the end of every month, we are in a position to take advantage of cards with rewards and such.  We also both have 800+ vantage scores (not exactly sure about FICO currently but they shouldn't be far off).  Any advice on good cards for us to look into?  We don't travel much so airline cards aren't that interesting, cash back rewards would probably be ideal.  We live in Colorado if that makes a difference.  APR doesn't matter as it will be paid in full monthly.

My second big question has to do with the emergency fund itself.  Where should it be?  Currently it's sitting in a savings account with a laughable interest rate, obviously this isn't ideal.  I'm just not sure of the best way to 'have' this money while I'm not spending it.  Do I look into CD's or something different?  I don't want to have too much trouble accessing it if an actual emergency happens but I don't want to leave it basically idle in a savings account either.

personalfinance,[AUTO] To pay off my auto loan or wait?,"I recently bought a Toyota Tundra used for $20k. I took out a 5-year auto loan through my bank at a 3.39% interest rate for the entirety, paying $363/mo.

I have $56k in savings, $60k in other mainstream investments, and I've been maxing my 401k contributions, about to lower those to only meet my employer's matching program. I pay $900/mo in rent and utilities. I'm going on part-time status with my company starting this week and I expect my earnings to be roughly $60k/year. I have no other outstanding debts and no other recurring payments except the usual cell phone and the like.

My question is, would it be a sound decision to just completely pay off my truck right now? My bank does not incur penalties for early payment, so I could completely pay it off. My credit score is 724 right now, and I'd like to make that a bit higher, but that may be just a point of pride for me rather than a necessity since I'm not planning on taking out any big loans in the future.

personalfinance,Easy refinance question,"I financed a car with my mom 30 months ago for a 5 year loan because I wanted a better interest rate and it allows me to stay on my parents insurance which is much cheaper. I've made every payment on time.

Now my dad is figuring out insurance and bundling and it's going to be cheaper for my dad's home and auto loans, and cheaper for me to not get my own personal auto insurance to the tune of about $90 a month-for me. (Not sure how much my dad would save) 

In order to do this my dad needs to get on the auto loan. I plan to continue the same loan end date, but will it look bad that I have now ""refinanced"" this auto loan twice.

personalfinance,24M - How do I ask for a payrise? (Slightly long post),"Hi, I'm not a native English speaker so I apologise for any grammar mistakes in this post. I'm about to ask my boss for a payrise since I feel like I deserve it and I'm not quite sure how to go on about it. Let me tell you about my backstory.

I started working in one of the biggest grocery store chains in my country 9 years ago as a part time with school. I dropped out of college 1 and half year ago and have since then been working full time in this store. About 2 and half years ago I became a shift manager (means I'm in charge of the store during the evenings/weekends) so therefore I got a higher minimum pay. I should have been made a shift manager some time before that but we had a pretty bad store manager, who eventually was fired. The new store manager made me a shift manager pretty much in no time. Right now I'm earning around $13 an hour during daytime and on evening/weekends I'm earning around $18,5 an hour. 

I aim on going back to school after this summer while still working in the same store with school part time. However, I am by far the most experienced shift manager in the store, having worked for 9 years I know pretty much everything inside and out. The other shift managers often come to me and ask me about things they do not know about. However the salary difference between me and them is like $0,24 an hour. I feel like I'm really valued in this company as an employee and would like to work there while I finish school. I have a great relationship with the store manager and the assistant manager and consider them my friends since we all started working there around the same time. They have been working there full time for the last 4 - 6 years but both started as part time with school like 9 - 10 years ago. However the pay is not great compared to what I could get in other places even though I have all this experience with me. 

This summer the store manager and the assistant store manager (they are brothers) went to France to watch the Euros in soccer. They were expected to be back to work last Friday, but since our country got into the knockout stages and the 2nd round of the knockouts, they have extended their stay and should be back to work next tuesday. In the meantime me and my coworker have been in charge of the store. I was on holiday in May and had an operation in the beginning of June. When I got back they went to France but had made a shift plan for the whole store. In truth, the plan was a shambles and we have been really understaffed the past 3 weeks. While that's been going on I've had to take lots of extra shifts (which I don't really complain about since I get paid hourly and make more cash from it) but the problem is I'm working around 200 hours this month since there are so few other shift managers that can work on weekends/evenings. 

*You might ask why both the managers are allowed to go on such a long holiday together and I can explain that. They booked the trip many months ago. When they booked it, we had another store manager, and our current store manager was the assistant. However out of the blue, our store manager was moved to another location and our assistant was made manager.*

I feel like there's loads of extra pressure on me these days at work and I can't get the stuff I usually should be doing on time because I'm overseeing so many things. I've basically been the store manager for 2 and half weeks now without them asking if I wanted to be in charge of the store while they were on holiday. There are many new people working who don't know how to do some things and it's just taking too much of me to teach them how to do things, deal with wholesalespeople (is that a thing), make the store look good and the usual stuff I have to do. 

I know for a fact that if I'd leave after this summer, they would not have anyone to replace me immediately. I've taken a look at the kids who are working part time and there's only 1 that I'd want to make a shift manager, and even then, she's been working there for 2 years against my 9 years. I feel like I'm almost irreplaceable here. Therefore I'd like a payrise especially since there's almost no difference in my salary and someone who would have been working there for only 2 years. I also feel like I should get something for the time I'm working as the store manager without being asked to do it. How do I ask my boss about it?",finance,1467224125

MachineLearning,"After implementing a few toy models, I'm now trying to implement a model from a paper for the first time; getting garbage results. How to decide if it's my fault or the author's?","I've learned the basics of ML from Peter Flach's book over the past few months, and I've implemented some simple toy models (MNIST, noisy function prediction, etc.). I'm attempting to implement my first serious model from the [literature](http://www.cs.au.dk/~cstorm/students/Chong_Jul2009.pdf), which is a prediction model for daily FX rates.

To quickly summarize, the model can be broken down into 3 steps.

1. Perform a four-level stationary wavelet decomposition of the past q prices.
2. Train a separate neural network on each set of detail coefficients and the level 4 approximation to predict the next price.
3. Feed these predictions and some statistical features (chosen by exhaustive selection) into another neural network, which outputs the final prediction.

The paper claims some very impressive results (see e.g. Figure 5.8 and Table 5.9). However, my results have been... not impressive. No run has predicted the next day's direction better than chance, much less gotten a validation MSE on the order of 1e-6!

Since this is my first go at implementing a real model, I'm assuming the fault is mine. My suspicion is that I'm doing the input normalization incorrectly, because the paper is rather vague about how this was done.

&gt; All the input data are normalized to the range [-1,1] before being fed into the neural networks.

I've normalized the input to this range in several ways, none of which worked.

Beyond me screwing the normalization up, I have no idea what I could be doing wrong, because the paper uses very simple techniques. Unless Matlab's NN toolbox allows its single-hidden layer ANNs to consort with spirits, I imagine the problem isn't caused by the fact that I'm using Keras and Python.

In summary, I have three questions:

* How do you decide when you're wasting your time trying to reproduce a paper's claims?
* What mistakes did you make when you started implementing real models from papers?
* How do you typically normalize input data to a neural network? Do you normalize the expected results as well?

personalfinance,The true cost of owning my BMW 2007 328i - Some lessons learnt,"Hello PF,

I thought I will educate some of the folks over here the true cost of owning a BMW 3series. 

A little background on the vehicle, history and the graphs that I have plotted here.

* I bought a 3 year old, 2007 make, BMW 328i, in 2010 for $21000 final price.
* Purchase Mileage ~42000, Current Mileage ~110000
* The car had a down payment of $5000, and an interest rate of 3.5% which I refinanced to 2.25% after one year. My credit score has always been &gt;780
* In 2012, I moved from North Carolina to Colorado. My drive to work in North Carolina was 20 miles. I got smarter and got myself an apartment in Colorado that was 3miles away from work.

With this background, I will explain how I collected my data and also the description of each category. I am very organized in my life and I like to keep my receipts for the future.

Here is the categories I have plotted my data in:-

* Loan -- Every expense loan related. I repaid my loan in 4 years, by making a final payment of $1500 in the end.
* Repair - Unforeseen expenses that are not wear/tear related. Gasket replacements, Water pump replacement, Spark plug replacement 
* Maintenance - All wear and tear related expenses that cannot be avoided and will happen with every car. New tyres, Brake replacement, Oil change etc
* Tickets - Tickets, Parking Tickets. (I am a cautious driver :))
* Auto Insurance - Monthly Geico payments
* Emissions, Registration - As name suggests

Some other key points:-

* BMW repairs are expensive. All repairs/maintenance jobs were done at a private garage specializing in German cars and not at the dealer or Pep Boys.

**YOU NEED TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY FUND OF ~$1500 - $2000 FOR UNFORESEEN REPAIRS FOR A BMW 3series**

* I had a small accident early 2013 - The impact of it in my increased insurance cost is seen. Accident = No good. 
* The frequency of repair is increasing as the car gets older (Doh!), but the cost of owning the car is getting lower. The most I paid for car in a year was in my last year of auto-loan payment.
* The total cost of repair + maintenance is ~25% of the total cost of owning a BMW 328i.  

*Here is the interesting part - I have paid ~$21000 for a car and another ~$18000 for repairs, insurance, maintenance, registration etc. I am quite blown away by this number. Is this normal for a car? Or can I chalk this up to the joys of owning a German car?*
 

Conclusions &amp; feeling about owning a german car:-

1. Buying a BMW had an initial thrill that waned off pretty quickly. 
2. There is a constant fear of a random big ass expense that I do not want. Having to see a bill of ~$1500 is no fun. 
3. I had to start getting mechanically inclined to save some money. Changing wipers, changing air filters. These can easily rack up $100 at the shop even though it takes 10mins
4. BMW is an absolute pleasure to drive. Fucking pain in the ass to maintain. Girls love BMWs. 
5. I have no regrets for owning this car. I was 26 when I bought this car. I am an engineer and I was making decent amount of money and I figured this was the best time to own a German car. Later with family ... I might not get the chance again. 
5. Keep an emergency fund ready if you want to own this car.

personalfinance,Question about a loan,"So I've banked with Wells Fargo for many years and a number of them I have been a premier account holder. I found a car I wanted so I called WF to get approved for the loan, they called me back later that afternoon and told me the loan had been declined. No clue why. So I went to the dealer to get approved through one of their affiliate banks..well they all approved me, including WF, and WF also gave me the lowest interest rate from any of them- 1.5%.

What gives? This makes zero sense to me. Why not approve me when I call them but on the same exact car, same exact loan amount I get approved when the dealer calls them.",finance,1467255730
personalfinance,Need advice on best prepayment strategy for two mortgages,"I have seen other posts that recommend to always pay down the higher interest rate mortgage no matter what. But it seems that in this case when I look at mortgage calculators, I would save more in interest to pay both down a bit rather than just the mortgage#2. I was hoping someone could help with the math to figure out the best prepayment strategy to minimize my total interest payments. The answer seems like it is somewhere in the middle.

Mortgage#1 = $291,197  principal remaining on fixed 3.375%  15yr loan originally $313,000 matures 03/2030

Mortgage#2 = $133,882  principal remaining on fixed 4%  30yr loan originally $170,000 matures 08/2042

Prepayments... We do an average of $1,333 per month ($500 extra per month plus a $10K lump prepayment at year end). 

Right now, we just pay down the 4% Mortgage#2 but is that really the best solution? Are we better off paying some towards Mortgage#1 ? 

Hopefully someone with better math skills will see this. Thanks reddit !


TL;DR - What I learned is:

For prepayments, we want to apply it to the higher rate loan since every dollar in the outstanding principal no matter where we are in the loan or the size of the principal is being hit with interest every month. And we want to do that for every borrowed dollar to the end. The loan interest is computed every month and that's all we care about. Read on for more...  Thanks all !",finance,1467255828
personalfinance,EE Bonds vs. Student Loans,"Hi Everyone-

Currently a medical resident in my mid-30s starting year 2 of a 3 year program making about $60K/year.  Have approximately $266K in student loan debt with interest rates ranging from 5.16-7.65% (atrocious).  Have been chopping away at it with whatever extra I can scrape together, not even covering all the interest with my monthly payments.  Currently registered with PSLF but not a lot of faith it'll be around in 2017.  Sticking with IBR for now as I can't afford $3K/month in payments if I privately re-finance and I wouldn't qualify for PSLF if I did.  Plus in the off-chance PSLF is around, it'd be nice to utilize it (although hard to find 503c jobs for EM docs).  [I am considering trying to turbo pay it off once I'm an attending.  Hate having debt.  This is my only debt].

Here's the issue- I have just under $12K in EE bonds.  Matured to face value but not maxed out yet.  A few have an interest rate of 4% but most around 1.3%.   Cash out and use toward Student Loans?  If so, I assume I put it toward the largest interest rates first.

I'm currently putting $400/month toward a 403B (don't qualify for a Roth due to husband's job) and $300/month toward an emergency fund.

This may seem like an obvious solution but I just want to bounce the idea off of some third party people.  Any feedback is appreciated.  Let me know if any more info is needed.",finance,1467256943

personalfinance,"Fucked up my first year of college, how can I fix it?","After I graduated highschool, I made it very clear to my family that I wanted to take a year off since I moved from North Carolina to Maryland during the summer. Unfortunately, they all argued and said that it wasn't the right choice. I wasn't able to visit my school until the end of July, so I didn't realize that there was more paperwork to be done through the school. (The deadline is pretty much past this point. So whenever they awarded me would've been after the semester started.) As I'm finishing the final papers for my school to receive how much I was awarded, I fucked up because of my parents marital status. I never knew they were ""officially"" separated until now. (Parents lived together for my whole life so I just assumed they filed their taxes as married and I just so happened to be only under my mom, while my siblings were under my dad. So I had my dad sign one of the papers when really, I needed my mom's.) Anyway, because of my timid personality and with no motivation of going to school, I just flat-out refused to go to the Financial Aid office to fix the situation asap at my school because they were pretty mean and miserable. (Still not a good excuse.) 

Fast forward, I had fun during the time I took the semester off. I've matured a lot since then, and I'm in the mindset where I'm ready to tackle my studies. I was able to fix 2015-2016 FAFSA before the year ended. On top of that, I was able to finish my 2016-2017 as well. So I'll be receiving both aids probably after Fall semester.

**tl;dr** Here comes the tricky part, for Fall 2015, I owe about 6k to my school. Because of that, I used it as an excuse not to take any classes for Spring 2016 due to the fact that I couldn't register until I paid most of it off. But I prolonged fixing my 2015-2016's financial aid that I won't be able to start Fall 2016 until I pay off for Fall 2015. I don't think my school will give me a federal loan since it's past the fall semester. My only hope now is to take out a private loan. 

I'm at a lost here, I'm not sure who I can turn to at this point. I live under my sibling's roof (thankfully, no rent.), but none of them can really help me.",finance,1467258594

personalfinance,"Paying off $80,000 in student loans in 4.5 years making $30k up to $97k.","**What?**
We paid off $80,000+ (I was too scared in the beginning to look at the full amount) of student loans in 4.5 years, making between $30k-97k. The loans were roughly 50% private and 50% federal, and all were mine for a bachelor's degree.

**When?**
It took me roughly 4.5 years. I started at the beginning of my senior year of college. 3 years was on my own, at the 3 year mark I got married and my husband joined in. 

**Where?**
We live in the Midwest, USA. I lived in an apartment during this process and paid 85% of my own expenses (parents helped with cellphone &amp; I was on their health insurance until I graduated college).

**Why?**
I had always been anxious about my increasing debt levels. One day I sat down on my parents couch and realized that I was graduating next year, and I was going to have to pay these bills no matter what. I didn't have an awareness of forgiveness or income based repayment at that time. But I knew that the loans couldn't be bankrupted, plus my parents co-signed, so there was no way out and I didn't want to drag my parents down either. I had heard of Dave Ramsey, so then and there I decided that I would do whatever it took to pay back every cent and be debt free.

**How?**

- Year 1: $30,000 salary
Worked three jobs during college (CNA, tutor, dishwasher). Often worked Baylor (16 hours Saturday, 16 hours Sunday) + 2-3 half shifts during the week.
Switched my major from a less marketable degree to nursing during my junior year.
- Year 2: $40,000 salary
After graduating I got a job at a hospital where my base salary started at $40,000. During my first year of training I focused on learning the aspects of the job and didn't do any overtime.
- Year 3: $50,000 salary
After my second year as an RN, I increased my salary by working 16 hour shifts, working holidays, night shifts, most weekends, and volunteering for shifts no one else wanted to work. 
- Year 4: $67,000 salary + husband's $30,000 = $97,000
I worked an ungodly amount of overtime and got married to my husband, who brought $30,000 income to our household. 

**What did we do right?**
-Had an emergency fund of $5,000. I know Dave Ramsey recommends $1,000, but our payoff timeline was so long the larger amount was a necessity.

-Used YNAB to track our expenses religiously.

-Live in the not so nice part of town. My husband and I lived together before we were married, we've been here about six years (before marriage this allowed us to split the bills). We play the fireworks vs. gunshots game at this time of year. Rent is only $800 for a 2 bedroom apartment, however. Reader beware: my car got stolen out of the parking lot and we had to pause the debt payoff to buy a used vehicle.

-After marriage my husband and I combined our income and our accounts. I know there's differing opinions on this, but this in my opinion was essential. We became a debt-fighting team and it really strengthened our marriage and our communication skills. It also helps you learn to compromise.

-No lifestyle upgrades. We are still wearing our clothes from 5+ years ago, we got all our furniture from dead people or thrift stores. I had my beater from highschool with 210,000 miles on it that I only stopped driving because it got stolen. I didn't have a smart phone until last year. Brown bagged it for lunch. My laptop has duct tape holding parts of it together. 

-Worked extremely hard. I came from poverty, but my immigrant parents were militant with me in school and with my work ethic. I've worked every Christmas, every Thanksgiving - in fact I'm working this Friday through Monday over the 4th of July holiday while my friends and family are out BBQ'ing. My husband will work 4-5 twelve hour shifts in a row. There was one month recently where he only had 2 days off from work.

-Paid off my private loans first. These ones are predatory and ruthless. Federal loans you can work with if there's an emergency, so we paid off those second.

-Had a life insurance policy on me so that if I died, my private loans could be paid off so they wouldn't go after my co-signers (parents).

-No car payments, no cable, no vacations. 

-Used [unbury.us](unbury.us) to track our debt payoff. 

**What did we do wrong?**
-Ate out too much at times. We are night shifters so we love going to Walgreens at 3am for snacks. These bad habits are really death by a thousand cuts to a budget.
 
-Acquired 2 pets during our debt payoff. I love our cats but if I would do it again, I would wait. Pets are more expensive than I thought. At one point our older cat was hospitalized to the tune of $1,000.

-I wish we had been a little more careful with our gas and utilities. These weren't budget busters, but sometimes we drove when we could have walked, and I have a bad habit of leaving all the lights on. Every cent counts.

-Utilized the nursing student loan forgiveness program. Nurses who work in facilities in under served areas can have some of their student loan debt forgiven. There are stipulations, and the process is competitive, but I would have qualified because I work in a very impoverished area of the city. I didn't find this out until I was almost done with debt repayment. Here is a link for anyone interested: http://www.hrsa.gov/loanscholarships/repayment/nursing/

-I wish I had considered ROTC or military service in the Navy Nurse Corps.

-Edited to add in another thing I forgot - I wish we had refinanced my private loans with a lender like Sofi back when we had them. I'm not sure these student loan refinance companies existed when we first starting paying off the private loans, but some of those interest rates on my old private loans were 7%. and we could have gotten a better rate, I'm sure.

investing,Professionals: Can you give us some insight into the assumptions that have been fed into equity valuations throughout this past week?,"I'm hoping for some answers that can give us, in very general terms, how the market is thinking about Brexit. Specifically, I'm wondering what are the assumptions that caused the drop on Friday and Monday, and what changed to bring the S&amp;P almost back to pre-Brexit levels. 

Last Friday when the market dropped, I thought that valuations changed based just on the effects of Britain leaving the UK. (e.g. higher import taxes on foreign goods being sold just in the UK.)

But, based on how the market has rebounded, my theory is now that when the Brexit results were announced on Friday, investors assumed the worst - that Brexit would lead to the dissolution of the EU (leading to higher import taxes on foreign goods sold throughout Europe rather than just to the UK). After the weekend, investors firmed up their analyses which lead to an even steeper drop. However, after statements by Merkel and other EU officials that they would work their damnedest to keep the EU together, investors backed off their doomsday assumptions and kept their valuation based just on the effects of Britain leaving the EU, which led to the the rebound we have seen over the past couple of days. Is this about right or am I totally off the mark here?

I'm hoping to get some insight into the current situation, but also some insight into how analysts think about macro events in general and what causes these drastic swings in valuation.

I previously worked around 2 miles from my home (which I rent) and was able to walk to work when I needed to. My wife makes around $20k a year as a trial-owner of a restaurant collective and is set to move to $30k a year once she is able to become a full member-owner. My new (good) job is 18 miles from my house, which makes walking a non-starter. 

My grandmother had given me a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer when one of my uncles gave her his wife's older car. I'm now facing about $1400 in repairs to the Blazer to get it running again, plus another $200 in repair to get it to pass state inspection after a pretty catastrophic failure while my wife was grocery shopping the other day. I've decided that it's no good to put that much into repairs of a vehicle when the net value is approaching zero.

I have not been able to fully fund an emergency account since I've had my new job as I've been focused on catching up on bills since then. Together we have about $120k in student loans that we're trying our best to keep up on. 

The Blazer is worth about $2k but with the repairs it is close to zero in actual value. At this point, I need to secure a new car (my wife can walk to work as it's just up the block and I've been able to borrow our roommate's car since I'm on third shift at the moment and he's on daylight).

Our credit is pretty bad since we have a few hospital bills that we were unable to pay before I got decent insurance. We were also reckless and plagued by alcohol abuse in the first few years of our marriage and pissed away a lot of money and ran up a lot of credit that we're paying on now.

I would like to get an SUV for our new car but have been unable to find anything that I would be able to purchase with the about $5k in savings we have in preparation for buying a car that wouldn't be approaching a serious milestone in parts and labor to keep running. I'm seriously considering buying a new car because the interest rates are better than what I can find for used car of three to five years old. I'm really up a wall here and have always heard that new cars are a luxury but if we're talking a difference of $1-2k or so between an SUV with 20k miles versus a new car, I really don't see the advantage of going with the used since I'll secure a new car with close to the same amount.

investing,Trending Value: Breaking Down a Proven Quantitative Investing Strategy,"The trending value strategy was developed by James O'Shaughnessy and detailed in his book What Works on Wall Street as one of the best performing strategies, using a combination of value and growth metrics.

Every metric in this strategy is commonly used by millions of investors every day; but when they are combined in a specific way, the results can be extraordinary.

[Cumulative % Return, Trending Value vs All Stocks \(1964 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/toENS0y.png)


[Portfolio Performance, Trending Value vs All Stocks \(1965 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/1VEmLIm.png)

O'Shaughnessy begins by backtesting strategies using one value metric at a time. For example, a strategy that is only invested in the stocks in the top decile (lowest 10%) of price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) and rebalanced every year. And likewise using price-to-book ratio (P/B), price-to-sales ratio (P/S), and price-to-cash flow ratio (P/CF). He also looks at enterprise value to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxs, depreciation and amortization) ratio (EV/EBITDA), which was the single best performing value factor he backtested. (For each of these 5 factors, low values are better).

Another factor he looked at was shareholder yield (SHY), which is buyback (how many stocks are repurchased by the company (i.e., decrease in number of outstanding shares)) plus dividends divided by market capitalization. (For shareholder yield, higher is better). The results for the top decile of these factors (lowest (or highest for SHY) 10%, rebalanced annually) are below (with all stocks for comparison).

[Performance \(1965 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/Mn17pXe.png)

By themselves, all of these factors beat the overall stock market. But combining the factors, coming up with a composite score and investing in the top decile of composite scores, yields even better results. To develop the composite scores, a ranking for each factor is given to each stock in the universe of stocks. So the stock with the lowest P/E gets a score of 100, the stock with the lowest SHY gets a 1, and so on (this can be done with the PERCENTRANK function in Excel (or 1 - PERCENTRANK for SHY, since higher numbers are better), or much more seamlessly using a more powerful tool like Portfolio123).

The ranks for each factor of a stock are added up for its composite score. O'Shaughnessy looked at 3 different value composite scores: value composite 1 (VC1) used the factors described above except SHY, value composite 2 (VC2) add SHY to VC1, and value composite 3 replaces SHY with just buyback yield. The returns for top decile of each of these composite scores is below (rebalanced annually).

[Performance \(1964 - 2009\)](http://i.imgur.com/8KSY0vu.png)

Each value composite is a significant improvement over any individual factor. Composites are more powerful than just screening for the best values of the individual factors because a stock that may be deficient in one metric but excellent in the others would get eliminated from consideration by screening (e.g., a stock in the top decile of VC2 may not necessarily be in the top decile for all of the individual factors).

To implement the trending value strategy, you simply invest in the top 25 stocks sorted by 6-month % price change (the ""trending"" part of the name) among the top decile of stocks ranked by VC2 (O'Shaughnessy chose VC2 over VC3 because of its slightly higher Sharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted return).

The universe of stocks is limited to those with a market capitalization of more than $200M (in 2009 $) to avoid liquidity problems with trading smaller stocks. It's a buy and hold strategy that is rebalanced annually with the following exceptions. If a company fails to verify its financial numbers, is charged with fraud by the Federal government, restates its numbers so that it would not have been in the top 25, receives a buyout offer and the stock price moves within 95% of the buyout price, or if the price drops more than 50% from when you bought it and is in the bottom 10% of all stocks in price performance for the last 12 months, the stock is replaced in the portfolio.

So what's the catch? There are a few:

* The Data: While most of the metrics described are freely available from any number of online sources, some (e.g., buyback yield) aren't as easy to come by, and I still haven't found a free way to obtain all of the data for all of the stocks at once.
* Psychology: While the trending value strategy has never underperformed the market for any rolling 5-, 7-, or 10-year periods between 1964 and 2009, it has underperformed the market for rolling 1-year periods 15% of the time, and 3-year period 1% of the time.

personalfinance,"Want to start paying my student loans in the fall, where do I start and is it even worth it to start now?","I'm currently going into my senior year of my undergrad pursuing a psych degree, and want to start paying some of my loans now as I will be paying my mom and dads Parent + loans at the same time when I graduate next May. I don't expect to make any major dents in it, but I want to start early. 

Heres my loan breakdown (according to Nelnet.com, they are due 1/18/2019): TOTAL AMOUNT = $19,519.60

* Loan A = $1,942 @ 3.86%

* Loan B = $3,912.01 @ 3,86% - including the interest that its 
accrued. It has $354.01 in interest

* Loan C = $4,500 at 4.660% interest

* Loan D = $1,618.03 @ 4.660% interest - accrued interest is $111.03

* Loan E = $5,500 @ 4.29%

* Loan F = $ 2,047.56 @4,29% - accrued $47.56 in interest already.

Now that I listed the loans, here is my monthly income and bills:

*Gross income per month = $1,400/mo.*

**Monthly bills (insurance, gas, phone, etc.) = $450/mo.**

**Money set aside for fun: $100/mo. Whatever isn't used goes to emergency fund**

So with the money I have left every month, is it even worth paying right now? I want to make a small dent in them before I leave college to work full time. My *expected* salary at my company when I work full time is $35k-$40k a year. 

Now I'm assuming that I should pay the highest interest rates first, but do I just focus on tackling one loan at a time, or pay each one at the same time. I really want to pay these off in 5 years (my loans and the parent+ loans), so what should my best strategy be? After making some financial decisions that weren't so smart, I live more frugally and budget pretty well. I live with my parents so rent and groceries are paid by them.",finance,1467293814

personalfinance,Should we buy a new car?,"Both me and my wife are 26, full time students and working full time. We take home somewhere between 70 and 80 thousand a year in combined income. We both have 11 thousand in student loan debt but should not need to borrow for school again as I'm going to be using the post 9/11 GI bill for my tuition when I exit community college and we make enough to pay for her CSU tuition with grants and our own income.

We own 2 cars. A 2009 Toyota Rav4 with about 60,000 miles on it, that car is fine and should be for the foreseeable future. The problem car is the 2008 Hyundai Elantra. It has 150,000 miles, which is fine, but its had an uncharacteristically large maintenance bill since we bought it. About 3500 in 2 years. I'm fairly sure it had been in an unreported front end collision, the dash board is split in the middle, which I've read can be caused by air bag activation or being out in the sun for too long. The air bag light also turns on and off frequently and the mechanic we use has told me if the light is on, the air bag will not actuate. That is my main concern. I'm not sure I'm willing spent another 2 grand to diagnose and fix another problem on this car nor do I feel comfortable driving in a car which may or may not feel like deploying its air bags in the event of an accident.

My wife has good credit, I do not. My bad credit situation is due to a series of poor, but willful decisions I made in 2008. Since then I have paid the full balance of all my delinquent debts, rehabilitated my student loan and managed to obtain a stable life. We have $11,000 cash which we are willing to use for a down payment but can tap up to $15,000 if needed. We currently save around $1000 a month unless we need to make a tuition payment. After some discussion we decided the most we are willing to spend on a car payment is 300-400 per month.

I know nothing about auto loans or if we are even in a position to borrow. We are looking to borrow with Navy Federal Credit Union. This would be the first new car any of us have ever owned if we do and we are considering a Prius or an Elantra. Would it be better for us to buy used again or go forward with our current plan to buy new.

personalfinance,Too much debt listed in my credit report... Can I move forward?,"So some background first...

I'm 25, male, just graduated in December, landed a job in public accounting, making decent money for my city.

This is where I'm pretty... frustrated...

I saved up 10K in cash and 10K in investments and now I think i'm good to leave my parents house. I'm planning to rent for the next 2 years since I'll start graduate school in August. 

What are the chances of being approved for a lease with the ridiculous amount of debt on my credit report?

$35,000 for my car $585 a month 0% interest rate ( I know not technically zero $16.77 per $1000 financed)

$12,000 co-signed for my little brother $284 5% interest rate... this should drop off as soon as his buyer takes over payments officially

$24,000 or so... for my step-dads car. $402 6.8% interest rate.

$37,000 my student loans interest ranges from %4 to 6.8% They want $240 a month I'm throwing $600 at them. 

I have no credit card debt, total combined limit of $32,000.

So I'm sure the kicker here is going to be the car for my step dad... he has awful credit n the 400's or so. We were told (probably false) by the dealership that he should make payments to the car using checks coming out of my parents small business so that in 6 months a credit union will see that he's making the payments and they'll refinance the car under his name. I'm super skeptical, I worked for a bank for 5 years and we didn't do those kinds of deals. I don't pay anything towards my little brothers car and we pay it out my account then he reimburses me ( I feel safer that way). That was my original condition for buying the car with for my step-dad. So I lose peace of mind if it's not coming out of my account.

Okay for the real question here, I'm expecting a bonus and raise fairly soon I only make $37k a year so far and I'm not looking at anything expensive for a rental probable around $500 for rent about $50 for water $35 internet and $200 a year for renters insurance.

My debt to income ratio concerns me (over 200%) would I even qualify for a cheap lease? If worse comes to worse I'd be able to foot the bill for that car for a few months but my parents already owe me north of $5,000.

personalfinance,Opinions of this tactic for eliminating high interest debt faster?,"In the past, I've been an idiot with my finances. As a result, I have credit card debt and a fairly high interest auto loan. The numbers are as follows: 

###Discover Credit Card:  
**Current Balance:** $1,650.27  
**Interest Rate:** 23.24% variable  
**Current Minimum Payment:** $53.00/mo  
**Current Payments:** $243.00/mo

###Wells Fargo Credit Card  
**Current Balance:** $2,171.11  
**Interest Rate:** 21.40% variable  
**Current Minimum Payment:** $64.00/mo  
**Current Payments:** $64.00/mo

###Local Credit Union Car Loan:

**Interest Rate:** 12.49%  
**Minimum Payment:** $145.49/mo  
**Current Payments:**  $145.49/mo  

My overall strategy to eliminate this is the snowball method - focus everything on the highest interest debt and then move that payment over to next highest, etc. In my case, this means the order is Discover, then Wells Fargo, then Local Credit Union.

I'm paying everything that I can afford into these debts, but I'm still looking at around 1 year 8 months till I'm debt free.

###My Earnings

**Pre-tax:**  
$22.50/hour  
$3,600/4 weeks  
$46,800/year  

**Post Tax:**  
~$16.25/hour  
~$2,600/4 weeks  
~$33,800/year

Obviously, taxes take up a lot of my income. This leads me to the tactic I mentioned in the title: **would it be worth it to have no taxes withheld from my paychecks for a limited duration?** That would give me approximately $1,000 extra money a month to pay down those credit cards with. If I had nothing withheld for 3 months, I could completely finish off Discover and only have $600-ish on Wells Fargo. That'd be (comparatively) easy to knock out. At that point, I could start putting my money to work for me. 

Everyone always says that income taxes and having extra withheld to be later refunded is basically just giving the government a free loan. Rather than having that money languish, I'd rather have it knock out 20+% interest rates for me. 

This last year, I got around $1,500 refunded to me. Assuming that I net $3,000 more in three months' paychecks, that would suggest that I'd owe the government approximately $1,500 come tax time. Obviously, the numbers are not that simple, and that's not exactly correct, but I suspect that's around the correct ballpark. 

**tl;dr:** Should I stop having taxes withheld for a limited duration and instead use that money to pay down high-interest credit card debt?",finance,1467299071

Hypothetically, I am 21 years old, have $0 to my name, but just today got my first job that pays $100k a year.  After federal and state taxes, as well as accounting for future food, rent, and other miscellaneous expenses, I am left with around $20k a year in potential savings.

personalfinance,Parenthood just became an extremely costly endeavor. My child care costs are slightly more expensive than my Mortgage.,"Hey /r/personalfinance

I normally don't post here too often, but I feel like I am on the verge of financial disaster... Again. 

I am not sure if it is the psychological after effects of growing up mostly poor, or how I super screwed myself in 2008 (I have recovered since then, low-700's credit score, home owner, etc) but after having my first child, I can say that I honestly feel like I am very, very close to being back in a pre-2008 financial condition. 

My wife and I have a combined income of around $89K. We have about $3000 in checking, $6000 in savings. This is a standard amount, but currently we manage to save $6000/yr, or there-abouts.

We have a mortgage of $1008/mo. I pay extra on principal whenever I can.

We pay $350 on her student loans/mo. I don't have any student loans. 

We are paying off the loan we had to take out (at 0% interest) to pay off the child's birth (maybe owe $1400 left @ $200/mo)

We have one car loan payment which is $400/mo for the next 3 years and 5 months. (interest rate of 3.99%)
(We pay about $1200/yr in car taxes because of the oppressiveness of Connecticut's taxing structure, but that's a different story)

Very little by the way of credit card debt, less than $1000 combined over all five accounts perhaps, most on a no interest purchase from Lowes.

I have an 80% efficient oil burning furnace, and burned through 600 gal of oil this heating year (infants make it so you have to keep the house kind-of warm).

The cost of raising a child is pretty minimal (diapers, formula, food, etc) except for child care cost. The lowest infant care cost from a reputable source in the area I can find is $254/wk. $1016 a month. 

Here's the problem. The child care cost is new, and at my current rate of savings of $6k year (down from 12k a year before the child and house, by the way) I will run out of reserves in half a year and become savings negative. Then after that, my savings rate will not grow as fast as my spending rate for child care. We used to have two full time baby sitters who are family members, but both of them are going to go through surgeries in the next two weeks which makes it so they cannot baby sit at all anymore. 

I normally feel relatively positive about my financial outlook, but I just can't see how I can come out on top of this. I take home about $650/wk after deductions, my wife is about $1200 bi-weekly. I average it to about $70k take home. Right off the top, I am now seeing the following deductions:

$70k-$13208 = $56792 (child care)

$56792-$12095 = $44,697 (mortgage)

$44697-$4800 = $39897 (car payments)

$39897-$1400 = $38497 (remainder of child birth loan)

$38497-$4200 = $34297 (student loans) edit: this said car loans twice. 

$35Kish left after all mandatory deductions / 12 = $2916/mo

Other costs:
$150 monthly combined car insurance

$158 cellphone bills

$120 internet/cable bill 

$165 energy generation bills (thanks for the huge increase, Eversource!)

$200 amortized heating cost

------
$2916-$793 = $2123/mo for food, gas, groceries, clothing and shoes when needed, baby things, car repair, savings account replenishment, house repair, etc. 



This number seems like it should be do-able to survive. But for some reason, it doesn't feel like it is. The actual cost of living in CT is pretty high in the form of taxation and ""nickel and diming"". I have gone over the budget in my head before and something doesn't seem the add up.

I'm at work right now but my situation is the only thing on my mind. I'm going to readjust my w4 credits to 0. I bring in about 2300 a month (about 1850 after taxes). I'm also trying to sign up for an online university to get a degree in business (accounting or management).

When we first got married right out of college we were just worried about having money to pay our light bill some months because of all of the school debt we have. We probably have 45k of school debt left to pay at this point. Some of it is a modest 3.5% interest rate, but some of it is up at a ridiculous 9%. We have no car payment at the moment.

No one is willing to help.,"Someone paid part of my student loan through an ACH payment in June 2013 from their Chase Bank account. In February 2015, my student loan servicer notified me that Chase Bank pulled the money back, stating that the account holder said it was fraud (it wasn't). The amount was north of $10,000. The student loan servicer added the amount back to my loans that I still owed. To make matters worse, they included a year and a half of retroactive interest, even though they were holding onto the money for that entire time!

I am no longer in contact with the account holder. I have tried reaching out, but to no avail.
(Edit for clarity: This is someone I was involved with years ago that I have no more contact with. Unfortunately I cannot contact them. I'm guessing it was more of an accident where they were going through their statements from previous years and didn't remember making the payment, so they said it was fraud. But I don't know.

personalfinance,"Just received my financial aid offer for college, as someone who works full time and is very careful of his credit - should I accept?","So i work full time,  and have a good career.  I filed a FAFSA just because I was told you might as well try to see how much you can get offered.  

Right now I'm just doing my core classes in a community college to save money,  as I work full time in engineering I just do 3 classes a semester. It runs at about $1500. The past few semesters I've just paid it up front because as someone who earns a good wage I honestly thought I would not get any federal financial aid. 

Turns out I am eligible. They offered me $1700 for the semester subsidized and $3000 unsubsidized.  

Now, I understand the unsubsidized $3k is charged interest which I won't take. 

The $1700 subsidized I am told is charged no interest at all. 

However,  I can pretty much afford to pay for this upfront.  It kind of sucks paying $1500 upfront but I can do it.  

Although,  I tempted to take the subsidized loan and just pay it off maybe $100 a month over the next year or so and it  will already be paid off before I graduate. Paying it like this will be less painful and leave me with some savings for the year should I need to repair my house or my car.   

However,. Once I've done my core classes at the cheap community college I am transferring to a high level University to finish my engineering degree,  which is going to be very expensive. 

Someone warned me to save all my financial aid offerings,  they said I should not accept any aid,  until I transfer to the expensive University.  

Is this true?  Would taking the subsidized loans now and paying them off before I transfer to the university hurt my financial aid awards when I go there?  

Is there some sort of limit to how much they can offer?  Say it's $15k of subsidized in total and they offer me $1.5k per semester than would mean it runs out after 10 semesters?  

At the higher level university  we are talking about maybe $2-3000 per class at the University which I would def need loans to help.

Lastly,  how do student loans effect your credit rating?  I know I would not have any payments due until I graduate,  but would accepting the $1700 subsidized loan be visible on my debt to income ratio?  Would it affect my credit score at all? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I just spoke to the financial aid office.  They told me to be aware of the fact that financial aid is only eligible for a 6 year term. As someone who plans on studying part time with 2 or 3 classes per semester I expect to be studying for a long time... However,  they said that the 6 year limit doesn't begun until I take my first loan,  which means if I can,  I should save it for the University when I really need it.",finance,1467314504

personalfinance,Having a hard time figuring out what to do with my savings.,"Hello all, this is my first time on here although I lurk and read advice on here. Let me know if I am breaking any rules. 

I am an Engineering student and have had internships last three years and managed to save 11k (3k for personal spending). I don't want that 11k to sit in the savings with such low interest rates. I am looking into stocks but I am not going to even go there till I am confident enough and learn the fundamentals. 

I have debated on throwing them in a CD but it seems like that is a waste as I won't get much in return. What are some of the options I should be looking into and exploring? Bonds? I won't be needing/using this money in the near future (2-3 years). Should I invest in 401k?",finance,1467317518
personalfinance,Question about paying off debt too fast,"So I am going to graduate from college next semester and am curious about how I should go about paying off my student debt. When i graduate I will have roughly ~50k in loans all with interest rates hovering around 6-7%. Now I know i've heard alot on this sub to pay off loans as quick as possible, but i've also heard (and please correct me if im wrong) if you pay off debt too quick, you can be taxed pretty hard.

About me a little:

I will be graduating next december with my degree in engineering. I have a written and signed offer for 95k and my girlfriend (also an engineer) who will also be graduating has a written and signed offer for 120k. She will be graduating with no debt as her grandparents had a trust fund for her. We will be looking at buying a house early on so that we can build equity ASAP, probably within the 100k-200k range.

So my question is, with that being said, should i pay off all my loans immediately? (ie before my grace period is up) or should i be making monthly payments on it?

Thanks",finance,1467317943
personalfinance,Saw a job posting from my employers offering more than double my current wage and I am more than qualified. How do I approach the topic or should I not even bother?,"First time posting and not sure if this is the right sub for it. Please let me know if it isn't. 

I currently work full-time at a family-run escape room facility making a little over minimum wage. While I am considered a loyal employee (worked here since its opening two years ago), as a recent graduate, I'm always looking for something (financially) better. I noticed a job posting from my employers looking for a customer service supervisor for a different branch, offering more than double my current wage. What bums me out is that their job description is basically everything I'm doing right now, and that my branch here is clearly over-staffed and I was never made aware of this new opening elsewhere. 

I've already tried asking for a raise a few months back when they wanted to make me a supervisor at their new cafe, but the reply given to me is ""that isn't how we do things here"" and that I will get a *dollar* raise for every year I stay with them. If that sounds weird, it's because they have a Chinese immigrant worker mentality.

Is it even worth approaching my employers about their job posting and possible opportunity? How should I go about it if I do? Or should I continue looking elsewhere since my employers seem ~~bonkers~~ like a lost cause? I don't want to burn bridges regardless because I'll probably need references in the future with my lack of employment history.

personalfinance,Buying second property?,"I have been wanting to move for awhile now and have been trying to do some repairs and get my finances in order before I put my house up for sale. The primary reason for wanting to move is needing more space, I'm always working on something and my 2 car garage just doesn't cut it. A couple days ago a property down the road came up for sale with a large shop on it. There is no house on the property but being so close to my current house the thought was to keep it and buy the other property. My question is do I refinance my house and include the new property under one mortgage or keep it separate? I bought my current house in Jan 08 right before the housing bubble burst so I have a higher interest rate (I put off refinancing it earlier since I was planning to sell) and my rough calculations say that with a lower interest rate and adding the new property in my payment would only increase ~$150 a month. I have excellent credit so getting the financing shouldn't be a problem.",finance,1467319621

personalfinance,Asking for help with my budget/plan,"Hello everyone. I've been browsing this subreddit for awhile and finally decided to create a profile and post a plan I've had. Please help me by critiquing my budget/plan.  I made a throwaway because this is pretty specific.

Details:

Married

30 years old

Midwest in a moderate cost of living city (between Chicago and Detroit COL wise)

Household base salary of $132k with upward trajectory and bonus potential (leaving out)

Me: $72k in finance + side income of $5-10k/year with high potential for management in 2-3 years ($100k+)

Her: $60k base +bonus $5k in customer service management with little room for upward mobility but completely happy with current role and work-life balance

Plan: Max 401k 36,000 (Taxable income = $96k)

After tax income = roughly $79k (fed + 3.4% state + 1.77% local)

Max Roth $11,000

Health insurance/paycheck deductions = roughly $4,000 ($150/biweekly paycheck)

Remaining: $64,000

Average monthly spending current = $2,500 x 12 = $30,000 (includes semi-annual and annual budgeted items such as auto insurance, tags, gifts, etc.) tracked via Mint

Remaining after ""normal"" spending $34,000

Ideas for remaining funds:

$10k investments (not sure)

$10k experiences (mostly travel as we have a healthy entertainment budget monthly)

$10k stuff/toys (car replacement, boat, motorcycle, etc.)

$4k buffer

Questions/Additional Notes:

    This budget will start in February 2017 as we will have paid off all non-mortgage debt of $40k

    E-fund has $12k which is 4+ months' average spending

    Non-mortgage debt is $40k (student loans, car, old debt/garnishment, medical bill avg. 5% interest rate) will be paid by Feb 3rd 2017 (paying ~$2,500 per biweekly paycheck on this)

    What else can I do to lower my tax burden legally?

    What non-401k/IRA avenues are available to us for long-term savings. I'm thinking of starting with real-estate and buying a duplex which can be very cheap in my area with decent rents. Or starting a side business

    Is there anything I'm missing? We were making a combined $30k 4 years ago and it's steadily increased with $20k raises/promotions for each of us in the past 14 months ($40k total increase)

Thanks for any and all feedback! I feel we have enough room in our budget to have fun and $10k on top for experiences almost seems excessive so I wanted to know if this plan makes sense. Future raises/side income can be absorbed into the different buckets.",finance,1467322311

personalfinance,"Starting HLS, hoping for some loan advice","I'm going to Harvard Law this fall. I have my cost of living expenses covered by my parents but I don't think they'll be contributing to tuition, so my student loans need to cover tuition (and fees) totalling $60,800. I didn't qualify for any need-based grants, and I'll be taking out Stafford loans of $20,500. 

Should I take out GraduatePLUS loans or should I shop around for private loans? I have an excellent credit score and I might secure low interest rates in private loans. 

I also have about $40,000 in jointly held liquid assets. We planned on using that in the future for a  down payment, but it might be better going towards student loans. What does this community think about this?

I understand that many people don't think law school is a good investment, but I decided it's for me, so please withhold those comments.",finance,1467327040

personalfinance,Fiancee and I are buying my childhood home from my parents at a discount. We also have crazy student loans. Can we turn this to our advantage?,"Here's the skinny:

In the relatively near future my fiancee and I will be buying my childhood home from my mother and stepmother.  They each own half of the house and are not married.  My mother currently lives elsewhere, I currently rent an apartment with my fiancee, my stepmother lives in my childhood home.  My mother is prepared to gift me her half of the house and I will essentially buy out my stepmother who in turn is using that money to buy a house for herself.  For a ballpark financial figure, the house is worth around $700k, we would be buying it for around $350k.  Together my fiancee and I earn a bit north of $80k/yr and currently pay $1350/mo to live in our apartment.  This all takes place in Massachusetts.

Here's the meat:

My fiancee has about $55k in student loans totaling in a minimum monthly payment of about $675.  The loans are broken up into a bunch of little ones with interest rates ranging anywhere from about 3.5% to 6.8%.  So we are getting absolutely murdered on these.

We want to know if the thought of us getting a house like this is financially sound at all before we add the loans to the equation.  From there, can we find a way to work her loans into the mortgage, or work the equity from my mother's gifted half, in order to get a better rate and overall value than what we're paying now?

I feel like I might have an advantage because I'd be a pretty safe bet -- if I default, the bank would get nearly 1.5x the value of what I've borrowed from taking the house.  Which, if we are *sure* all the monthly rates are manageable, is a risk we think we're ready to assume.  But I only know one thing about this whole process which is that I really don't know anything about this whole process.

Am I in as good a spot as I think we might be, or am I misreading this?  And is there anything you see that I haven't thought of?

Thank you!",finance,1467330526
