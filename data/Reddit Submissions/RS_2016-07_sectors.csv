personalfinance,Should I keep extra credit cards around?,"Ok, So my husband and I were looking at our credit scores (which are both around 790/800 so pretty good), and we noticed that our length of credit is only ""fair.""

I'm not a fan of carrying around credit cards I KNOW I'm not going to use. Now that costco doesn't take amex, I'm in favor of just cancelling the card, because that is literally the only reason we ever use that card at this point, as our other (visa) main card has better rewards for using it. We also have an old REI credit card which is a VISA, and frankly, we have all the camping supplies we need for the forseable future so the rewards are relatively uninteresting to us. 

I get having one ""main"" card with great rewards, and a backup in case that one gets stolen or something... but I feel like we should dump either the REI VISA or the AMEX, but my husband says because they are our oldest lines of credit, we should keep them just for the sake of keeping them.

**What is the recommendation of PF? Close or Keep?**

Added note: we have no carrying-over credit card debt and pay off the total every month, regardless of what card is used, so the varying interest rates aren't really a factor in this decision. We also have a VERY comfortable emergency fund, so having credit available in an emergency isn't really part of the issue either.

Edit: No fees on any of the cards. So per advice I guess we'll just keep them even though it seems weird to me!",finance,1467336470

personalfinance,Renewing a Federal Stafford Unsubsidized Loan for Second Year in Undergrad,"Hi, I'm sorry if this question is dumb and/or doesn't belong here, but you guys are very helpful so hopefully this is easy and you can be on your way!

I'm having trouble finding information on how to actually *renew* or reapply for a second federal unsubsidized loan for my sophomore year in undergrad. Most of the information I see is about first-time borrowers (I borrowed last year and already filled out an MPN and went through entrance counseling). I filled out my FAFSA, and my university has suggested the Federal Unsubsidized as a ""loan option"", but I'm not sure what my next steps are. Looking over the NSLDS I still only have the first year loan, so I feel like doing the FAFSA alone didn't really do anything.

personalfinance,30 year or 15 year refinance,"We expect to move to a new house in two years. I can refinance today at a significantly lower interest rate and no fees.

This seems to make a refinance a no brainer, but should I go with a 30 year or 15 year?

If I take a 30 year and then immediately start putting the difference in monthly payment between my old loan and my new loan towards an additional principal payment, then when I sell in 2 years I should have around $10,000 more equity in my home than if I didn’t refinance.

If I take a 15 year loan and don’t make an additional principal payment, my monthly payment will go up by around $900 dollars but I will end up with almost $35,000 more in equity when I sell than if I didn’t refinance.

My question is whether the additional equity is worth the risk. I am confident I can pay the higher loan amount right now, but I anticipate taking a new job within the next year that is a steep salary cut. There’s also a not-huge but non-trivial chance my current job suddenly asks me to leave. We have ok emergency reserves; maybe 4-6 months in savings and checking and another 6-9 months in the market.

If I lost my job, or immediately took a big pay cut, or we didn’t move for more than two years, the higher loan payment would quickly become a very big headache. But I feel like I’m leaving a lot of equity on the table by not grabbing the lower rate.

A hybrid option would be to do the 30 yr loan but put the difference between the 15 year monthly payment and the 30 year monthly payment towards the loan each month. That would get me around $28,000 in equity if I’m able to keep up the extra principal payment, but would give me flexibility if I lose income.

So I guess my question is whether its worth limiting my financial flexibility to seek an extra $7,000 in equity. Or if I should play it safer and/or consider a different approach entirely.",finance,1467338335

Bitcoin,Can someone explain to me how Abra Tellers are not classified as money transmitters?,"https://youtu.be/gr0kKwbMs5o

In this video at 5:24 the founder of Abra says that:

'the transaction is peer-to-peer and not through a money transfer company and therefore (the sender/receiver) does not need to present ID or fill out forms.'

It seems to me that he is largely implying that the Abra teller is NOT a legal money transmitter. Am I correct? This seems to run contrary to the definition of money transmitter as defined by US federal and state law outlined by prominent Bitcoin Lawer Marco Santori in 2013: http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-law-what-us-businesses-need-to-know/. Can someone explain why he is saying this? Any references to their statements regarding this question please?

I think Abra's vision is for remittances to initiate FROM the US and go TO immigrant countries. Is it possible that they foresee only one end (The US side) needing to be legal money transferer and the other end's country being too inept to notice non-licensed tellers? Could this model possibly work?

Bonus question: If I am sending Bitcoin denominated in USD, couldn't the value of the Bitcoin change during the transit and therefore the receiver would be getting more or less than intended? How are they dealing with this caveat?",cryptocurrency,1467352148

ethereum,Casper interest rates as a futarchy Objective function,"There has been a lot of interest in [futarchy](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/) as a mechanism for governing decentralized autonomous organizations, bottom-level protocol decisions (probably too late for the DAO fork but for something like Serenity certainly) and challenges like determining where to allocate funds for public goods development. Essentially, every time there is a choice to be made, use a prediction market to determine what people think the score of some desired outcome metric would be if decision A is made, and what score would be if decision B is made, and take the one that the market thinks would provide a better outcome.

Both in a decentralized context and in its original proposed context in national and corporate governance, however, an important challenge is: what exactly is the outcome metric that the futarchy tries to optimize? So far, in the context of DAOs on top of ethereum, I have advocated the use of the DAO token/ETH price for the token of that particular DAO. The advantage of this metric is that it is easy to measure in a decentralized way, and the measurement algorithm poses few avenues for corruption. However, there are obvious downfalls - many DAOs want to do things other than maximize profit, have ethical constraints, serve some social objective even at the expense of profit maximizations, so alternate metrics are desired.

One alternative metric that I have come up with, inspired by both Avsa's [fork vote by ether commitment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4qo3f9/fork_vote_by_ether_commitment_version_2/) and my discussions with [Ralph Merkle](http://www.coindesk.com/ralph-merkle-is-back-and-he-wants-to-resurrect-daos/) where I pointed out that a ""futarchy as world government"" would need to have a reliable way of detecting the probability of existential risks or else it would dangerously ignore such scenarios, is the use of interest rates on long-term bonds as an objective function - the lower the better. Interest rates signify people's willingness to make long-term commitments for the future, and sacrifice both present enjoyment and present optionality for a greater return in a world that, in extremis, may possibly not even exist; the lower the market interest rate is, the more people are willing to commit. The Ethereum protocol, and DAOs, are both areas where existential risks are very high, and arguably the long-term stability of the system is precisely the ""social value"" that we want the protocol to provide.

Additionally, in the case of Ethereum specifically, proof of stake will come with a requirement to deposit and lock down one's funds for 4 months in order to participate - and if a validator node acts incorrectly then the deposit may be completely destroyed, a risk that makes proof of stake bonds very hard to securitize (ie. make tradeable via some kind of wrapper contract backed by the bond). Hence, people's willingness to participate in proof of stake arguably corresponds heavily to trust in the stability of the system at least for Casper's 4-month term. Note that there are two proposed versions of Casper, one which targets a fixed level of participation and adjusts interest rates to compensate and one which provides a fixed interest rate and lets participation levels float - in the first case, low interest rates can be the objective function, and in the second case it can be a high percentage of ether participating in Casper. If the markets predict a lower interest rate, or a higher level of ether participation, if a given proposal is accepted, then the proposal likely benefits protocol and ecosystem stability and therefore is likely good.

Note that the metric is definitely gameable in some circumstances - for example, a hypothetical malicious proposal that prints 100 million new ether and donates them to future Casper participants will definitely secure high participation levels and low ""official"" interest rates (the de-facto interest rate including the 100m new ether will of course be massive). Hence, this mechanism cannot be given absolute power over the system and should be used in conjunction with either social consensus, voting, or a secondary futarchy that actually does try to maximize the price of ETH or some DAO token (or a combination of all three; in my opinion good governance is in most cases multi-heuristic).",cryptocurrency,1467361324

personalfinance,"(US, VA) Can gifts that earn tax credits can earn a net profit for High Earners?","I work with a non-profit organization in Virginia that is an ""Approved Partner"" of the [Neighborhood Assistance Program](http://www.doe.virginia.gov/school_finance/neighborhood_assistance_act/).  The program offers a Virginia tax credit equal to 65% of qualified donations to my organization (and many others).  I believe that I've found a way that high-income individuals can make money by donating to my program.  However, my understanding of income tax may be flawed, and I'm hoping that r/personalfinance can help me to understand this better.

**My understanding**

I looked up the [2016 Federal income tax rates](http://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets) as well as the [Virginia income tax rates](http://taxfoundation.org/article/state-individual-income-tax-rates-and-brackets-2016) to calculate the net cost of a donation.  

My understanding is that charitable donations are deducted from your income prior to calculating both federal and state income tax. 
While a State Tax Credit applies like a payment (after taxes are calculated).  

**Example**

A couple that earns a combined income of $165,000 gives a $1,000 gift that is eligible for a NAP (65%) state tax credit.

* Filing Jointly, their Federal Tax rate is 28%, saving them $280 in federal income tax.
* Their State Income Tax Rate (5.75%) saves them $57.50 in Virginia Income Tax.
* The Tax Credit (65% of their donation) reduces their State Income Tax payment by $650.

So $1,000 - $280 - $57.50 - $650 = $12.50

After taxes, the $1000 charitable donation would cost the couple $12.50 (based on my understanding).

**Making Money**

In the example, the couple was in the 28% Federal tax bracket, but there are 3 tax brackets above that one:

* Rate.........Single Filer.........Married, Joint.........Net Cost per $1,000  
* 33%........$190k-$413k.......$231k-$413k.........-$37.50 (=profit)
* 35%........$413k-$415k.......$413k-$466k........ -$57.50 (=profit)
* 39.6%.....$415k+...............$466k+.................-103.50 (=profit)

personalfinance,Overwhelmed and terrified by a high credit limit,"Super long story: My credit was in the toilet due to sharing credit with two past boyfriends (lesson learned).

I've drilled away at my debt over the past four months and just been given a high-limit credit card, even though my credit is less than stellar, but the interest rate was about 5% lower than my current card (transferred my current balance, naturally).

I've consolidated the rest of my bills into the new card, just because for me the ease of payment and convenience of not having to deal with what feels like endless payment arrangements overrides paying an extra 15%. Plus with everything in one place I can make relatively large payments that won't allow much interest to accrue while maintaining a consistent credit history, whereas paying these bills by themselves would have no effect on my credit at all.

So my question is this: I'm usually extremely impulsive, and I'm worried about doing what so many people my age do and maxing out my credit card on stupid frivolous things. All of my regular bills are current (and were before getting the new card), so I'm not using my credit for regular expenses yet (and won't until the balance is paid off), and even with large credit card payments, I'm making enough to set aside money for regular savings.

Bitcoin,The economic disconnect still astonishes me sometimes.,"If you get the average person all hot and bothered about political problems you will almost certainly hear a few repeated and common complaints.  Here are the ones I always run into:

&gt;1. Banks.  The financial system is cheating us.  They have committed fraud and have taken retirements and so on.  Our financial system needs to be put in check and its time we band together and get the government to do something about it.

&gt;2. Poverty. Poor people keep getting poorer, businesses do everything they can to pay people absolutely nothing at every opportunity.  They are racist and hate the little guy and lobby endlessly to keep the minimum wage at a point where the impoverished are always in need.  Its time the government stepped in and raised the minimum wage so that we can fix this problem and get the poor the wages they deserve.

&gt;3. High prices.  The market is so evil!  Prices are always going up and it hurts everyone.  Housing and education prices keep going up so fast that no one can afford them.  Its hurting our country and preventing people from getting the homes and the education they need to live a comfortable, fulfilling life.  Its time the government did something to make them more affordable and put the evil price risers in check!

I hear these arguments incessantly and what is so extraordinary is that the very second I suggest that our money contributes to every one of these problems their story **immediately shifts 180º**

So my response is generally a much less direct and more appealing version of this: 

&gt;Me=1. Well the government and the central bank have monopolized a system in which new money is created as loans and pushed into the market.  This has the effect of **heavily** subsidizing the financial markets where the new money floods in before price inflation has decreased its value.  Its basically a legal system of counterfeiting at a known ratio in order to allow it, but obscure and slow its effects.  

&gt;Me=2. Inflation causes minimum wage to be less and less valuable over time, meaning that raising the MW only kicks the can down the road a few years.  This affects the poor to the greatest degree and hurts any opportunity they have to save for the future by siphoning off the value of their earnings over time.  It also has the effect of increased inequality.  With the political privilege to create money out of nothing and then charge interest on it, you end up with a system in which the *entire economy* can go into debt at multiples of its entire productivity.  How can someone loan out 2,000 wooden boards when only 400 exist?  That is essentially what happens in the financial markets and it runs the consequence of creating a huge boom/bust cycle.

&gt;Me=3. The constantly rising prices are a consequence of an endlessly increasing money supply and not the fault of some business.  Businesses have no fantastical power to control prices anymore than you can manipulate prices on craigslist.  Ever wonder why those things funded almost solely by debt - housing, education, cars, medical, and so on all experience inflation rates that dwarf other industries?  

Money is a tool for measurement.  *Printing money to create wealth is similar to changing the length of a foot on your tape measure so you can get a bigger house.*

Then comes the responses!  This is where I'm totally baffled.  They defend all of these measures with a fury that is sometimes frightening.

&gt; 1. CONSPIRACY THEORIST!! Inflation and loans are a GOOD thing!  We just need the government to stop the banks from doing bad things!  If we didn't have inflation then DEFLATIONARY SPIRAL (note: literally never happened before ever in the history of mankind, a completely and utterly *made up* economic problem)!  People would sit on money forever which hurts everyone and then they would all get rich doing nothing! 

&gt; 2. Inflation GOOD!  Deflationary spiral!!  Rich would be so worse if we didn't have the banks and government printing money out of thin air to help the poor!  Banks don't benefit from the ability to create loans from nothing, only people who cant afford houses benefit!  Boom/bust is always there.  The Fed has basically cured them... except the Great Depression because evil business and the constant boom/busts we have also cuz evil markets.  But remember the 1800s and how bad they were then!?  I remember because I was there!

&gt; 3. Inflation GOOD!  Businesses don't have to charge higher prices and wouldn't if they were *good people* instead of *evil scum-fucks!* If we didn't force them to invest by inflation they would *sit on their massive piles of cash and laugh as everyone drowned in their own fecal matter!!* 

I was just wondering if anyone had any clever ideas or arguments that made this simpler to understand.  I've had very mild success but I keep going at it since I actually want these problems solved.  But they have this huge disconnect between an obvious thing like printing money decreases the money's value, **Which they openly admit and claim is desirable.** But then its like the subsequent financial system bloating, ever higher prices, and worsening poverty could not **ever** have anything to do with this *directly related* and foundational manipulation?

personalfinance,$170k in student loans after 7.5 years of school. Should I refinance or consolidate them?,"So I have a lot of student loans from going to undergrad and graduate school. I didn't have help from anyone with college and the amount my parents made I didn't get many grants or scholarships for income reasons. I'm also the first person in my family to go to college so no one really knew what to do about loans or scholarships. I had some scholarships and teaching assistant jobs at school which paid for some of tuition but theres still a lot to pay for. I have all federal loans and no private loans while being on the income base repayment plan but for some reason one of the federal loans is with a different lender (Uheaa) for some reason and not with all my others (Great Lakes). 

I'm just starting the loans next month since I graduated in December and the grace period ended and after looking at my income (45k starting out) and monthly expenses I shouldn't have problems paying for anything and might pay a bit extra towards loans to get them down faster.

I have some high interest on the graduate loans at 7.8% but thats only for 2 of the graduate loans. The average for everything else is around 6.2% with some being as low as 3.2%. Is it worth it to refinance or consolidate the loans and try to get a lower interest rate or should I pay more a month towards the higher interest rate ones then consolidate or refinance? 

Another thing I was reading on the loan company's website is that is there is any interest left after 20 years it is forgiven. I would prefer to not have loans for that long but should I just pay what I can until then and let it run to the 20 years? Or are there any good consolidating or refinancing options I should consider?

EDIT:  So I just spoke with the loan company and they said just make payments after 20 years on the income base plan and it will be forgiven in 20 years so that seems like the best option. And they confirmed that the government pays any interest not paid yet every month for 3 years so that should keep interest down as well. The only other monthly payments I have right now are rent, utilities and internet.",finance,1467396701

personalfinance,Credit repair success!,"When I got engaged 4 years ago we started sharing details of our finances. I discovered that my husband had fucked up his credit from being irresponsible. He had a few things in collections and MANY late payments on his student loans. He didn't overspend, he just didn't do paperwork. His credit was low 500s and we live in Seattle where I would need him as a co-borrower if we were ever going to buy a house. We weren't in a hurry but this required some serious help.

I like paperwork! I had way more debt but my credit was stellar. I took over all paperwork duties and we started credit rehab.

* He could only qualify for a secured credit card so we got that and put it in autopay. Every year we checked if he could increase the credit and/or change to a regular credit card. It took about 2 years to convert the card.

* I added him as an authorized user on all my cards. 

* I paid off the 2 collections and was able to get one removed. It was for a utility bill that was sent after he moved and he never received it. Because he didn't receive it they removed it when I paid it off while on the phone.

I've been tracking with Credit Karma and we're about ready to buy a house so I applied for a pre-approval and ran his score for the first time. I expected something in the low 700s. My middle score is 749, his is 763! (We use my cards very heavily so my utilization is high) But OMG. 4 years of effort and we are in the best interest rate bracket!

Please help!","I am 28 years old living in downtown DC with my girlfriend (25) who works as an medical assistant at a hospital for a plastic surgeon making $18 per hour while working 50 hours per week. She is trying to get into medical school for next Fall. I am a personal trainer at a very prestigious gym a few blocks away from our apartment. We recently moved into this apartment from about 3 miles north which required me to drive to work at VERY early hours in the morning leaving Emily (girlfriend) having to Uber to and from work which started to add up quick. This move was very spontaneous which forced us to take out a small loan at our bank to cover the triple rent. This move was done to save money but we can't seem to get our heads above water. 
after each paycheck I seem to have about $300 for groceries and other things. I have gone through my savings so I have ZERO savings. Emily has about the same in her account as well. 

CURRENT HOUSEHOLD INCOME: I make my money based off of clients so my pay moves around a bit, anywhere from $3000-$4000 per month after taxes. Emily makes about $2000 per month. She is hourly not salary so that can fluctuate slightly. 

CURRENT DEBT: My credit card debt is about $3500 which is between 2 cards, both of which are maxed out (22% APR). I do not have any other credit cards. My student loan debt is $16,500 through stafford loans - Great lakes borrowers. 4.6% Interest rate.
Emily took out a loan when we moved as mentioned earlier for $3000. We owe $1500 on that and the interest rate is 8.5%
She also has a credit card with a balance of $1300 W/ interest rate of 8.5% Lastly, I have a Best Buy credit card with a $1000 limit, the current balance is $850.
AUTO LOAN: I owe $13,000 paying $395 per month with 12.65%APR. This loan is shared between Emily and myself. Her credit score is about 750 and mine has tanked back to 562 since my student loans came to be and my credit card utilization is at 100%.
 ALSO: I am absolutely willing to sell my car because Emily has a car we do not use that her parent purchased for her. She uses mine because it has DC tags. The problem is that I owe more than its worth.

worldpolitics,Dead Brexit Walking - 'a post-modern version of Monty Python’s Dead Parrot Sketch' - by Pepe Escobar,"All political hell is breaking loose in the UK. The Prime Minister is no more - a post-modern version of Monty Python's Dead Parrot Sketch.

A nasty, stiff upper lip Tory battle for power is mirrored by a Labor insurgency; that, in itself, would warrant a brand new Python sketch. The general level of “debate” is ghastly. In parallel, British establishment icons want Brexit to be simply ignored (“unlawful”, “illegal”) or remixed, so the unwashed (white working class) masses will be forced to vote the right way.

An army of lawyers told the House of Lords that yes, Britain should change its mind, albeit with “substantial political consequences”. As the British establishment reasons the EU, after all, does have vast experience on the matter. Denmark voted against Mastricht in 1992, Ireland voted against both the Nice treaty in 2001 and the Lisbon treaty in 2008. The EU trampled them all.

For its part, the EU seems to be exhibiting a united front. Out is out. And preferably, fast. Brussels is practically forcing London to get a move on so an embattled EU can get to work to – in theory – get its own act together.

Eurocrats, off the record, stress that even “fast” won’t be fast enough – because London has been self-marginalizing itself for two decades now. At the same time they expect that the more the disastrous consequences of Brexit are self-evident, the more reasonable Brits will be.

The official narrative now emanates from the new power troika – German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Francois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Countless Europeans would flinch at buying a second-hand Fiat from these people. But still, they’re the new troika, and their message is clear. Article 50 invoked as soon as possible; no negotiation without notification; discussing our future relationship, fine, but only after you formally ask for a divorce.

Welcome to the remixed EU

Into this toxic environment steps in – surprise! – US Secretary of State John Kerry. Brexit can even be “walked back”, he volunteers – in a Dead Brexit Walking way. Apparently Kerry was very impressed that David Cameron told him, this past Monday in Downing Street, that he would never invoke Article 50 and was powerless to “start negotiating a thing that he doesn’t believe in”.

Kerry is sure there are a “number of ways” his Dead Brexit Walking scenario would work. Naturally he can’t admit in public what terrifies the lame duck Obama administration. It has nothing to do with the UK going to the “back of the queue” – White House terminology – to renegotiate a trade deal with the US.

This is all about no more American Trojan Horse in Brussels. No more TTIP. Germany and France making all big European decisions without a Five Eyes looking in. No wonder Exceptionalist shills immediately started spinning that the only solution for Brexit is more NATO and its corollary: further demonization of Russia.

Occult by all these machinations is the stark fact that the sole purpose of NATO now – apart from losing wars in Central Asia and destroying nations in Northern Africa — is to perpetuate the military occupation of Europe. And for that, NATO badly relies on anti-Russia hysteria.

At least there is movement in other fronts. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble is already exploring a way out, as in a negotiation offering an “associate” membership for the UK. In fact this is the current status quo; the UK is not part of the euro or part of Schengen. The core issue, for Britain, is access to the single market. And that, as far as Brussels is concerned, will never be a case of “you can get your tea and scones and eat them too.” You’ll only do it if you accept EU immigration.

Venturing into uncharted territory, with perfect timing, irrupts the leaked road map for a remixed EU, conceived by a Franco-German duo of Foreign Ministers, Jean-Marc Ayrault and Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

The Franco-German vision, predictably, privileges security, immigration and the euro, with an emphasis on economic growth. They want even “more Europe” (something the Brits would never agree with); Defense and Foreign Policy closely intertwined; and a unified European army (imagine the serial heart attacks in the Beltway).

They want total European coordination – from intelligence to incarceration – to fight terrorism, as well as integrated surveillance of Fortress Europe’s borders.

They even venture into a project for “stabilization, development and reconstruction” of Syria (before that someone must tell the CIA and the Pentagon to stop sluggin’ it out on what “moderate rebels” to weaponize).

In the “follow the money” department, the Franco-German duo want the same fiscal policies for everybody, “convergence of national budgets” (good luck with that) and a European Assembly to control monetary policy. Now try selling all that to a true “Europe of the peoples”.

And what about China?

Then there’s the giant panda in the (collapsing) European room: China. Beijing is still carefully analyzing the current political circus in London and Brussels before adjusting its strategy.

There’s no question London, so far, was the privileged Chinese gateway to the EU – as well as a top offshore trading hub for the yuan. Beijing was also counting on London to facilitate achieving market economy status, which would immediately translate into even more Chinese exports to Europe, all this closely connected with the New Silk Roads. Last but not least, the UK – much to the displeasure of the “special relationship” — is a founder member of the China-driven Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

London, for its part, was beaming with the prospect of solidifying itself as China’s gateway to Europe while securing torrents of investment – a Chinese-style “win-win”.

So far though, nothing changes. Take, for instance, telecom equipment giant Huawei still betting on Britain.

China-UK was hailed last year as a “golden relationship”. But as UK banks and financial services contemplate moving to the EU post-Brexit (HSBC, for instance, already announced that 1,000 jobs are moving to Paris), the real story is that China can start contemplating further “win-win” scenarios also with Paris, Frankfurt and Milan. As a backup, there’ll always be that Dead Brexit Walking. And if it turns out “unlawful”, “illegal” Brexit goes out to meet its maker, everything will be “golden” again.

personalfinance,TSP-illiterate Fed -- Should I switch from G to L2050?,"Hello PF, longtime lurker, first-time poster. Sorry to be that person, but I've done some TSP-related searches here and am still a little confused.

Like many who've posted before, I was given the blanket ""put it in G"" speech during the whirlwind in-processing sessions and didn't think much of it. I regret the mistake but am ready to improve.

Today, as a govvie barely making ends meet in DC (another post for another time), I'm doing the 5% matching into the regular TSP. This is my only retirement account right now, ~$25k total in the last 5 years. I know the max is much higher, but I need to get rid of some student loans first. It will be a couple of years before I'm prepared to max TSP contributions.

It sounds like I need to get out of G... I've seen a lot of recommendations for L2050, should I just move everything into that instead? I'm very much a ""set-it-and-forget"" type of investor, at least for now; if I change my mind later and want to diversify, are there fees associated with moving money from one fund to another within TSP? Are there other options I should consider, such as diversifying across funds? I am currently in my 20s and planning to make a full career here.

Also... should I start thinking about dabbling in the Roth version of the TSP? I know there are a lot of threads here already about it, so I will do some research. People keep telling me that it's great for someone relatively young and early in their career, such as myself -- but a comment here pointing out that income tax as a retiree will likely be lower gave me pause.

personalfinance,Best way to pay off student loans?,"Hello,

I just want to get an idea how I can manage my money after I graduate. I don't graduate with my doctorate until 2018 but I want to go ahead and make a plan.

During undergraduate, I didn't have any student loans or debt. I worked as much as I can when I didn't have classes and saved money. In 2013, I got into a doctorate program. I saved about $5000, which was used for living costs. 

Tuition for my school initially costed about $25,000 per year. During my second year, I fell ill. I ended up with poor grades and I had to make up those classes this past year. I am going to third year to finish up classes then I'll be heading off to rotations. 

As of now, my loan total is ~$95,000 and this coming up year tuition is $40,000. I'm going to assume it'll be $40,000 for fourth year, bringing a total of $160,000 (federal loan) by the time I graduate. I also have $7000 in private loans (car was damaged). I do not work currently; I want to focus on raising my grades.

My salary starting out would be $100,000, more or less. My question is what's the best way to manage my money so I can pay off my loan as soon as possible? I want to pay off personal credit card debts and private loans as soon as possible, but is it realistic to pay off my student loans within 5 years? I also want to buy a house in the future, is it also reasonable to buy one within 5 years?

Thanks in advance!!

personalfinance,All of my debt in Excel format - help me figure out the best course of action to pay it off?,"Hey guys, for the past year I have been tracking all of my debt in excel. I have my minimum payments for each debt, what I actually pay, the balance, and the interest rate. I also have a section for how much I am making each month so I can compare what I am earning vs. what is going towards bills. There isn't usually a large discrepancy between the two. 

I almost always pay more than the minimum payment for each bill, and I also use most of my income for the bills. What I am looking for is advice on a possible better way to allocate my extra income. Is there a certain bill I should put all of my extra income towards and pay off first, while making the minimum on all the others? If so, based on this information, which order should I do that in? 

Note: The way my car loan works is I payed off the interested already when I started paying the loan. I still pay more than the mimum just because I want so so badly to not have a car payment for once and i'm so close. I usually do $300 a month on the car payment. Also note that I usually put $150 for my student loans and $150 for my parent plus loans (I don't feel right having my dad pay those so I pay for both the student loans in my name and the loan in his name). I spend about $100 a month in grocery's and $120 a month in gas. I make about $463 a week.  Oh, also, it seems like I am putting so much towards my school loans and the balance hardly budges at all. It is disheartening.

personalfinance,Best way to pay for graduate school,"I'll be going back to school in the Fall to work on my Master's degree and am really trying to weigh the options of how to pay for school. I currently have no student loans from my undergraduate and my husband and I have worked really hard to pay off our credit card debt. All of the information I'm seeing on Federal student loan rates put interest rates at 6-7% with additional loan fees. We have a credit card at the moment that has only a 9% APR. With in-state tuition rates and only going part time, I'm looking at $4,700 per term.  

What's the best route to go here? Put it all on federal student loans, defer payment but rack up a substantial amount in interest charges or put each term on our credit card and pay it off as we can? I've calculated we could put ~$800 a month towards it and my car will be paid off in less than a year freeing up an additional $400 a month which gets us close to paying each term in full with interest charges. There are also opportunities to male large lump sum payments when bonuses or tax returns comes in.

Two part question.

**First:**

You only live once and planning everything based one figure percentages and trusting a lot to external factors worry me.

Let's say your net worth is $1MM. In case of an economic crisis what will happen to your assets? What happens to cash, liquid, real estate, lands, stocks, etc?

What if your all money is in sitting the bank and not in lands or real estates? 0?

If value of the currency takes a hit, what we have is basically worthless? If interest rate goes up, what happens?

**Second:**

To all of the problems above, I think the only solution is to have an useful skill that people would always want to pay for. Is that correct or is there a better solution?

In the meantime the market kept improving - plus the house we bought was a flip, it appreciated in value from assessed at 380k to 450k by the county -so that combined with the market conspired to raise our property taxes a huge amount.  Like $400 a month past where we thought we'd be - live and learn.

Terms are going from 30 year at 4.5% to 3.625% interest rate, 3.75% APR.  We'd save 240$ a month, so the roughly 3k it would cost in fees seems to make up for itself pretty quickly, and we need the money now more than we will in 30 years.

personalfinance,BoA wired home mortgage money to wrong title company. Any recommendations?,"Hi all, apologies for any grammatical/formatting issues in advance as I am on mobile. 


Background: Close was scheduled for 9AM on Friday (yesterday). We went in to BoA and wired our 20% down payment in advance on Thursday to ensure there were no delays on our end. Title company confirmed receipt of those funds on Thursday, so we think life is good. We show up to close at 9AM and everything is routine--closing disclosure looks good (had already reviewed), and signed all the paper work regarding HoA's, identity, etc. After signing, we sit and wait for an hour at the title office as BoA's policy is they require the title company to scan everything back to them to ensure we dotted the i's and crossed the t's. BoA said everything was good on our documentation, and released funds. After waiting for another hour, the title company gave us keys and said wires can take a bit to clear the Fed, but they at least had the Fed routing number. At this point we go grab the Uhaul we had packed our apartment furniture into and head to the house. We unloaded everything into the garage as we just needed to quickly dump it to get the Uhaul back on time. 

Where it went wrong: as we are taking the Uhaul back, the title co calls and says the wire still hasn't shown up. I call BoA and they are insistent it was sent hours ago. I requested an email of the transaction and as she looked they finally connected the dots they sent the funds to a completely different title company about 8 states away (with an entirely different name). 


The sellers requested the keys be handed back to the title company, as they felt their insurance wouldn't cover us over the weekend (important note here is the seller BROUGHT money to close, so not like they are out anything at this point). 


So here we are in a hotel for the next 3 days awaiting BoA to resolve the issue. The steps I have taken are:


1) Escalated the issue to the Sr VP of the region just to ensure she is pushing on her end. 


2) Requested reimbursement for 3 night stay at the Holiday Inn down the street as we have nothing in the apartment. 


3) Requested they wire the funds first thing on Tuesday morning, regardless of whether or not hey have received the funds back from the wrong title company they sent it to. I am most worried that they will not issue a new wire until they receive funds back--as this was 100% a BoA issue, am I correct in thinking I should be pushing for a disbursement first thing on Tuesday?

I am a recent graduate of physical therapy school. I currently have 3 PRN (as needed) jobs, averaging 45-50 hours per week at a rate of $50/hour. PRN hours are not guaranteed, that is why I have 3 employers, so I can fill in the gaps whenever necessary. 

Averaging 40 hours per week x $50/hour = $2000 / week without taxes. 

As a PRN therapist, I do not get full time benefits, however, one of my employers offers a 401K with no matching. 

My total student debt is roughly 135K (private school):
Federal: (Fixed rate)
1. $20500 - 5.84%
2. $20500 - 6.21%
3. $20367 - 5.41%
4. $6528 - 6.80%

Private (sallie mae)
1. $42,037 - 7.5%
2. $25,410 - 8.375%

I currently have a ROTH IRA with ~$5500, haven't deposited into it in years since I was in school. 

Luckily, I am living at home with my wonderful family, free of rent. My only real expense is $400/month for health insurance. As much as I want to move out into my own place, it doesn't seem to make sense financially. Car is paid off.

After reading ""How to handle $"" I still have a few questions: 
-Do I still need to create an emergency fund with the formula of 3 to 6 months x expenses? For me that would be only $1200-$2400. If so, I have that already. If not, how should I address this? 

-My employer does not match, should I not even sign up for the 401K at this point and just move to step 3, paying down debt? 

-I am definitely going to tackle the high interest sallie mae loans first (avalanche method), while paying the interest payments on my federal loans. Should I pay as much as possible towards the 8.25% (25k) private loan and only pay interest on the other private loan? Or try to pay an equal amount to both private loans, while tackling the interest on my federal loans? 

-At what point do I start contributing to my ROTH IRA / potential 401K. Do I need to completely pay off all loans before I start doing this? If not, do I contribute to both the IRA and 401k, or just the ROTH since my employer does not match the 401k. 

-Regarding the 401k: This employer is my Saturday only gig, so I will only be making about $1500/month. Not sure if this matters. 

-I am planning on proposing this year and need to buy a ring. Ive seen variables ranges for ring prices and would like to spend ~5K.

I am trying to get myself and my girlfriend on a budget that would allow us to save more money and also be able to actually afford the things that we want (for example we were finally able to afford a larger tv that we dont have to crowd around). We are young (19 and 21) so we have most of our stuff as handme downs or broken. We want to start buying things that look nicer or work better (Another example, we have a couch from a friend with massive holes in them and want to replace it). I know we make more than enough together. We currently spent our only saving moving out of our old apartment and into new and buying new stuff and such. So basically we have nothing really.

For a little more info, my debt is current $500 on a credit card, she has $1000 on a credit card. I have a very large student loan (prefer not to say because it scares me and I plan on using income based payments), this is currently paid 25 dollars a month to lower the interest rate but is deferred till after school (next year).

Rent $770
Internet $55 (I work from home sometimes so I needed better internet)
Directv $60 (we are so happy we are fainally able to afford tv and decent internet)
Electricity $70? Variable pay as you go plan

Cat food $10 (also probably a little high)

personalfinance,Borrowing money from yourself as a savings strategy,"I started this about 8 months ago as an experiment, and it worked the two times I did it but I wanted to gather some input on long term sustainability. Most importantly, a strong test during a period of hardship.

After many years of financial irresponsibility, I finally started maintaining a permanent savings account. Managed to accumulate about $5,000 in 8 months, with an additional matching $5,000 in an investment account.

I am sure this strategy has been done before, here is how it works for me: this past January I took a mini vacation and took $500 out of savings. Using an Excel spreadsheet loan calculator, I essentially set myself up a 6 month loan that was financed through my own savings: as in for that $500 I took from it, I had to pay myself back with interest in order to do so. I input the rate at 30% and set up automatic withdrawals from my checking to my savings account every paycheck (twice a month) independent but in addition to my small regular contributions to savings.

At the end of the 6 months, I had paid myself back the $500 principle plus ~$41 in interest to the savings account at a cost to me of only $43 a paycheck, which I never saw due to the nature of automatic ""payment"" to the savings account.

The second time was to pay for a security deposit on a new place I moved into, same rules applied. Took out $1000, and set myself up a 9 month repayment plan with a high interest rate charged to myself. I still am paying this one back the same way, about $62/paycheck and a 30% interest rate.

Of course the first and biggest objection may be ""you could have just put that extra money into savings anyway"" - however, with my personality and habits.. It is much better that I never see the money through the form of automatic payments than it is just to add more to my monthly savings amount (this amount varies month to month). Maybe it is just a mental thing? But if I never see the money hit the checking account I don't think twice about it. It helps considerably. And it is difficult to regularly gauge how much I can actually save each paycheck since a lot of my bills and expenses can vary considerably month over month.

Has anyone else tried this strategy? It seems to be working for me as a way to build savings and deter me from just raiding the account whenever I feel a want for something. Initially discipline was a challenge, but the automatic payments take care of that and I can watch my savings grow month to month more than it would normally.

The real test would be long term unemployment or emergencies.. But I feel like I could enhance the effectiveness in that sort of situation by expanding the term lengths (for example, 12, 18, 24, etc month ""loan"" periods to keep it extremely low cost) and keeping the ""payments"" very small as a way to maintain the strategy and discipline of paying it back.

Any thoughts or input? To me I feel like it helps maintain and grow savings, while at the same time forcing financial responsibility by treating the payments to myself as another bill rather than as a monthly savings allotment..",finance,1467481366

I am 20 years old, and currently half way through my Junior year at a State University, dual majoring in Accounting and Finance. I transferred to this State School from Community College. I live near the Pittsburgh area.

Due to me transferring in from Community College (Some items didn't transfer the way I wanted them to) and deciding to dual major, I will have to earn 134 credits to earn both of my degrees (which also means me taking extra classes during the semester and a summer/winter class). One of the requirements for testing into the Certified Public Accounting Certification is that the applicant has 150 credits from an accredited college, as well as a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting. In order to reach this 150 credit requirement I will need 16 more credits. That is another semesters worth and totally doable for me. However I am unsure of how I should do this since I have two options. I am expecting to graduate in December of 2017 (I took summer classes last year) and do one of these two options (or another if you guys suggest something smarter) in the Spring of 2018.

1. Take easy classes and use my internship job (which I can convert into credits) to fill in the 16 credits. (I used this internship for 3 credits last semester, I should be able to suck out 12 more credit hours from this job and take two other easy classes to fill the requirement). This would be more profitable for me in the short-run as my internship is paid for so I could place the money into my student loans.

2. Minor in Computer Science OR Information Systems. This option would mean that I have Bachelors Degrees in Accounting and Finance as well as a Minor in Computer Science or Information Systems (muh STEM). I would only wish to do this if it meant better employment opportunities and salary in the long run. Doing either minor would take 18 credits, and would most likely kick my ass due to work load. So if it wouldn't help my job prospect in any way I do not wish to do it. Also if this is the better option, which minor should I take?

I have considered a Master's Degree in Accounting but after realizing I needed only 16 extra credits for the CPA exam I wish to take this other path instead. If worse came to worse I could go for a Masters Degree in the future and hopefully with aid from my workplace. I was also told that in more fields of Accounting than not CPA &gt; Masters.

1099 vs W-2: i will get a 1099 and I have no idea how this works. I am under the impression that I should save 40% of my pay per month to pay my taxes quarterly. Correct? Is this just federal or is this state as well? Can I switch states once I find a permanent residence? 

Retirement: i am being paid a lot of money but I am not offered retirement. I have been informed that I am on my own. What do invest in? How much do I save? 401k is what i have been told but I have no idea to start.

Buying a house: from what I have read, i should not exceed 28% of my monthly income for rent and utilities. I've always been allotted an amount monthly since 2008 and I have only used 70% for rent and the rest for utilities. I think I have that down pat, but any advise would help. Also, should I allot the property tax into that 28%?

Insurance: holy shit. Where do I even start? Health and homeowners are new to me. I have usually payed like 400 a year for rent insurance but, is it the same when buying?

I am sure I will think of other stuff. I have talked to a financial adviser at my unit but they are baffled about a lot of what I have said because it is rare for someone to triple their pay. 

I will be getting an accountant when I start my new job but i want to go to them with as much knowledge as possible.

personalfinance,Bank of America savings account,"Hi everyone, I'm 100% new to this sub and to the world of money so please bear with me.

I looked around a little and people say Barclays dream savings account is good but I don't know what that means. What are the risks of switching over to a new bank?

personalfinance,International Teachers Retirement Investing Advice,"My GF and I are international teachers and we have been reading about investing for retirement. I was hoping someone could look over our plan, and let me know if it sounds good (much of our advice we've read from this sub).

Age: We're both 28.
Debt: My GF has 21k in student loan debt. I have 22k. We have just started to pay it off. It's federal debt with an interest rate of 6.8%. 
Savings: My GF has 6k and I have 17k in savings.
Goal: We're looking for money to retire in about 30 years.

Our Plan: I like to keep things simple, and while I'm not entirely risk averse, I like security and certainty. Our plan consists solely of setting up a Target Retirement Account with Vanguard, and adding anywhere from 30 to 40k per year into this account.

My question is, for the next few years, should we prioritize paying off our student loans first? We can save about 20k a year working abroad, but the one thing I'm having trouble with is the allocation of our savings. Would it be better to pay off student loans all at once? Or would the money be better spent in the Target Retirement Fund?

My student loans total $33k. I pay $600/mo.

My husband makes about $8k/mo. (can sometimes be down to $6k/mo.) I make about $2k/mo. (I have a lot of deductions out of my check)

Attached are images of each student loan with the interest rates. As you can see the higher loans (one of them is ~$20k) and has a high interest rate of 6.5%

My thinking is trying to consolidate loans into mortgage, get a lower interest rate, and pay extra on mortgage principle each month.

personalfinance,"Just married, $80k student loan debt, savings goals - need advice/gut-check.","Throwaway on this just because I am paranoid.

I just got married and am starting to sort through our combined finances. We take home about $70k/yr. combined, with each of us putting some away into respective retirement accounts (mine a Roth IRA, her's a traditional IRA) and also into a small health savings account (around $1.5k). We both have graduate degrees paid for by student loans. My wife is considering entering a PhD program next fall as well (the schools she is targeting are fully funded and offer stipends as well in the 30k/yr. range).

Our wedding added on a bit of debt to our credit cards that we are tackling fairly aggressively with about half of the money we received as gifts (1/2 being around $2000). This is our top priority right now since it is on cards with a higher interest rate (16.9%-21%)

We have our accounts set up as follows:

* One Joint Checking Account
* One Low-yield Savings (Same bank as checking, emergency fund, about $500/mo. going in)
* One High-yield Savings (For our home down payment, about $300/mo. going in)
* One Amex (high $$ purchases and bills on autopay, paid in full at EOM)
* Two Freedom cards (daily/budgeted expenses, paid in full at EOM)
* One Joint Vanguard account to serve as a wealth/investment fund (Future kids college, trust, etc., about $100/mo. going in)

I have the budgeting side mostly figured out. We live frugally, and I have a good idea of how I want our money to enter the accounts, automated amounts going into each account.

The elephant in the room is our student loan debt. I have about $80k in student loans, interest rates ranging from 3.5%-6.5%. She has around $40k in student loans at ~6%. Our loans have been in forbearance for the last year since we got out of school and left the grace period. As of right now, our loans are set to start repayment next month with a combined payment of around $1,000. 

Combined, the numbers freak me out a bit since we definitely want to own a home, start a family, etc. Along with our savings goals, it feels like we just don't have the money to pay off our loans and live comfortably, especially in the expensive city we live in (Seattle). Keeping our budget as it is now along with our savings goals (around $900 allocated per month), we are about $850 short per month if we move ahead with paying the loans off as they stand now.

I've heard about refinancing the debt through a private lender like SoFi; and, i'm not sure if it's even possible, but it 'sounds' like a good idea if I were able to pay off the credit card debt with that refinancing as well. Is that even a thing?

I know that most of this can be tackled with budgeting wisely, but I would love a gut-check on whether refinancing even my loans makes sense.",finance,1467512564

investing,"If the Fed increases interest rates, isn't that subsidizing banks at the expense of other companies?","Investors of US banks are eargarly waiting for the Fed to increase interest rates which will boost earnings for US retail banks like $BAC, $WFC or $USB. This is because of a
widening spread: the amount of interest they pay to depositors is relatively
fixed while the interest they charge for loans will increase.

In parallel, non-bank companies will find it more expensive to raise debt and invest in value-creating projects which would decrease jobs and innovation overall. For example, Boeing or GE might open less factories or invest less in R&amp;D.

Banks will reap profits at the expense of value creating companies. Margins for banks are already sky high (ie. WFC has a 42% net margin). Why should this margin go even higher through government subsidization?

personalfinance,Paid off some major debt; looking for advice moving on,"Howdy PF!  I've been lurking for some time.  Your advice has put me on the track to financial prosperity.

This week, I paid off a major debit.  Long story short, I was on a payment plan to pay off two credit cards, starting in 2011, to the tune of $720/mo.  Total payoff amount:  ~$37000.

I still have revolving debt, but feel it's MUCH more manageable now that I've freed up this $720/mo.  The debt is as follows:  

* $7100 owed on one credit card, 29.99% APR, ~$225/mo. monthly payments
* $3100 owed on another credit card, 26.99% APR, ~$125/mo. monthly payments
* $2100 owed on a third credit card, 17.49% APR, ~$50/mo. monthly payments

Here's where I'm looking for advice:  Should I:

* Continue to make minimum payments on the aforementioned credit cards, focusing the ""extra"" $720 a month on a single card 'till it's paid off, then move to the next?
* Find a debt consolidation card that has 0% interest for xx months and do balance transfers (knowing full well I""m not going to get a card with a $12300 limit?
* Get a debt consolidation loan with an interest rate somewhere around 14% (or hopefully lower) that'll cover the $12300?

I'm personally leaning toward the last option, but I'm still having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of paying off debt by taking on a debt.  It does, however, make sense to borrow money at a better rate to pay off high interest rate debt.  I am uncertain how a debt consolidation loan will appear on my credit report and the effect it'll have long-term.

Other pertinent details I know you'll ask for:

* 33 years old, single, no kids.
* Income is $3450/mo. + ~$200/mo in income from side jobs (the $3450 is reliable, side income is not).
* Renting a duplex: $675./mo.
* Utilities: $120-$250/mo. depending on time of year
* Internet + Cable:  $100/mo.
* Cell phone plan: $200/mo. (providing for a family plan of 5, non-negotiable)
* Pet care: $400/mo. (sick pet, non-negotiable; will take on however many jobs needed to afford care)
* Food:  Split this cost with my girlfriend, $200/mo.
* Insurance:  $110/mo.
* College loans:  $240/mo.
* Gas for car:  $50/mo.
* Life insurance: $15/mo.
* Online subscriptions: ~$25/mo
* Current savings:  $250 (plan to up this to $1500 by saving the $720 each month for 2 months)
* Contributing 7.2% of my paycheck to an employer-provide retirement program; employer matches 6.8%, ~$30,000 in said plan.
* Car is 9 years old; paid off
* No other appreciable debts or investments

personalfinance,Rescuing myself from Dave Ramsey plan,"I realized, almost too late, that closing all my credit cards and blindly following the TMM plan could actually be troublesome for my finances.  I don't yet have a house and I don't want to give myself hurdles in the future due to no credit score.  I also don't want to give up my employer match while I pay down debt and I want to begin fully funding my Roth each year now.

With all that said, I still want to make sure I am doing the right thing.  Here is what I am proposing in its place.

Baby Step 1 - instead of having a dedicated $1000 emergency fund, I would use my YNAB 1 month buffer if I had any small items that were emergencies or outside of the budget.  This is already saved up and ready to go.

Baby Step 2 - I am down to just 2 debts, my student loan and a car loan.  Both have low interest rates.  I bought my car 1 year ago and I wanted it paid for within 36 months so that I would have 7 years to save for a replacement vehicle.  My plan is now to reclaim some of the money I was spending on debt repayment, making minimum payments on the student loan and paying enough on the car loan to have it fully paid off by the time the car hits 3 years old.

Some of the other money freed up from not being so intense in DR Baby Step 2 would go to maxing out a Roth IRA.  Once the Roth is maxed, I would begin saving towards 6 months' expenses up for emergencies until the next year when I would max the Roth again.  Meanwhile while all this is going on I would be contributing my 6% to my employer 401(k) to get the full possible match.

After the emergency fund is done, each year after fully funding the Roth, I would begin saving up for a down payment on a house.

I would also begin using my cashback credit cards again instead of closing them.  I don't have a debt or spending problem and they will all be set to be paid in full automatically.  I use YNAB to track every penny and prevent debt.

Questions - am I missing something in my logic?  Where should I put my Roth IRA (Betterment or Vanguard)?  Where should I keep my checking account (should I worry about the interest rate here?)?  What about my savings?  Should I invest my emergency fund in something safe or just keep it in savings or checking?  Where should I keep my sinking funds?",finance,1467540746
personalfinance,[Auto] Recent college grad with 45k in student debt making 40k a year. I need a new car for work and cant decide to go new or used.,"**TLDR**: 45k in student debt &amp; making 40k a year. 10k in savings. I am traveling between 1000-2500 miles a month, with 1500 being the average. Budgeted $335 a month for a car. I want a car that costs $290 a month, leaving me with about $1150 of pure savings left in my budget a month. Student loan payments are $460 a month, and part of me wants to get a car in the 10-12k range and used the saved money to help pay off my student loans quicker. I am just worried the used car wont be as reliable/will cost more in the long run than a brand new car with a warranty. I just want a reliable car that will get me from A to B and not cost me an arm and a leg in maintenance or parts

**Full situation**

I just graduated college with around 45k in debt and also got a job 3 weeks ago that pays 40k a year. It is a work from home job, so thankfully my parents are allowing me to live at home with them to save money for the next year or two. The one catch about the work from home job is that when I also travel a ton for the job, potentially up to 2500 miles a month, with 1500 being the average due to having to travel to various sports arenas every weekend and occasionally during the week once the college basketball season starts. Thankfully my company pays for my gas and gives me $200 a month (built into my salary) for a car. 

So my current dilemma is that I can not decide if I should go new or used. I have had my heart set on a new 2016 Toyota Corolla S Plus for $17583 ($238 a month) after all taxes and fees or the S Premium trim for $20557 ($290 a month). Those prices include $4000 down  and a 1.991% interest rate from my bank. These prices fit into my current budget very well (budgeted $335 a month for a car) and when combined with my other expenses still leave me with a little over $1150 a month. I am just a bit worried that while it fits my budget now, in a year or two when I get my own apartment or home that the higher payment might leave me with only a few hundred left after paying rent and utilities, hindering my ability to keep saving up money. I am also worried a new car would shoot up my auto insurance.

I will be paying off my student loans at $460 a month or so over the next 10 years and part of me is saying to just buy a cheaper car that will cost me $140-$160 a month in the 10k-13k price range and use the $130 extra towards paying off my student loans early or saving up for an apartment/home. Or I could just pay it off over 24 or 36 months vs 60 months for a new, more expensive car while paying roughly the same amount per month.  My only concern about that is that the less expensive car will have a shorter warranty and come with more wear and tear (30k-45k miles) and will not be as reliable as a new car with a full original warranty. Especially with all the long distance driving I will be doing in the car on weekends for my job. For the cheaper car options, I am looking at Hertz Car Sales and CPO cars.


So r/personalfinance , do I go with my heart and get a new car with a full warranty and peace of mind? Or do I go with a cheaper, used car with a shorter warranty that allows me to save more money/pay off my student loans quicker?",finance,1467546447

About us: Married a long time, child-free by choice, college graduates with good jobs. No debt -- we paid off our student loans and mortgage very quickly. The condo we own is probably worth about $200,000 -- less than we paid for it, but oh, well.
My pre-tax income is $115,000 and my wife's is $60,000. We paid about $21,000 in federal income tax and about $5,000 in state income tax last year.

Our annual expenses are about $30,000, or about $2,500 a month.

Our savings include: A savings account with $225,000 and a checking account with $11,000.

I have a 401(K) worth about $135,000.

My wife has a deferred compensation plan worth about $92,000.

My wife doesn't work since she's a stay at home mom, but she's going to school for home inspection.  Long term we want to invest in real estate.

What should our next move be?  Should we keep saving and try to get investment properties as soon as possible?  Should we focus on refinancing the house we live in?  Should we try to pay it off first?",finance,1467557652
financialindependence,My wife and I are about to turn 40. How close are we to FIRE?,"[X-post from /r/personalfinance.]

Hey, guys. My wife and I are both about to turn 40 and we're looking for some feedback on how close we are to being ready for early retirement. We don't hate our jobs and we're not eager to retire immediately, but we'd like to know we're on track to being able to retire whenever we want to.

About us: Married a long time, child-free by choice, college graduates with good jobs. No debt -- we paid off our student loans and mortgage very quickly. The condo we own is probably worth about $200,000 -- less than we paid for it, but oh, well. My pre-tax income is $115,000 and my wife's is $60,000. We paid about $21,000 in federal income tax and about $5,000 in state income tax last year.

Our annual expenses are about $30,000, or about $2,500 a month.

Our savings include: A savings account with $225,000 and a checking account with $11,000.

I have a 401(K) worth about $135,000.

My wife has a deferred compensation plan worth about $92,000.

We have mutual funds worth $350,000.

I have a SEP IRA worth $127,000.

My wife has a traditional IRA worth $215,000. I have a traditional IRA worth $99,000.

I have a Roth IRA worth $50,000 and my wife has a Roth IRA worth $70,000.

I own Comcast stock worth $52,000.

That puts our total savings at about $1.4 million, and when you add in the value of our condo our net worth is about $1.6 million.

Are we at FIRE now? If not, how close are we? And any advice for how we can better allocate our resources?

Thanks!",finance,1467559527
btc,"If Bitcoin becomes a major currency, then tens of trillions of dollars on the ""legacy ledger of fantasy fiat"" will evaporate, destroying AXA, whose CEO is head of the Bilderbergers. This is the real reason why AXA bought Blockstream: to artificially suppress Bitcoin volume and price with 1MB blocks.","https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4r1jwk/maxwells_boss_and_christine_lagarde/

The man in the picture in the link above is Henri de Castries - chairman of the Bilderberg Group, and CEO of AXA, an insurance giant which has over half a **tr**illion dollars in exposure to dangerous derivatives, and whose ""investment arm"" AXA Strategic Ventures is one of the main owners of Blockstream (ie, *Gregory Maxwell is literally getting paid by the masters of the legacy ledger of fantasy fiat*).

If the new counterparty-free hard asset Bitcoin becomes a major world currency, then companies like AXA (and most other members of the Bilderberg Group) will *lose tens of trillions of dollars* since they will no longer be able to rule the world with their ""legacy ledger"" of debt-based ""fantasy fiat"" which they ~~ninja-mine~~ quantitatively-ease (QE) into existence out of thin air (which is why the fiat in your pocket and your bank account is worth less and less every year).

This is the *real* reason why AXA is trying to quietly destroy Bitcoin, by ""investing"" in Blockstream and *strangling the Bitcoin network with artificially tiny 1 MB blocks.*

As long as miners continue to use code with a tiny hard-coded artificial 1 MB ""max blocksize"" limit, imposed by the corrupt / incompetent Gregory Maxwell who is CTO of the AXA/Bilderberg-owned private company Blockstream, then *Bitcoin volume and price will continue to be artificially suppressed*.

We need to liberate Bitcoin from the centralized control of Gregory Maxwell and AXA/Bilderberg/Blockstream/Core - which will remove the artificial 1 MB ""max blocksize"" - and then *Bitcoin volume and price will again be free to rise to their natural levels*, allowing Bitcoin to become a major world currency.

The old posts below may be interesting for people who want to explore this further.

Sorry for all these re-posts but there's not much new to say, and we've been saying it for months. And sorry for the tinfoil - but [the people who ""own"" you (see this 3-minute George Carlin clip on YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsL6mKxtOlQ) are probably never going to openly admit to you exactly *how* they manage to own you - so it makes sense that you might have to do a little digging to connect the dots yourself, perhaps along the following lines:

&gt; Blockstream is now controlled by the Bilderberg Group - seriously! AXA Strategic Ventures, co-lead investor for Blockstream's $55 million financing round, is the investment arm of French insurance giant AXA Group - whose CEO Henri de Castries has been *chairman* of the Bilderberg Group since 2012.

&gt; The insurance company with the biggest exposure to the 1.2 quadrillion dollar (ie, 1200 TRILLION dollar) derivatives casino is AXA. Yeah, *that* AXA, the company whose CEO is head of the Bilderberg Group, and whose ""venture capital"" arm bought out Bitcoin development by ""investing"" in Blockstream.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4k1r7v/the_insurance_company_with_the_biggest_exposure/

---

&gt; Greg Maxwell used to have intelligent, nuanced opinions about ""max blocksize"", until he started getting paid by AXA, whose CEO is head of the Bilderberg Group - the legacy financial elite which Bitcoin aims to disintermediate. Greg always refuses to address this massive conflict of interest. Why?

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4mlo0z/greg_maxwell_used_to_have_intelligent_nuanced/

---

&gt; So... The insurer whose ""solvency"" is most dependent on maintaining the fiction that the riskiest assets in Exter's Inverted Pyramid (derivatives) are actually worth something - is now paying the devs who write the code for the solidest asset in that pyramid (Bitcoin). What could possibly go wrong?

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4k4hia/so_the_insurer_whose_solvency_is_most_dependent/

---

&gt; The owners of Blockstream are spending $75 million to do a ""controlled demolition"" of Bitcoin by manipulating the Core devs &amp; the Chinese miners. This is cheap compared to the $ trillions spent on the wars on Iraq &amp; Libya - who also defied the Fed / PetroDollar / BIS private central banking cartel.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/48vhn0/the_owners_of_blockstream_are_spending_75_million/

---

&gt; The day when the Bitcoin community realizes that Greg Maxwell and Core/Blockstream are the main thing holding us back (due to their dictatorship and censorship - and also due to being trapped in the procedural paradigm) - that will be the day when Bitcoin will start growing and prospering again.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4q95ri/the_day_when_the_bitcoin_community_realizes_that/

---

&gt; Bitcoin's market *price* is trying to rally, but it is currently constrained by Core/Blockstream's artificial *blocksize* limit. Chinese miners can only win big by following the market - not by following Core/Blockstream. The market will always win - either with or without the Chinese miners.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ipb4q/bitcoins_market_price_is_trying_to_rally_but_it/

---

&gt; Bitcoin has its own E = mc^2 law: Market capitalization is proportional to the square of the number of transactions. But, since the number of transactions is proportional to the (actual) blocksize, then Blockstream's artificial blocksize *limit* is creating an artificial market capitalization limit!

personalfinance,Wanting to build credit and save money at 19 years old with a wife and newborn.,"First off, I want to thank you guys for reading the wall of text I am about to post.  Second, I am 19 years old, married with a newborn and living with my parents, working as an electricians apprentice. According to Credit Karma, I have a 498 credit score through Transunion and Equifax. I'm hoping you guys can help me create a feasible budget for me to stick too, while also making a savings. 

MY DEBTS:

1. Wells Fargo College Credit Card: $798
  - There is a $37 fee every time I am late on a payment
  - The Account is closed
  - The minimum Payment they want is $235 by 07/04/16, which I do not have the money for.

2. Stafford Loans U.S. D.O.E.: $6,010.11
  - The account is on an income driven repayment plan where I do not currently owe anything

3. Georgia State University: $3,812.01
  - Sent to collections
  - Is NOT showing on any of the 3 credit bureas reports

MONTHLY INCOME:

1. Work income: $1,800 a month (before taxes)
  - based off 40-hour work weeks
  - I usually average about 8-10 hours of overtime, but may start slowing down to 40 since construction work usually slows during colder months
  - Come 07/21/2016, i will get a $0.40 raise which will take me up to $1,864 per month before taxes and I will get a $1.25 raise every year after.
 
2. Food stamps: $357

MONTHLY BILLS:

1. Car insurance: $190
  - cheapest it will go due to that being liability

2. Rent: $150
  - may go up to around $300 since my brother recently lost his job

3. Phone Bill: $190
  - Will probably go down to around $170-ish, because I am paying for more data than I need.
  - Both phones currently have $400 balance that,after paid off, should reduce the phone bill to around $130 a month.

4. Diapers: $90 
  - one pack of diapers usually lasts about 2 weeks

5. Gas: $160 

Extra Notes:

1. I live with my parents
2. I have a wife and a newborn, who is breastfed so there is no food cost for her really.
3. I plan to get a second job, maybe as a delivery driver or overnight stocker for a grocery store
4. I do not currently have any money in my savings account
5. I recently applied for the capital one secured credit card with a $200 limit. I plan to use this card to pay off debt while building my credit.
 - I have the opportunity to increase the limit by paying more down payment before activating the card, but I plan to keep the limit low in order to not go into debt again.
6. Wife gets $357 in food stamps monthly, so food is not really an issue.
7. I have a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport, that is getting old and is starting to need repairs.
  - most repairs are minor though, and I can do them myself most of the time.
8. We want to move out, but it is difficult to find housing in a nice neighborhood for under $700 a month. 
9. We have nobody to watch the baby, so my wife can not work due to daycare being too expensive.
10. I do have a mint account, which has been a TREMENDOUS help.

I was in a bind last October and ended up financing a $5,000 used car. The car i had before was on its last breath, and the dealership took it as a down payment. My parents wouldn't cosign, so my APR is 22.9% (yikes) for a 52 month loan. My credit score was good at the time, but wasn't established enough for a cheaper loan. I have an opportunity now to trade my car for a newer one, for a similar monthly payment and much lower interest rate.

Similarities: 

* He is named Cobra. 

* It is *extremely* important for him to remain anonymous, he even modifies his voice in interviews. 

* He is interested in Bitcoin and speaks out against the Fed and the global financial system in general. 

...AND, best of all: 

* He beliefs in some outright bizarre things, among them is coincidentally a close affiliation with an intelligence agent named *Michael* (the first name of a notorious person 'our' Cobra is also working closely with)

&gt; In 1975, a certain **intelligence agent under codename Michael** was running for his life from Illuminati that were chasing him. He gathered around him a group of 12 operatives in order to protect himself. While on the run and in hiding, they discovered a maze of tunnels below the New York underground subway system. They entered the tunnels, disappeared from the surface and regrouped down there. So the Organization was born, having its main command center under the subway system of New York. Through the vast spy network that Michael still had on the surface, they have contacted many operatives that fought against the Illuminati and many of them went underground and joined the Organization.

personalfinance,Someone told me to not pay off my student loans ASAP.,"As the title states, a friend of mine told me that I'd be better off making minimum payments ($69/mo for me) on my student loans instead of paying them off ASAP. They said that the age of the account would help my credit score more than paying it off and not owing the money. Or, that I could invest any extra money I would put towards paying down my student loans and get a higher rate of return.  
  
This surprised me a little bit because in my mind I want to pay the student loans off ASAP to minimize interest paid, as well as free up money for other things, like a car that I'm going to need probably before the end of the year. I only have ~$1650 left to pay on my student loans, so I could knock that out very quickly if I wanted to.  
  
My student loans are the only thing I pay interest on for the time being, with interest rates of 4.25% and 3.15%. I have an account with a furniture store that offers no interest if the balance is paid in full in X-months, and I have autopay set up to make sure my payments are as low as possible while still paying off the entire balance by the due date. I have a credit card but I pay that balance every month so I'm not paying interest. My credit score is very good (750+ish), but my weakest area is age of accounts, with the student loans being open ~5yrs and my credit card and furniture store account at ~1 year each.

So i paid my bank 30 dollars to stop payment because I want to set it up so that I pay from the bank, no direct debit craziness. I learned I really can pay money to send a fuck you to the company.

Forex,Weekly Macro Overview - Week 27,"Previous Week Summary

The whole week was about trying to figure out what will be next after Brexit referendum. Investors reassessing the impact and fleeing to safe assets, GBP hitting the low of 1.3149 (1985 levels), the 10yr/30yr yield on Gilts at 1%/1.88% respectively, gold trading above USD 1300 level. Question mark about offshore RMB trading in Europe raised in case of UK leaving EU (China picked London for RMB offshore operations).

Monday – US Lew – strong USD is in the interest of US.

Tuesday – ECB: monetary policy created destabilizing spillovers, divergent policies creating uncertainty about future direction, higher exchange rate volatility and risk premiums. Merkel – EU strong enough to handle UK exit, no informal talks before Article 50 is activated. Farage (strong Leave) - Reiterates desire to be good friends, neighbors and trading partners with the EU. What an irony…

Wednesday – Japan is likely to implement a large (2% of GDP) fiscal stimulus after July elections; verbal interventions heavy the whole week. German monthly Preliminary June CPI slightly lower; Atlanta Fed US Q2 GDP forecast raised to +2.7% from +2.6% and real Consumer spending to +4.3% from +4.1% and lowered the next exports forecast; May Core PCE was in line with forecast +0.2%/+1.6% (monthly/yearly); Consumer spending for May was up 0.4% mainly due to strong demand for autos what can make a positive footprint on Q2 GDP number; Personal income grew but slightly below expectations and Pending home sales fell on monthly basis. According to Powel Brexit has increased global risks and Fed likely not hiking rates this year.

Thursday – interesting formula for UK: Sum of FDI + portfolio investments + current account = 12.8% of GDP. Portfolio investments and FDI inflows more than offset the Current account deficit of 5.1% GDP, but what if the inflows reverse? UK is still able to finance its current account with foreign money, but likely would need to decrease the consumption at certain point as the inflows reverse also on lower yields. EZ June Advanced CPI Est. at +0.1% vs 0.0% exp. Y/Y, CPI Core +0.9% vs 0.8% exp. Y/Y, the better number was due to higher core and slower decline in energy prices. Draghi - EZ GDP will be lower by 0.5% in 2017/18 due to Brexit. Carney (BOE) – further easing in July post Brexit likely, Chicago PMI higher on production and new orders, US Initial claims higher but in line with healthy job market (below 300k).
  
Friday – ECB loosening QE buying rules helped peripheral issues and other HY bonds should benefit as well. EU PMIs better, EZ May Unemployment rate at 10.1% in line with exp, lowest since Sep 2011. Bullard (Fed) – sees US GDP still at +2% rate, no further contagion from Brexit, Fed still tools to use, productivity needs to increase, low bond yields to continue. Fisher (Fed) – wait &amp; see data/tightening, US economy pretty doing pretty well, no plans to move into negative rates.

Stocks rallied towards the end of month (Q2 &amp; H1), as we saw lots of short-covering, window dressing but not sure how long will it last. 











Upcoming Week Outlook

Monday – we can expect a refocusing of markets from assessing Brexit impact/uncertainty to incoming data. The Brexit even was a huge thing, despite being expected well in advance, but now it is a time to go back to work. 
 
Tuesday – RBA will be in focus, followed by Carney and BOE Financial Stability Report. Will Mr Carney bring up more hints on a pre-announced July easing? Isn’t having GBP down 13% a perfect stimulus tool? Dudley and Tarullo (both Fed) will be out (Tuesday/Wednesday) and in spite of their planned agenda, we may learn more about the impact of Brexit on US jobs creation. Recent economic data were solid, except for May NFPs hiccup, employers are hiring but productivity growth is missing. Actually, all of that in the light of “upcoming” rate (non) hikes from Fed (market pricing them in 2017), will be watched and thought through.

Wednesday – US Trade Balance (going more negative) and ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI (better than previous). The highlight will be FOMC Minutes from the last before Brexit meeting. They will not be that relevant in the light of new situation after the vote, but may provide some guidance on job creation, macro data vs Fed hike likelihood. 

Thursday – BoJ Kuroda speaking, well Japanese officials were pretty busy with verbal interventions last week and it would be nice to see Kuroda shedding some light on potential new QE. ECB’s even non-monetary meeting can bring some surprise comments/ideas in Brexit, aftermath as Italian banks are getting fragile. ADP Non-Farm Employment Change, Challenger Job Cuts and Initial Jobless Claims will be definitely watched ahead of Friday for some hints on US NFPs after May debacle with +38k only. 

Friday – US Non-Farm payrolls will be highly watched event as market is trying (again) to solve the Fed rate hike puzzle. Market is expecting the number between 175k-181k for June and unemployment rate rising to 4.8% from 4.7% previously. 

Earnings – Samsung (Wednesday), PepsiCo Inc (Thursday), other companies are not that relevant. Samsung – EPS expected to be down, revenue up but sales of S7 Galaxy seem to be strong. Ready for a positive surprise here when we are getting more to price than features game? PepsiCo – sales should be above analysts’ estimates giving us a good insight in EM and overall consumer demand, but investors will also listen to any comments on potential impact of Brexit on product lines. The changes in health trends affecting Coca-Cola are also the same for PepsiCo. Well, think twice… http://tinyurl.com/hn932vu

During medical school he will be racking up the debt. Then he will do a 3-4 year residency making ~50k. And then he will make approximately 200k as a doctor in the field he's interested in. I figure he could pay me back about 15k/yr during residency and then 36k/yr as a physician.

15k/yr * 3 yrs = 45k.  
36k/yr * 5 yrs = 180k

personalfinance,[Need Advice] Considering buying a house,"I have been considering buying a house for the past few years. I was looking with a realtor a couple years ago but ended up not going through with anything because I was unsure where I would be in a few years. I am now sure I will remain in my current area for at least 5 years. 

I am in my late 20's and work in tech in the SF bay area making approx 150k with 0 debt. I am currently investing pretty heavily in index funds. I have maxed out my 401k, IRA, ESPP, and am contributing to an after tax brokerage.

My current lease is coming to an end in a few months and my roomate is planning to move to another state, so I have two options: 1) Find a new roommate / new apartment 2) Buy a house

I am considering option 2 because interest rates are quite low right now and I am getting tired of moving every year. Rent is quite expensive here and seems to be increasing every year as well.

I considering looking for a 2br/3br/2b for 600-700k. I have the funds to put 20% down on a house in this price (parents will help with this). According to a mortgage calculator the payment will be approx $3,300 with property tax &amp; insurance. I would get a roommate which should be able to contribute $1200 or so. I am currently paying 3600/mo for a 2br (split of course) so this payment will be pretty similar with a roommate. If necessary I could swing paying the full payment for a few months here and there by budgeting if I am unable to find a roommate but would be pretty house poor if I did not have one.

personalfinance,"(US, CN) Life Decisions at 20","Wow, wow, first post on Reddit! Hello everybody!  

I just turned 20 years old and decided to get my finances in order. I'm currently working in Beijing, China as an English teacher. I make $30 an hour, which equates to about $300 to $450 a week. (Yes, you can make that much without a degree) My rent is paid down until August. Here's how things look right now:

**Private Loans:**  
8% APY - $20,130.34*  
4.750% APY - $14,978.70  

*I feel like a loan with a rate as high as 8% deserves some explanation. This was for my freshman year of college, before I really understood what that 8% means or the impact it would have on my financial future. My parents took it out for me, and I just assumed it would all be okay. I'm anxious to refinance this, but I'm still a sophomore in college, and many loan providers require a steady job and that you hold a degree in order to consider you. For the record, this loan is from Sallie Mae.

**Federal Loans:**  
5% APY - $3,500*  

*This is a Perkins Loan in grace until October 2016.  

**Stocks:**

$200, 5 year note, to be issued by August 1st, 2016.  

**Vanguard Mutual Fund:**  
$1,000*

**Savings Account (Ally Bank at 1% APY):**  
$1,361.97*  

*I realize that Ally Bank doesn't offer the highest interest rates, but their 24/7 customer support is especially handy considering I'm living on the other side of the planet. I'm planning on opening a [Barclay's Dream account](https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/dream-account.html) which offers a 1.05% rate, for use as an emergency fund. When I go back home this August, I plan on closing my local bank account, which offered 0% on Checking and 0.02% on Savings. On another note, should I open a Discover Checking account? I've heard good things about them.

**Checking Account (China Construction Bank at 0% APY):**  
About $826.48 or 5500RMB.  

I suppose my question is; am I heading in the right direction? I don't need too much liquidity right now because my earnings in China cover all of my expenses, and I have plenty left over, which I put into my savings.

personalfinance,Can I count on refinancing my car loan?,"Hey all! Thank you in advance. I have read the top discussions on loans, buying used cars and building credit, and feel like I could benefit from some more directed advice. 

Here is my situation. I currently have a 20 year old Toyota Camry which is very close to being undriveable. Even with regular maintenance, I am surprised each day it gets me to work and back. 

I started building my credit 4 months ago. According to credit karma, I should be on track to establish a credit score of roughly 700. I've never missed a payment and I keep my usage low, but I regularly make use of my card. I have $3200 in savings. After monthly expenses, if I am frugal, I can save $400 per month. 

So here are my options. I can spend hundreds or thousands on my car to keep it running (right now it needs brakes, timing belt, oil, tires, that I know of, and there seems to be a growing issue with the suspension) and keep on saving. I can buy a very cheap, old car outright. Or I can agree to the Astronomically high interest rate offered by a local dealership, get a decent used vehicle, and hope my credit union will agree to refinance my loan after I establish credit in 2-3 months. This is my first time building credit in my life, so hopefully that puts me in a better position than bad credit. I commute 56 miles a day 5 days a week.

## Recent financials 

From their latest annual

&gt; These markets are influenced by many factors including consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy. 

So sounds like this is a classic cyclical business with the economy being the key driver. The growth and margin expansion look pretty good too!

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $8.1bn | $7.8bn | $7.3bn | $5.8bn | $5.6bn|
|EPS | $8.31 | $7.25 | $5.07 | $3.61 | $2.52|
## Competition

From their latest SEC filing

&gt; The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals. In 2014, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $21.8 billion in sales, up approximately 5.6% over 2013's sales of $20.7 billion.

&gt; The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines.

Despite that commentary both margins and returns look healthy.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $226.75 for Mohawk Industries, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 20% to their target.

# Valuation

The following table shows the key valuation metrics. The valuation is aggressive versus it's *Household Furnishings* peers. Though, I'm not sure I have the right peer group. If we look at a wider cyclical consumer group forecast PE is over 20 times with long-term growth expectations of 15%+ per annum. Could it be this is a ""boring business"" that is largely ignored?

# Dividends
Mohawk Industries, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. The firm appears to be happily doing deals, re-investing cashflow rather than paying dividends. In 2015 they did 3 big deals. 

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 0% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 2%. That's against a backdrop of revenues up 15% to $2.17B over the 3 months and reported net income up from $22.3M to $171.5M. Revenues were up for all 3 divisions: Flooring ROW; Flooring NA  and Ceramics.

In their [latest earnings call](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3972500-mohawk-industries-mhk-jeffrey-s-lorberbaum-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) they talked about their optimism, the benefits of the acquistions and the way their recent capital investments are bearing fruit. 

But they note that:

&gt; Each of our capital expansion projects creates significant long-term value, adding new revenues by increasing our product offerings and our customer base. Typically, these projects take one to three years to achieve their full benefit. All of these investments could provide higher returns than our acquisitions, though start-up costs impact our immediate results.

Perhaps these investments will provide a catalyst for earnings upgrades in the coming quarters? Alternatively could it be a stronger US economy and housebuilding market?

&gt; Similar to 2015, the U.S. economy had a soft start this year, but continues to benefit from solid job creation and low interest rates. Despite sluggish new home starts in March, the National Association of Home Builders affirmed the recovery of the U.S. single home family market.

For me, this is an intriguing stock! I think it merits a more detailed look.

personalfinance,Help! Dad has $60k in CC Debt. Looking for ways to consolidate,"Quick intro: Long time lurker and just wanted to say that this subreddit really has an amazing group of people that I have learned a lot from.  

Summary of the issue: 
My dad (63 y/old) has managed to gather $60k in CC debt across several credit cards (5 or 6) with a range of interest rates (highest being 14%). His annual salary pretax is about $110K. He's pretty old school and still manages everything by hand, paper bills and checks which is a tracking nightmare.  I have setup everything on mint for him and me to start getting a better picture of this and that does help a bit (but i just set it up like 2 weeks ago).  I'm also going to try to stay on top of him in regards of his spending habits now that mint setup. My next step is to try figure out a way to start consolidation his debt into 1 or 2 monthly payments so that there are at least fewer accounts we need to track (and with lower interest rates).    He paid about ~5k in interest alone last year and i definitely would like for less to be towards interest and more towards the principal. He has an excellent credit score if that helps..

Where I could use some advice:
1) What are some good debt consolidation options?  We tried getting personal loans through TD and SOFI but were rejected. 
2) In terms of interest rates, we are seeing rate quotes of about 8% which i think is high... are there any low interest rate alternatives?
3) I can help contribute a decent amount monthly as well.  
4) While i don't like the idea of him having to declare bankruptcy is that a good move in THIS case?  I would think that would be a last ditch effort.

Also, before we go down the path of ""your dad sounds like a pretty irresponsible human being and its better to cut off these financial vampires"" let me be clear.  He's a good dude and didn't use the money for selfish reasons or vices or anything like that. He spent it all on us, his family, and we were the irresponsible ones for putting that pressure on him. He's been an amazing person in my life and I really want to help him out in any and every way I can.",finance,1467651339
personalfinance,Which option will increase my pre-approved housing purchase price the most short-term: paying off debt OR buying points on the interest rate?,"I am currently participating in a non-profit housing assistance program. This allows for me to, among other things, buy a house with no down payment, no closing costs, and no mortgage insurance requirement. (There are Minimum Required Funds, which I can pay from my Roth IRA.) After the underwriting process, my housing qualification amount came back lower than I expected. 


Rather than taking a loan from my 401(k), my father has graciously offered to give me additional funds, somewhere between $3,000 to $5,000. My question is, which would benefit me more in the short-term to get my qualification amount increased: using that cash to pay off half my total debt or using it to buy down the interest rate? I would use it to pay off the credit card debt. Detail listed below.


* Average monthly net regular income: $2,700
* Average quarterly net bonus income: $850
* Average annual net bonus income: variable, $0 - $4,000
* Current car loan balance: $4,500 (I pay $250/month)
* Current credit card debt at 0% interest with continual fixed payments: $2,000 (I pay $50/month)
* Current credit card debt at 0% interest until March 2017: $3,000 (I pay whatever I can pay/month)
* Current qualification amount: $132,000
* Desired qualification amount: $140,000 - $150,000
* Current quoted interest rate: 3.125%
* Average property tax rate: 3%


I am calling my housing counselor tomorrow to ask her how long it will take once either of these things are complete, but I'd like to have an idea of the best way to utilize this money. I don't know what other information would be helpful. Please let me know, thanks.

It says that “the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 requires withholding of Federal Income taxes from distributions ... unless the recipient elects not to have withholding apply. ... All withholding will be deducted from the gross distribution amount prior to issuing the funds to you.

What are the pros/cons to withholding taxes?  I’d rather pay the taxes now and not have to pay them out of my savings later.

Frostmane is a Vanilla Server with a strict focus on Survival and progression. We are actually a semi-vanilla server as we do utilize a dynamic map. We've been strong and we've fallen hard. We've established a solid player base and have lost our player base. We've been up for many months and we've gone down for many months.

What we'd like to see is players selling or buying diamonds from each other using the subreddit - Or whatever item it is you'd like to buy/sell.

I will emphasize a strict policy on survival. One thing that always bothered me was seeing mods flying around spawning in materials. They may as well have been playing on a Creative server. That stuff doesn't happen in Frostmane. Here is the original mcservers listing for our server. Mind you we've started a new map so some of the listed endeavors may be a non-existent :P

###**Amenities**



- **Iron** **Farms** We are home to several iron farms (Based off DOCM77s original design) in several of the towns for players who would like assistance in making tools or are in a quick need of iron. Simply ask a moderator if you are would like any or check the public iron farm in the Spawnshire tower.



- **Gold** **Farms** For those looking to expand the rail system, there is plenty of gold for powered rails in one of our two gold farms. Coupled with the iron farms, there is room for infinite railway expansion. Note: These gold farms will soon be obsolete with the future implementation of a nether-roof design. [Image](http://www.frostmane.net/uploads/3/9/4/2/39425921/6535470_orig.png)



- **Armory** offers free iron armor and weapons to new players. 



- **Walking** **distance** **from** **Railway** Offers quick transports for thousands of blocks (Currently along the -X and Z axis)



- **Nether** **Hub** For the fastest transport, there is a system of hallways in the nether. Currently there is a new nether hub under construction above the bedrock. We have broken through the ceiling bedrock. ^Special ^thanks ^to ^BigcatChandler ^and ^Mcsmack



- **Chicken** **Palace** For new players wishing to stock up on food, there is an automated chicken farm/cooker at spawn. Just look for the giant chicken! Take some feathers while you're there. (We have more than enough) ^Special ^thanks ^to ^Mcsmack ^and ^Autonate [^Images](http://imgur.com/a/qAlNU) 



- **Enderman** **Farm** If you are in need of quick XP or just some enderpearls, we have a public endermen farm which can get you to lv 30 in minutes.^special ^thanks ^to ^suchareq3 [^Image](http://www.frostmane.net/uploads/3/9/4/2/39425921/4473195_orig.png)



- **Redstone Rail Duplicator** Those looking to expand the rail system may take a quick visit to our rail duplicator facility near spawn. It is the building that looks just like a powered rail. ^Special ^thanks ^to ^SprocketMCrankns [^Image](http://www.frostmane.net/uploads/3/9/4/2/39425921/8823049_orig.png) 



- **Slave-Trading** A number of established players have built automatic Village Breeders. Players looking to buy villagers may inquire with players Prelyt or McSmack.  [Images](http://imgur.com/a/GrrVr) 


- **Mob-Farm** In Eastern Spawnshire lays a large tower. Atop rests a mob farm (Based of the X-Spawner design by The Smoking Koala) With items such as bones, arrows, flesh, string, and gunpowder in such abundance, players need simply ask if these items are needed. The gunpowder will be sold in the form of TNT in Marketshire whereas all other items will likely be spared freely for those in need. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/sJrfjif.png)



- **Slime-Farm** Frostmane is home to a 4-chunk slime farm. We have dug out these chunks and replaced them with spawning platforms. Players in need of slime will need to AFK here until they obtain the desired amount of slime balls.



- **Witherfarm** The construction of the automatic wither skeleton farm is near completion. We have dug out a 128x128 portion of the nether. Upon it's completion, plenty of coal and beacons will be available for cheap to all players. ^(Special thanks to Autonate) [Images](http://imgur.com/a/hLIWk)



- **Gulag** Bad players are sent to the gulag and put into adventure mode. Players are asked not to enter the gulag as they will be put into adventure mode and will not be able to escape without the help of a moderator. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/6CSNE0W.jpg)



- **Free** **Overnight** **Parking** [More](http://i.imgur.com/NoQcaDf.png)

**Upcoming**


- **Guardian Farm** The Ocean Monument nearest to spawn is to be excavated. Access to this site can be found though the nether hub. Simply take the hallways south and then left at the sign saying ""Ocean Monument"" [Image](http://i.imgur.com/DxM70fI.png)


- **The Great Trade City of Marketshire** Players may currently buy lots in Frostmane's trade city Marketshire. Purchased lots may be used to build shops for others to buy from. This project is currently lead by **Grootemoeite**; The Emerald King, and Lord of Marketshire. [Map](http://imgur.com/MCviXab)


- **Ventrilo** or teamspeak or whatever. This is open for discussion depending on population growth.


- **Dedicated Hardware** With the increasing number of new players joining Frostmane, dedicated hardware will soon be a necessity. As we exist simply as a virtual machine in a data center, we are bottle-necked by the traffic of other server instances sharing the same hardware. Christmas was a painful day with the overflow of traffic to Host Horde's machines. The View Distance has been set to 12 to accommodate so many players while reducing network lag. It is Prelyt's and my goal to eventually switch over to dedicated hardware when our server grows to a point where it is no longer a question. We envision of a view distance never less than 16.

**The Great Spawn Cities**


- **Spawn Woods** New players will first appear in the crossroads between cities at Spawn Woods. From here, they will be greeted with a fresh supply of cooked chicken provided by our automatic chicken cooker. They will also be greeted by our warm and welcoming Spawn Woods Inn (Under construction!) where they may stay the night. The signs on the roads will point players on their way. Building/logging in this preserve is discouraged as we do not want new players to be bombarded with player-builds upon first logging in.  This land resting between the three main cities is overseen by Lord McSmacks. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/97ySzGI.png)


- **Spawn Lake** Nestled between the three main cities is Spawn Lake, a lovely beach biome sporting prime real-estate between the major cities.  Any player wishing to build here is more than welcomed. The Spawn Canal also connects the lake to the Spawnshire River. This municipality is overseen by Lord Mr_Blister50. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/TJTEWCa.jpg)


- **Spawnshire** The city of Spawnshire sits on the map origin and has served as our original spawn. Without much in the way of layout planning, Spawnshire is a city of chaotic design and hospitality. Shops here offer items free for new players. It also offers a variety of services such as rail duplication, an iron farm, and an Inn. It is also the home to the nether portal leading to the nether hub as well as several player cottages. Players are welcomed to build homes here or on it's outskirts. As the last mayor of this city has gone missing, this land is currently overseen by Lord Salty_Snatch. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/mSDw2ok.jpg)


- **Marketshire** Under the rule of King Grootemoeite, this stretch of land serves as the official trade city for Frostmane. Players here are able to purchase a lot on which they may build shops to sell to other players. Marketshire is still under construction and will soon be home to the first Investment Banks of Frostmane. (See Investment Banking under rules) Established players are encouraged to join in the action by bring exotic items to the great spawn cities. In a Large Biomes map, such trade of items brought from afar is encouraged. Be it jungle saplings, packed ice, or hardened clay, they are all worth something in this city. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/pfERw58.jpg)


- **Eastern Spawnshire** This land just across the lake is home to several automatic farms. New players are welcomed to harvest crops and livestock so long as they replenish. Visitors may help themselves to some melon slices. This city is overseen by Lord Crusaderp. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/AoRIm3i.jpg)


- **Dunshire** Far in the north lays the city of Dunshire whose ruler Prelyt has long left to build the city of Frost Thorne in the far east. Players wishing to visit or build here may find Dunshire by taking the nether portal halls north or may take the railway north 4000 blocks. Dunshire is home to several amenities including two iron farms, an automatic wheat farm, mob farm, and a number of taverns. Those willing to AFK here are more than welcome to the bountiful yields of these automatic farms. [Image](http://i.imgur.com/Q68m2Fn.png)


- **Frost Thorne** A keep 40k blocks to the east nestled with in the Ice Spike biomes. Players often visit to harvest packed ice and snow to bring back to the spawn cities. Reaching this town on foot has not been done. There is currently a railway leading directly to this place just outside the nether hub. Players may also use a horse to get there. A small horse ranch can be found just outside the nether hub. [Images](https://imgur.com/a/RTrMr)

**Rules:**



- **Claiming** Players are asked to post a sign with their name on it on their builds. More specifically, in large cities that are home to multiple players. This gives others an idea of who they are ~~stealing~~ ~~from~~ visiting.


- **Logging** Trees are to be removed completely when harvested. Floating tree tops are a nuisance to take down when needed. If faced with a large Oak Tree, burn it down. Repeat offenders will be sent to the Gulag. 



- **Grief** Destruction, stealing, obstruction, and harassment will result in a ban. Building a giant penis along the road, however funny it may be, is an obstruction to traffic and will not happen.



- **Investment Banking** Currently a couple of players are setting up banks in Marketshire. Qualified layers looking to take out a loan may receive up to a block of diamonds. (Enough to create starter tools) Investees may then pay the diamonds back within a specific grace period established by the investor without any interested accrued. After the grace period, an interest rate may be applied daily. If the amount of time given to repay the loan has passed with the loan left unpaid, banker players may request that the players land and titles be seized by the server. The land may be sold at auction or given directly to the bank. Qualification for such a loan is dependent on a player's assets including land and items.



- **The Law of Salvage** Our Salvage law allows for any township or kingdom left abandoned to be listed as salvage. In this case, the land will be given to another player or sold at auction by a moderator (Diamonds) A land will be considered abandoned if it's player/s have not logged on in **30 days** or more. The land and all of it's treasures are then transferred to the new player. However, the land and any buildings on it are not to be destroyed.



- **Iron Grant** Players interested in establishing new builds may be eligible for a grant of up to 64 blocks of iron in order to aid them in establishing a base or township. It is asked that this grant be used for those with virtuous builds in mind. It is suggested that these players eventually build their own iron farms to spread the love. Players interested in this grant may request it by posting in our subreddit with a description of what it is they wish to accomplish.


- **Appeals** Banned players wishing to return may appeal by typing a rather long and saucy appeal on our subreddit. Please include the reason for your crimes and your reason for wishing to make ammends.


- **Restitution** Players having suffered grief from a banned player may request to have their buildings restored to a previous state. All lands and titles of the offending player may be seized by the moderators and handed over to the offended.


- **Phallic structures must be tasteful.**



^All ^other ^rules, ^including ^**PVP** ^are ^at ^the ^consent ^of ^the ^town/kingdom.


---


**[PVP]** Some biomes or kingdoms may be flagged as PVP zones. In these zones, players are allowed to kill each other unless they agree to work cooperatively. While you may then steal the items of those you kill, one shall not cause damage to any builds. Such dedicated PVP zones include Frost Thorn (The Ice Spike Biome in the far east), any PVP arenas/stadiums (Excluding spectator areas), and any and all pubs/taverns/bars.


**[Anarchy]** Entire biomes (Including it's rivers) may be claimed as Anarchy biomes where players are free do as they wish. (Including destruction) Such areas must be well-marked as a warning for other players. A perimeter must be established and is not to be destroyed. All destruction and chaotic behavior must stay out of chat. So far this is an experimental concept and has not been implimented yet. Such biomes may be established soon.


**[PVE]** All other unmarked zones are to be considered as PVE. Towns and builds are to be considered as PVE unless specifically stated otherwise.

personalfinance,VW Buyback and potential new car.,"Hello everyone, sorry for the lack of flair or any real structure, I'm on mobile at work. 

Last year I had no credit, had just landed an amazing job that paid me more in mileage than a car payment would realistically be, and my AC-less Scion XB was approaching the end of it's life. I ended up at the Volkswagen dealership in town with no credit and a co-signer that still ended up with me landing a 19% interest rate. I was happy though, I had a 2012 Jetta TDI even though I knew that paying it all off via normal payments would land me in the 30-35k range (yeah, I got screwed royally but it's a great car). I left that job in September of 2015 after they cut mileage and increased hours significantly.

Fast forward a bit to the Dieselgate scandal and now they're buying them back. My calculations based on the tables released recently show that I should be able to pay off my loan entirely and have roughly $5,800 left over. 

In a little over a year I have been able to go from no credit to a 678 and 667 between transunion and experion. No late payments on anything ever, minor medical debts, nothing else bad on my credit. All cards are at roughly 30% or less balance as well. 

I want to do this right this time, but I have no idea where to start or what to expect. Do I get a loan from USAA or finance at the dealership? That's probably one of the stupidest questions anyone has ever asked in here but I'm looking for the answers in the best way I know how. Do I get the loan approval before I go into the dealership? Do I base it on the price of the car? Does the dealership still add a finance charge and dealer fees? 

As for a down payment, I was planning to put down 3-4K and pocket the rest in savings as a financial cushion. Is that wise? Should I put down less or more? I want to show the bank that I'm serious about paying and hopefully get a better interest rate. 

My current payment on the 2012 Jetta TDI is $496/m. I don't want to get screwed again this time, and I'll also be going to a different dealership that offers a free lifetime warranty on the engine/transmission on top of the typical warranty for everything else. 

I plan to go for a New 2016 VW Golf TSI S 4D automatic. Price on the website is $18,944, $15,944 after down payment. 

What should I expect from the dealership or the bank? Is there a chance of actually getting a 4-5% interest rate? 

Thank you.",finance,1467656185
personalfinance,Paying down CC debt the best way possible,"Hello PF,
credit card has about $6500 in debt on it, there has been advertisements from the bank of the CC that says they can offer a loan to pay down the Cc. Are these good for me as the person wanting to pay down this balance? The Apr is about 9.5 with the current CC and is it best to get a lower interest rate to pay it down? The Cc offers cash back rewards by making purchases on it, is it good to put regular purchases on the card to get back to small rewards if I would be making the purchases anyway? Or to cut the card into pieces and make payments each month.",finance,1467656716

                The Decentralized Autonomous Factor


        •	Who am I?

My name is Jonathan KLEIN, I am a 25 years old French entrepreneur. My partner, Loic GORKA, and I are launching a new Fintech, Tresorio. Tresorio is a cash-flow financing crowdfunding platform. The aim of Tresorio is to offer a new vision of invoice financing. Thanks to this platform, entrepreneurs can obtain a flexible short-term loan justify by a future cash-flow represented by an invoice. If you issued an invoice with a 45-day payment delay, you could receive a loan in 48 hours of the amount of the invoice. The loan is reimbursed when your client pays the bill. 
Besides that, we have a 500MH mining rig used to generate a small amount of gas for our future smart-contracts.  

        •	What is Invoice Discounting?

Invoice discounting is the practice of using a company's unpaid accounts receivable as collateral for a loan, which is issued by a finance company. This is an extremely short-term form of borrowing.

Invoice discounting essentially accelerates cash flow from customers, so that instead of waiting for customers to pay within their normal credit terms, you receive cash almost as soon as you issue the invoice.

        •	Why is this important?

All over the world, our Ponzy-scheme monetary system creates a money scarcity for the masses. Small and medium businesses are dying from this lack of cash and investors desperately need interesting investment products. 
Invoice financing make them both happy. 
For businesses, this is an affordable way to face their cash-flow needs whitout betting on the success of a development project. The commercial operation represented by the invoice is done, all you need is to wait the money from the client. 
For investors, this is an interesting way to finance the real world with a high return (3 to 12% per year depending on the risk profile of the company). Thus, the money you lend is allocate for a very short time (3 months max). 

In a more philosophical perspective, money rules our world and to my mind, financial Dapps are very powerful tools to show how Ethereum could make this world a better place. 


        •	What does a successful factor need?


-	A kickass financial analysis system 

In order to create trust and to avoid a too high default rate, each company needs to be evaluate. An interest rate reflecting the risk needs to be set as well as a maximum amount of simultaneous loan. In addition, financial analysts need to provide a fair overview of the financial situation of the company to the investors. 

-	Efficiency and flexibility

To meet the businesses needs, the organization have to be able to finance an invoice in less than 48 hours. 
Furthermore, in France, 23% of the clients don’t pay their invoice on time but only 3% don’t pay within a month after the end of the delay.  This is why the system needs to be flexible. 

-	Autonomous contracts 

If we want to really make a difference, this system has to be autonomous. We have to automate the redaction and the application of the contracts between borrowers and lenders.


-	Liquidity for investors

If we want to bring the masses into a system like that, the money can’t be stuck for a too long time. Private investors have to be able to sell their loan to someone else if they need their investment back. 

-	An anti-fraud system

It is obvious that the easier it is to borrow, the greater will be the risk of invoice falsification. Because it’s not an invoice repurchasing but a loan based on an invoice, this risk will be reduced. Even if you submit a false invoice, if you sell use a same invoice to get two loans from different parties or if the underlying commercial operation goes wrong, you still have to reimburse the loan. 

-	A collection system

If a borrower doesn’t pay his debt, the factor needs to have a strategy to recover the funds. 

-	A credit-insurance 

If there is a total default on the debt, an insurance has to be set up to refund (at least partially) the investors. Dynamis we need your help! 

-	A friendly legal environment 

In France, a blockchain-based certificate intermediation is now officially legal. The financial instrument has to be a certificate (“bon de caisse” in French). The certificate is nothing more than a IOU for businesses. 
Our legal partner is an American law-firm, Kramer Levin, specialized in Fintech. 

  
        •	Bring Factoreum to life within the Ethereum Ecosystem 

First of all, thank you for still reading this article. I hope my English is not to bad but you know…French are bad in foreign languages…
Loic and I have experiences in finance and entrepreneurship but none in programming Smart Contracts (or anything else). We are big fans of Ethereum because of its potential of disruption and because we really need to create the conditions of an emerging world where freedom and democracy are not just marketing. It’s not a big news, we need a paradigm shift to avoid a very dark future where self-interests of the elite are the only things that matter. 
We really hope that this project will receive support from the Ethereum community and that we could work on it with developers and other great minds on this forum. 

This is now the time to expose our vision of how this could work. 

        1.	A web-server 
The web platform is very important. It is the entry gate for the masses. It should be well designed, clear and easy to use. 
On this platform, borrowers could submit their application, investors could make a deposit and choose where they want to invest. Crowdlending platforms are good examples of what informations we should display on this site. 
A blockchain explorer could be use within this website to show real time data (how much a company currently owes to investors for example).
This web server will also be useful for the recruitment of Recruiters and Analyst. 

        2.	The tokens
This part gave me a lot of headaches so I will be glad to have some help on this particular subject. 
The problem is that a system based entirely on a cryptocurrency is doomed because of its interactions with the fiat system. Businesses have to be paid in fiat currency because they can’t pay their furnisher in ether (at least for the next few years). 
A solution could be a “fiat token backed by ether”. 
When an investor makes a 1000€ deposit on the website, the 1000€ should give him 1000 tokens. In order to make this “Ethereum compliant”, we could introduce ether as an exchange value. When the 1000€ deposit is done, the platform change these into ETH (at current exchange rate) and change these ETH into token (at current exchange rate). 
At 10€/ETH, 1000€ -&gt; 100ETH -&gt;1000 token. 
If ETH/EUR goes to 20€/ETH, 1000 token -&gt; 50ETH -&gt; 1000€.
I don’t know if it’s a smart way to see this or if it’s even possible but it will annihilate the risk of an important fluctuation of the ether price during the process. 

        3.	The “Recruiters” 
The “Recruiters” user-class will act like a decentralized human resource department. First recruiters will be nominated by the founders of the project. 
Their role will be to recruit the analysts and the other recruiters. 
Each time an analyst makes a candidacy through the web server, the recruiters will place a bet on the approval in token. You want to accept a candidate because you think that he has the ability to conduct good analysis, you bet 1 token on the YES. 
When 10 recruiters at least have placed their bets, the consensus win the fees paid by the losers. 

        4.	The “Analysts” 
The “Analysts” user-class will act like a decentralized financial analysis department. To become a certified analyst, you’ll have to justify your ability to conduct financial analysis (CV, motivation letter, example of analysis made, etc.) and be approved by the HR department.
Each time a business makes a candidacy through the web server, the analyst will analyze financial information, redact a note to the investors, propose an interest rate reflecting the risk and a maximum amount of simultaneous loan. 
For this work, analyst will receive a compensation in tokens paid by the entrepreneur as an analyst fee. 

        5.	The “Insurers” 
Because Insurance firms are seeing the risk through data and statistics and not through a human perspective, we think that a decentralized insurance could improve efficiency. 
Take the example of a 1000€ invoice, when the cash collection begins, all investors who wants to lend money to the borrower could say “I want to place 100€ on this loan”.  This is the crowdfunding part. We can also imagine a crowdinsurance part in this process where insurers could say “I send 50 tokens on the insurance contract for a prime of 1 token”. The investor can choose to pay 1 token, loose it at the profit of the insurer if the loan goes well or take the 50 tokens if the loan is in default. 
Insurers could be the client of the borrower himself, employees of the borrower who have faith in their company, analysts, small insurance firms or anybody else. 
The amount of the prime will be set through an auction system. The amount of the prime will be another indicator of risk for the investors and the bad borrowers will be punished through this system. 


        6.	The “Borrowers” 
When a company wants to borrow from investors, all the entrepreneur has to do is scan the invoice and enter the email address and the matriculation number (SIREN in France) of his client. The invoice is dematerialized and send to the client who electronically sign it. The advantage of this process is that Factoreum knows that the client approved the invoice without having to tell anything to this client about the financing operation. 
The bank account information of the borrower on the invoice has to point to a wallet type bank account. This wallet could have an IBAN like any common bank account thanks to the technologies developed by payment fintech like MangoPay.
When the client pays the bill on this wallet, the capital part of the loan is automatically change in ether and in tokens. The tokens are reimbursed to the investors. 

Then, a project page is set up. On this page, investors could see a brief description of the company, a brief description of the relation between the company and his client, financial basic information, analyst recommendation, previous investors feedback, interest rate and maturation of the loan. 

When investors have brought the amount of the invoice, this amount is send to the borrower’s wallet minus the total amount of interest. If this is an invoice of 10 000€ that has to be paid by the client in 45 days, the certificate (loan) will be of 10 000€ + x% interest rate*maturation*10 000 for a period of 75 days (maturation of the certificate = maturation of the invoice + 30 days of grace period). 
Each day, the investors getting back the daily interest until the capital is reimbursed. 
At D+45, if the client payment is not received, a notification is sent to the borrowers to let him know that his client hasn’t paid the bill in time. The borrower has 30 days to find a solution with his client or himself. 
At D+70, a notification is sent to inform the borrower that a direct debit will be maid in 5 days from his usual bank account. 
At D+75, the direct debit is maid. If there is not enough money on the bank account, a collection process begins. 
If that collection process fail, insurers lose their bets.  

        7.	The “Investors”
Investors could be anyone: Individuals, financial institutions, other businesses, union, etc. 
They just have to create an investor profile on the platform and buy tokens in fiat currencies or directly in ETH. 


        8.	The contracts 
As I said, my understanding of how smart contracts works is very limited but I assume that a simple contract couldn’t (or shouldn’t) orchestrate all that. 
Correct me if I’m wrong but we can imagine conventional tools used to create multiple smart contracts within a common system. 
A web platform used to generate an insurance contract each time a loan in insured for example. 
I picture that as a collection of contracts using Solidity, generated and orchestrated by more complex algorithms inside the web platform for each functionality or interaction.


I hope that was a not too long reading and that I was clear enough. 
My personal goals here, through this post or through my firm, is to show the world how finance could work in the 21st century. Taking back some power from banks in the process is an important driver too!
If that makes me rich, great, I could use some financial freedom but it’s not the most important point. 
That’s why I expose this idea to you today, this has a gigantic potential for millions of users, companies and investor, for ethereum and for our economy when the actual system will fail (and it sure will). This could create a real decentralized financial firm run by collective intelligence and consciousness in transparency and fairness. 
I am opened to any suggestion and I will be thrilled to work on this with the community. 

If you think that this project is interesting and want to help me or just if you judge that the effort deserve a reward, you can donate to 0xbfF0083045F931FE8f3472A43199a7e07488D244. 

Thank you in advance for your help,

personalfinance,Mortgage questions. Refinance? Pay extra towards principle? Etc.,"My mortgage is a 30 year and I'm on first year. Owe 142k at the moment. Interest rate is 4.0. After full escrow with HOA, HI and PT it's at a flat $900.00 per month. I've always paid an extra $100 towards my principle for a flat $1000.00 per month.


I know interest rates have dropped a bit but I'm not sure if its worth refinancing for an extra 1-1.5% lower. Also I'm not sure if its better to put that extra $100 per month towards the principle or if it would be wiser to be putting it into a mutual fund. My retirement is already covered so that $100.00 would be extra. As it is I do a minimum of 10% of my income towards savings/investments so that extra 100 towards the mortgage does affect me.

The problem: she is running out the federal student loans she can take out. She doesn't have enough left to borrow to finish under-grad. She has no help whatsoever from family. Father is deceased, left her with nothing. Has not spoken to her mother in over 5 years.

personalfinance,How to handle high student debt with relatively high income and considerable stock options.,"I'm a 22 year old, single,  male that just finished college and I'm about to move to Seattle to begin work at a large tech company. I have collected alot of debt but I was lucky enough to land a job which may make it more manageable to deal with.

 My main questions is how to handle all of my student debt (is it possible to refinance? should I kill small loans upfront?) But also I'm interesting in answers to how to handle my stock options (Do I let them vest for &gt;1 year to take advantage of some kind of tax break or sell what I can after 6 months?) Do I enroll in a stock buy back program where I can buy 15% of my check in company stock at a discounted rate of 10% and then after 6 months of vesting I get control? 

Am I in big trouble or am I in a position where I have control over my finances?

I will be living in an apartment (haven't found it yet) but I expect to pay around 1,300/1,400 per month. There are so many things to consider and I'm dealing with so much debt/income that I have no idea if I will come clean out of this deal. How to I handle my salary and more importantly stocks to put myself in the strongest financial position? Do I start investing in a 401k (if so which/how much traditional? Roth?)? Do I mess with stock buy back programs? I'm thinking about selling my first 6 months vested stock for ~30k - (capital income tax) but I've heard that letting stock vest for a year gives some tax benefit? Is this a smart decision?

I'm staying at home with my parents for the first year (no rent, breakfast &amp; lunch provided by employer, dinner by my parents) since I can't afford to move out. I've planned the budgets post-tax with all expenses overestimated.

**Debts** :

* $10k credit card @ 20.24% APR (ouch)
* $38k student loans @ various interest rates, but the highest is 6.8% so I planned my debt from that amount.

**Goals** :

* Credit score back up (low from high utilization) 
* Student Loans paid off in 8 yrs/less

**Budget 1**: Touches all my debt, save a little here and there.

* eliminates $7,105 of student loan debt (about 30k left)
* eliminates $6,050 of credit card debt (about 4k left)
* puts $3,454 (not including 50% employer matching...cha chinnnng) into my 401k.
* saves $3,454 into my emergency fund
* estimated $3,715 of ""padding"" that will be leftover cash for me to save, or move with at the end of august 2017

**Budget 2**: Emergency Fund &gt; High Interest Debt &gt; Low Interest Debt.

* saves over $5400 for emergency fund
* completely eliminates $10,000 of credit card debt
* paying minimum only on student loans, except for last month (so essentially not really making headway there)

After federal and CA tax, I would probably have a take home around $62k. Health insurance is about $2.1k/yr. 

My 401k right now has about $55k in it, Roth IRA around $35k, and HSA around $6k. 

Cash on hand is about $45k. 

Obviously, I can't afford a house in the nice areas of the bay area. I could probably swing something in Oakland or Hayward, but I'm not comfortable bringing my elderly parents to live with me. 

So, I'm thinking about the Sacramento/Roseville or nearby area.

Decently sized houses, especially Lennar's ""next gen"" homes (which have a private suite built into the house; like a legal in-law suite), are about $470-500k or so. 

I could rent out the private suite (own kitchenette, bathroom, garage, living space) for an approximate $500/mo, for example. But for purposes of calculation, let's disregard this potential income. 

Does it make sense to forego maximum 401k contributions (and max Roth IRA contributions) to save for a downpayment? I would change my 401k contribution to maximize the employer match and leave it at that.

- Standard Life has been forced to stop retail investors selling out of one of the UK’s largest property funds after **rapid cash outflows were sparked by fears over falling real estate values in the week after the UK’s vote to leave the EU.**

- **£2.9bn commercial property fund will need to sell real estate to raise cash.**

- **UK’s third largest open-ended property fund for retail investors.**

- The last property crash in the UK was preceded by a wave of similar gatings by funds struggling to meet investor demands for cash.

- Standard Life marked down the value of the buildings its funds own by 5 per cent in the wake of the Brexit vote. The UK’s two largest open-ended property funds did the same.

- impact could be wide-ranging since property has become one of the most popular choices for retail investors seeking yield in an era of low interest rates.

- **some closed-ended property trusts are trading at discounts of more than 10 per cent to their net asset value**

- **“The risk is this creates a vicious circle, and prompts more investors to dump property, until such time as sentiment stabilises.”**

- Investors in the fund will be unable to redeem for at least 28 days.

- Open-ended property funds have been criticised for the mismatch for promising investors daily liquidity despite property being an illiquid asset class

personalfinance,What's the right loan strategy to finance my home improvement project?,"Seeking to construct an addition to my home which I have estimated to cost between $80k (best case scenario) and $120k (worst case scenario).

Financial situation:
---

**Income:** 

- Base salary: ~$7,324/mo. This figure is after tax withholding, 401k deductions, health insurance deductions for employer insurance, etc. Notably my tax withholding is somewhat aggressive despite my attempts to withhold less. I always get a four figure return. I've just decided to consider that money a bonus and I do not ever let it figure into my budgeting. I always plan to owe the government money instead and treat tax return proceeds as a pleasant surprise.
- Side business income: Ranges between $0/mo and $3k/mo. Business has been decent lately, but I try to never count the side income when doing budgeting either. I like to consider the side income as entirely a bonus, like an unexpected tax refund, or a bonus from my employer. Maybe that's paranoid, but that's how I roll. Makes surprises usually pleasant ones.

**Expenses:**

My monthly expenses tend to average ~$4k/mo summing together everything, e.g. mortgage, property taxes, debt payments (detailed below), groceries, utilities, internet, including an averaged/flexible fun money budget, etc.

**Debts:** 

- Around $80k remaining in student debt.
- House is worth around $425k. I last refinanced it in 2014 at 20% equity on a 25y loan. Equity has increased since then to whatever 2 years of steady payments gets me. Where I live it's unlikely the home value has changed (either up or down).
- No other debts.

**Savings:**

- ~$10k emergency fund that I don't want to dip into for this project.
- 401k with a decent balance that I also don't want to touch for this project.
- ~$15k in a savings account earmarked for this project.
- No other savings, investments, or assets. (Unless you count my pair of cheap cars as assets, which I personally don't.)

**Background on me:**

The reason I look a bit cash/asset poor for someone with such a high income is I used to have more student debt and a metric fuckton of medical debt, but I recently paid off all my medical debt and the highest interest student loan debt. My student loans are now all below the interest rate of my mortgage, so I no longer consider aggressive debt repayment to be a priority. Until recently, I was shoveling almost 100% of disposable income into high interest debts. Now that that's done, I would really like to construct this addition I've been putting off so that I could get debt down to reasonable levels. I want to reward myself a bit before I go back to being militantly responsible with my disposable income again.

Progress so far kicking off this construction project:
---

Tried to get a construction loan for it from a local bank, but the bank denied me because I want to do some of the work myself. They only give construction loans if 100% of the work is being done by licensed contractors. I wish they'd said that to me at the start!

I am planning to sub out the foundation work to a licensed contractor, but I don't need assistance doing the rest. I hired an architect to do professional drawings for me, I got a permit, and part of my contract with the architect includes a provision for him to inspect my progress on a routine basis to ensure my work is up to code. But that is not enough for the bank.

Since the denial is not based on my credit or debt to income ratio, the bank offered me an alternative: a cash-out refi of my existing property based on 90% LTV (no PMI) at a better interest rate than I am paying now on a 30y loan rather than 25y. Since I have slightly better than 20% equity now, this would allow to get some cash at closing. Seems like a good deal, but it won't be enough to fund the whole project though.

As such, I've been thinking of leveraging different financial instruments to get this off the ground. I've been looking into personal loans and they don't seem too bad. All the nerdy finance sites that seem to know what they're talking about seem to be coalescing around LightStream and SoFi as the best personal loan lenders for people with 1. excellent credit (check), 2. looking to borrow large amounts (check), 3. over a longer term (check). Here is one of the better articles I found explaining the current state of the market: http://www.thesimpledollar.com/best-unsecured-loans/

One question I can't seem to find an answer to is is it better to go with the pickier online lenders like LightStream or SoFi or is it better to go with local banks / credit unions? The internet doesn't seem to have a consensus on this. Although for what it's worth, I checked with one of my local credit unions and they don't offer personal loans that high. They max out at $25k.

Another interesting option I could use is get a 0% interest credit card. The Citi Simplicity card offers 0% APR for 21 months. Depending on how much credit they offer me, I could put some of this on that credit card and pay it off before the 21 month period expires to enhance my borrowing power and minimize how far I need to stretch a personal loan or home equity proceeds.

So reddit, in summary (good lord this got long), what are your thoughts on those questions:

1. Who is better for a personal loan: online lenders like LightStream or SoFi vs. local banks / credit unions?
2. Are LightStream and SoFi really the best online lenders for what I need or should I look elsewhere?
3. Should I do the 0% interest credit card too to add another financial instrument into the mix?
4. Should I kick off the 90% LTV cash out refi while I'm at it just so I can get some extra funds that way too, or just go all-in with the personal loan strategy and tell the bank that's been yanking me around to buzz off?
5. If I do all three (the refi, the 0% APR credit card, and the personal loan) all at the same time, will the numerous credit hits endanger my chances of getting any one of those things? Like should I do them in a certain order to minimize hassle?

I feel like I'm cobbling together the funds using duct tape and bailing wire...!

investing,Opened an IRA with Vanguard... what now?,"I have been taking steps to become financially stable for retirement in the past few years: this includes paying off student loans, maintaining little to no CC debt, and opening a 401k up to my company's match %.

My problem is, I am not familiar with how Vanguard works, or an IRA for that matter. When i opened the account I successfully deposited $1000, but it never asked me what type of fund I want it to go into. Currently it is in the ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund"" but I didn't pick this one, and I don't know where I can find the expense ratio to compare it to others such as the S&amp;P 500. 

I guess at the moment Vanguard is a black box to me: I can't see what is going on under the covers and don't know where to begin. I also don't want to start clicking on random things because I don't want to accidentally screw up my finances or do something costly come tax season.

personalfinance,Is aggressive pay-down worth it or am I better off taking the Forgiveness of Debt tax hit?,"Hey, long-time lurker here.  I was running some numbers on my student debt, and I thought I had previously had it figured out but now I'm worried.

Here are my facts:

Pay-as-you-earn payment plan: Min. payment is $138 (doesn't touch principal, interest accumulating to the tune of about $350 per month)

Total Loan: $75,300 (two consolidated loans, $69k and $6k)

Interest Rate: 6.375%

Term: (I am confused on this, loan says est. payoff 2045, but the ""amount to be repaid"" term ends 2028)

Salary: $69,500

Bonus: $2-5k

Raises are roughly 6-10% each year, 15-20% in promotion year (every 3 years or so), I'm a CPA in public accounting. 

Ideally, at the end of the term of my student loan (10-15 years) I expect to be making $200k+

Embarrassing I can't figure this stuff out on my own right?

So I noticed on my one consolidated loan ($69k one), the ""estimated amount to be repaid"" is $103k, and the proposed scenario is $138k minimum PAYE for the next 7 months, and then the standard payment of $742 per month for the next 138 months. I'm guessing this assumes that you don't qualify for PAYE each year, and flips it back to standard in the scenario after the current year end.

With this pay-down scenario, I'm left with unpaid principal of $65k and unpaid interest of $5k. Giving me a $21k tax hit ($70k x 30%~).

Here is my question: 

Based on my income versus debt service ratio, I think I will qualify for the PAYE/IBR plan for the foreseeable future.  Is it worth it to aggressively pay down my debt even though I'll still be left with so much unpaid principal/interest?  I'm not sure what the FoD income would be if I continued on an interest-only minimum payment scenario, but paying in less to get hit with 25-30% on the dollar at the end of the term, seems like it could potentially be a better outcome as long as I can front the IRS payment.  Or am I missing a critical component of math here?

TLDR: Should I still be paying the most I can comfortably pay against my loans or go for minimum payments and be prepared for a substantial FoD tax hit in 12 years?  I think my total ""cash out"" maybe be close to the same here, just one is over time, rather than at the end.

Hope this makes sense at what I'm trying to ask here.",finance,1467735566
personalfinance,"Nearing my 7 year mark for old debt, looking for some advice/assurance.","After reading the sidebar and doing some internet research, I'm just looking for some advice to let me know I'm on the right path. 

Back in 2009-2011 I opened a handful of credit cards and they eventually went to collections. Two of them were charged off and were not bought by a debt collector. Three of them were, and are still active on my credit report. Together, they total around $3.5k. 

All three debts are past the statue of limitations. I've received letters in the mail from two of the agencies asking me to settle/pay, and at the end of the letter they say ""we will not sue you for your debt because of the age."" The third one that I have not heard from is the oldest, and I am assuming that they will not attempt to sue me either because of the age. On top of that, all the negative cards will hit 7 years between the end of this year and the end of 2017.

Because of that, I just intend on letting them age and fall off my report since it's so close to it happening. I don't need to buy a car or house (or other huge purchase) between now and then, so it seems like the most logical action.

However, I'd like them to stop contacting me via mail/phone. To do this, I need to send them one of the standard 'cease and desist' letters through certified mail, correct? After that, all that is left to do is wait for the negative marks to fall off?

Also, I have a federal student loan account that was not paid for 5 months in the past. It is currently up to date and regular auto-payments have been paid on it. Is it possible to send the student loan servicer a good-will letter asking them to remove the negative marks from those 5 months, or is that uncommon? 

And one more question - I have two unsecured credit cards from Capital One that I use as regular cards. I've had them for about a year and a half. Balances are paid off in full every month, history is current and perfect. When the old debt/negative marks fall off my credit report, will my ""new"" score be based on these two open credit cards? I'm curious how my credit score will be based after the 7 years.

personalfinance,Selling stock to pay student loan debt,"Hello,

I am currently a graduate student, with about $60,000 in student loan debt. The interest rates range from about 4.5% to 8%. My grandfather recently discovered that he made an investment for me about 15 years ago, and found the value of the stock is approximately $45,000.

Because I am a student, and do not have a large income, the steps I have taken in my financial journey so far are to create/stick to a budget, and create a 3 month emergency fund.

Should I sell the stock? The value of the stock has been rather steady for years, and barely increasing, while the interest I am accruing on my private loans is building up significantly.

I would increase my emergency fund to 6 months, and use the rest of the money to pay off the loans with the highest interest. How does all of this work tax-wise? I am used to having an annual income of under $10,000 and I have never had this much money available to me in my life.

 *I will not receive a raise (this is almost assuredly wrong, but I would like to keep my projections as conservative as possible);

personalfinance,"Wanting to move, should I start now or is it even worth waiting a year? Can I even afford it?","I purchased my home about 6 years ago for 100k and still owe about 90k on it.  I spoke to a RE Agent that my company works with and he said as it sits, it could be worth around 130-135, but with some new floors (with a DIY price of about $2k), some fresh interior paint (couple $100?) and minor yard cleanup (another couple $100), it would probably fetch around 150-155.  

&amp;nbsp;

I am no pro but I think his numbers are a BIT low as most homes in my neighborhood are selling for around 160+ with similar sqft, acreage, etc. but he said his estimate also includes a home a few houses down that was something like a bank repo and was auctioned for like 120k, which lowered his estimate.

&amp;nbsp;

Right now I have only about 1k in the bank and thanks to my ex wife who racked up ~30k in CC debt and left, I have quite a bit owed that is going to eat up a lot of this profit from the sale.

&amp;nbsp;

I currently owe:

* 90k @ 5.25% on the mortgage
* 2k @ 7% on HELOC
* 15k @ 6% on HE Loan (which will be merged w/ HELOC by the end of the year IIRC)
* 5.6k @ 14.5% on CC #1
* 3.8k @ 0% (until 5/2017) on CC #2

Total CC and HE debt: 26,400

&amp;nbsp;

I bring home about $3,500/mo and I'm putting about $500+/mo towards the highest int rate card (CC #1) first.  In the past year, I have been able to payoff CC #3 w/ about 4k, and brought CC #1 from ~8k to 5.6k (unfortunately I had a few unavoidable hits in the past couple months that prevented me from paying down any further, but will start back up by the end of July with another pay down.)

&amp;nbsp;

I currently pay most of my bills in the first half of the month, so I make sure and have exactly 2k in the bank at the beginning of the month to cover all that plus leftovers, then at the end of the month, anything that is over 2k for the next month I payoff my CC #4 (gas, food, etc. monthly expenses) then put the remaining towards CC #1.

&amp;nbsp;

I am looking at homes closer to work (will go from ~60-70mi/day to ~5-10) and closer to family.

&amp;nbsp;

The homes I am looking at are in the 180k range, + or - 20k, as the city is more expensive than the one I live in.

&amp;nbsp;

I am wanting to either do a 80/10/10 mortgage to avoid the PMI if possible, or even a 3/5% down as I don't have a lot of cash on me right now, but once I pay off all of these CC's and can eliminate the $300-400/mo of CC bills (just minimum payments, not including my paydown at the end of the month) I should be able to start saving much better.

&amp;nbsp;

Given all this information, and not knowing what the closing costs will be (I live in FL if that helps), can I even afford to move now (and stop paying the several hundred/mo of CC interest plus the extra 200+/mo of gas) or should I wait until maybe next summer?

&amp;nbsp;

Not sure if this matters, but my boss also told me that he needs me to move closer to work b/c I am working into more of a manager position and need to be more easily available.

&amp;nbsp;

As I said, I currently own this home I have and took advantage of the First Time Homebuyers Credit in 2010, so even though I have pretty much talked myself out of it, I don't think I would be able to dip into my 401k penalty free (via a loan or disbursement) even though I have about 45k in there.

&amp;nbsp;

I know the general consensus in PF is to wait to buy until you have 20% to put down, but I feel like that would take years, and I would just be throwing money away at these CC interest rates and high gas bills, where I could be putting that into a mortgage payment or even savings/retirement.

personalfinance,Car purchase: financing vs. paying cash,"**TL;DR At low interest rates, is it actually better to finance a car instead of paying cash?**

Background: We just refi'd our mortgage and will be paying ~$355 less per month. We had to put down close to $30K to do so, going from a jumbo to a conventional to get a lower rate. We're in the market for a new (used) car, budget around $20K. We'd keep this car for well over 5 years, and it will be chosen largely for its reliability. 

I've always had it in my head to pay cash for a used car. We can pay the $20K in cash and still have a 6+ month emergency fund. But I was just playing around with the numbers, and it looks like if we were to get a 60 month loan at 2.5% for $20K, it would mean monthly payments of ~$355. So the downside is that we'd pay an extra ~$1,300 in interest, but the upside is that our monthly expenses/DTI ratio stay the same, and we can invest that $20K that we would have spent. Or we could keep some of that in cash; as I mentioned, we just put $30K toward the mortgage, so the idea of tying up $50K is a bit scary, even though we still have the e-fund. Even if we didn't invest any of that $20K, and just kept it in savings (ie worst case scenario), the total interest expense of $1,300 over 5 years is only $260/year, which isn't really that much.

Comparing apples to apples:.


* **Option 1** - pay $20K cash for the car, invest/save $355/month.


* **Option 2** - finance $20K, invest/save the $20K we would have spent (either lump sum or DCA; if we invested exactly $355/month, then Option 1 would obv end up the better choice due to the $1,300 interest, so we'd have to do more than $355/month for Option 2 to end up better if we wanted to DCA)


* **Option 3** - a hybrid, like $10K down, finance $10K, payment = $177, invest $178/month, invest/save $10K.

I have tried every site I know, even willing to go through a crazy interest rate, but nothing approves me.

**Background:** 
I am 22. I had to drop out of college due to my parents divorcing and found out my father never actually approved any student loans for my term and I was screwed. My father was abusive to myself and my mother, only treating my sister with love and respect and she still lives with him, and my mother and I had to find a place on our own.

Fast forward two years later, I am working almost 80 hours a week, cannot seek therapy for my depression &amp; anxiety due to no money and free time and my medication is always billed to my credit cards because I can barely afford rent because my mother does not work and I am supporting us both. Due to bad luck, her hereditary illnesses have taken a toll on her and she cannot stand or walk for prolonged periods of time and even with her 20 years experience in administrative work, nobody will hire her. Welfare gives us very little to cover rent, and my mother is currently trying to get disability.

I have 10k in credit card debt, barely can afford rent or bills and I need to move. I have found apartments that are half what I am paying now and will be in such a better place but I am always with more expenses than I make in actual money and I never have a penny to save, I am always behind on everything and its killing me. 

Recently, my mother has been emotionally abusive to me, which I'm sure comes from the depression of her life falling apart the past 5 years and I need out of my apartment. I would kick my mother out but I can't afford to live here regardless.

My lease is up on 9/30. I am willing to move. 

I'm asking you guys to please help me point me in the right direction if there's any lending sites or organizations that can help me with $7k to cover my rent from now until the end of my lease just so I can get money saved up to move, pay my bills on time, and get some of my credit cards paid off to get my life together. With that loan, I can pay my rent on time, and use my my paychecks to cover everything and have about $3500-4000 saved up to afford to move to a new place alone and be on top of everything.

I do not have any family or friends to help me cosign or anything either, if I stay and renew my lease I will be in the same position, but if I don't, I will be homeless and I am scared thinking about it.

I am currently making enough to make the payments on these accounts, but these and my other bills have it so that I'm getting by paycheck to paycheck and anything extra puts me in a bind and asking for help. Like I am now; I have a speeding ticket to pay from driving half asleep. 

I am considering trying to get a personal loan to pay off all three accounts and a little extra to pay off the ticket and hopefully lower interest rates. The problem with this is I don't know if I am eligible for this amount for a loan. I am open for more options. Please help me. This is the most stressful this in my life and I don't know what to do.

I know traditionally bonds shouldn't drop with the market, but we're in such a weird place right now I don't know enough what they would do. Are bond funds prices primarily governed by interest rate?

personalfinance,Plan to purchase new house in 2 or 3 years. Do we (1) pay off old house more quickly to maximize equity (2) pay off other debts or (3) save for down payment?,"Hello PF. I am a longtime lurker, first time question-asker.

My wife and I have decided we need to move to a better school district in the next two to three years so our now-baby can go to decent schools. We own a home that is worth around $230,000 (recent realtor estimate). I have a good, stable job paying around $140,000/year with variable annual bonus that paid out about $50,000 this year. We have 12 months of emergency savings.

We owe about $149,500 on the house with an interest rate of 4.25%. (APR is slightly higher). I also owe $30,000 in student loans; monthly payment is $220, and will be paid off in 2033. Consolidated interest rate is 5.00%. I owe about $12,500 on my car. It will be paid off in 3 years. Interest rate on that is 4%.

While saving up for the emergency fund, we put aside approximately $1,500/month. I want to stop saving money for the emergency fund and dial saving back to $300/month for our kid's college fund. That leaves about $1,200 to save/pay off something else.

The options as I see them are:
1) Pay off the house much more quickly. We will be able to use the higher equity we have in this house to afford a bigger down payment on our next house, thus minimizing the note long term.
2) Pay off the other two loans (student loans + car). These are fairly small, and they don't really eat into other priorities. Paying off the student loan or car loan wouldn't free up enough income to make it worth it (my opinion). If I don't pay these off, I would just refinance them to a lower rate and put them on autopilot. Knocking out the student loans at a higher clip would take at least 2 or 3 years, and the payoff would be $220/month of extra income.
3) Save for a down payment separately. The issue with this is that it is hard to guarantee a decent rate of return in the short term.

I am leaning towards option 1.

personalfinance,"Got my first salaried job in California Single, 53K salary, 36K student debt, 0 credit history. Need advice.","Hi,

I've spent the last week trying to educate myself on personal finance using this subreddit. It's a topic that I struggle a lot to wrap my head around which is why I am reaching out. Any how, after 6 months of being unemployed and looking for a job, I finally got an offer. It's not as handsome as I was expecting based on the field (Biotech) and the location of the job, but I've put that behind me and I need to pay my damn bills and it's my first salaried job so I accepted it. 

I'm moving from Texas to the bay area, California for this job.The base pay of the job is $53,000 a year with no 401k benefits. I get basic medical coverage, and a stock option that I am not 100% sure about because I don't know anything about stocks (despite trying to learn). I'm coming into an area with a very high cost of living (shared rent will be around $1000 a month) and also $36,000 of student debt which I plan to make minimum monthly payments on. I never messed with a credit card growing up, and was completely oblivious to them. As a result, I don't have a credit history at all (that I know of).

What advice can r/personalfinance give me? Should I be worried about opening some type of IRA (roth, traditional, etc) or putting away all of my disposable income to paying student debt? Is there a way I can minimize my tax burden so that my 53K salary isn't 38K after taxes (state taxes, federal taxes)?

Buying the apartment and getting a roommate, coupled with side jobs can potentially get me SL debt free in 3 years. Background on me - I’m a single, 26F, young professional living in Washington, DC making about 51K. Willing to sacrifice for long-term peace of mind.

After months of reading through reddit and blogs, and assessing my situation from every angle, I've come up with a plan that I think is pretty solid. It's unconventional and probably breaks every PF rule out there in some form or another.  I’m giving as much information as possible (financially and emotionally) to stave away the generic advice. This requires putting my entire life on hold for 5 years, and diligently sticking to my budget if I don’t get a substantial increase in income. Can redditers look it over and give me some pointers? Figures are rounded for ease of calculations. **Thanks in advance if you take the time to read or comment on this!**  

**Monthly Budget: Present and Future:**
Below is my monthly budget estimates, *after taxes*, based on the 24 paychecks + supplemental income. If I can put 1.5-2K a month towards my student loans, I’d wipe them out in 3-4 years while saving $12K in interest. After that is paid off, a year of 1.5K a month towards my mortgage plus a year of 1.5K a month towards savings/retirement gets me to nearly 30% equity and 30K in savings in 5 years.
[Budget pic] (http://imgur.com/a/BQCjD)  

* **Income:**
When I graduated grad school, I took the first job that was offered to me because I was so desperate not to spend another year unemployed. That job paid 45K+benefits and I hated it. After a year I found my current job (non-profit) which pays 51K, bi-weekly. No 403b matching until 2 years employed (then at 10%).  
-I’m starting a new PT job in a few weeks, which may get me an extra $720 gross each month if I get all my requested hours. I also recently started mystery shopping/EasyShift-ing, in which I try to pull in at least $200 extra each month.  I’m doing everything I can to set myself up to find a higher paying job next year. Otherwise I’m basing this on it not changing by that much in the next 5 years. 

* **Student Loan Debt:**
About 63K total, all federal loans, with an average interest rate of 5.6%. The highest interest is at 6.8% and the lowest at 4.25%. My standard repayment would be about $700. I’m currently on income-based repayment at $170 and I pay $360 monthly, with the extra payment going mostly to principal on the highest interest loans (but accruing nearly $300 in interest monthly).  
-Could I stay at my non-profit job and pay minimum to get the loan forgiven after 10 years? Sure…but I’d hate myself because this is not a place where I can see myself long-term.

* **Credit Card Debt:**
I basically only charge my monthly expenses. My outstanding balance is the result of previous monthly deficits and a vacation. I expect to be finished with that 08/2016, but it would still continue to accrue my monthly because the reward (1.5%) is totally worth it. Outstanding credit card balance (minus monthly expenses) is $1000 at 0% APR until 11/2016 (12K credit limit). I’d been paying about $500-$1000 each month for the past year.

* **Home Debt:***
My current rent is $1165 with utilities. I’m already under contract to buy a 550sqft, 2bd/1ba, co-op apartment in a not-trendy-at-all neighborhood. Thankfully, my mom put up the $1500 EMD. So if I walk away, *I’m* not technically losing anything. The purchase price is a bit over 130K with 80/20 loans (first time home buyer program). The 80% loan of 102K is at 4.5% for 30 years, and the 20% loan is interest deferred (I can choose to pay 3% annually or defer it until the sale). Closing costs are negligible due to seller’s credits (about $1600) and I’m planning to put 3% down of my own savings. Condo insurance is a bit less than $450/yr and monthly co-op fees are $366 (which includes property tax, water, sewer, trash, reserves, insurance, management and outside maintenance). I’m estimating no more than $200 monthly for utilities (gas, electric, internet), if that.  
-I anticipate being able to rent the second room out for $600-700. This is not the best neighborhood and the rooms are a bit small, but it’s within walking distance of a metro station. I’m not treating this home as an investment, it is purely to reduce my housing costs. I will probably break even or sell at a loss. Could I wait and save up more down payment? Could I wait until my student loan debt decreases and my credit score improves? Sure….but the opportunity cost of waiting seems greater. Am I limiting opportunities by staying in DC? Maybe, but it was hard enough to get this job...I can't really imagine it will be any easier to get one in another location where I have no professional or social network.

* **Savings:**
Currently I have a bit over 5K cash, 3500 in retirement (trad. and Roth IRAs). Uncounted future money for savings is about 4K – rental security deposit, 2 extra paychecks, and tax return within the next year. Currently saving $300 cash + 150 IRA each month. I don’t think it’s prudent to save $5-10 a month on a mortgage by wiping out my savings and putting more money down. I’ll probably have 3K left as an emergency fund.

* **Lifestyle:**
To be perfectly honest, I’m not frugal - I’m cheap. This is a high COL area, and there’s no “going back home to stay with parents” because I come from a small town where almost everyone lives at or under the poverty line. My dream is to be able to adopt a toddler-aged or older child in about 5 years. I don’t foresee a significant other in my future.  
-I don’t go out much, and I’ve already informed my friends that I will probably never get to go out with them in the future if it isn’t free. I don’t date. My food budget is set up for mostly $2-3 microwaveable meals and the occasional $10 take-out meal that I can eat for both lunch and dinner. I’m trying to meal plan to get it down to around $100/month. I may spend money on clothes every 3-4 months. I never go to the doctor. I  metro to work and drive on weekends.  
-Could I find a cheaper rental in DC? Possibly, but not likely. To get an equivalently priced room as the one I’m buying (with roommate), I’ll need to live in places where commuting costs will add another $200 plus an hour or two. Trust me these places are hard to come by in DC proper to actually have the math work out in my favor – if you are a DCer, you’ll understand. If you have a $600 room in DC proper near a metro, please PM me!

I'm 29 years old, married with 2 small children. I have some money saved, and have been investing some of it, but am unsure i'm doing things the best way possible.

We own a house that we paid around $300k for. We currently owe about $160k on the mortgage, which is around 3.75% interest rate. I've been paying a few hundred dollars extra each month to try to pay it down faster

Currently, i have lots of savings invested in a portfolio i made based off a bogleheads lazy porfolio, which looks like this [https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/d9905f](https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/d9905f)

Also, my wife and I have ira's. I have a SEP IRA, that i contribute varying amounts per year to. I just contributed for 2016, and the account currently has ~$115k in it. This IRA is all in a vanguard 2045 target retirement fund. My wife also has a traditional IRA with ~$20k in it, invested in the same.

Since i'm self employed, there's no other 401ks or matching or anything like that. Im sure someone will ask about income, it can vary depending on some things, but an estimate of ~$175k/year is fair.

I guess the question I have is, does it make sense to invest the ira in the target retirement fund? The target fund is made up with a similar breakdown to what my other portfolio is, am i just paying a higher fee for nothing?

What about our mortgage? Should we pay it off, or does it make sense to invest in the market since that theoretically should be a higher return? Am i smart for trying to pay it down faster, or should i just be investing everything I can and just pay the minimum on the mortgage?

How does my portfolio look? Is using the lazy portfolio a fine idea, or am I better off doing things differently?

personalfinance,Looking to payoff debts and would appreciate your advice on how to prioritize which ones to payoff. My debts and income are in the text.,"I'm 34 and I have about $65,000 in savings, no retirement, although do have a pension if I retire with my current company (I'm self employed). My wife is employed with a retirement plan and pension. Our combined household income is about $135,000 a year.

**Debts:**

Truck loan: $22,500 - this is an interest only loan that I pay every six months. Interest rate is 5%

Car loan: $19,000 - $540 monthly payment - interest rate is 0.9%. 36 months left on the loan.

Business credit card: $12,000 - currently 0% interest that expires in December

Student loan: $6,500 - $157 per month - interest rate 2.32%

Personal Credit Card: $2,500 - 0% interest for 10 more months.


I have two plans I'm trying to decide on.... 

**Plan 1:**

Payoff truck loan and business credit card. This will not reduce any monthly payments I make, but it will extinguish those debts. And allow me to keep $30,000 in savings. Then snowball the other debts and work to pay them off, I figure I'll have them done in about 18 months (most likely 12 months).

**Plan 2:**

Payoff car loan, student loan, personal credit card. This would free up $700 a month, which I'd use that $700 to pay down the remaining debt and allow me to keep $37,000 in savings for emergency fund. This would allow me to have the remaining debt paid off in 12 months. I'd also be willing to payoff the business credit card which would lower my savings to $25,000, but I'm a little uncomfortable about having such a low emergency fund.

Once all debts are paid off I'll start maxing out my Roth and every year and adding another $7500 - $10000 to traditional IRA or SEP.

Please give me your thoughts as to which makes most sense. Or if you think I should do it differently please give me your suggestion on how to prioritize these debt payoffs.

I had 2,000, my mom had 2,000 and I was going to take out 2,000 more. We got there to find that the sedan had been sold, and my mom got to looking at a new car. The dealership owner saw her looking and pulled her aside and said that new models were coming in, it was the last one and he wanted it out of there. He halfed the price and went below MSRP but still out of my range. Mom demanded I sign for that one, promising that she'd put up the 5,000 needed.

From the latest SEC filing:

&gt; We operate in a very competitive industry with market participants routinely introducing new and improved vehicle models designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectations. Producing new and improved vehicle models competitively and preserving our reputation for designing, building and selling high quality cars and trucks is critical to our long-term profitability. We will launch a substantial number of new vehicles in 2016. Successful launches of our new vehicles are critical to our short-term profitability. In addition, our growth strategies require us to make significant investment in our brands to appeal to new markets.

Furthermore, they point out that it can take 2 years to launch a new vehicle and that they are a very fixed cost business. 

Margins and returns are good versus most of the peers, though perhaps there is a chance to get to Toyota or Volkswagen's long term?

General Motors Company has $49,718M of net debt. That is 2.9x it's latest operating profit. Typically I would worry when a company's debt gets that high... but this is the auto industry and I sometimes wonder if this industry is more a bank that gives cars away to attract borrowers, than a car company that lends to its clients... here's a subset of the group, just look at the size of the borrowings versus the market value. Wow!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $37.06 for General Motors Company and their recommendation to clients is *Buy*. That implies an upside of 32% to their target.

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. Valuations are tiny, though I am suspicious of the long-term growth forecasts from Wall Street. And of all the majors the Free cashflow looks attractive.

But I can't help to recall a *maxim* that you sell autos when they are *cheap* and buy them when they are *expensive* as usually they are cheap at peak earnings and the top of the economic cycle. :(

# Dividends
General Motors Company is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.48 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.38 per share. That is a 7% growth. Nice! And it's still looks like there is room, given forecast EPS of $5.64 a share.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. So it's valuation's under pressure. That's despite sales in the last 3 months up 4%, with the US performing well, and the Financial division too.

I fear the drivers in the near term are going to be, the obvious ones: 
* US auto sales
* global economic outlook
* the dollar
* interest rates

So, maybe I just buy it, take the 5% yield and ignore the fluctuations, assuming they'll survive the electric car onslaught from Tesla and friends.

Or would you suggest a different auto stock?

personalfinance,Help Me Use My Money Wisely,"I will try to keep this as short as possible.

Background:

I am a 24YO Engineer. When I started college, I was a first generation and had no idea how I was going to pay for school, so I took out loans with Sallie Mae (worst mistake I could have made). Interest Rates were 7.75% for $22,5k, 8.875% for $16k, 9.875% for $19k, and 10.875% for for $18k (Costs before interest). And I have federal loans for about $20k. YOU DO THE MATH. 

When I got my first job, I was SCARED. Granted, I live with my parents and basically have no bills besides what I want to spend (no rent, no phone bill, no car payments etc.). I am very grateful that my parents let me essentially mooch off of them, but in return, they do not pay a single dime of my loans. So my plan of action was to pay it off as fast as humanly possible. I started throwing my money in the accounts, the majority of the money going into the account with the highest interest rate. From January 2015 to July 2015. I funnelled $30k into my loans, paying off the highest interest loan. I did this by draining my bank account twice to no more than ~$1.5k. I was then able to apply to refinance my loans with a different company. I refinanced the remaining $64k with an interest rate of 4.76%. (Which was great for my parents because they were no longer cosigners and their credit score skyrocketed) I now pay the minimum payments of $1.2k a month and should be paid off in 4 years. I also have been paying minimum payments on my federal loans this whole time since it is very forgiving (about ~$19k at this time) .

Now that the history is over, lets look at the present. I have ~$17k in the bank (checking, no savings). I make $3620 a month after taxes (I get a decent raise every January - perks of working for a small company. My first after tax paycheck in 2014 was $3120/month). My company offers a 401K but does NOT match, and I haven't enrolled yet. I've been with my boyfriend for a long time and we want to eventually buy a house together, hopefully in 2-3 years (he too lives at home). I live in NJ and owning a home where I live is expensive. Credit score is 744.

I basically want input on what I should I should do with that money in the bank. My gut instinct tells me to throw it in my student loans, but that makes my BF very nervous whenever I essentially have ""no money"" and I would have to start saving again for a down payment for house. I tried reading over the 401K information and it is gibberish to me, even after reading the sidebars. My spending right now is too loose. I have been very careless with weekend trips, concerts, eating out, etc. and I need to tie myself down on the spending, this I know. When I essentially deplete my bank account, I am much better with spending, well because I have to be! How do you think I should proceed? Please let me know if there is anything I left out that is important.",finance,1467818546

stocks,This Mega Dual Rally Signals The End Of Central Banks And Epic Warning Shot,"Gold and silver have spiked dramatically higher in 2016. Just in the last week we have seen silver squeeze higher by 20%. It is extremely rare to see both gold and silver surging together. Why? The basics of it revolve around gold being a store of safety, while silver is mainly an industrial metal. The idea being, if there is panic gold surges but usually silver stalls or falls because the panic is due to something economic. Negative economic issues can hurt demand for silver.

 

This mega spike price action on gold and silver tells of something absolutely scary. It screams to the world that investors have lost all confidence in the central banks. Whether it is the Bank of England, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan or the Federal Reserve, currencies are looked at as being far too risky. Remember, interest rates in Japan and some places in Europe are now negative. It is not normal to pay a bank to hold your money. Central banks have created this artificially. Investors now prefer to hold gold, which is normal in fearful times...but also silver. That is the more shocking part. Central bank printing presses and monetary policy have gotten so out of control that investors are willing to buy anything but currencies. Look at the price of Bitcoin as well. It is up over 200% in 2016. Again, Bitcoin (BTC) is something the central banks around the globe have no power over. It cannot be printed at will.

 

Keep an eye on other metals to see if they start getting the same play. An even more economic dependent metal is Copper. If gold and silver continue higher, look to buy Copper. This could be the next store of safety from the out of control central banks. Pretty scary for investors if you hold lots of Dollars, Yen, Euro or Pound. Diversifying into other assets that cannot be printed is extremely important in this day and age.

 

The end game is simple yet horrifying. There will be another epic global collapse, far worse than the financial catastrophe in 2008-2009. It will spur a global depression. All of it caused by central bank policy. As the world emerges, the central banks will be dissolved. You read it here first. This will happen in the next 10 years.",finance,1467826293

personalfinance,Apparently my credit card has a variable interest rate. Need help understanding.,"I signed up for my first credit card when I was 19 ( 5 years ago) through my bank (US Bank). I got an ok interest rate (14.99%). I do all of my banking online, so I rarely check my actual statements. I checked one recently because it seemed like my interest was a bit high. I have been aggressively paying down about $6500 work of credit card debt that I accumulated through several years of being underemployed and dumb.

Here's what my statement says:

Balance Type|Balance By Type|Balance Subject to Interest Rate|Variable|Interest Charge|APR
:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
PURCHASES|$5332.35|$5461.85|YES|$72.90|16.24%

**PURCHASES|$36.46|$35.84|YES|$0.62|21.24%
**ADVANCES|$0|$0|YES|$0|24.24%

**APR for current and future transactions.


So does this mean my interest rate just jumped to 21.24%? I am not using the card anymore, the charge for $36.46 was an emergency, and I did not have another form of payment available. Will my current balance be charged a 21.24% interest rate? Or does that only apply to future purchases? 

I am planning to have this card paid off by February 2017, hopefully transferring the balance to a 0% APR transfer card, but right now my credit score is recovering (currently at 624 Transunion, 644 Equifax per Credit Karma, has increased 40+ points over the last month thanks to taking care of some other debts) and I'm waiting for my TransUnion score to hit 640 before applying for a transfer card.",finance,1467828109

personalfinance,[Auto] Lease New Cheap/Purchase Used Cheap,"Firstly I want to say that I may be wanting my cake and eating it too.

I have an old but very reliable vehicle that I want to replace. I am 26 and Gross 50k. My housing expenses is around $900 per month. $300 per month in school loans (25k total). $250 in Utilities. $300 food. 
Maybe another $200 in Misc expenses.

I want to spend around 15k on a very particular car. For which maintenence cost would not be an issue. As I have access dealer techs.

I also have a roommate that pays me (Directly for the next 6months atleast) $550 the house we share is mortgage by my parents which $900 is the mortgage.

The problem is I want a cheapish car with a bunch of miles that I know won't depreciate anymore. The credit union says they won't finance a higher milage car. And the age is a factors into the interest rate. 

My other option which I'm not really wanting to do is lease a vehicle.  I don't want to be committed to a car that I can't modify (**I'm a huge motor head**) for several years.

**Should I give up on the auto loan from the bank and purchase and finance through a dealer** 

or  

**get a car that I won't like and will cost me roughly the same money**

or

**Lease a new car**

Keeping my current car as much as it pains me cause I love this car is no longer a practical option.

**EDIT:** I know that for many people a vehicle is just something to get them from work to home. I do not feel the same way about cars which is why I want to restate the crux of my question which is:

Should I consider a dealer loan for the car in my price range I really want,

Get a car loan from a bank for a vehicle that I can afford but will probably massively depreciate.

personalfinance,"[Debt] Going back to school, should I pay off my current debt with new student loans?","I'll be going back to school this semester for my Master's degree and just received my FASFA letter. I'm in a very fortunate position where my degree is 100% paid for already so any loans I have available are ""free"" to be used, in that sense.

I am being offered a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan of **$4,158 / semester** this year. That means I could take out only 1 semester and pretty much pay off my current debt (see below).

**Current Debt:** 

Student loan (undergrad) - $3,061.88*

Credit Card - $1,274.96

**Total:** $4,336.84


* *There is a note next to my current student loan total that says ""This is not your payoff amount."" I assume this means if I paid in full, it would be some amount less?*

Additionally, I am looking to close on a land contract for a house soon so my thinking is that in consolidating my debt, my credit report will look a bit better for the banks. My previous student loan was sent to collections so I imagine that doesn't look the best and it would be better to have a more current loan on file with the older one paid.

As far as income goes, I don't have a lot and will only be making about $1,000/mo as a stipend through my university to live off of, which doesn't give me much room to pay anything off faster. I'm pretty good at being frugal so my idea here, again, is to consolidate and pay the 1 loan off slowly as I get through the next 2 years of school, with my personal income going up quite a bit (hopefully) after that.

Does this sound like a good idea, or should I just continuing making the minimum payments on my current debt and avoid taking a new loan out?",finance,1467828748

My credit limit is $7500 and I usually charge about $750-$1250 per month on that, paying off the full balance every 1-3 weeks or so.

In April of this year I signed up for credit karma and the Transunion and Equifax report scores have been hovering around 680 consistently. Here's the little graphic of factors they provide (this is 1 day after paying my CC balance, which is why the utilization is so low right now) http://imgur.com/Pb0DRW6

Can someone explain why there's such a large gap between FICO and the TU/Equifax, but the TU/Equifax have been within 5 points of each other every month? Is it really just the difference between formulas?

I'm a little over 6 months clean, which is the longest I've ever had. I'm currently working a full time job. I need advice, I feel like I can't be fully honest about my debt with family because it makes me feel super worthless and dumb.

My debt is as follows:

$1500 in parking tickets, which they have just started garnishing my wages and taking it out of my GST checks. Most of these tickets are in collections, they started at $25 a piece but went up to $61 since they were neglected for so long.

$1000 cellphone bill.

$1300 credit card debt, the limit is $1000 so I'm currently over $300 just due to the monthly fees and its in collections. 

$200 owed to Money Mart which I am going to pay on Friday when I get paid. 

My income and bills are:
My pay cheques are around $750/bi weekly. 
I have a $60/bi weekly car payment that comes out as soon as I get paid. 

$185/mth for my cell phone, I've got 15gb of data on there and they said that I cannot reduce the plan until I have the past due caught up, so I haven't been able to lower the monthly amount.

Car insurance is $55/mth, 

Line of credit minimum payment is $170/mth (I owe $15,900 on my line of credit)
 
I pay $200/mth currently to crash on my aunt's couch. 

About $80/biweekly for gas for work travel. 

I can't get a balance or flow with paying this shit.

I'm sure others have faced this question and I've looked around and couldn't find any solid answers or advice. I'm faced with two student loans in the amounts of $28k and $25k, at an interest rate of 7.9% (thanks, Congress). I have other loans but they are insignificant compared to these two. They were both around $20k when I took them out in 2011 and 2012, so I've learned how quickly interest compounds.

I am qualified to take out up to $23k in loans for my first year, although I will only need $17k/year. These loans are at a much better interest rate of 5.31%. 

So my question is: should I take out the full amount and make payments on the loans that are higher in amount and interest rate? Is this even legal? In my mind this seems like a good way to save money, although I don't want it to cause any legal or financial trouble.

Will be filing an appeal that may or may not get approved. I owe my parents about $4500 between last years schooling and a recent car purchase (another story).

Electricity,"Advice with 3-way wiring, upgrading from very old to new switch.","There are currently two switches linked to a set of lights that I'm trying to add a timer for, replacing only one of them.

I've identified which is the primary (first in line from the breaker panel) by following wiring.

Both switches currently have only three wires, a black, a white, and a red (in addition to ground).

The new switch that I'd like to put in is: http://www.leviton.com/OA_HTML/ProductDetail.jsp?partnumber=VPT24-1PZ&amp;section=44955&amp;minisite=10251

Instructions for the switch are at: http://www.leviton.com/OA_HTML/ibcGetAttachment.jsp?cItemId=qoaRoyladhvy4zg3RsANaA&amp;label=IBE&amp;appName=IBE&amp;minisite=10251

I am looking at step 4b for the wiring diagram - which is as close as I can get without having to change the second switch. I have the black/red/white wires that were connected to the old switch, though nothing to connect the yellow (YL/RD per the instructions) to, and am thus rather confused.

I've set one of these switches up before in a single pole setup, and it was easy enough.. I tried simply replacing the old with the new switch, plugging in the correct colours to their screws, though that didn't work (lights wouldn't turn on, and breaker didn't blow).

I theorize that I'm going to have to map out which wires go where, though am not certain how to proceed. I have a digital multi-meter ready.

Any advice on how to start with this would be greatly appreciated. I would be happy to post a walk through with pictures and/or video to help others once I've figured it out..

UPDATE: I finally got fed up, and used one of the traveller wires to bring the (black) line over to the second switch, and was able to get it working single-pole. Since this switch is now set to auto-on the lights at sundown and auto-off at sunup, I really don't need that second 3-way switch. I've capped off the second traveller (white), and will head out to home depot to get a wall plate that covers the location where that second switch was tomorrow.

Okay reddit, this is my first time posting, so please go easy. 

My situation: 
I'm a recent college grad with a great job in my field of study. I make what most would consider a decent salary, but I live in San Francisco, and therefore pay more than the average Joe to live, eat, get around, etc. I cut costs where I can, for example my rent is extremely cheap by SF standards.  

I have 3 federal loans, each around $2-3K. I have a monthly auto-payment of around $100 set up, and that $100 is divided pretty much evenly across all 3 loans. Loan 1 has an interest rate of 3.15%. Loan 2 has an interest rate of 4.25%. Loan 3 has an interest rate of 6.55%. All are fixed rate. 

It's pretty obvious to me from reviewing my statement that I should start paying more on Loan #3, as my current balance is now higher than the principle. What I'm looking for is advice that might be less obvious; tips or tricks, or just advice I may not already know. And, if I am only able to increase my monthly payment by about $75 (for the reasons listed above), how should I divide it up across the 3 loans?

personalfinance,"Help Planning to return to College. How much should I be willing to take out in loans? How do loans/scholarships effect financial aid, etc.? Lots of questions...","**Background:**
 
I'm planning to return to school preferably as quick as possible, but I want to do it right, when I initially went to university, I excelled academically, but failed to adapt in every other way, ended up dropping out and addicted to heroin, defaulting on debt (about 12k), and found myself with no family, friends, money or assets. I grew up in a shitty situation, with a functioning addict for a parent, and no family members who had gone to college to help, I went in to it blind and that contributed a lot to why things didn’t work out, this time around I need to be much more prepared, and have been doing my research, but there are still a few things I’m unsure about/need help with.

I've spent the last few years getting clean and rebuilding, paid off all my debt, started rebuilding my credit (back up to 660s and hopefully maybe 700 by the end of the year)saved up an emergency fund ($5k). And feel like I'm in a generally good position to return to school full time.


**My info:**

- 23 M Florida
- Goal: Attend a state university, hopefully, without working, while minimizing debt as much as possible, with the goal of finding stable employment, paying off my debt as quickly as possible, and then enjoying a middle class life.
- Intended Major: Accounting
- Credit Score: 660 (should be at least a little higher, hopefully 700 by the time I would take out loans – a year from now)
- Emergency fund: $5,000
- Debt: $0
- School left: 3 years (four if I get accepted into the honors/joint - MAcc program). The first year (this fall &amp; spring) I will still be working) so I’ll be attempting to cover 2 years with financial aid.
- Estimated Cost of Attendance: FAU Off-Campus $23,834 (including tuition $5,432).
- EFC: 0
- Pell grant award: $5,815
- Federal Loan Eligibility: $12,500 total (up to $5,500 subsidized)

**Questions:**

1. I’m planning for worst case scenario, if I receive no scholarships/further aid, how much should I be willing to take out in loans for the last two years of school?

2. How much can I take out? My understanding is you can received loans for up to the school’s official cost of attendance, less any grants and scholarships, is this correct? (In this case $23,834 – $5,815, leaving me with 18,019, $12.500 of which would be federal loans, and after that I would need to look at private loans?)

3. If I end up needing private loans, how do I go about looking for those/finding the best deal?



4. ~~If I do keep working while going to school, my goal is to find a job that offers tuition reimbursement for part-time employees, how does tuition reimbursement factor into financial aid? My understanding is it lowers your loan eligibility by counting as financial aid similar to grants and scholarships?~~

5. ~~My Pell grant will cover tuition, does this mean I can’t use tuition reimbursement, or could I just use tuition reimbursement first to cover courses, then apply the remaining Pell grant money to rent/food/etc.?~~


6. How do scholarships, grants, tuition reimbursement and loans affect taxes?

7. With scholarships, I can receive up to the amount of cost of attendance, and apply them for rent/food whatever, unless the scholarship specifically states otherwise?

8. If I receive a scholarship that is say only for tuition, can I apply it too that, and then use Pell grant money for other expenses, or is Pell applied first?

9. Receiving more aid via grants &amp; scholarships affects my financial aid In that it lowers my loan eligibility, but it shouldn’t affect my EFC &amp; Pell aware correct? If I’m wrong, how do I know how any awards will affect EFC/Pell?

10. Is my emergency fund enough? 

11. My understanding that to be successful post-college, I need to participate in school groups, like the Accounting Honor Society, preferably in a leadership role. To network and attend relevant events on campus. To have at least 1 internship. And to take advantage of the school’s career center resources, interviews, resumes, networking, etc. Lastly, to begin applying for jobs, in the fall of senior year?

personalfinance,Parents can no longer afford to pay for my education . I need to take out loans for the next four school semesters. I'm very unsure where to begin but want to make sure I do this right.,"So here's the deal. I know nothing about finances. Absolutely nothing. I'm 19 and the ideas of loans, money, and budgeting intimidate and confuse me. My parents have been very supportive for my sibling and I. They told the both of us to go to the best school we could get into and they'd try to cover as much of the costs as they could. My sibling just graduated from a state school with only some small Federal Subsidized Loans. I'm attending a private school for a degree in Computer Engineering.
To finance our education my parents had been taking money out of their retirement funds. This hasn't been a problem until this year when they ended up paying more in taxes than they had expected due to the money they withdrew from their retirement funds counting towards their income. Instead of getting their tax return they ended up being taxed more. After doing some planning and consulting an advisor they decided that they simply couldn't afford to keep paying for my education if they wanted to retire in the foreseeable future.
This leaves the next four semesters up to me. I currently have a subsidized federal loan for about $5,000. This is my only debt. My parents have agreed to pay for my food and books but it looks like tuition and housing will be up to me. My current bill for this upcoming semester, after financial aid, is just shy of $15,000. This seems to leave me with one choice. To get a private loan.
From what I understand theres no way to know what bank will give me the best interest rates unless I apply for a bunch and compare. This is what I plan on doing.
Now my degree is a five-year program where in my next three years I will be spending both summers and two semesters worth of time on co-op where I have been told to realistically expect $20-$35 an hour. This gives me the opportunity to pay down my interest while I'm at school but I'd also like to save some of that money, use some for daily expenditures, and buy a used car. Ideally during that time I'll be able to live at home and commute (I live in the suburbs of New York City so I have a good opportunity to get something in the city or somewhere else close) to my co-op. In the meantime I'm currently working a summer job earring $14/hour. When I get to school in August I plan on getting a job on campus to earn some side money but it won't be more than $10/hour with about 10 hours/week.
Any and all advice is appreciated. To begin with, should I be applying for private loans to compare interest rates? What else should I be comparing? Am I missing anything major? Is $60k-$70k worth of private loans damning? Is there anything I can do to lessen the cost? Should I be using any income in the mean time to pay down the interest?

I come from a very conservative household and my extended family is all conservative and while only my direct family knows that I am homo, its still been real tough with the treatment and the tension and the awful remarks. Beyond the lack of moral support, my parents have just laughed at or ignored my questions regarding finance and basically act like I'm not going to be able to handle the outside world, which to be frank is kinda hurtful. I'll be going to college as a freshman in the fall and my parents have made it very clear that they won't be supporting me or expecting me back home. 

The details of my financial aid package are as follows:


Estimated total cost             $33,418


Cal Grant A (FAFSA)            -$12,294


UC Berkeley UG scholarship -$5,962


Work Study                        -$4,000


 (Loan) Total:                11,162

So assuming that I can make $4,000 during my freshman year considering I want to adjust before taking up a job, that leaves me with some loans right? Is there really anything I can do to reduce this?

Federal subsidized                       $3,500


Federal unsubsidized                    $2,000


and Federal parent plus loan (idk) $5,662

We live in a 2 bedroom apartment near CSU Fullerton in southern california, 2 people in each room. They would like for us to take in an additional roommate to live in the living room but i'm not very happy about this mostly because I like to have friends over to watch movies or play board games in the living room once or twice a week. If I say no two of my housemates will move out and I will need to find two more to replace them (they have told me they will understand and finding roommates this time of year will be easy)


The short of my financial situation is that I am mostly living on financial aid with a very part time job that pays for groceries. I'm a chemistry major which doesn't leave me a lot of time for another part time job. Getting an additional roommate would save about $100 per month.


My question is, is this worth it? I could save $1200 next year by living more uncomfortably which could really help to cut some of my student loan debt but I really don't want to lose all that space.

~3 years ago I had amazing credit.  800+ on all 3 bureaus.  However, I carried a large debt load, 100% credit cards.  I put myself in a situation where I uprooted my entire life, moved cross-country for a job opportunity, and it did not pan out.  At the end of it, I was out of money and out of hope.  

I stopped paying ALL CREDIT CARDS with BK in mind.  Credit scoring dropped into the FOUR HUNDREDS in less than 60 days!  Literally 800s to 400s in 2 months.  

* 6 or 7 credit card accounts

* ~$40k total CC debt at the time.

**WHERE I AM NOW**

* I have not checked my credit report in 3 years, since I heard it hit the 400s.  I intended to file BK for the past few years, but me being me, never got around to it.  Things have changed.  Read below.

* I have never attempted to negotiate or discuss collections or settlements.

* I get emails from Credit Karma every week or so saying, ""Your credit has changed!""

* I used to get a shitload of collections calls - several a day - now I get maybe 1 or 2 a month, add to ignore list, never hear from them again

* I spent 2 years being what I would consider ""broke.""  I could pay my necessary bills, but not the CCs.

* I have scared myself into keeping a minimal amount of $$ in the bank in fear of seizure/garnishment, which means I have cash in random places.

* I now make far too much to qualify for BK.



**HERE's WHY I SAY I'VE BEEN LUCKY**

* I have not been served/sued

* My wages have not been garnished

* I am now fortunate to be making 5x what I made before

My thought is that month the first payment is due, we request 401k loans and get the money a few days later. That way we have enough to pay for the cost of the renovation and we can push off the repayment period as much as possible. My plan is that once the project is done, do a cash out refinance and use the cash to pay back the 401k loans first and put the rest back in savings. It looks like refinance rates are a little lower than the 4% I currently have, so that's a plus.
Is this a feasible plan? I understand there is risk involved in hoping for a high assessment of the house, but newly built houses right across the street have been selling for 300k+, and I'm hoping that I can get an assessment of at least $250k. With the refinance I'll put enough down to avoid paying PMI. I also understand the rule about having an emergency fund, but I can liquidate my stocks in order to cover anything that comes up. I'm interested to hear what people think.",finance,1467894080

personalfinance,Could someone please explain tax deductions for paying student loan interest?,"I know there is a deduction for paying student loan interest but I'm having a tough time finding any sources that quantify this for me. Do I receive a larger return during tax season if I pay more student loan interest this year? 2016 has been the first year my student loans have entered repayment so I want to be prepared for what to expect.

I pay roughly $315 a month for my payments and of that I think its pretty much 50/50 towards capital / interest until the interest is paid down (which is currently around $3000).

personalfinance,Student Loan/Future Advice Needed,"To start, I am 25/M/USA
I am freshly graduated as of May with my BA in Supply Chain Management and am lucky enough to have acquired a position at a local company with an hourly pay of $25 ($52,000 Annually), typically my field is salary so there may be some advantages to hourly since my O/T is time and a half (unsure yet if I have availability to using OT). Also, my fiancé is moving to the Caribbean to study medicine, this is important to a future question.
Anyways, here's the fun part, I am currently $98,179 in student loan debt.

I will list my current financial aspects:

- Sallie Mae Debt: $73,636 (7 separate loans)

- Federal Loans: $24,543 (7 separate loans)

- Credit Union Checking Balance: $6,100

- No Savings

- No car payments, have been moving forward on buying a Toyota 4Runner for $10k since it should last at least 300k miles. My current Sunfire has lasted me from 120k miles to 330k miles and I feel as if it is about to die (I am definitely frugal with my money in regards to cars).

- Currently no rent payment, but that will be changing in August so I either will be moving home or moving in with a friend (This will either cost me $300-400 monthly living with a friend or $0 living at home)

Here are my big questions:

1)	Should I buy a $10k car that I can put at least $4,500 down on (due to checking account balance) or should I use my fiancé’s car while she is in the Caribbean? 

2)	Should I consolidate my private loans?  federal loans?

3)	What would you do in my situation? Move home, use large sum of checking account to negotiate paying off one of my semi-larger loans and borrow fiance’s car? Or rent with friend, make car payments and possibly be a bit happier in the short-term?

I really just don’t know what to do and need some advice, anything helps.

If anyone needs more information please let me know and I would be glad to provide it.  As long as it’s not ridiculously intrusive.

personalfinance,(NL) Soon I'll be starting in college and be able to receive the cheapest loan in my life.,"Hi reddit,

In 2 months Ill be starting in college (I'm an 18 y/o male).
Due to an inheritance I don't need to pay my tuition so my main expense would be costs of living. My parents are able to support me for a good fraction of these expenses, so I do not need to lend a whole lot of money.

My government offers student loans with really, really good terms. Summarized the interest is 0.01% and loan has to be paid off within 35 years.

My dad suggested I lend the maximum amount which is about $1100 a month and put it in a savings account or invest it.

At this point, I've moved the majority of my money to PNC and kept my BoA savings and checking accounts open in the event of any recurring charges I've neglected to switch to my new bank.

For my BoA Savings, it was a Money Market account for about two years, but in preparation of moving my money around, I switched it back to a regular savings account so I would have a much lower minimum account balance required.

This happened sometime in mid-April, and I'm aware that sometimes accounts that switch their interest status can take a cycle or two before interest is posted again. However, the last time my Savings account at Bank of America earned any interest that was added to my account was April 11th. It's been almost three statement cycles since then, and nothing. Should I contact BoA to see what's up, or should I just let it ride for now and bring it up when I eventually go to close the account?

personalfinance,Retirement Option Advice,"Hi PF,
I’ve been reading the sub for awhile and have developed some great habits from doing so (thanks!). I’m 23 making 65K with about 30K student loan debt and 9K car debt. A few of the loans have fairly high interest rates (between 5 and 6.5 –just paid off the 8% loan), so I’m paying as much as I can per month. This leads me to my retirement savings. My company matches up to 6% dollar for dollar vested immediately, so of course I’m taking advantage of that. I included my debt info to explain why I’m only putting in 6% of my pay at the moment and not more. Now to my question – I have three options for my contributions and everything I read about them has lead me to different conclusions. They are as follows, with my brief understanding of each:

Before Tax – contributions reduce my taxable income, and are taxed upon withdrawal in retirement.
Roth 401(k) – contributions do not reduce taxable income, and are untaxed upon withdrawal with no penalties after age 59 1⁄2.
Post86 After Tax – contributions do not reduce taxable income, and only the earnings are taxed upon withdrawal (no age penalty?)

They all qualify for the company match, so I’m looking for some advice as to what my contribution levels should be here. I have changed them once or twice so far, and currently they stand at 3% going to Roth 401(k) and 3% going to Post86. I understand that the choice depends on desired income in retirement, and I guess I just don’t really know how quickly retired folks typically pull from their savings to determine if I expect to have a higher or lower income in retirement than I do now. From what I’ve gleaned from a few articles, there really isn’t a definitive right or wrong answer that will generate hundreds of thousands more or less. I just want to stop obsessing over it and stick with one plan for awhile. After I pay down my loans, I plan to open a vanguard account and continue investing there in addition to the investments through my company. Any advice here would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,"[Student Loans] I just got a call from my student loan holder, they offered me a buy out, take it?","I have $38,400 in private student loan debt that has basically never been paid. The loan is from when I went to a for-profit school when I was 18, I graduated in 2004 but never found work in the field. It's taken me since then to finally get a good enough job where I can start making payments on it. 

I was young and stupid and didn't make any deals or communicate with them in any way, i just ran and avoided it. Now that im a bit older and wiser i've started making payments on my loans and made efforts to get my federal loans out of default with an income-based repayment play consolidation (the federal loans are only a few thousand dollars).

After I made my first payment to each of the 2 private loans I got a call from Navient (formally sallie mae) offering me a buyout option of $4500 to wipe out my private student loan debt. The condition is I have to make the payment by the end of the month. Technically I could pull it off, it would hurt like hell but i could do it. I get paid monthly so I could just use the vast majority of my savings and my paycheck to pay this off and be a bit late with other bills and just eat ramen for a month.

I know it might sound obvious, at least it did to me, ""of course take it"" but what are the consequences? I know if I pay it in full over time it will look ""better"" on my credit but right now im paying $350 a month and at that rate it will take many years to pay off (3.5% interest), im 31 now and I'd like to start a family and get a house sometime soon, **my question is: This seems a bit too good to be true, what are the consequences and is this a good idea for the long term health of my credit and financial situation?**

p.s. it's really true, you spend your 30's trying to fix what you broke in your 20's if you're not careful (and i definitely wasn't). 

TL;DR; 40k in student loan debt. Loan holder offered me a settlement of $4.5k if I send the lump sum by the end of the month. Consequences of settlement? 

**Edit:** Why do some people seem to think I make over 400k a year? I don't see where your math is coming from. I make just over 100k and I support my entire extended family of 10 so things are tight but i can make it happen.

**Edit2:** Ah, it's because i said I was in the highest tax bracket. I guess I was wrong about that. My accountant told me i was ""basically in the highest tax bracket"" because I was single person that makes over 100k. I guess I need a new person to file my taxes.

Title is pretty self explanatory. Thanks to my tax return, job switching (paid out leftover vacation time) and a few other smaller things, I have about $4k that wouldn't have come in otherwise. Not counting this new money, I have about $30k in savings

I have $17k worth of student loans debt (down from $29k, class of 2015 \o/), all federal. ~$2k is at 6.8%, the remainder is 3-4%. I would love to dump some if this money towards the loans, but am not sure if now's the time. 

I'm hesitant for a few reasons. The
biggest thing I'm concerned about is a potential move in the future (SO is in the final stages of interviewing for a job that would require us to move a few hundred miles in the next few months.) If this happens, I'm out of a job.

If the move doesn't happen, I'm still hesitant - my new job doesn't pay very well, since I'm still in training. Once I'm done with that, my pay should increase pretty quickly, but right now I'm making uncomfortably little.

Not counting this new money, my savings would cover about two years of living expenses (including rent, internet, transportation, etc). I'd like to have my loans paid off in the next 2-3 years so I can start aggressively saving for retirement.

personalfinance,"Opinions on taking loan from 401K, please!","I am considering taking out a Loan from my 401K balance. At my current situation, my credit card debt has been a huge source of anxiety and depression for me and I would do just about anything to get rid of it completely. I have budgeted as much as I possibly could but still seem to not be able to pay off the debt (interest rates range from 14-20%). My only question is what will happen should I not pay off the entirety of the loan if I were to be separated from my current employer? 

As I understand it, the remaining balance of the loan would be due in full within 60 days after separation and if it is not paid, then the remaining balance would be considered an early withdrawal and I would be subject to penalties and taxes (10% penalty, 25% federal tax, and 8% CA tax), correct? Let's say that I take out a loan of $12000 and make payments of $240/month ($120/paycheck), however two years after I initiated the loan, I am separated from my employer and have a remaining loan balance of $6240. If I am unable to pay the $6240 in full, I would be subject to the taxes and penalties of ($6240 x 0.43=$2,683), correct? If so, how would I pay the tax bill of $2,683? Would that be at the time that I file taxes for that year?

Also, if I was separated from my current employer was because I got a new job at a different company, theoretically I could 1) Rollover the remaining balance of 401k to the retirement account of my new employer and 2) Take out a  separate loan from my new 401k to pay off the taxes due from my first loan, right? Alternatively, if I'm in desperate need and did not have another job at the time of separation from my current employer (got my ass fired), I could also simply take an early distribution from my remaining 401k balance to pay the taxes due on the first loan, right? Yes, I know this would be a horrible option and I would need to withdraw even more than the taxes due on the loan balance to cover the penalties/taxes on the withdraw as well. 

To be honest, the money that I would lose in terms of my 401k would be worth it to me if only to rid myself of the cc debt. I racked up this debt during an extremely difficult time during my life and it's like an almost constant reminder of that period. For my own mental health I feel like I just need to get rid of it as soon as I possibly can and outside of winning the lotto, I don't see very many other options.

For reference: I am in my mid-20s, have a 401k balance of about 26K, current employer contributes 10% of my salary regardless (not a match), and I contribute 5% of my salary.

personalfinance,Buy an old cheap car or finance a decent pre owned car,"Hi,

I am 21 years old and going into my senior year of college.  I need to get a car by the end of the summer and am torn on what to do.  I have $5,000 dollars right now that I can spend on a car (I also have a little bit more to cover taxes, fees, insurance).  I do not have much of an income during the school year aside from odd jobs here and there but I will be graduating in May and will have no issue finding a job once I graduate.  

My question is: Would I be better off spending all of my $5,000 on an older car that I can pay cash for up front, or should I buy a used but newer car and finance it.  I can get pretty decent interest rates with my parents as cosigners if I decide to finance.  If I finance I would structure it so that the payments would be in line with me already having the first 18 months accounted for with the $5,000 saved and I would just make a payment from my savings for the first 18 months.  Then I would just continue to pay it off each month with the money I earn after I graduate.  (18 months is a very safe time frame and most likely I'll only need 12 months).  

My gut says buy a cheaper car and pay in full with the $5,000 but I am afraid that if anything unexpected happened, I wouldn't have any money in the immediate future to fix it.  I understand that the issue exists in both scenarios, but it would be significantly greater with a cheap car vs a newer used one.

Any thoughts would be appreciated.  Thank you.  

P.S.  Also just to be clear- I have other savings to live off of next year at school.  The 5k is set aside solely for a car.

personalfinance,"Move MIL out of a bad neighborhood and into elderly housing by using this ""trick""?","I am having a tough time figuring out how to handle my 65 year old, widowed, mother-in-law and her housing situation going forward.  

Her kids are all grown and married, she has been widowed for about five years and collecting survivor SSI benefits of about $1100/mo.  Here are some financial facts or at best, some estimates.

-Money she has in the bank - $200-300 as far as we know, lives paycheck to paycheck on SSI.  She may hide cash but none of us know where it is if it even exists.  
-Mortgage balance is roughly $20,000, give or take a little depending on when her last payment was made.  Should be paid off in about two years
- Her payments are about $800/mo on the house and her eldest son takes care of most of that, along with annual property tax of around $4500.  She takes care of the remaining plus her utilities.  
- Collects $190/mo in SNAP .  
- No other retirement accounts we are aware of, life insurance all used up

A safe estimate on her home value is in the $225k - 250k range (it also needs extensive updates) for a poorer town outside of Boston.  Four bedroom and roughly 2000 sq ft.  I'm being conservative as she could get closer to $300k if it was modernly updated but it looks like it's out of the 1950's inside.  

While it's not a topic of discussion around the dinner table, I've been told the eldest son would inherit the house if she dies or she may act on something prior to that.  And here is where my question comes in.....  

She lives well below the federal poverty line and she wants to keep it that way when it comes down to the home sale.  She doesn't want to be pocketing $200k+ in cash and no longer able to qualify for cheap, elderly housing.  

So should she sell to her son for $1 to ""hide"" this asset vs selling outright to a new owner?  Is this common?  Moral to do?  I'm torn on the issue as I would like to see her have a cushion of money to fall back on but at the same time, I don't want to see her dump it all into a new place to live because $200k doesn't get you much in better neighborhoods around Boston, not even many one bedrooms where she would feel safe, without being able to put some of the money to the side for her retirement years.  She also needs to live near public transit as she has never driven, those places are much more expensive.  We want her to live near one of her four children, if possible, and we almost all have elderly housing nearby that is an option for her.

I have emergency fund set aside, $1250, not quite half a year, but close enough.

I don't have any retirement fund set up yet, since it doesn't make any sense now, when our parliament just robbed last funds that were stored in institutions offering these (imagine federal government first merging all your 401k and IRAs into subaccount on Social Security system, and then just taking over the funds - that's what happened here), and I can expect only state pension, that's around $280 for now - pathetic even by our standards. Plan is just drop something on saving account each month until I'm too old to work.

Due to our economy, best saving accounts here are offering up to whooping 1.5%/year on deposits - we have negative inflation now. 

What I can realistically do with $5000/year? Should I stick to simple saving accounts, or try investing in funds? Or try something else?",finance,1467925094

personalfinance,The Classic Question: Sell or Rent it,"I've seen many people ask this question but I'm trying to establish a plan that my wife and I can follow for 5 - 7 years to get where we need to go. 

Our goal is in 5-7 years to buy a home with some acreage and have a little hobby farm. We figure we'll spend around $500-550k for the right place (based on current market value). 

**Here is my situation:**

Current Mortgage:
*Purchase Price $207k

*Remaining Mortgage $194k

*Remaining Loan Term: 28-1/2 years

*3.75% Interest Rate

*P&amp;I $919

*Tax, PMI &amp; Insurance ~$360

*Location : Ideal - by parks, and elementary-high school, small town feel etc. 

**My current plan**

My thought was to make an additional payment of ~$625 to the principal per month for about 5 years to bring the remaining loan balance to about $120k. I would then do a re-amortization with my bank to restructure my payment, however I need to put down at least $10k on the principal when I do this plus a $500 fee. 
During this time I would save my work bonuses which total about $4000/year to give me $20k. 

We would then spend the next roughly 2 years saving the difference in the mortgage payment + the $625 giving us about $14,400 per year x 2 = $28,800 + an additional 2 years of saving my bonus ($28k) for a total of $56,800. 

We would then find our house, put down about $28k (5%) and leave about $29k for improvements and other farm things. 

Granted none of this takes into consideration our gradually increasing income and our ability to save more.

**My Question is this:** 

I can rent my current house for about $1,400 giving me probably $650 in positive income (based on a re amortized payment), and my house is probably worth $230k.  We would have enough income to make both mortgage payments (as the rental would be comparatively small). Would I be better off renting this place out and dealing with a little less cash on hand for the new house or should I sell it after 7 years, having gained all that equity + 28,800k of the 2 years of saving?  I'd rather not do a HELOC or something like that to use the equity as I don't want to have several payments, I'd rather pay in cash or not have it.  I'm handy enough, I suppose I want to rent because it seems like a smart investment and good long term income potential. Plus I can always sell if I get sick of being a landlord.

personalfinance,Need advise on a possible Student Loan Forgiveness opportunity.,"So the college I acquired my bachelors at is closing down. I saw an ad regarding student loan forgiveness for this school specifically, so I clicked it and filled out some basic info(name and phone number). Within 5 seconds(literally) I got a call from a company in California called [Post Grad Services](http://postgradservices.com/). The guy explained to me that I may be eligible for full or partial student loan forgiveness. I give him some more basic info and he needed access to my FSAID which I gave him so he could see the loans.

He eventually tells me that I qualify for something called Pay as you earn. It's for a ~30k federal loan. He said it would lower my payments to $133/month for 223 months and that the program basically allowed me to pay the principal balance only, and once it's paid they forgive the rest of the loan. He said I can make more than the $133 payment and that there would be no interest applied for the first 3 years. They want $500 to process the paperwork for me to get into this program. I told him I would think about it and did not give any more information(they wanted me to pay over the phone). He was not pushy at all.

Now I've heard vaguely of this Pay as you earn program. I did some googling and cannot find anything about it allowing you to pay the principal balance only and there being no interest.

My questions are:

Is this a legitimate service that is just charging me to do something I can do myself?

Am I an idiot for giving them any information(FSAID)? I have a feeling I shouldn't have given him that but was exhausted after work and not really thinking straight. The idea of halving my student loan debt made me stupid. I already changed my FSAID pw.

Is he explaining this program to me correctly? It sounds too good to be true. I am a little confused as he said that I would only pay the current principal balance for the life of the loan(223 months), but the first 3 years are interest free. If I'm only responsible for the principal doesn't that imply that there is no interest?

investing,Game Plan For The Non Farm Payrolls Report: Be Ready To Capitalize,"Within hours the Non Farm Payrolls Report will be released. This is the once a month jobs report that gives a clear picture on whether or not the economy is speeding up or slowing down. The stock market pays close attention to this number because the Federal Reserve bases a large part of their interest rate policy on it.

Analysts estimates range from 150,000 to 225,000. A number anywhere between 150,000 to 200,000 would be considered a goldilocks number and be very positive for the stock market. However, a number below 150,000 would be negative. Why? Because it would signal a slowing economy. Considering the Federal Reserve has almost no bullets left in their 'quantitative easing' gun, the markets would likely panic. A -300 day on the Dow Jones Industrial average would be likely. Should the jobs number come in north of 200,000, the markets would likely be flat to lower. Why? Because it would be interest rate hikes back on the table for later this year. You would see a sharp spike in yields and the Dollar would shoot higher. A higher Dollar would put pressure on gold, silver and oil.

Ultimately, the market is hoping for that perfect number. Not too hot, not too cold. Somewhere around 185,000 would be perfect in my humble opinion. If that happens, the S&amp;P could head to 2120 or higher.

A few things to note: There will be 35,000 jobs automatically added into this number because of the Verizon strike being over. Also, pay close attention to last months horrid number in terms of revisions. Revisions up would be very positive.",finance,1467962289

ethereum,"On Coin-lock voting, Futarchy and Optimal Decentralized Governance","There has been a lot of interest in decentralized governance algorithms in the Ethereum community, both recently in the search for tools for getting consensus on resolving the DAO issue and more broadly because one of the attractions of Ethereum is the ability to more easily implement such things. Outside of the Ethereum community, there has also been a substantial body of research into developing voting algorithms that are more ""incentive-compatible"" in various ways than simple 51% majority vote. The primary contenders include:

* **Futarchy**: https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/
* **Quadratic voting**: http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/
* **Liquid democracy**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy

Inside the Ethereum community, there are already projects looking to use each one of these. Before the DAO blew up, there was interest in [creating higher-level tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDao/comments/4n59i1/dthpool_fluid_democracy_for_the_dao/) to essentially become a de-facto liquid democracy. [Akasha](http://akasha.world/) is using quadratic voting for rating posts and comments, and [Maker](http://makerdao.com) is exploring intergrating futarchy into its DAO governance.

There are naturally arguments between proponents of these camps. In the case of futarchy, it is highly flexible and can theoretically work to maximize any desired objective that it can measure, even against the wishes of the majority of its participants (provided that a sufficient number of them are economically rational). However, it runs into the critiques that (1) finding metrics that are easy to measure is hard, and [complexity-of-value problems](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Complexity_of_value) abound, and (2) outsiders are just as able to participate as insiders, and it is potentially vulnerable to outside groups manipulating the futarchy markets, whereas voting systems naturally protect against this by limiting participation to a particular community. Quadratic voting is theoretically incentive-compatible, but implementing it as-is requires both (1) a one-ID-per-person system, and (2) ideally a way to prevent one user from bribing another to vote in a certain way (both of these are implied in QV's original political voting context, which has robust identity verification and secret ballot properties, but neither are present by default on the blockchain).

Assuming a very high degree of economic efficiency and lack of moral constraints or other friction, many forms of voting break down entirely: voters would simply sell their votes to the highest bidder, and every decision would essentially become an all-pay auction; it's only because of morality, communicational friction and other such considerations that the mechanism works more nicely. Futarchy achieves better performance assuming such secondary motivations do not exist, but fails to take advantage of them if they do. What could be nice to have is a voting mechanism that combines the benefits of both: the mechanism **looks** like an improved voting system, and so assuming the token holders are generally ""nice"" people it acts like an improved version of voting, but assuming bribery and the like is successful and rampant the economic model rather collapses into something like futarchy, which can still provide fairly good results under many circumstances (in fact, it gets better the higher the stakes are).
 
Avsa's [fork vote by ether commitment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4qo3f9/fork_vote_by_ether_commitment_version_2/) is interesting because it actually comes surprisingly close to creating such a system, to some degree. To see how, let us analyze the economics. Anyone can vote, and the vote is weighted by the amount of ether that you vote with, but unlike a simple coin vote like http://carbonvote.com, here voting requires actually locking up your ether for some time if the decision that you favor goes through (if the decision you opposed goes through, you can recover your ether as soon as the vote ends). Users can choose how long they lock up their ether, and the weight of the vote is also multiplied by the square of this length of time. Locking up ether is, economically speaking a cost, however it is a cost that is lower if you are confident that you will not want to exit the Ethereum ecosystem. Hence, there is an element of futarchy in the vote - in fact, it's a [futarchy based on implied interest rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4qqowc/casper_interest_rates_as_a_futarchy_objective/). Avsa's original proposal has the weight of a vote dependent on the square of the lock up time; personally I think it should be the square root, so that the lock up cost relative to the number of votes follows a similar function to quadratic voting. A one-person-one-ID system is not needed as the system is ether-weighted.

Now let's see what happens if bribes are possible. Then, a faction that wants action A to be taken would need to make bribes either to pro-A voters to make them accept longer lock-up periods, or to pro-B voters to get them to accept shorter lock-up periods and thus lower vote scores, or to non-voters to get them to make low-cost short-duration pro-A votes. Unfortunately, you can't bribe people to ""lock up for one more day than you otherwise would have"" because you have no idea how much people ""otherwise would have voted"", and they can lie to try to get your money; the only bribe that would work is a blanket subsidy to every voter that is higher the longer they lock up their coins if they vote A or the shorter they lock up their coins if they vote B. However, because of the ""futarchy"" element this is more expensive than a simple all-pay auction: if option A genuinely creates more uncertainty, then buying A-votes through bribes will be expensive and buying B-votes will be cheaper, whereas if option A creates less uncertainty then buying A-votes will be cheaper and buying B-votes will be more expensive. An attacker looking to ""buy"" A-votes will thus have to settle for bribing B-voters to vote with lower lockup periods, but this is highly expensive as it would essentially entail paying almost everyone, including A-voters (lest they get incentivized to become low-lockup B voters to claim the attacker's bounty). This is not a perfect futarchy argument, and it particularly only focuses on the ""interest rate"" version of futarchy and not token-price-maximization or any other objective, but it does get quite far along the way.

A worthwhile direction for future research would be to more explicitly start from the first principles of voting, quadratic voting and futarchy and see if there can be a broader framework to bring them together and create a hybrid system that provides the best of all worlds.",cryptocurrency,1467966866

personalfinance,"[UK]Student loan, current balance doesn't add up.","Hey, first off I'd just like to mention that I will be calling up the loan company and/or government agency to find out what's up, but I thought I'd ask here just in case I'm about to make a tit of myself.
  
  
I graduated University back in 2008, with a loan of £13,807 (I've confirmed this number with the gov.uk loan payments). Since then, I've been working for over 7 years, starting employment in late 2008. I was on pretty poor wages for the first 2 years so I'm not even sure if I qualified for automatic loan repayments through PAYE. (I will be digging up old payslips to confirm this). But I do know that since about 2010/2011 I have seen automatic student loan deductions from my payslips.
  
  
The catastrophically terrible thing I need to own up to, is that I've never seen a statement from the loan company, they've always had old addresses for me or otherwise incorrect contact details. I've FINALLY managed to sort all that out today, but they've said that I won't get a statement until about 6 - 8 weeks from now. But, I can finally log-on to the website to check my balance, and this is why I'm here.
  
  
According to the website (which doesn't show transactions/history, just the balance) I have £12,485 left outstanding, meaning I've somehow only managed to pay off £1322 in the 7+ years of my employment. Now, this isn't taking interest into account, of which the only information I have at the moment is ""Interest Rate: 0.90"" .. I'm assuming that's a percent, and I'm assuming it's annual. If so, that's just around £124 a year based off the original loan amount, and shouldn't explain why I've only chipped off £1322.
  
  
Currently, I pay £93 a month on student loan via automatic payslip deduction, and it would have been around that figure for the last 3 - 4 years, and dipping lower before that. Even at a rate of 80 a month for the last 2 years alone (which is actually under what I pay) I should have paid off at-least £1920.
  
  
My question, (sorry it took so long to get here!) is, even though the student loan comes out of my payslip, do I still need to tell the loan company how much I'm paying off each month? I've seen a ""balance calculator"" that will allow me to enter monthly deductions (though, only for 2015/2016). This is the first I've heard of it though, and all information I find through the gov.uk website seems to suggest it's all automatic anyway. This leaves me greatly confused, and any info you folks can share would be appreciated.
  
  
As I said, I will be calling some people next week, and I'll be going through all my payslips tonight (what better way to spend a Friday evening!), but I thought I'd get your thoughts/opinions on the matter.

I have a Fedloan servicing loan of about 23k that I'm slowly chipping away at.


For the past year I have been calling in and making monthly debit card payments as Singapore banking systems to not use routing numbers, and therefore direct deposit payment options are not available to me.


Just now they told me that, going forward, I will not longer be able to use the debit card to pay my loan as they 'have been having problems with the system and are discontinuing it'.


MY attitude towards this is, so fucking what? Not my problem. I have the money and intend to pay it, is it my problem that you guys are picky about the method?


Does anyone have any ideas as to the legalities of this situation. They have said that I can get a money order and pay via money order but those cost a fee every time and it just feels punitive/illegal to have me bear the cost of paying for it. It's like I'm paying money for the right to pay money. Is that not illegal?


Either way would appreciate any advice on how to escalate or possible work arounds.

personalfinance,Mortgage Company offering to lower my rate for free?,"Hello, 
 This is my first time posting here but I have a strange question that I can't find anywhere else. Let me preface this with some info  first :

I'm a first time home buyer, closed end of November in 2015. I have a standard 30yr mortgage with a large Mortgage Company who is also servicing my loan. I typically pay +$100 extra into my mortgage every month as well and my credit score is in the 760 range. 

Now this morning I recieved a call from them (the same person who handled my application months ago) stating that they are going to drop my interest rate for no charge whatsoever because I qualified for their Mortgage Rate Drop guarantee program. No fees, no penalties, no extension on my loan, no nothing. This of course will give me money back. The only caveat is that he has to run another credit check in order to verify.

This all sounds far too good to be true with the only downside being the pull on my credit rating. Has anyone else heard of this sort of thing? The only info I can find on it online is for a 7yr refinancing program that I didn't sign up for and isn't specified in my paperwork. I'm holding off until I can get more info than what was provided. 

If anyone knows more I would greatly appreciate the help. 

Thanks

personalfinance,Question regarding Retirement Fund selection,"Hello, PF! I've spent time lurking around but have a question regarding my wife's retirement funds.  I think I know the correct answer, I want to run it by you all. Just last week, I updated my own retirement funds from 10-15 funds with varying expenses, high and low, to a Vanguard Retirement Fund with the lowest total expenses available to me (I think Ex Ratio is ~0.1-0.15% all in)

My wife currently is 100% invested in a 403b Roth Retirement 2050 Fund (TRRMX, 0.75% ER as of 5/31/2015).  If we switched her to a mix of the the Vanguard INST Index (VINIX) and the Vanguard Short Term Fed Adml (VSGDX), based on our current portfolio, we would have an extra ~$270,000 after 30 years (Used calculators from this post https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4nbk4g/403b_vanguard_target_date_funds_vs_mix_of_index/). That's certainly not a trivial amount.

As I'm currently a college student with no immediate debt and have family support as an emergency fund, I was looking into some sort of reinvestment strategy over the course of 5 years to have a better return than what my bonds are currently offering.

personalfinance,"UK - Student Loan for Masters - is getting one a BAD idea if I can dig into savings and pay outright? (rate: RPI + 3% =&gt; currently 3.9%, £7k)","I want to do a part-time distance learning Masters course, fees will be about £7k in total. I will be working full-time throughout, earning £21k before tax per year.

I am eligible for funding from the UK Student Loans Company. Details of the loan below.

I have savings, enough to pay for the course outright. However, it is a lot of money, and I'd need to dig into what I consider my back-up money, or transfer money from a different currency (which I might do anyway if euro and pound gain parity).

The questions is: is there any reason I should NOT be taking out the loan (beyond the ""you are taking a loan"" argument)?

**Details from [the website](https://www.gov.uk/postgraduate-loan/overview)**:

&gt; The earliest you’ll start repaying your Postgraduate Loan is April 2019.

&gt; You’ll only start repaying when your income is over £21,000 per year.

&gt; How much you’ll repay: You’ll pay back 6% of your income over the minimum amount (‘threshold’). This is £21,000 a year, £1,750 a month or £404 a week.

&gt; Example: You earn £2,500 a month before tax. This is £750 over the monthly threshold. You’ll repay £45 (6% of this amount) each month.

&gt; You must repay any undergraduate student loans you have at the same time.

&gt;Interest rate: You’ll be charged interest from the day you get the first payment until your loan is repaid in full or cancelled. The interest rate on the loan is currently 3.9%. The rate is set by adding 3% to the Retail Price Index (RPI). The RPI is reviewed in September every year - if it changes, the interest rate on the loan will change too.",finance,1467995905
personalfinance,"Should I pay off a student loan with another, better interest rate loan?","I'm currently a student with federal direct unsubsidized loans. My initial loan was for $10,000 at 5.84% interest rate, and the total balance as of now is about $10,350. My loan will continue accruing interest throughout my next 3 years of school, but I don't have to start paying it back until 6 months after graduation.

As it stands now, the federal interest rate for this upcoming school year is lower, at 5.31%. My question is this; is it beneficial or recommended to take out a loan with this current interest rate for the purpose of completely repaying my loan from the previous year?

I'm aware that the loan will not be dispersed immediately, so my idea was this. I currently have 10k in the bank, money that was supposed to be for tuition. To clarify, I have additional savings to cover living expenses and an emergency fund. I could use that 10k to pay off my current loan in full. Then, I could take out an additional 10k at the current, better interest rate, and use that to pay my tuition for the school year. That way, I still have the same 10k of debt in student loans, but with no current interest accumulation, and less accumulation over the years.

I have been under contract for a new home in Colorado for a few weeks. I was under a contract last month, too, but it fell through. Both times I was with this same lender. Now he wants to change me from a 3% down payment to a 5% down payment and I am not sure why even though he has given me some seemingly nonsensical answers to my questions around it.

Here below I will retrace the conversation and attach screen shots of the PDFs (the numbers on the loans basically).

----------------------------------------------

**His First Email to Me**

Afternoon
 
We ran into a glitch with FNMA and the guideline requirements as it pertains to current homeownership and the 97% Loan-to-Value option.  I feel I have put together a good alternative in which your monthly payment actually comes in a little lower and your total cash-investment is still basically the same.  There is a few hundred dollar difference, but very close.  In the 95% option I am picking up the lions share of your closing costs thus the way I was able to keep your cash investment basically the same and still reduce your monthly payment.  Call me to discuss and Shawn can send the formal updated disclosure tomorrow for the 95% program option
 
Thanks

* Here is the PDF with the loan at 3% like we had agreed to for over a month: http://i.imgur.com/d421TNo.png
* Here is the NEW PDF with the loan at 5% like he is suggesting in this email: http://i.imgur.com/IHqG6p0.png

-----------------------------------------------------

**My Response**

Hi,

The first thing I noticed was that the interest rate went way up. I thought you were taking a lion's share of the costs? It looks like it is just being passed right back to me in the form of a higher interest rate.

-----------------------------------------------------

**His Response**

Afternoon
 
You caught me off-guard for a 2nd until I looked at what I had sent you on the 95% option and realized I hadn’t adjusted the rate correctly.  My apologizes.  It will increase by only .125% but the up-side is the mortgage insurance decreases by .140% so those two wash each other out.  Here is the correct 95% option
 
Thanks

* Here is the NEW *NEW* and *Promise It is Right This Time* PDF with the loan at 5% again: http://i.imgur.com/bnAUOaR.png

-----------------------------------------------------

**My Response**

Why is the interest rate going up?

-----------------------------------------------------

**His Response**

The difference is balanced out by the reduction in the MI, long-story short, the only way I can cover the costs is I need to have the premium available to do so.  The only way we as lenders can get that in the secondary market is via the interest rate.  I was lucky that it was only .125% to obtain sufficient premium when we securitize the loan after closing, to cover the costs.
 
See below:  This is how the pricing comes up from Wall Street when I submit your transaction based upon your qualifications.  This is for a FHLMC conventional 30-yr fixed rate loan.  Par, in other words, the rate in which you as the borrower would pay all applicable costs would have been @ 3.625%  thus the 100.00 next to that rate tier.  What that means is there is no cost for us to purchase the rate nor is their any premium available for me to pass on to you the customer.  In the 2nd option @ 3.75% that comes in @ 101.157.  That means I have 1.157% of your loan amount that I can give back to you.  That wasn’t going to be enough, so I am contributing  .50 of 1% (my commission) to help make up the difference, thus what I am showing you in the lender paid closing costs section of the form.  I hope that helps explain.  Let me know

Some quick facts/questions/comments:

* For this second contract he asked me for a more recent bank statement which is understandable and standard practice since it had been a month since he had ran my previous numbers. However, with this new statement, I had a MUCH higher balance due to a small loan I had to take out to help cover the costs of the down payment, the move, etc. (He already knew I had done this and we had previously discussed it so it was no surprise and all on the up and up). However, I also had a bonus from a new job ($5,000) and a large payment of $3,000 come in from the HRBlock for messing up my taxes last year as well as 2 back to back large paychecks. All in All there was about $20,000 in there that I know he wasn't expecting. My gut keeps telling me that he saw dollar signs and is trying to get at it since he knows I have the money.

* This whole thing about a new rule/law going into effect on July 2nd (just a few days ago!) seems suspiciously convenient. I've done some research. I currently own my home (it was my first home 10 years ago and I still live in it). This new home will be my second home. It appears that this 97% loan with a 3% down payment thing is reserved only for first time home buyers anyway. Am I right on that? Why have he and I been talking about this for over a month (with him knowing fully that I own my current home) and I am only just now seeing this info with a simple google search? Is he either incompetent or perhaps malicious?

* Related to the bullet item above: Is there even really any law or change that took effect on July 2nd at all? I was thinking of giving him the benefit of the doubt and just assume that maybe he was covering his tracks after he realized that I wasn't a first time home owner and that maybe he had the information wrong on his notes/computer or something and was just trying to make it look like a law had changed rather than admitting a mistake. Remember, I never knew the 3% down thing was a first time home owner thing until just now when googling it (which I am still not 100% sure about I guess).

* The numbers are confusing me. It seems like he is doing the Jedi Mind Trick thing and just trying to baffle me with bullshit and a wall of digits and pseudo facts in his last email especially. It boils down to ""just trust me, I am doing you a favor"" as I read it. But I have also read a lot online about the bait and switch tactic where they will hit you with this crap near the end of the process because they are certain that you will not jump ship and go with another lender at this late point in the game.

* There are these ""Lender Credit"" things on the PDFs that get thrown around. Is he literally trying to fudge numbers so that he can make a certain amount that he deems necessary?

* I am concerned that with this suddenly higher interest rate (even though I am paying more down) will lead me to paying much more over the 30 years of the loan compared to what it was before at 3% down with a lower interest rate. Can anyone help out with this? And, also, if I am going to be paying more then that means this loan will be worth more and, therefore, he can sell me for more is that correct? It seems like a sneaky way to increase his take on the deal without me noticing.

personalfinance,Buying a 200k house,"My wife (26) and I (28) are looking to buy our first home in new jersey. She's in the teacher's union, and I am a union carpenter. We got approved for a 200k house a couple days ago, with an interest rate of 4.1%. We went with a bank that eliminates the closing costs and points due to the fact that we're in a union. 

My salary = 40k, next year 50k

Her salary = 28k, next year 35k

We have no CC debt or student loans. 

Car Insurance = $200 a month

Cell Phone = $100 a month

Rent = $0 (Living at my moms house)

 We have been budgeting since january, and essentially live off her salary and bank all of mine. Last month we saved 2k. 

We have a combined 30k in the bank, which falls short of the 40k deposit for 20% of 200,000 but my mom is ill, and  I will be getting an inheritance of 30k in the next few months. My sister will be taking over the house I currently live in and pay me and my other sister off. I should get around 150k from that. So to break it down : 

30k in savings currently + 30k in inheritance in a few months + 150k for being bought out of current house(estimate) = 210k. 

Now I dont love the idea of paying so much towards interest on a mortgage so I essentially want to pay it all off when I get my full inheritance. That way we'd have a house, be mortgage free by 30 and just have to pay the taxes and upkeep. 

I would wait to move out of my current house until I get all of my inheritance, but once my mom goes, it will be me, my wife and my sister living in the house which we cannot do as my sister is a passive-aggressive mean person who is slowly chipping away our sanity. If it weren't for my mom, we'd have moved out long ago.

 When I get my initial 30k inheritance I will have 60k. I will put down 40k for 20% and take out a mortgage for the rest. I will pay off my mortgage as normal monthly, but once the rest of my inheritance (150kish) comes, (not sure when exactly) i'd like to put all of it towards the mortgage. Now my question is would my house be paid off or am I going to have to factor in interest, even if I pay it off in the first year? Am I paying the same interest as if I paid it off in 30 years or only the interest for that one year? My only other scenario would be move in with my wifes parents until all of the money comes through and then buy the house outright, but I am not sure on how much the would save us exactly.",finance,1468004465

personalfinance,I have four different student loans. How do I determine how paying the principal of each will affect my monthly payment? (Massachusetts),"Hi all,

I'm about 14 months out of school, and have more or less just accepted my student loan payments rather than spent too much time identifying the best strategies to improve my situation. Now that I need to purchase a car, I figure it's time I change that. My question is where it would be most wise to allocate my savings over the next couple years, given current savings of about $16,000 and monthly surplus after all bills/401k of about $500. I have four separate federal loans from each year of school, all fixed rate:

1) $5,500 @ 6.55%
2) $6,500 @ 6.55%
3) $7,500 @ 3.61%
4) $7,500 @ 4.41%

I assume it is normal that my monthly payment of  $339.41 is evenly distributed among the four. I am going to be looking to spend about $15,000-$20,000 on a car in the next few months. I am unsure how much to put down on it (with about a 3% loan). I know that there are tax breaks that come with student loans, so I didn't know if that should come into consideration either.

All of that said, my question is how to prioritize. Given the situation, is the money best allocated to a car loan, savings, or a particular student loan?

The plan was to keep renting the house I am in which is amazing (3,500 sq. ft., a garage, and lots of land) @ $1,200/month for a couple more years until I have enough money for a large down payment towards building a house that will cost around $250k.

personalfinance,Entering a period of volunteerism -Financial Hardship and Student Loans,"Hey PF,

22 year old graduated college in 2014. I have fairly significant debt in both federal and private loans ~60-70k. Everything was going relatively well until the past few weeks when the reality of not getting in to school hit, and I realized I needed to revamp my med school app for next cycle. I had previously been living with my girlfriend, working full time in retail, and supporting myself.

Long story short, I just moved back with my parents, and I will be starting a summer internship at a prestigious hospital in my state. This will be 4 days per week full time. On 2 of the remaining days I will be working at the shop I was in for the past year. It'll be 22-23 hours each week, I'll be taking home about $220.00 per week for the next 2-3 months. =880/ month

My monthly commutes will be expensive. My train fare will cost 275 + subway fare 80+ bus to and from my weekend job +150=505

On top of that I pay $380 in **private** student loans per month. 

I won't have much in the way of food expenses, but I also have $500 in credit card debt that I would like to have off of my shoulders. In June I bought a laptop to replace one that had died in January. I would initially call this a stupid purchase, but I've become way more productive, and it gave me a means to communicate with jobs/volunteer offers, and doctors for shadowing, which has been invaluable so far.

My main concern right now is my student loan payments. I'm not sure if I have any options or what the outcome would be if I were to take them. I am unsure if I qualify for deferment, forbearance, hardship, etc, but I am also unsure if I should utilize these options if they are available.

Any advice in my current position? I know I could get by for the summer with the above plan if not for the student loan payments, and I already know that I won't have any real chance of making a real dent in them until after professional school, but I also don't want to screw myself over for the next two years by making a dumb decision right now.

In the fall I will be looking for more relevant work and taking one college course in order to fulfill an newly instated pre-req. 

I know I need to live cheaply for the next 2 years, but I just need a financial plan that will keep my head above water.

p.s. I will be getting about $800 or so from a co-worker who wants to buy a bike and accessories that I own. Any advice how this money should be spent would be appreciated

A few things to note: 

Fill out anything in the blue cells.

The tax rates are federal tax rates. We are in WA State and have no state income tax, so that might make it inaccurate for someone in another state using it.

This is a household consisting of a set of parents and a 1.5 year old. The two adults get paid every two weeks, the 1.5 year old is currently between jobs.

I do not know how to accurately calculate ""F8"" which are withholdings for social security, medicare, and L&amp;I, so I just found the percent being pulled from my paycheck. Maybe a rocket scientist knows how to make this accurate for anyone using it?

My employer contributes 3% of my salary to my 401k regardless of whether I contribute. It would be pretty easy to change the formula for a matching situation.

Our food, gas, and diapers/baby stuffs are too varied every month to account for on this sheet (currently), but by taking the amount in ""F27"" I know how much we can spend every two weeks on it. This is where the critiques will hopefully come in to better this sheet.

personalfinance,Random money received from stranger - Chase Quick Pay,"My sister just received a random deposit of $400.00 to her eMail via Chase Banking's ""Quick Pay"". She doesn't even bank with Chase. She went to the bank to see if it was real and they said the money is there and they don't know where it came from but she can open an account in her name and withdraw it, so she did then closed the account. 

I'm weary because in the past I got a check in the mail for a few thousand dollars and took it to the bank and it was a legit check that I can deposit but the banker warned me of its' origins and somehow or another we found the terms on the sender's site that if I cash it I'm agreeing to enter into a contract where it was considered a loan and had a massive interest rate that I had to pay back. The mail I got however was very differently worded and made it sound like I had just won some free sweepstakes and could cash the check for money and never think about it again—very disturbing scam. 

Because of all of that I'm now worried for my sister that she maybe shouldn't have opened the account, taken the $400, then closed the account.

Hello! My significant other owes about 19k on a credit card. We recently took a financial hit and make a lot less. We're moving in an apartment that is about $600 less a month then we pay currently so pretty soon we'll have that available to put towards the bill. 

Everything we have currently pay on is necessary to survival(car payment, phone service, food, apartment) and we just plain don't have the funding to allot to the credit card until we move. I don't have debt and his credit card debt happened before we started seeing each other. 

My question is how to negotiate with the credit company(navy fed) that will make them happy and avoid taking food out of my mouth?

personalfinance,"Good retirement, but I want to do more.","Hi /r/personalfinance
Reddit stripped my editing so I did what I could to make it readable. Sorry.

I’m 29, No debt, I do have an emergency fund.

Okay, so I have a defined benefit retirement plan through my new employer and I plan to spend my career years here. I also have access to a deferred retirement option plan, and a 457b. Overall my retirement is very good if I just make use of the pension and drop, however I want to go above and beyond and I’d like some input for deciding on a course of action. Should I get an IRA and should I make use of the 457b? I think I want to do those things but not sure if I’m trying to do too much.
 
My final average salary is calculated over my highest paid 36 consecutive months over my career. My pension plan works out to the following 5 options. 

The retirement takes effect at age 50 if I elect to retire with a changing benefit for every additional year of service up to 55. My final average salary is calculated over my highest paid 36 consecutive months over my career. Currently my salary is 6607 a month. 

Age 50 2% X Final Average Salary (6607) X Years of Service (21) = $2774.94
Age 51 2.14% X $6607 X 22 = $3110.58
Age 52 2.28% X $6607 X 23 = $3464.71
Age 53 2.42% X $6607 X 24 = $3837.35
Age 54 2.56% X $6607 X 25 = $4228.48
Age 55+ 2.7% X $6607 X 26 = $4638.11

Currently my salary is 6607 a month. With a maximum benefit of 75% FAS.I get a 2% cola raise to my benefits annually.

The way our DROP program works is starting at age 50 and afterwards I can retire and receive my retirement payouts to a drop account managed by my company while I continue to work and earn a paycheck. Our current interest rate on the account is %11.3 which is calculated yearly and they have a second interest rate that is calculated every 3 years that’s currently %7.5 and going down to %7.25 next month. I don’t fully understand the two different interest rates on the drop account so if anyone could explain I’d appreciate it. 
I’m also able to sell back all of my unused sick leave but It’s complicated and I’m not sure if it’s necessary to include. 

My plan was to contribute an additional 15% from my gross monthly salary and to use that to max an IRA through Vanguard and throw any additional funds over the IRA cap into the 457b. Does this sound like a solid plan, or should I focus elsewhere? The 457b is through fidelity and we have 30 index funds to choose from but I haven’t been able to see them yet still waiting on enrollment and paperwork stuff. I also believe I have access to a roth457b not sure about that though. 

Okay I hope that covers it, I think I got the pertinents in there, please any advice will be read and appreciated.",finance,1468026122

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinancing Questions,"I have been looking into refinancing our 30 year fixed mortgage to a 15 year fixed rate while also pulling out some money to pay off credit card debt. This is driven by the lower interest rates and the fact that the Denver market has shot our house value way up.

&amp;nbsp;

We already refinanced once in March of 2013 to get a lower interest rate


Currently we have:

*Principal Balance of $144,000

*Fixed interest rate 3.5%

*Principal Interest Payment of $704

*Total Monthly Payment of $1075

&amp;nbsp;

The new 15 year Mortgage (According to the lending agent) would be:

*Principal Balance of ~~$159,000~~ $157,000 ($10,000 to pay off credit card debt of about $4,300 with 11.99% interest rate and a car loan of about $6,500 with an interest rate of 4%, the other ~~$5,000~~ $3,000 would be to pay off closing costs and fees associated with refinancing.)

*Fixed interest rate ~~3.25%~~ 2.75%

*Principal Interest Payment of ~~$692~~ $1,068.83

*Total Monthly Payment of ~~$938~~ $1,315

&amp;nbsp;

~~First, I don't understand how our monthly payment would be lower with the 15 year mortgage, and I think that the Total Monthly Payment would actually only be about $12 lower not $137 as our Insurance and Tax payments won't change.~~ This makes a bit more since now, having to increase our monthly payment by $300 - $400 in order to go the the 15 year loan.

&amp;nbsp;

Second, is it a good idea to get the cash out with the refinance to pay off our other debts? I don't understand the nuances of how the different types of interest work and I am afraid that we would be paying much more with the mortgage interest on the $10,000 then we would if we continue to pay the debts down. (We should have the credit card payed down by Feb. of 2017 and the car payed off in July of 2017 if we just continue to make payments.)

&amp;nbsp;

Another option is to refinance the house to a 15 year mortgage without taking the extra money out, and possibly having a slightly higher interest rate of about ~~3.375%~~ 2.875% (we would still need to roll about $4,000 of fees and closing costs into the loan.) This would also slow down our re-payment of the credit card and car loan a little as we would have to re-allocate some money from debt payment to the mortgage payment.

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for any insight you may have. I am tired of making decisions without being able to make sense of everything only to find out that we are getting screwed in some way.

EDIT: We got a new quote for a 15 year mortgage instead of a 30 year mortgage, so I fixed the numbers.",finance,1468048947
personalfinance,College Choice Advice,"Last year, I completed my first year of college. I come from a family with very little money, and I chose a university that is well above what we should be able to afford. That is mostly because of a scholarship I earned, plus federal aid. However, with classes coming back soon, I am questioning whether or not I should continue there. I had to take ~10k in federal loans last year, and it will end up being the same each year, roughly. Here's the kicker. I want a major change. I'm not entirely happy with what I'm choosing to do. So, I've been considering going to a junior college, that I could basically go to free for two year. Basically, just starting over, but still having some college credit transfer. Would it pay off to go to junior college for two years, then transfer to a four year, or should I stay at the four year, and finish there? 

Note: I believe I can still graduate in 4 years, even with the major change, at the four year University. However, the debt scares me. Although, I'm assuming that I'll have to take out loans once I reach the point to transfer anyway.

Edit: I am currently enrolled  at a small private University, majoring in secondary education. What I wish to change to is Sociology, with the plan to enter law enforcement after graduation, aiming for a federal agency after I gain the LE experience. 

Also, out of pocket cost at the private University is very little, with the loans, federal aid, etc. The out of pocket at the junior college would be virtually nothing.",finance,1468049574

Last month I opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard and contributed the federal maximum of $5500 to the account.

btc,Venmo is better than Bitcoin,"So I just discovered the very popular Venmo app last night (I know, I'm a bit late here!), and Venmo is everything that I had hoped Bitcoin would be as a payment network. Now I know why nearly 100% of my friends use Venmo:

- Instantaneous peer-to-peer money transfers with zero delay. Once you receive money in your wallet (which is instantly), you can instantly send from your wallet to someone else.
- Zero ability to reverse or cancel any payments that you make. All payments are final. Just like paying cash.
- Zero transaction fees to send or receive. 100% free. 
- Can be unbanked: No need to have a bank account.
- Private: No need for any identification.
- OPTIONAL: Can link a bank account or credit card, if you would like. Bank accounts can be used for sending or receiving. Credit cards can be used for sending only. Credit card transactions charge a 3% fee to the sender.
- Extra bonus: It has a huge social networking element built into it (which is totally optional on a per-transaction basis), which makes it super fun to use &amp; hilarious to see what your friends are doing! All dollar amounts are hidden, but comments are visible + you can join discussions + like comments.

The only major downside at the moment:

- According to the app, it only works in the United States. (Not sure if this is enforced by IP address, or if it can be worked around by using a VPN).

For Bitcoin to compete with something as amazing as Venmo, Bitcoin has to be BETTER than everything Venmo offers to its users. But sadly, it doesn't even come close. 

Outside of international payments, I really don't see why any American would ever consider using Bitcoin over Venmo for payments.

Sure, you could say that Venmo uses an inflationary currency printed out of thin air by the Federal Reserve, but I think we all know by now that the vast majority of Americans don't understand nor actively care about that.",cryptocurrency,1468069439

* I owe 7k on a 3.4% interest rate car loan for my 2010 car, which is my only outstanding debt. The payment is $163 a month, which is easily manageable for me.
* I contribute 5% to my company matched 401k which is invested in the Vanguard 2055 index fund.
* I have three month's living expenses in a internet savings. account


I feel like the questions I have are kind of stupid, but I can't seem to find the answers. My goal this year was to put $5,500 into a roth IRA (because that's the best way to avoid taxes on my investments to my knowledge) and invest that $5,500 into some low cost Vanguard ETFs as a starting point for my investing adventure. That roth IRA was going to be where I kept putting 5,500 a year for investing until eventually I can't deposit money in the IRA because my income is too high. (A guy can dream) 

I opened a Vanguard account for investing today and deposited 1k, with the intent to purchase shares in the Healthcare ETF (VHT). My plan was to deposit 1k each month from the $5,500 I had set aside this year and to purchase shares of a different ETF/Index fund each month.

My question is, when I deposited 1k into Vanguard, it put it into a Brokerage Account, but it never gave me the option to specify I want a roth IRA. The only things that show up are my Brokerage Account, something called Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement fund) and in another section, my Employer Sponsored 401k. 

I want to make all of my investments from a roth IRA account to save on taxes, right? What exactly am I doing wrong?

I put it on the highest interest loans I had.  Calculating the average interest rate of my current loans, it's about 4.3%.  

Budgeting on Mint, I've calculated that I can save about $2500 outside of my budget.  

The question I have is how much should I hammer down my debt?  At the moment, I contribute 7% of my paycheck to a 401k.  Since I'm new at my company, I don't get their employee match for six months, so it's not as if I can take advantage of that right now.

Additionally, I don't have an emergency fund saved up yet, but that should accumulate soon.  

The only concrete thing I have in mind is to put the 3k net bonus I receive soon all on my debt, making the balance ~21k.  From there...how much should I pay off?  

I should note that I'm not expressly saving for a house and just plan on renting once I'm out of the free corporate housing I'm in (which lasts 4.5 more months).  As for a car, I have no payment, but it is an '07 with 130k miles on it, so it's reasonable to think that getting another car isn't far off.

personalfinance,Making a drastic life change - putting education first,"Hey /R/ Personalfinance. Past two years I've been working full-time and doing school on the side/when I can. I've been at a community college and should already have an associates, but my work has really impeded my ability to get school work done and become more educated. I have a minor learning disability and juggling the two isn’t working for me.

&amp;nbsp;

Put my two weeks in at my full-time job, can’t really do this and focus on school work. I work at a cellphone store that pays $10 an hour plus commission, I’ll be substituting my income with a part-time waiting gig on the weekends for some spending money and to lessen the amount of savings I will have to pull from on a weekly basis.

&amp;nbsp;

 I run a club at my school and intend on investing my extra time on developing that and becoming a more competitive candidate for scholarships and some ivy league schools (Will most likely stick to a cheaper state school but, would like to see if I can get in). Next fiscal year I will 24 and be able to apply for FAFSA independently without my parent’s income. With my financial plan I figure the less income I have this year (23), the more FINAID I will have which in theory should broaden my options for schools and hypothetically lower my overall loans.

&amp;nbsp;

Little bit about my financial situation and goals for the upcoming school year:

&amp;nbsp;

Income: 

&amp;nbsp;

$150-$200 a week waiting tables

&amp;nbsp;

$0-100 trading options/swing trading (Investment club)

&amp;nbsp;

Also receive $160 monthly for a lawsuit 

&amp;nbsp;

Total: $460

&amp;nbsp;

Expenses:

&amp;nbsp;

Rent: $500

&amp;nbsp;

Car Payment: $220

&amp;nbsp;

Cell phone: $45

&amp;nbsp;

Food: $150

&amp;nbsp;

Going out: $200 (Will be as frugal as possible but also trying to make new friends and enjoy myself a bit.)

&amp;nbsp;

Student loan payment: $120

&amp;nbsp;

 Total: $1235

Net loss ($775)

Debt: $4500 student loans so far

$1100 on citi card, which is from paying for a summer class.

&amp;nbsp;

Savings: $5500
Tax return: $3200

&amp;nbsp;

Couple side notes:

&amp;nbsp;

-This will be for 8 months during school, then I’ll live back at home temporarily until the following school year.

&amp;nbsp;

-	Also have a 0% APR citi card, promo rate is good until 2/18, plan on using this when needed.

&amp;nbsp;

-	Thinking about taking a small loan or personal loan from a family member if needed for the school year… Don’t really think I need to but if the interest rate on the loan is decent, I would do that and keep more cash on hand rather than depleting all my savings at the moment.

&amp;nbsp;

So /R/ personalfinance, how does my plan sound? A main reason for this change is my quality of life sucks from no time between the two, the opportunity cost of killing myself to not go into debt doesn’t seem worth it. My relationships have suffered from overextending myself via full time work and school. Trying to piece together a social life before I get older and it becomes more difficult to establish friend groups.

personalfinance,Better to pay more state taxes,"This is for California. For simplicity, ignore underpayment penalty and interest free loan from and to the government by paying too little or too much tax.

At the end of the year, you will owe a certain amount of state income tax. It does not matter how much tax you've paid throughout the year. If you owe 5,000, and paid $6,000, you will get back $1,000. If you only paid $4,000, you will owe $1,000.

Here's where it gets dicey. You can deduct state income tax on your federal tax return. So you might as well ""maximize"" what you pay state income tax, and get that federal deduction. You then get back what you overpaid on state income tax.

I am definitely missing something here otherwise everybody would be doing this?",finance,1468090677
personalfinance,continuing to get collections letter without receiving debt verification,"Hey guys. Thank you for taking the time to read my post!

In early June I received a collections letter that I thought was not actually for me. The letter was pretty vague, but it referred to bankers insurance (which I have never purchased/used that company) for property damage (never knowingly broke anyone else's things). The original debt is from about 4 months post spine surgery. The tail end of the letter reads something about failure to pay may result in inability to renew drivers lic. or register a car.

To me, this implies some kind of moving violation. 4 months post op, I could barely stand for more than a few minutes, never mind drive a freaking car!

Well, I used a template letter from, I think nolo.com, to request debt verification/dispute that the debt was even mine. As per the templates suggestion I told them to not contact me further either in writing or via the phone, nor can they contact any third parties, such as family members, significant others, place of work, place of business ect. other than to provide verification of the debt. I sent this letter certified and got the slip back in less than a week that they received my letter and someone in the office signed for it. I gave them 3 weeks or a little more to provide verification. Letter suggested two weeks, but I gave an arbitrary date of July 15 to provide me with details of my supposed debt.

Today, I received another collections letter dated July 2, but NO verification! This is both against the fair debt collections act and against my very explicit directions.

What actions can/should I take?

I can included my letter to them to you (with key info blocked, like my name) if you would like to see it.

Thank you for your time and experience.

EDIT: Here is the letter I sent, which included a copy of their original debt collection attempt. I don't have that on my computer though (edited formatting to make letter easier to read. it didn't copy right the first time. broke up the wall o text)

On June 1, 2016 I received a written notice of the claimed debt, a copy of which is attached.
This is to inform you that I dispute the debt because it appears to be a moving violation, and I haven’t driven a car in two years.. I am hereby requesting that you confirm the fact that I owe this debt as required by any applicable state and federal laws. Please contact the creditor to obtain verification.

In addition, under the provisions of state and federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and related consumer statutes, I am hereby instructing you that you are to cease collection of the debt while efforts are made to obtain verification. Until you resolve this error with the creditor, you should neither contact me nor anyone else except the creditor about this collection

Furthermore, any reporting of this matter to a credit reporting agency is premature. Until you have investigated my dispute, you should not relay negative information to a credit reporting agency. If negative information has already been reported, you will need to notify the agency to remove said report until the investigative process is over so that my credit report remains accurate, or at the very least, my credit report should be updated to reflect my dispute.
Your next contact with me should be either notice that the creditor has failed to provide verification of the debt and that the matter has been closed or that you believe that this debt is valid and are providing proof of my responsibility. If the former, please confirm that I am not being held responsible for the debt in writing and also that if the account has already been noted on my credit report, that you will contact the bureau(s) in question to have the account removed. If the latter, I expect that you will provide me with an explanation as to why you have decided not to remove this account from collections and a copy of all documents relevant to the debt such as the application, bills, records of communications and payments, and any other data that indicates my responsibility

I am instructing you not to contact any third parties such as my employer, neighbors, friends or family members. In addition, you may not contact me by phone at work or at my home about this collection activity. All future correspondence should be sent to me in writing.

I look forward to your acknowledgement that you have received this notice by July 15, 2016.

Question 1)  If I have an extra $100 per month that I can apply towards these two big credit card balances, how should I be allocating those funds with the goal of paying everything off in the quickest fashion.

personalfinance,Need a sanity check: Evaluating in-state (MD) vs. out-of-state 529 plans,"I'm finally getting around to setting up 529 accounts for our two boys, and all of the ""conventional wisdom"" I've read recommends that if your state allows a tax deduction for 529 contributions it's generally best to use that. Maryland does allow married couples to deduct up to $5000 per beneficiary, meaning we'd be eligible for a $10K deduction per year. Based on that we've been planning on starting one account with $35K and the other with $25K and adding $5000 per year to each after that. (Well, technically half those amounts in accounts owned by each of us, since we'd each have to open separate accounts for both boys to take the deductions.)

The thing is that when I start crunching the numbers it really doesn't look like the tax deduction is worth it in the long run when you factor in the fees and expenses on the funds that Maryland's plan has available. I've been looking at this stuff for so long that I could really use some fresh eyes to see if what I'm figuring makes sense, or if there's something somewhere that I'm overlooking.

Our household income puts us in the 4.75% bracket for Maryland, meaning that $10K deduction would save us $475 a year on our state taxes, but we'd end up having to pay 25% (our current federal marginal rate) of that back in federal taxes the following year, for a total net benefit of $356 per year.

Where things go sideways is looking at [the fees and expenses on the funds available in the Maryland plan](http://i.imgur.com/mKE6FYj.png). Their date-based funds that I might use carry 0.80% annual fees. And I wouldn't be able to come out much further ahead rolling my own portfolios out of the choices available there.

When I compare that to something like [New York's plan](https://www.nysaves.org/) with equivalent Vanguard funds at 0.16% or [New Hampshire's plan](https://www.fidelity.com/new-hampshire-529/) with Fidelity funds between 0.12% - 0.17% I'm ending up with something like a $12K-$15K savings from the lower cost options over the remaining time we'd be building up their accounts.

Before we go into the details, I am not having any troubles making any payments. This only serves the purpose of money saving here:
I have 32300 dollars in student loan. Average interest rate is 5.45% Out of the 32300, about 5000 dollars is 2.4% interest rate.

I am buying a home, say 470k. I can either:

1. Put down 53k. and take out of a loan for 417k (this is not an coincident, 417 is the most I can take out with a low interest rate) with a interest rate of 3.25% or
2. Put down 23500 (5% min requirement) and pay off the student loan. However, the loan for the home would be  446500 with an interest rate of 3.5% (not 3.25%)

personalfinance,Financial Planning for Graduate School - Looking for Advice,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm looking for some advice on how to go about financing a graduate program I got accepted in. I'll provide all info I think might help, if anything further is needed I'm happy to provide it.


I accepted the offer to enroll in an evening MBA program starting in Fall 2016 after researching what graduate programs would be beneficial for further career advancement and with hopes increase my income (I work in corporate finance).


My seeking advice has to do with financing the program, with the biggest question around whether to accept the federal loans I've been offered through the FAFSA. To somewhat simplify numbers, I'll do some rounding.


Some basic info about me:

- Cash: $14k
- Debt: $9k federal student loans from undergrad

- Gross annual income: $61k
- Contributing 5% to 401k to get the company match
- Net take-home monthly pay: ~$3,600k
- Monthly expenses: ~$2,400k

The full 3-year program cost is $78k, so $26k annually (I added a little onto this number to account for misc. costs like books and such).

Below are my current resources for the program:

- $9k saved up specifically for school (I'll have $5k as an emergency fund)
- $8k annual tuition reimbursement from work, so $24k for the total full program duration
- $1k of my monthly net take-home pay can be saved for school after the program starts. Providing my job stays intact, this would yield $12k annually.
- Assuming my gross annual income stays below $80k over the next three years, I can claim the American Opportunity Tax Credit for $2.5k annually.


These resources just about cover it, I could make up the difference with additional savings beyond the monthly $1k and potential bonuses earned.


For the first school year I was offered $18k of Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. I'm hesitant to accept it because I still have $9k loans left from undergrad that I don't want to stack on to. On the other hand, this way should anything happen to my job it won't interfere with school and I can continue on with the program.

So basically my financing plan comes down to these options:

Option 1: don't take out loans, finance through the resources listed but with the risk that this is very dependent on job security.

Option 2: take out the federal loan offered, but continue saving as I would in Option 1 as long as I continue working at my current job. If I go with this option I'm considering also using the $9k school savings to pay off the undergrad loans to start with a 'clean slate'.

Of course, option 3 is to not do the program at all :) However I already signed and accepted the offer to enroll, and this is my most opportune time to do the program. I think I can pull it off but it'd be nice to hear what others think.

So my question is - which option would you recommend?

Again - please let me know what additional information would help you give advice.

Thanks in advance for the help!",finance,1468110366

personalfinance,Help figuring out how to pay for my last year of school.,"I have one year left of school to pay for before I graduate. I go to a fairly expensive university and so after financial aid (~$33000) and money I am making this summer from an internship (~$10000 after taxes) I need to come up with about $15000 for the year. All of this money just pays for housing, tuition, and other small fees that the university tacks on. I am doing nothing extravagant like getting a meal plan to jack up the price of attendance. Through my first three years I have taken out the maximum in Federal unsubsidized loans and will be doing the same this year, resulting is around $31000 in federal loan debt total upon graduation.

My parents have helped me pay for my education up to this point but are going through a divorce. They both expect the other to pay, resulting in grid lock with any money that is available, and outright refuse to cosign a loan. The latter of which is especially frustrating as I have approached them numerous times completely willing to take out a private loan for my Senior year but have been shot down every time. Their refusal is not because of me but because they feel it would be too damaging to them if say they need to take out a new mortgage in a years time.

I can sit here an hope that they come to some agreement with a small amount of money that was earmarked for education before the divorce, but this divorce has been going on for 15 months now so a positive resolution to their situation seems unlikely. Coming to an agreement to aid myself, and a sister who is also in college, last year was a terrible experience. So I am trying to prepare for the worst and determine my options.

As I see it I can talk to my grandparents who will most likely be willing to help cosign a private loan. But it would be very difficult to uphold some unrealistic goal of fairness between both sides of my family. I however do not want to have this conversation with them until absolutely necessary as I feel bad having to resort to their aid.

I have been applying to private scholarships but I see that as an unlikely means of paying for all of school, maybe it can reduce the ~$15000 I need by a bit.

The other option I have considered is trying to take out a loan on my own. They last thing I am worried about it my ability to pay off my debt once I graduate as I have never had a problem finding employment in my field in the past and will likely have a job lined up before my senior year even begins. I have over a year of credit built up in my own name, I have always payed off my credit card balance in full and on time. I work a part time job during the year but it is minimum wage and only results in a few hundred dollars a month, it is enough for food and other minor conveniences. I do not have any significant assents in my own name, nor any built up savings as 100% of the money I have made every summer has gone right to school. Is there any chance I can take out a loan on my own?

personalfinance,Long time lurker requesting advice on how to pay for college. Unique circumstances involved.,"Hi PF, I've got a unique situation with a lot of moving parts and some unfortunate circumstances. Please bear with me.

Background: I got into my dream school (University of Southern California) after appealing my rejection letter. I am attending Marshall School of Business this fall which is one of the highest rated and most prestigious business programs in the United States and around the world. I'm not sure where I want to work in the future but I'm thinking investment banking or starting my own business. A degree from Marshall would pretty much guarantee me a job anywhere I want. The only problem is, of course, paying for the exorbitant cost ($70,000/year). This is where it gets tricky.

My mom works at a university on the east coast and there’s this great program called tuition exchange. It’s a scholarship that’s offered and I was able to secure 80% of USC’s tuition (41K) every year for 4 years as long as I maintain a 3.0 GPA. This brings the total bill down to 29K/year. I also was able to secure a 1K scholarship from my high school which I think is awarded every year as long as I reapply (I’ll check). This is all separate from financial aid. My real cost so far: 28K.

This is the really sticky situation: I cannot apply for financial aid because my father refuses to fill out the Non-Custodial Parent form. My parents are divorced and my dad hates my mom and thinks that by not filling out the form, it will screw her over (which it will). I’ve pleaded and cried to him to submit the information but he said he’ll never do it. Considering FA would completely cover the rest of my costs for college, I’ve looked at ways to get around my dad. You can appeal the Non-Custodial Parent Form which is what I tried to do… twice. Unfortunately this failed. When I called to ask why, the financial aid officer said they only waive the form if I haven’t been in contact with my father for years. At the time I applied, my dad drove up from NJ to PA every week to see me and my sister. After that, this May, I asked him one more time to submit the form and when he said no, I cut contact. I have not seen him or sent any emails to my dad (although he has sent a few to me) in hopes that I can apply for FA later this year, next year, or the year after. My real cost so far: still 28K.

My mom is really great and is doing her best. She doesn’t have any college saving though because she was banking on the tuition exchange. She told me she is willing to take out 15K from her retirement every year for my education. My real cost so far: 13K.

I applied for and will receive 5.5K in unsubsidized federal student loans this year and at least that every year after. My real cost so far: 7.5K.

Lastly, my mother’s family said they would help but it doesn’t look like that’s going to happen. My aunt is supposed to be running her own golf tournament but the contracts haven’t been signed and her tournament might fall through. She was planning to give 10K per year. In exchange I would work for her this Christmas and next summer. My grandma said she would contribute but she gave the money to my aunt because she needed it for a real estate investment (which failed). My real cost so far: probably still 7.5K

I will have 5.5K saved by the time school rolls around so that brings me to 2K. I think I’ll take a small private loan for this if I end up needing to.

Here’s my plan: 
Apply for Financial Aid ASAP which would cover everything.
If that fails, apply to be a residential adviser sophomore year so room and board will be free (15K) every year for the next 3 years.
If that fails, I am willing to take on private debt but I REALLY don’t want to.

In regards to financial aid, my questions are: Would my dad’s email jeopardize FA in the future? When should I ask to reapply for FA? And do you think I’ll ever be awarded FA?

In regards to my mom: What is her best course of action to help pay for my college without going broke?

Is there anything else I can do to pay for college?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Adding info for context. My mom has an apartment in NYC worth 600-800K with 140K left on the mortgage. It's currently being rented to provide another source of income for our family. My mom plans to live in that house when she retires. She also has another house worth ~255K with 200K on the mortgage. In addition, she told me she has ~200K in retirement. If she had a small retirement and/or no equity, I wouldn't even consider taking my mom's money but she said she can handle it. In your opinion, can she?

Edit 2: Also it was my mom who suggested pulling money from her retirement.

Edit 3: I have decided to go to Northeastern. I committed there this spring because that was the university I chose before my USC appeal was accepted. I took a step back and realized Northeastern would be more fun for me because there more flexible and I'd have more spending money. After realizing it, I think I was just hyped up about going to USC and after I got out of that mindset I have chosen Northeastern. I feel good about my decision and so does my mom. Thanks for everything guys! I don't think I would have ""woken up"" if you didn't shake me into reality. Thanks again!",finance,1468130163
personalfinance,Help me choose between continuing degree at UCLA or transferring to local CC or Cal Poly Pomona.,"Hello r/personalfinance, I'm soon to begin my second year at UCLA. I'm currently enrolled as a Chemical Engineering major, but plan on switching to Geography with a concentration in Geospatial Information Systems. I would switch to Computer Science, but I would essentially have to graduate in five years and don't want to pay the costs of an additional year to go through the freshman CS series courses. I recently received my financial aid notice and noticed I only received about $6200 in grants for the year down from $14k in 2015/16. My family's income decreased from $70k to $50k between 2014/15 and 2015/16. My parents own their own business and their expenses increased for the year. When my financial aid office noticed the difference in income on my fafsa they placed a hold which required a few weeks to get the additional forms and numbers to be resubmitted. I believe as a result I received no federal grants/scholarships and only received UCLA's additional grant for lower-middle class income families due to the postponement despite my on-time submitted fafsa estimates. Essentially my costs from UCLA came to about $16k for the 2015/16 year and have increased to $22k for the 2016/17 year. My parents are willing to pay for the increased costs, but I'd rather they not shell out $40k for essentially my first two years and possibly another $40k for my last two years. They are in a financial position to do so (already have their two houses paid off and expect to retire once I graduate and set-up a small shop for their business). My other alternative is to transfer to a local CC for about $3k for two years to finish off GEs and CS courses and transfer to Cal Poly Pomona for a Computer Science degree which would take an additional two years (possibly 3 due to impacted major) while I commute from home. While I could benefit more from the opportunities, internships, networking, and prestige of UCLA I'm unsure of whether it's worth the financial cost this would have on my parents. Saying this, I realize I'm very blessed to have my parents willing to cover my higher educational costs and if my parents weren't willing to cover costs I would've chosen the no debt CC/CSU route. I greatly appreciate any advice from this community.",finance,1468139824

personalfinance,"Going to college, seeking private student loans but having trouble","Hi! I'm attending college out-of-state full-time this fall as an incoming freshman working towards a bachelors in computer science. I have good credit ( 750+ ) with about three to four years of credit history. My parents have very bad credit and no savings, and therefore I'm looking for lenders who will work with me even though I have no co-signer. I'll also be working part-time while attending ( interviews lined up but no job offer yet ) and will be receiving federal aid.

However I'm having trouble finding any info on how to locate lenders that would fit the bill for me. Most require co-signers with good credit or require that I already be attending college and receiving good grades. Given how I don't have the former and I can't do the latter until I get enter and get past my first semester, I'm not sure where to go. 

I did my best the last couple of years to save what I could and build my credit up, but I didn't realize how hard it would be to find private college loans without having a co-signer that has good credit that's also friendly towards incoming freshmen.

Any advice for someone in my situation?

**edit #1:** Well I just found a lender that doesn't require a co-signer with good credit or for me to have already gone through a semester, but they require me to be earning at least $15k per year while attending and I wasn't even making that full-time with some of the jobs I've worked. At this point I might just have to talk to my school and maybe get swapped from full-time student to part-time so I can work full-time and qualify for private loans. Not sure if that's an option but if so it might just be my only option.",finance,1468161760

personalfinance,Baby on the way... How the hell do you all do it?!,"Long story short, my wife is due in a few weeks.  I have even financially smart my entire life and I have managed to get my wife and I credit card free as of June.  We have no other debts, except for car and mortgage.

I have GROSSLY underestimated additional costs for additional +1 to medical insurance AND child care costs...

We earn a combined 80k annually, but even with no other debts, it seems impossible to meet monthly finances.

How the hell does anyone pull this off?!

Edit: To give a better scope... My wife and I never go out for dinner. We might get a delivery pizza once a week, which I know will be sacrificed, which is OK.  We don't drink, so the bar tab never existed, so 'cutting' on that expense is not a thing for us.

In my area, average child care costs are $150 per week.  I don't have family that can help out with watching the baby, so it's just up to us.

Further, we are both teachers, so 'putting in more hours' isn't a viable option.

Edit 2:  Monthly expenses are as follows (rough estimates)

1,150 Mortgage (impound acct included)
400 Car
400 Food/Toiletries
225 Cell Phones
120 Cable/Internet
100 Gas
150 Pet Food
350 Past Loan to Family

As for income, 80k gross.  Teaching in Arizona, so we pay 11.3% into Arizona Retirement System.  Another 10-15% goes to State/Federal Tax, Then Social Security etc etc.


Edit 3:  I appreciate all the feedback.  There is a lot of great advice here that I'm going to look over.  Looks like Lots of cuts over several different aspects of our income will be the solution.  I was hoping there was another way to be able to build an emergency/savings account while still paying into childcare, but it looks like that's off the table for the next few years.

I also currently live with my parents and have no other outstanding debts.

Do I take my parents' offer and pay them back over time or decline their offer and just stick with a repayment plan?

For an example pay period, my gross pay would be $2,400, with $240 withheld before taxes for 401k, and I would take home $1,532.36. So for 80 hours, I was taking home about $19.15 an hour. If you add in the 401k to the $1,532.36 and ignore the complications it causes by being before tax, that put me at about $22.15 ($1,770 / 80) an hour after Fed, Social Sec, Medicare, OH tax, Columbus Tax. So I'm getting a ~26% tax rate overall.

Anyways, $19.15 x 2080 = $3,319 / month which is what I was budgeting at. 

So I've been interviewing, and a few places are offering more, a few less, some salaried, some hourly. I'm trying to figure out how much is too little so I either try to bargain for more if I get an offer or just ignore them if they won't go high enough, but I am not entirely sure how to do the math since taking out money into a 401k before taxes kind of makes the math harder to do. 

Are there any good online calculators? I live in Upper Arlington/Columbus Ohio if that makes any difference in which tax calculator is good for me.

I'd like to know what the proper way is to address some rising concerns with my new employer, firstly that I am using my personal vehicle as a means to deliver company goods to our postal carrier (the local post office). Secondly that we are understaffed and my employer keeps turning down applicants.


**My first issue is:** I ship packages, but I also physically load them into my car, drive through traffic at the end of the day, and deliver them to the post office. This was not part of the job description on the marketplace ad. I understand that times are rough, but I don't think this is fair or smart at all, to be using my $11K vehicle for free, delivering the companies profit, everyday. I'm trying to be nice but I'm probably being stupid. What disappoints me, is that I brought this topic already and they said they'd be implementing a company pick up but nothings been done. On top of that, Coach and Nick are always pushing me to ship as much as possible until the very last minute before the post office closes. Not only does that make the postal workers unhappy, its fucking dangerous because I have to go through a bad intersection during rush-hour and forget making last minute corrections on an order if somethings wrong because I don't have time. We allow customers to order out of stock items which complicates shipping greatly because our inventory is FUBAR (I really don't like this sales strategy, I think its stupid and runs the risk of making our customers angry for holding their money for weeks at a time w/o delivering anything).


**My questions are:** Should I being doing this driving? If I am, shouldn't I be compensated? Why hasn't my boss/supervisor
said or mentioned anything about this asset that I providing (They say thanks but uh...?) Is ordering out of stock smart sales approach for us?
How do i broach this topic with my boss?


**My 2nd issue is** Two months ago when I first came on board, we we're a 4-man company. We're currently a 3-man company quickly falling behind schedule. Ellis, the warehouse guy, had made it clear to my boss for about several months (previous to my employment) that he was joining the army in July.During his enlistment process we fell behind because he was out of work for a couple days. This put us behind for about a week and a half.We caught up sort of but now  2 months have gone by, he enlisted, and we haven't hired anyone new.


Once again we are now falling behind.


This concerns me because I am having to stay much longer at work to keep us productive/ customers happy (50+hrs). I do care about my customers, they seem like patient people and have generally had faith in our company. I do this, but while I am paid overtime, it isn't the arrangement I am looking for. I want to go home and take care of other things. We've already had to come in on the weekends 3 times to try and get caught up. I'm exhausted. The original hours were supposed to be from 8-5pm. I stay to 6, sometimes 7, until I get really hungry again. And I don't fool around either, I'm on the phone, fixing orders, or shipping non-stop until lunch or close. No texting, candy-crush, clipping nails, or shooting the shit with customers. He's said he's been disappointed with the new applicants. He's enlisted the help of career center to receive applicant's resumes from their database (how he found me). But tbh, a trained monkey could do this. Heck I learned in a day. Even one of his customers, a regular, came in to help out with packing and joked (light-heartedly) that this position was mindless and not what he wanted in pay ($9). I think the only barrier to entry is the fact that you need to know about about the product and he just wants someone to be able to slip on into that role.  I haven't even had any paid training in this regard, just doing the job so I know that shouldn't be an issue.

**My questions are:** Is this normal for a small business? Shouldn't we hire more people? If we're a bare bones crew
that can't handle one missed day of work, shouldn't we have some type of contingency in place to make sure we
don't fall behind, like a part-time worker? Should I be shouldering these extra hours? Should I be like Coach and
scram as soon as the clock tolls 5:00? (He has not stuck around past 5:30, Not that I can blame him too much). What could he possibly be so hesitant or picky about that two months have gone by and no ones been hired?

personalfinance,Maxing out student loans?,"I just finished up my first year of professional school, and am in a position to take out up to $150,000 in loans with favorable terms (no initiation fee, the variable APR has been under 2.5% since the financial crisis hit). I don't need to take the full amount to pay for my education, but I am seriously considering taking out the maximum amount regardless. My thinking is that with the low rates, any excess can be dumped into an index fun to provide a small net gain. Furthermore, it would provide me a reasonable amount of liquid assets that I could leverage into favorable mortgage terms once I graduate and look into purchasing a home. I tend to be an optimistic fellow and look at the bright side of hypothetical scenarios, so I was wondering if y'all could enlighten me to some of the risks in this plan, or some of the other benefits that I haven't taken into account

personalfinance,New graduate about to start my career soon. Couple of questions about pay and paying off my loans.,"Hey there PF, long time lurker here. Just to give a little background, I'm a student that will be graduating in early August and also have a full-time job lined up starting the same time. I have quite a bit of student loans, and with my free time I figured I would get a budget and repayment schedule set. On top of that, I have just a couple of questions I figured I would ask regarding the calculation of my pay, and advice on my current living situation. 

**Before I ask my questions, my loans are as follows:**

* Subsidized Stafford Loan A: $7,000 at 4.660%. No interest accrued yet. 

* Subsidized Stafford Loan B: $8,250 at 4.290%. No interest accrued yet. 

* Unsubsidized Stafford Loan C: $2,000 at 4.290%. $57.19 interest accrued. $2,057.19 outstanding.

Now thats out of the way, on with the questions. 

1. As I'm starting to budget how I will be repaying my loans, I'm curious as to around what my exact pay will be. Obviously I don't need a figure down to the exact cent, but an estimate would certainly be nice. My offer letter states, ""you will be compensated at a rate of $3,000.00 per month, payable semi-monthly on the 15th and last day or each month (or if either falls on a weekend or holiday, on the preceding business day), which represents $36,000.00 when computed on an annual basis."" I have been told by HR that the hourly rate is $17.30. People have told me that dividing your annual salary by 2080 gives you your hourly wage, which is correct in this case. **I live in Florida and plan on claiming a tax allowance of one. From calculators I have used online, they show that I would be earning around $1,129 every 15 days, after taxes. Is this a decent estimate or should I be expecting something else?**

2. I'm currently living at home for free with the intent to pay off all of my student loans as quickly as possible. I know that I should be paying my loan with the highest interest rate off first. However, that loan is also subsidized and will not be earning interest until 6 months after I graduate. I also have an unsubsidized loan that has already been accruing interest (although a small amount). **Would it be a better option to pay off loan C first, and then loan A? Or loan A first and then C? I figure paying C off first would be the right choice, but I wanted to just make sure.**

3. Like previously said, I am currently living at home for practically free. Assuming I have a pay of around $1130 every 15 days, or $2260 every month, I'm in the position to pay off a good amount of my loans over the course of just one year. However, I have lived on my own for the last 4 years and am truthfully not sure how long I want to be living at my parents house. This may sound like a stupid question, but does anyone have any advice on how long I should stay here? I know the ideal answer should be for all of it, but I figure a solid 6-8 months might be enough to get the majority of it out of the way. Would it be stupid to go live on my own after I get a good amount of my loans paid off? If you were to pick a number, what amount of loan outstanding do you think would be good for me to be out on my own? $36,000 is by no means a lot of money, so I'm just worried if I go out on my own with even $2,500-5,000 left, I won't have enough money after all of my expenses to get it paid off.",finance,1468203965

Also, is M0 what the Fed currently has, or all assets/liabilities they have? So if they print off $100 and loan out $90 of it, would M0 be $100 or $10? Another way of asking: is it possible for M0 to decrease?",finance,1468205391

investing,Negative interest rates,"Found an interesting article explaining the desired effects of negative interest rates. Are devalued currencies usually a net positive for certain countries? I remember reading awhile back that China was devaluing the yuan. With them being export-dependent, this would increase demand for chinese goods and possibly jump start their slowing economic growth? Am I understanding all of this correctly?

stocks,"A Review of Robo-Advisors (Vanguard, Betterment, etc.) [WARNING: LONG POST]","[**In response to the question: What is the best robo-advisor?**](https://www.quora.com/What’s-the-best-robo-advisor?share=1)

To dissect this topic, I want to break it down by a custom [FinTech Pyramid](http://imgur.com/a/0dqAc) that I created to answer this question.


As you can see with my infographic, I separate assets and liabilities among five groups:

* Savers
* Experimenters
* Career Makers
* Accumulators
* Preservers

I will base my analysis on each group, as I believe it is easiest to declare winners in each, based on the needs of the end users, and thus how robos have segmented the market.

**Introduction**

A firm that targets everybody, really targets nobody.

This question is very much like asking, what is the best fast food restaurant, or what is the best car? Do you want mexican or pizza? Fast casual or sit down? An economy car or luxury? Electric car or gas guzzler?

If you want to think about it like the ETF market, are you looking for an index fund or something more specialized - a Vanguard Group or a Wisdomtree? You can’t pick a “best” ETF because they are targeting different markets.

**FinTech Pyramid — Savers**


This segment I define as being very tied to their new financial independence. They are entering college or the workforce and have established their own bank accounts, debit cards, and are starting to pay their own bills. Any robo solution needs to address these needs.

The main players here would be Acorns (Brokerage), Digit, Stash.

Acorns (Brokerage) really was the innovator in this customer segment. For years, it was derided to offer investment focused products to college students. This has since changed that Snapchat (product) and others have announced their intention to get more involved in fintech. But, the thought of offering an investment product to those with only $100 or maybe even less to invest was very disruptive.

What Acorns did was take a page from the old Bank of America (company) ‘Keep the Change Program’ and combine it with the robo principles that were created by Betterment (product/company).


Instead of investing in a near 0% interest rate Savings Account, Acorns decided to engineer it as an investment account in the stock market instead.


It has paid off, as of the time of this writing, Acorns has 472,000 accounts!


The negative - they charge $1 per month on balances below $5,000. Given their average account size I calculate to be around $155, that means the average person is paying 7.7% per year in fees.

But, I am a strong believer in consumer driven economics, customers love this app and don’t seem to care about the high fees. If interest rates go up, I believe this customer segment can move towards something like Digit, but at 0% that is hard to do.

*Winner: Acorns*

**FinTech Pyramid — Experimenters**


This market I define as being UI UX focused. They are first time investors in the market, thus the experience needs to be fast, seamless, and educational. Robinhood (Brokerage) has done a brilliant job targeting this audience. According to a Fortune report, their average customer age is 26. They make it very simple, clean, and FREE to buy your first stocks.

Likewise, I have always been impressed with the clean UI/UX of Betterment (product/company) and how many little bells and whistles they have to make their app simple for a complimentary wealth audience. There is a reason why they have attracted over 100,000 clients. It is very easy to use for first time investors.


Acorns also has a very nice interface that wins a lot of awards for their UI/UX. You could argue they have a good product for the Savers and Experimenters.


But Betterment has a much more robust technology platform that cuts across web and mobile, while Acorns is strictly mobile and it it focused more on savings (through the round up the change feature). Betterment also has been in the market longer managing money, and has a large Data Science department that puts out many interesting studies. For these reasons, I believe they are the clear winner in this segment.

*Winner: Betterment (product/company)*

**FinTech Pyramid — Career Makers**


For those in Generation X and Millennial Generation that are just getting their careers on track, the biggest thing they are looking for is investing robustness and features. They are 20–30 years away from being able to reach a Private Bank like Goldman Sachs Private Wealth Management, and they may only have $50,000 saved up, not nearly enough to access a private bank. According to Barron’s, the median minimum investment on these private banking platforms is $3 Million.

Some of the biggest things here that are wanted would be access, investing sophistication, and breadth of platform. On the liabilities sign they are most likely starting to re-finance their student debt and using more high end crdit cards like American Express (company). They are also driven by things like rewards and new experiences.

Career makers want to go into work and tell their friends that they just invested in the next Uber (company). This comes down to what I define as “access.” Below, we show the current portfolio makeup of a Hedgeable portfolio.


This includes our own Venture Capital fund that has a $1 minimum investment, integration with Coinbase for bitcoin and soon Ethereum (virtual currency) and more products in the pipeline lie P2P Lending investments, private real estate, and green energy. Hedgeable also allows clients to change the entire makeup of their portfolio to be Impact Investing focused, or called SRI in the industry -


Career makers also want to make sure their growing sums are at least attempted to be protected from big collapses like the 2008 Financial Crisis. Remember, this demographic was in the Experimenters segment during the crisis, and they were deeply hurt by the aftermath. This comes down to what I define as “investing sophistication.”

Below, I show GIPS compliant client composite performance of Hedgeable clients from Jan 1 - Feb 11 of 2016, versus a passive “Robo Index” that we have developed.


What is Hedgeable's investment philosophy?

A third decision point here would be what I call the “breadth of platform.” Are you a small business owner? Do you want to open an account for kids? The “best” robo-advisor might not even be able to take your money because of limited account types! So this could be a very important determining factor for career makers.

Wealthfront currently supports taxable investment accounts including individual, joint and trust accounts. We also support Traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and Rollover IRAs.

Betterment is harder to pin down, because they separate all of the account types into separate FAQ questions based on goals, but it seems like they offer about the same number as Wealthfront, with one or two exceptions.

Hedgeable offers the most account types. In addition to all those listed above, Hedgeable has 27 account types, including 4 different joint accounts and popular small business account types like SIMPLE IRAs and Solo 401ks.


Because of these three dynamics, I believe Hedgeable is the winner for Career Makers.

*Winner: Hedgeable*

**FinTech Pyramid — Accumulators**


This segment has reached the pinnacle of their careers, and their earnings start to level off. They have “access” due to their typically larger account balances than those lower on the pyramid.

They have accumulated many accounts across savings, checking, mortgage, investments. They are looking for the most robust app to keep track of these finances.

The average American in this demographic spreads investment accounts across 3 or more firms. They also have 4 or more credit cards, 2 or more kids ready to go off to college, at least 1 mortgage, 2 or more insurance premiums and health accounts, and much more. PLUS, I call them accumulators, because the numbers get larger as they reach their 60s and 70s.

This leads many to need a very robust suite of Personal Financial Management (PFM) apps to look at these accounts.

Personal Capital has done a very good job of targeting this demographic. As of the time of this writing, they have over 1 Million downloads of their PFM apps, which like Mint.com (product) was originally, are built on top of the Yodlee (company) aggregation software. Other platforms have PFM, but Personal Capital is by far the most robust.



Personal Capital allows you to hire one of their advisors if you want to talk to someone about your accounts and build an investment plan.


I like to think about Personal Capital as the only true player in the market that is disruptive to the advisory industry. Whereas firms like Acorns, Betterment, Hedgeable, Wealthfront are targeting clients that have traditionally been shut out of the advisory space - they do not meet the minimums - Personal Capital is directly competing with them with a similar business model.

The average balance of a Personal Capital client is about $125,000 according to my calculations based on SEC data. An advisor at Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo (company) is about the same. Instead of building their own PFM apps, these advisors will use tools like eMoney Advisor for account aggregation or a TAMP platform such as Envestnet (company).

Thus, if you are in the accumulator phase, Personal Capital is a good choice as a digital solution vs. a traditional advisor.

*Winner: Personal Capital*

**FinTech Pyramid — Preservers**


This customer segment is going to be more income based, they are typically already in retirement, and are looking for products like annuities and health insurance. They also will tend to be more tied to the traditional brands like Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch, Vanguard Group, etc, because they came of age with many of them.

This is why Schwab Intelligent Portfolios and Vanguard Personal Advisor Services will most likely be strong choices for this group. Not necessarily for the actual product offered (as of the time of this writing I do not believe either offers true retirement &amp; insurance), but because branding and trust matters with this demographic.


Remember, Schwab was founded in 1971, and Vanguard in 1975. They were the fintech disruptors of their day. From the time the Preservers have been in their 20s and 30s - like the Gen X / Gen Y generation of today - they have grown with these brands.

The brands Baby Boomers know from the 70’s remain attractive today.

This will explain why Schwab has been able to move over about $5 Billion from this demographic, while Vanguard has been able to move over about $30 Billion, since they launched their digital solutions. According to reports, 75% -80% of Schwab’s Intelligent Portfolio AUM has come from existing clients. Their average client is over 55 years old, so this proves my hypothesis. They struggle to attract new young clients, but are very solid choices for their current Baby Boomer client base.

*Tie: Charles Schwab and Vanguard Group*

**Pareto Principle - Other Segments**

I am also a strong believer in the 80/20 rule. My pyramid probably only encompasses about 80% of the market.

For the 20% of the equation there are specialized situations that drive human behavior in consumer finance and in particular in wealth management.

**Bargain Hunters**

We see this “coupon” or “bargain” mentality occur a lot in the ETF space, some investors will solely look at low-cost options, and compare expense ratios of Vanguard, SsgA, Blackrock iShares, etc.

Here the competitors would be Wisebanyan and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.

Both are no management fee, but Wisebanyan is truly no fee, Schwab is not really free when you look under the hood, as we did here -

Why does Schwab Intelligent Portfolios hold so much cash?

What is a good Schwab Intelligent Portfolios review?

In fact, we estimate that with increasing interest rates, Schwab could be making over 2% on some accounts!

WiseBanyan has done a nice job on their app design, and they have high ratings among customers in the iOS App Store.


Because of the many conflicts of interest within the Intelligent Portfolios product, I believe Wisebanyan will be the clear choice among those looking at a simple solution at no cost.

*Winner: WiseBanyan*

—-

**Tax Efficiency Hunters**

If you have a large amount of unrealized capital gains in a taxable account or are concerned with cutting down on a potentially large tax bill on an account transfer or ongoing trading, then this sub-category is for you.

Although most people will typically compare Wealthfront and Betterment (product/company) head on, I think of Wealthfront more as a tax manager and Betterment (product/company) as a UI/UX focused personal finance app.

Tax managed investing is a very lucrative industry. For example, Parametric is a leading institutional asset manager that focuses on tax optimization, and they have over $160 Billion in AUM!

When Wealthfront pivoted from Kaching (and then their original Wealthfront business model of a marketplace for actively managed portfolios) they smartly created new awareness in the industry for Tax Loss Harvesting. This technique has been used for decades by advisors, but was never optimized for the scale that Wealthfront operated on. They obviously hit a nerve in the market, especially from high earning Silicon Valley workers, because since they brought this to the forefront in their marketing, it has become “table stakes”. Every robo is expected to offer it, and Wealthfront can be credited with this.

Below, is what Wealthfront claims is the returns from their TLH strategy (until August 2014).


Wealthfront also does tax-efficient transfers of securities. Again, if a client has a large amount of realized gains in a taxable portfolio it becomes difficult to sell them. If you go to Wealthfront, they claim to sell them in a tax efficient manner, waiting for some legacy securities to become long-term gains, etc.

Introducing Tax-Minimized Brokerage Account Transfers » Wealthfront Knowledge Center

For these reasons, I would say Wealthfront is the leader in this niche part of the market so far.

*Winner: Wealthfront*

—-

**Service Hunters**

This niche will cut across demographic lines. Some consumer finance shoppers are most interested in the breadth of customer service.

Personal Capital and Vanguard Group approach to support is to provide a human advisor that you can chat with. So, if your only concern would be that you want to talk to someone about your account via a video portal then these would be good choices. Below, I show the video portal from Vanguard PAS -


Some people (like myself, who has never walked into a bank branch and hates talking on the phone) are looking for a more digital/tech look and feel. On the more digital side I believe Hedgeable has the most robust service, which is 7 day text messaging, live chat, support ticketing, phone, CIO office hours, digital consultations, email, and soon chatbots.

Betterment (product/company) would be a close second, they also offer 7 day chat and phone service and they get good reviews from customers on service. Although, I am writing this in the afternoon on a weekend and Betterment’s chat is offline (see below), even though the chat hours say it should’t be -


Some platforms just aren’t selling service and that is fine - sometimes people just want to go to an automat (remember those?!) versus a sit down restaurant. For example, Wealthfront doesn’t even offer a live chat feature, but that is purposeful (I assume), since they are trying to build more of a TurboTax (product) low service model.


I cannot pick a best of this sub-category, because it really depends on what kind of support is important to you - an advisor via video chat or a fully digital experience.

*Winner: Depends on service type wanted*

**Conclusion Part I**

The wealth management market is very complex, there is never going to be a one size fits all solution for everyone. Therefore I suggest the following two steps -

Determine where you stand on the FinTech Pyramid
Below I created a graphic based on the levels of the pyramid and my selections in each:


Once you have determined where you fit in the pyramid (there will be some overlap in age, thus I took off the ages in some of the levels), it will help to narrow down the “best” selection for you and your circumstances.

Determine if the 20% rule applies to you
If so, the pyramid isn’t going to be applicable, and you can look across the spectrum for a solution. This accounts for why about 80%-85% of most robos’ demographics fall within the same age range, but 15%-20% do not. There are many more categories, but I focused on just three in my analysis.


**Conclusion Part II**

A shopper that is best suited for a Hyundai (car company) is probably not going to be hanging out at the Tesla Motors (company) dealership and someone in a hurry on game day is probably not going to trade in their Papa John's Pizza order for an hour adventure at Outback Steakhouse.

Many of the answers here will point out a clear winner, but that is because they fall in a certain part of this pyramid, and they are looking myopically at the market from their own eyes. Thus, they are not even mentioning some key players in the space, that aren’t targeting their demographic. There is no way a firm can be best for everyone, and I don’t believe anyone tries to be. This is a common miss-conception in Financial Technology.

Just look at the infographic I made below. This shows data from a Citi survey, on the expected rise of robo assets over the next 10 years. Much like the ETF market, this space will be fragmented, with “best” in class equivalents of Vanguard, SSgA, WisdomTree, GlobalX, etc. Or if you want to look at it like the trading market, an options trader certainly wouldn’t think Robinhood (Brokerage) is “best” because they don’t even offer that service, even though millions of 20 somethings might love it!

There is nothing wrong with any of the players in the market, it depends on what is important to you at a particular stage in life. Happy investing!

I don’t know if my auto loan should be my higher priority or if saving for the deposit should be a higher priority. My credit score is about 720 right now, my credit is low because I only started building credit 1.5 years ago (thus the high interest rate for the car loan). Someone told me not to pay the car loan off too aggressively because I miss the opportunity to build credit. And I would need that credit to buy a house, is this correct?

personalfinance,"I paid over $300 in taxes last year, and did not receive any of it back during my return. What did I do wrong?","Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I've tried googling and such to no avail.

I'm a senior in high school (actually I just graduated) and I've been working a part time job since about September. I can't remember how exactly I set my W-4 (it was a while ago) but whenever I checked my paychecks last year I always saw a consistent 10% taken from my gross earnings. I was still in school so I didn't earn too much, only about $3000 from September to December. When I check my pay stubs, it shows that approx $300 were withheld as ""taxes"". 

When I filed for my tax returns, all I got back was $20 from my California state tax return. I did not get a single penny back from the Fed. If it helps any, I was 17 at the time and I filed as a dependent, and my parents claimed me as their dependent. 

At the start of this year, my tax rate all the sudden jumped to about 25%. I did not make any changes to my W-4. I was still working part time, so I don't know why this changed. I only started working 35-40 hours a week a month ago. 

$300 isn't too big a deal, but it is $300 that I'll need when I go to college next year. What worries me even more is that so far this year I've been taxed about $1500 (and I expect that to rise to over $2000 before I go to college), and I'm worried that the same thing will happen and I won't receive any of that money back, which is huge to a soon to be broke student.

Thanks in advance, if there's any other info I can provide to help figure this out just ask!",finance,1468210702
financialindependence,"How much is enough? Ready for FIRE, but at my peak earning capability with kids on the way...","Not sure if the throw away account makes this more or less believable, but I'm gonna give this a shot and hope I get some thoughtful responses. 

I've been very lucky in my career and investment timing, which has put me in a position where I'm most likely ready for FIRE right now. However, I recently advanced in my career in a manner that will allow me to achieve relatively large increases in my yearly income in the coming years (I currently make $400k/year, and that number could realistically double over the next 3-5 years). My stats:

Net worth - $1.9M 
(Home: $1.1M with $600k mortgage; rental property: $450k with no mortgage and generating $1250/month; stocks: $635k; 401k: $315k)

Income - $400k/year

Spouses income - $120k/year

We have no debt other than the mortgage on the house, and I'm currently on a very aggressive savings/investment plan to try to pay that off in the next few years (I know it's probably not ideal to focus on paying off such a large mortgage with a 3.75% interest rate, but getting rid of that debt is the last thing really forcing me to continue working). 

So I'm sure those numbers will have a lot of people telling me to F off, and I get that, as I read this sub regularly and I know many of you have retired on much, much less. But kids are imminent (about to start trying in earnest), and while we have some great public schools in my area, I still hear that they can be pretty expensive even if you don't have to pay for private school. 

Furthermore, the most legitimate issue I see with myself is walking away from a yearly income that will greatly add to what I've been lucky enough to accumulate. How much is enough? I want to FIRE and be able to watch my kids grow up, but is it worth working (around 7:30am-5:30pm 5 days/week) through at least their early years (3 years old? 5 years old?) to make an extra $2M?

I hope this post doesn't come across as pompous - I know I'm in an incredibly good position.  But I read people in this sub talk all the time about the trade off between your time (and your kids) and working to accumulate enough to live off the rest of your life, and I've never seen a discussion that weighed those factors for someone in my position.",finance,1468211032

And how should we be living monthly?,"For those that haven't seen my other post in here, my mother hasn't worked for the better part of three years to due to a cervical cancer scare, a bunch of unexpected emergency surgeries, an actual cancer diagnosis (leukemia), and her back giving out. Her doctors have forbidden her to work since about 2013.

We live with her boyfriend ($0). Her income is about $700 a month from Social Security, $300 a week from her boyfriend, and $90-100 per week from my deadbeat dad for child support. 

I am 17. I am trying to get hired at WalMart so I can funnel all of my checks into getting us out of debt. 

Debt is as follows:

- Barclaycard VISA, $3000, 18% interest, minimum due about $29-49 or so depending on balance

- Capital One, $2300, 10% interest, minimum due $50

- Best Buy, $1400, 29% interest (!!), minimum due $90

- Bank loan, $7000, 12.25% interest, minimum due $200

- Car loan, $2700, 7% interest, minimum due $107


The car is my debt. It is my car and I was paying it until the new year, point blank my job at Best Buy was hurting me emotionally and mentally. My mom picked the tab up while I focused on school (her orders) and told me to job hunt at end of summer. I will be picking the tab up again on that as soon as I get a job. 

As far as other expenses go:

- $150 or so monthly to T-Mobile
- $200 or so to Progressive/USAA for insurance
- A fuck ton on gasoline because she has an old V8 Jeep that does 11 MPG and she does a lot of city driving for my disabled brother
- I think that's everything... At least I can remember at 2:15 AM. 

So, subtracting phone and insurance we have ballpark $900 a month free. 

I just switched her banking to Simple and am trying to figure out how to setup Mint so we can get every penny. 

But, we get a $2-2.5k payment from Social Security in August. What do we pay with it? I know for sure we're paying that damn BBY card off, she's paying $70-80 a month on payments and then three days later they nail us with $90 in interest. 

What should the rest go to? I was thinking the bank loan because it's the most expensive, but it's interest rate is less than the Barclaycard. I don't know. Please help. :/

stocks,"This Weeks Game Plan In The Stock Market: Prepare For Earnings, Fed Speak","The week ahead promises to be volatile. With the stock market near all-time highs, the markets have shrugged off worries about Federal Reserve rate hikes, economic signals of weakness and Brexit. So what happens now? Is the all clear given for new all-time highs?
This week we will begin earnings season. The first big name company to report will be Monday after the market closes. Alcoa Inc (NYSE:AA) will report earnings, and economists will be looking for signals of growth or lack their of, in the aluminum industry. This could tell investors if a global slowdown is getting worse or easing. The consensus estimates are for $0.09 per share on $5.20 billion in revenue.
The rest of the week will mainly be devoted to financial stocks. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co (NYSE:WFC) will report. Investors will be looking closely at these reports to decipher how much of an impact low rates are having on their earning potential. The 10 year yield closed on Friday at 1.358%.

In addition, look for comments from CEO's like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon on the future of the global economy. The markets always pay attention to his remarks.

personalfinance,Question about Federal 6mo. grace period + eligibility,"Hey guys. I have a question about my student loans. I borrowed $5600 via a Unsubsidized Federal Loan in Oct of 2015. I used that money to cover two semesters of school which ended in April of this year. However, I went through a bad bout of depression and I got absolute shit grades, so I'm not eligible for more student loans this August. I got some counseling (for the depression), have been holding down a full time job, and should be able to pay for 6 credit hours this coming January (minimum required to be re-eligible for federal loans). I've taken some classes on effective study habits so that I can get good grades this time around. I got good grades in high school, but it's been three years since I graduated so I lost my study habits and the depression from other stuff got to me.

Anyway, I'm wondering a couple things. Am I correct in that you must get good grades @ a minimum of 6 credit hours before you can get federal aid again? 

I've set up a repayment plan for my current student loans. The payment is only $60 a month, so I can make that right now while I'm in school/working full time. However, do those payments stop once I've gone back to school at least half time (6 credit hours) even after the 6 mo. grace period? Or would I need to return within the 6 mo. grace period?

personalfinance,Possibly harebrained twist to building emergency fund,"Hi wise PFers! [x-posted to r/investing, but wanted a different opinion from a slightly different crowd]


I have a question about my emergency fund, which is kept in a high-interest online bank. I read [this](https://www.betterment.com/resources/personal-finance/safety-net-funds-why-traditional-advice-is-wrong/) article from Betterment about why it's better to move most of your savings to a brokerage account with a moderate risk portfolio of 60% bond, 40% stock, plus an extra 30% as ""cushion."" The article argues that a savings account has anemic interest rate and you will lose money through inflation. And while there will be volatility in the investment, the ""cushion"" is there so that even if the market crashes, you won't lose your principal. He explains it all better in the article.


This seems interesting to me but I was thinking of a slightly different method to split the difference. Leave a few thousand in my savings account and invest say $3-5000 (including the 30% ""cushion) in some low-cost conservative mutual funds with high and frequent dividend rates. Then direct said dividends back into my savings account, thereby automating a self-perpetuating savings plan. My cash account will be automatically replenished through dividend transfers. The ""cushion"" will protect the principal in my brokerage account.


Is this a completely idiotic idea?


Also, I know stock dividends are ""unearned income"" but can dividends be directly used to contribute to an IRA so long as I am under my annual limit and my income exceeds said limit? Or do IRA contributions have to come directly from one's checking account? Like, does it even matter because it's like robbing Peter to pay Paul kind of thing?",finance,1468251056

personalfinance,Getting a personal loan to pay off 25k in credit card debt--financial situation is about to make a dramatic turnaround.,"Starting the second week of August I will no longer be paying $350/week in childcare payments for my twins as they are starting public school. I've been looking forward to this for 5 years! I've pretty much used my entire income to pay for their care since they were 8 weeks old and I had to return to work. 

In order to make ends meet instead of paying off my one, low interest credit card every month I've found myself maxing one out then opening and transferring to the next for the introductory benefits. I've done this quite a few times over and now I'm stuck with high interest rates and the subsequent transfer fees. 

So my question is two part, I guess. Since I will soon have my entire income again, should I try and tough this out and pay them off one by one? Or would it make more sense to wipe the slate clean and just stick with one monthly payment on an installment plan? And if the latter is smarter, should I use my big name bank or find a credit union to try to work with? Unfortunately my credit score is sitting at 640 because of the amount of debt I owe and because there have been 3 credit inquiries in the past 2 years from me applying for new credit cards (sigh). I do have 100% history of on time payments and began building credit 20 years ago. 

If I could speak to someone and let them see that I am not actually high risk and that circumstances have just been difficult for me do I have any chance of getting a high amount loan and a good rate? Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,What's the better career/grad school decision financially?,"Hello everyone. I'm a college student preparing for graduate school and can't decide between occupational therapy and becoming a teacher. I've looked extensively into the details of both jobs, but I'm curious about the financial aspect of things.

I'll have $27, 894 in debt from undergrad, all of which were federal loans.
For OT school, programs I'd be applying to range in cost from $65,000 to $144,000. This is just tuition, not housing, groceries, misc. fees, textbooks, gas, etc. I'll be taking out loans for all of that. 1 school is $65,000, the rest are around $105,000. A starting salary in my area (Michigan) for an OT can range from 40,000 in public schools to 55,000 for other areas of pediatrics. I'm not really interested in working with adults at this time, but the salary is higher. It would be very difficult to work during this program due to the number of credits, requirements to attend fieldwork, events, volunteering, group projects, etc. 

On the other hand, the teacher certification program is about $49,000. I'd be living at home during the program and my parents wouldn't charge me rent during school. It's also a night program so I can work during the day until student teaching. The starting salary for a teacher with a master's degree around here seems to range from $35,000 to $40,000. 

Basically, it comes down to massive debt, but a higher salary or a lower salary but lower debt as well. My estimate is that the debt for teaching, including undergrad, would be roughly $78,000. For OT, it would be for sure over $100,000. Probably closer to $150,000 and quite possibly higher.

Talk to me like I'm a three year old here please. My goals in life are to have a house (not a big house, but a decent sized house in the midwest), a car that's not falling apart and to not be constantly stressed about money. What would life be like for me with each path? What's the better decision financially for me?",finance,1468259381

Some information (prepare yourself, it's a pretty long post...):  

- Net take-home pay per month (this is also net of medical, dental, vision, 401k, and HSA): $3,179.48  
- Current cash on hand (net of current month's CC balance): $12,617.13  
- 401k balance: Total - $4,446.18 Vested - $3,715.13  
- HSA balance: $1661.21  
- My boyfriend lives with me and I charge him ""rent"" of $500 a month.  

Expenses: (monthly)  

- Mortgage Payment: $1,044  
- Condo Association Dues (incl. garbage + water): $254.30  
- Comcast (blech): $50  
- Electricity: ~$25  
- Cellphone: $50  

Other:  

- Mortgage: 30-year fixed rate FHA Loan with $166,114.42 balance @ 4.125% interest. Bought a condo April 2016.  
- Car: 2008 Toyota Yaris with ~80k miles. It is paid off and under my dad's name.   
- Car insurance: $900 a year  

So in my opinion, I'm doing alright as far as finances go. But as you may have noticed, I didn't put any of my other expenses such as gas, food, recreation, etc. on the list because I honestly have no idea how much a month I spend on those. I've never really budgeted before, I kind of just buy when I need/want to but in a reasonable manner. This is also something I want to figure out because although it has been working for me so far, I don't want to get too comfortable and have my sense of what's ""reasonable"" to spend money on change. I don't live particularly frugally now, and I don't want that to spiral into a lifestyle change that I cannot afford. A few questions:  

- How much should I be saving a month?  
- I know I should probably be making additional principle payments on my mortgage, but what is good amount?  
- Currently I contribute 6% of my income to my 401K and my employer has a 50% match up to 6%. I didn't really change any of the [default investment options] (http://i.imgur.com/KbfabTb.png). Is there more I should be doing to maximize my return?  
- My employer will match up to $1,200 in my HSA, but currently I only contribute $600 a year. Should I be contributing more? So far in the year I've had it, I've only used $300 for some dental work and contacts. I am thinking about maxing out the match amount for this year and using the funds to get Lasik.  
- Some people have been telling me that interest rates are low so I should re-finance my home loan? Not going to lie I don't even really know what that means lol.  
- Is there something I should be doing with my savings? Currently it's just sitting in a Chase savings account.  
- What are some general guidelines/tips on how to decide if I can ""afford"" something? Because I have a list of wants and I'm having trouble deciding if they're reasonable. Ie. Lasik, kayak, washer/dryer, mattress, vacations, etc.

I've received 4,000$ from Pell grants, and 5,500$ total from federal loans for this year. The school's need-based grant also gave me around 3,000$. This leaves me with around 10,500$ that I have to pay out of my pocket.  
My mother think something went wrong with the awards, because she's the sole income of the family and makes around 35,000$ per year and also because my sister's tuition was basically fully covered by her college.

No idea where to start.,"Whenever I look for advice on this matter, I always get overwhelmed and disheartened. It seems like I'll read a bit of advice, then immediately see ten reasons why said advice isn't good! So, I thought I'd try my luck at asking here for some tailored advice that can hopefully put me on the right track.

I am a 20 year old from the UK and have a Youtube channel which gives me a decent bit of income £1.5k+ a month). I also have a eCommerce venture (which I feel I could scale up a bit) that gives me a few hundred pounds a month. 

For the past year or so, the money has just been going straight into my (Santander 123) current account which has an interest rate of about 3% on balances up to £20k. I know this probably isn't safe or sensible. I'm registered self employed and we have a family accountant who has sorted the tax paying side of things.

I live at home with my family, have one year left on my degree (which is government funded and doesn't need paying back) and have no debt or plans to move out for at least a few more years.

Because Youtube isn't exactly a safe long term plan, my goal with the money I have made is to save up enough to buy some property I can rent out, and maybe invest more in my eCommerce venture.

I'm basically just asking where to start. Should I speak with a financial adviser? Should I move this money to a different type of account or look at investing it? Honestly, I would prefer options where there is less work for me, as I would rather focus on my studies, Youtube and eCommerce gig.

personalfinance,"Thinking of taking out additional student loans to purchase a car, currently only working part time.","Hi r/personalfinance! I'm quickly approaching the last two semesters of college and living off of student loans and I'm trying to figure out how much more loans will be beneficial in the long run in order to maintain my cost of living and not pile on unnecessary debt. Hopefully you guys can help!

**Current living situation**
I am living in a two bedroom apartment with my boyfriend and a roommate so rent isn't super expensive (until recently had 2 roommates so rent has gone up). I am also sharing a car with my boyfriend (which his parents bought him for school) and we both commute to school about 9 miles away and work together. We also work at the same retail job about 8 miles away from home. It's been working out so far since we were getting similar hours at work and we had similar class schedules, but this next semester he will be doing one last class at a community college elsewhere in the city and thus working more hours and I will have a full 18 unit semester at our university and going back to mostly working just weekends so I'm thinking it's time I find an alternate means of transportation. There is little to no public transit in my area and its a farm town so not terribly safe to ride my bike to campus next to stretches of road with cars going 70+ mph. Also I'm in the position where the last 18 units for fall are the last for my university and I need one more class at a community college for spring, which means my student loans will be cut off in January since I will no longer be enrolled in my main university. Currently I'm barely scraping by with the little money I make and the left over loan money I have due to the little hours I get at work so I will probably need a second job (current job doesn't want to give me more hours over summer because my schedule will change again once i start school). So because of all this I really feel a car would allow me to branch out and work another job to lay a foundation for post-grad living expenses. 

tl:dr circumstances are changing and car would be very helpful for another job as well as getting to and from campus better.

**Current expenses**

Rent: $545.00

Utilities: $60.00 (no cable or subscription services, just internet and water, electric, gas)

subsidized loan: $500

Unsubsidized loan $12,000 (most likely also around 4.290%)

total: $18,700

no matter what amount I choose to take out, it will be cut in half and dispersed in August and January.
Tuition is $3500 per semester for 6+ units
and about $2000 per semester for less than 6 units

**Current options**
1. take out full loan amount and only receive half in august ($9,350), overload on units and work min. hours, finish university by january and be 100% on my own financially by january and not receive the second half of the loans because I would no longer be enrolled in main university, hope my job gives me enough hours to maintain my current situation but still share a car and possibly pick up a second job.

2. take out full loan amount and take 15 units in fall and 3 units in spring to get the full $18,000 and put the bulk of it into a car, use the extra time and resources to get a second job and have established hours at both by the time I graduate.

3. take out full amount, spread it out to 9 units each semester and no car one job, and live off remaining loan money?

**Car**
I was looking at going with an electric car, a bunch of nissan leafs at my local carmax are going for about $8,900 and I would of course get the extra warranty or whatever it is they offer to ensure the car is covered if theres a big issue after purchasing it so I'm sure it would come out to about $11,000 or so.

So what do you guys think, is it worth sinking further into debt to get an extra bill for car payments, but also have to option to work more? I'm extremely lost here, so any insight on the situation is great, thanks! also if I need to add any more info let me know!

investing,Is there a gold bubble?,"Now, this may sound stupid. I'm a college student and I've still got a lot to learn. But yesterday I was watching a movie called Boom Bust Boom (great movie btw) and it got me to thinking of what possible bubbles could exist at the moment.

My honest opinion is that the economy is being propped up and we are a lot more fragile than the fed, media, etc. are making us out to be. Obviously many others believe the same/something similar so they flocked to safer assets like treasuries and gold. The fact that gold has risen by well over 100% year to date has me feeling like if there was a bubble developing in the U.S. economy, it'd be gold. Not just because it's risen so high but because it's risen so quickly. 

Could this be possible? Like I said I'm only in college so I'm not sure how a commodity bubble would work since I don't believe I've consciously experienced one. Is it different because borrowing money to buy gold isn't very common? Or maybe it is. I'm not sure.

Either way, I believe we are in some sort of bubble since the markets are overvalued and the amount of consumer (and overall) debt in the U.S. is way too high to be considered healthy imo.",finance,1468269130
personalfinance,Interest Only versus Amortizing Mortgage,"I'm looking into buying a place that, because of family, geographic and economic reasons (I live in NYC and have a small child), I wouldn't possibly stay in for more than 5 years.  I know a lot of people in a similar situation and they all seem to be doing 30 year amortizing mortgages, but I can't for the life of me figure out why:

On an amortizing mortgage, your monthly payments are going to be higher of course because a portion goes to principal.  But being as payments are structured such that you pay mostly interest first, there seems to be little benefit in the first 5 years and in fact, you are overpaying interest because interest payment are front-loaded on the amortizations schedule.

Obviously knowing that I'll leave in 5 years or so means I would do an ARM, but the question is - why would I amortize?  Shouldn't I just do a balloon and if I have some left-over cash I can pay down in bigger chunks than an amortizing mortgage would schedule, without the burden of front-loading interest?  (or, alternatively I could use that extra cash that I'm not using on scheduled interest payment to  (i) invest if I think I can get a return to beat my mortgage interest rate or (ii) afford a larger mortgage and get a tax deduction for those additional interest payments).

I will graduate next August from grad school with about 80k worth of debt (undergrad+grad total). I am well on track to making 80k next year as well, so while my debt is a lot (it feels like a TON) I think it's not too terrible? What I am wondering is, how on Earth do I begin saving for a house, and is it even worth it?

About me, I am 27 years old, right after I graduated college I was in the Peace Corps for two years. After I left I began working for the federal government in DC, not really making enough to save a ton but enough to support myself in the city. I started grad school in international relations a year ago and I'm on track to graduate next summer. Right now, I make about 65k, which is about 3400 a month net after health insurance, taxes, and retirement. I am sure I should have been saving all along, but I haven't really made very much money in my adult life, so I haven't even known where to begin. I do have a small emergency fund of about $3000 right now.

Townhouses in the DC area cost about $300k to start - there is real estate for less but those are mostly studio condos or properties that would need lots of renovation, which would cost more than $300k in the end. I am not looking to buy right now, not for a few years, but saving 60k (20%) while paying student loans (I will almost certainly be in a job that allows for PSLF, so I will be doing that) seems like an enormous task. Is it really just buckling down and saving 1000 a month for the next 5 years? Is there a way I'm missing? Does everyone buying a house just have much better saving skills and foresight than me (I can believe that...)?

* Combined Gross Income: 230 K (USD)
* Current Savings: 40 K
* I own a condo in Chicago. Two bedroom, two bath, with a great view in a large building. I currently owe 215 K on the mortgage, the condo was recently appraised for 250 K. 
* We've sunk 40 K in upgrades into this condo in the last two years (new floors/new kitchen)
*My credit is 670, my wife is around 800
* Condo has great amenities, HOA is $690/month, with a special assessment of $166 until 2022.

* Our only other debt is $400/month for a car payment, and $400 month for parking.

We are trying to refinance right now. I currently pay $1750 month (7.4% interest) plus the $810 for monthly HOA.

The mortgage company will let me wife and her excellent credit take over the loan, even though her name isn't on the title. However, because the condo appraised for less than 80%, they are offering an interest rate of 3.9% on a 5-1 ARM. 

If we pay off 15K (which gets us to 80% of value), we can get the interest rate to 2.8%. 

Our goal is to save about 120 K in the next two years. With the refinanced loan, we will be able to save 5 K monthly.

My questions: 

1. Should we sink another 15 K into the loan to get to 80%? Is that a sound investment?
2. Should we spend 12 K to pay off the special assessment, and making the condo much more appealing on the open market?

personalfinance,"21, starting an accelerated nursing program this Fall. Costs are high, but long-term benefits are totally worth it, how do I go about paying?","Hey r/PF,

A little back story, I am a recent college graduate in the field of health sciences. As you all know, to work in the healthcare field some further education is required after a bachelor's degree. My degree is pretty generic despite my business minor, as it is designed to be a ""pre-health"" path preparing students for their field of choice after graduation. 

When I initially entered college I planned on becoming a physical therapist which would require a min. of three extra years of school. In my junior year I decided I would pursue a degree in nursing and take the accelerated path as it is only a 14 month program. I will be attending a very prestigious school in the Northeast and the degree/program is known for its competitiveness. With that being said, it is not going to be cheap.

I am looking at roughly $60k in total for the program, with $12,500 in financial aid awards for 2016-2017. I plan on borrowing $50k in order to cover the tuition costs of this school. Fortunately, I was awarded a decent amount of money throughout my undergrad degree, so I do not owe as much as the average college graduate in the states. My overall question is, where should I borrow from? This is clearly my second undergrad degree (accelerated bachelor of science in nursing) so I cannot depend on federal aid as heavily as I once did. I do understand that this is a large investment at this stage in my life, but I am a male entering the field of nursing in the tri-state area. Not only will I create a stable work environment for the rest of my career, but my salary won't be too shabby for a 23 year old either.

Right now I plan on applying to Discover Student Loans' Health Professions option, as I have already used Sallie Mae for a private loan. If you have any advice on other loan options, tips, or simply words of encouragement, please do not hesitate to share.

Best course of action?","I just last week got a letter from Eastern Revenue collections agency telling me a Federal Perkins loan in my name had gone delinquent and had been sold to them, so they're asking the full balance be paid, plus collections, etc. I thought it was a scam at first because I had consolidated all my loans (I thought) nine months ago, after finishing grad school, and I hadn't received any sort of notice about this loan. No call, no email, no letters to my address and I don't think any to the address they had on file, my parents'. Nobody called my parents, either—my father definitely would have told me.

I consolidated my graduate school loans through Fedloan after finishing school in order to be eligible for a federal loan forgiveness program (I'm public sp.ed. preschool teacher). At the same time, I lumped in my remaining undergraduate loans serviced by Fedloan, under the impression that it included all my loans. By that point, Fedloan was the only lender I was aware of. 

I talked with a woman from Eastern Revenue this morning; she said I could consolidate this with Fedloan, but as I understand it the collections costs and fees (~$400) would also go into that debt, and doing so wouldn't undo the damage done to my otherwise very good credit score. (~780) 

I don't really know where to go from here, because I'm not sure if I have any recourse other than biting the bullet. I can pay the balance if needed, but consolidating seems like a better option. But really, neither is ideal since I had no say in any of this until now. Are there other options?

What is the best account for this kind of savings?

1. Target Loan A first and continue to pay it until it's gone, then target B, then C

3. Target whichever loan is the largest at any given time (so Loan A until it goes lower than B, then target B until it goes lower than A, etc.)

personalfinance,"Current net worth of -$51,000. Promotion and pay raise coming in August/September. 1300 mile move; desire to buy a home in 1-2 years...Let's just say I have a lot of questions.","*edit: So it appear the 1-2 year hope for a home has been pushed to more like 2-4 years. The way I see it, I am doing fine with my $29k income and the promotion will come with a $20k raise. Thus, all the extra (after taxes 15k) will go into paying my student loans off.*

I have been saving up preparing for this potential promotion. Unless something happens, I should have around $4,000 to move across the country in August/September. Not much, but everything I own will fit in my car. So that will be easy.

I will be moving from Nebraska to North Carolina.

According to glassdoor and payscale, my promotion should come with a $50k-$55k salary. Current salary is $29,000.

On $50k, my income should be $3,100 per month after taxes.

I don't anticipate my expenses to increase much. They should remain around $1,700 per month, but I am going to work on cutting that even further once I get established. Charlotte and Omaha have similar cost of livings: http://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/omaha-ne/charlotte-nc/50000

**Current Debt**

* $41,000 in student loans at an average 6.2% interest rate (All federal loans)
* $9,000 collection I am negotiating for pay for delete (they already removed it from my reports, now we are just finalizing amount).

I have read several articles stating that I shouldn't necessarily go ""all in"" and pay off my student loans super fast. Yet I have read some articles that say to pay it off fast because it's an immediate 6.2% return on investment. I think paying it off over a longer period of time is better for my financial goals. Just want to make sure I am thinking right.

**What I want to do**

After moving to NC, I want to rent for the first year or two and save everything else. Preferably I will rent a simple, cheap studio apartment.

After the relocation, I want to build my emergency fund to $5,000. That should take 3-5 months after I get settled in to my new town. I currently have $4,000 to move. Hopefully I will be able to save $1,000-2,000 of that by being really frugal during the move.

During that 12-24 months of renting, I should be able to save $1,500 per month. After renting and saving, I want to put a down payment on a 4BR/2BA house and rent out the other rooms. I had a friend of a friend do this and he just paid off his 30 year mortgage 24 years early on a $130,000 house.

I want that!

Soooo...

Median home prices in Charlotte are $170,000.

Using that $170,000 as a benchmark, I would need a $34,000 down payment. That would take me roughly 2 years to accumulate if I saved $1,250 per month, which I can easily do after promotion and my emergency fund is established.

Using [Khan Academy's mortgage calculator](https://www.khanacademy.org/downloads) a $170,000 mortgage with a 20% downpayment and a 5.5% (I have no idea what interest rates will be when I go to apply for a mortgage), my mortgage would be $775.

Rent for 4 bedroom houses vary considerably based on location. The lower end is about $1200 per month rent for a 4BR/2BA and middle seems to be around $1,600 or so. That comes out to about $300 to $400 per room.

Let's assume everything stays the same (it won't stay the same, but it's all I have to work with).

If the mortgage costs $775 per month, I rent out three rooms at $333 a piece ($1000 total for me), and let's say I put 30% of that away each month for repairs/maintenance. That drops to $766. If I use that $766 to put towards the principal of the mortgage and I pay the actual $775 mortgage myself, it would be paid off in 9 years 6 months if [bankrate's calculator is correct](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/mortgage-loan-payoff-calculator.aspx)

Really, what I need to know is, based on my situation with $51,000 in debt but $41,000 of that is in federal student loans, how do I get to where I want to be?

Should I just pay the minimum on my $41,000 student loan and get the house sooner. Should I pay off the student loan faster and postpone the house?

If it helps I am single, never married, no kids, 30 years old.

tl;dr: Expected promotion should allow me to save up for a house and drop a down payment near $40,000. Or I could put all of that towards my student loan over the course of 2 years and work on the house after student loans are paid off. Which is the best route?

crypto,Design: Plausibly Deniable Encryption,"I have a data container in 4KB of memory that contains a 2KB cat thumbnail image, and my 1KB of secret plans. The remaining 1KB is random.

I have a key file that maps out the arrangement of data from the container. So the key file defines how to sort data out of the container into a block prepared for decryption. However, the key file does not contain any meta data on the files inside the container. It strictly defines the method for sorting the entire container into one long series of blocks.

The encrypted cat pic is arranged to sit at the beginning of the container, meaning the first byte of cat pic data, is the first location derived by the key file, and so on, until the entire 2KB of data has been read. After that point, the 1KB random data exists, still following the data arrangement provided by the key file. Finally, the encrypted secret plans are the final 1KB of data in the container.

I have 2 passphrases that are necessary for decryption/encryption. The first passphrase is for my cat pic. The second passphrase is for my secret plan data.

**Problem:**

When I am accessing my cat pic, the entire key file can be expanded to the full 4KB mapping, even though we only need 2KB of data. I then either:

1. Decrypt the full 4KB with the 1st passphrase, which results in a cat pic, and 2KB of junk. I can then decrypt the entire container again, with the 2nd passphrase and recover my secret plans. This requires encrypting my container by the 2nd passphrase, then by the 1st passphrase.

**It takes longer to access the plausibly deniable data.**

 2. Decrypt the first 2KB and retrieve my cat pic OR decrypt the last 2KB and retrieve my secret plans + junk. But now I have to have some way of defining which of those 2 I want to do. And I have to have a key file... otherwise similarities between the derivations of both keys, may cause the same valid area to be written to by both files... irrevocably destroying data. (My assumption here, I believe to be wrong, but I haven't determined how to say... encrypt the keyfile with the 2nd passphrase, then use that result as the mapping for the cat pic, without overwriting any necessary junk data for retrieving the secret plans.)

**Now everyone knows that a container has at least 2 files in it, even if 1 is nonsense.**

The concept that I have in mind would require a symmetric algorithm that would require a stream of junk data equivalent to the plaintext you are encrypting.

In our example above, the 1KB secret plans are encrypted with a random stream of junk data, resulting in an encrypted 2KB file. This is then fed in as the junk data when encrypting my cat pic, resulting in the 4KB file. No key file required.

Now when the passphrase for the cat is entered, the data decrypts and the junk data is separated from the real data. Then you would have to decrypt the resulting junk data, with some other key, in order to retrieve the secret plans.

This system works just fine, even though you need both keys for the secret plans, but the side-channel is there. It always requires more time to get to the plausibly deniable data.

In court, I'm sure evidence showing repeated decryptions on the same file/object vs. single decryptions, would probably be sufficient to imply that an additional key is required for decryption... and that is a problem.

I'm not trying to find a FD encryption solution... I'm just trying to figure out some way of making the act of accessing the cat pic, or the secret plans, look identical to an outside observer (the only difference being passphrases/keys.) How can I eliminate the side-channel attack?",cryptocurrency,1468349816

A company that I work for in the US has approached me to work full time for them, and since it's a great opportunity I want to make it work.

Things get a bit complicated, as my wife has a job as a teacher, and I don't want to uproot our entire social life, and her career for my new job, unless the offer is very significant, or if she would be able to get employment in the US as well. 

My wife's Canadian and lives in and works in Canada, and I've just started the process of becoming a resident there. I divide my time between Canada and the EU, as my job allows me to travel a lot.

After talking to the company's legal council and my accountant we've figured out the following things.

- If my income comes 100% from a foreign country I'm not liable for Dutch income taxes.
- If I'm hired as a contractor by the American company there would be a 30% tax withholding of my income
- I cannot become an employee of the company unless I relocate to the US, as I need a US tax I.D.
- I would be in a managerial position in this new job, and the company's worried about the implications with me managing other employees while I would be a contractor. 

From my freelance gigs I made about $65k in 2014, $74K in 2015 and the initial offer that's on the table right now is $89k. I haven't negotiated the amount, as I first want to figure out what my next step should be.

Questions:
1. Can I get any of the 30% that's being withheld back?
2. How much more can I reasonably ask for with regards to the job offer?
3. If we were to move to the USA, what's a reasonable relocation fee?
4. The company provides a $20k health care kicker if we were to move to the USA, is that enough to cover everything? 
5. How hard would it be for my wife (Canadian English teacher) to find employment/get a US work vis?
6. How much federal taxes would I be subject too if I were to move to a state without income tax with my current offer?
7. Is there another way to make this work?

personalfinance,Will paying my car loan off sooner help my credit?,"I'm a 23 year college student working on my first car loan.

I owe about $2,500 left on my car, I took a 12,000 loan out in January of 2016, so I have been making payments for about 6 months. I've been paying an extra $500 towards the principal every month along with a few large sumps of random payments here and there.

Long story short at this rate the whole car should be payed off by November 2016. (a total loan period of 9 months with no missed payments of a lump sum of 12k) 

I was wondering should I try and pay this off sooner? I have the loan for 60 months but decided I wanted to pay it off asap since I have a 5% interest rate. I had good credit before I got the car, but the problem was I didn't have enough credit history and no one to cosign for me either which is why I had such a high rate. 

What would be the best course of action. Should I pay off immediately or should I just wait until November, or should I start paying less (maybe only an additional $300 in principal each month instead of $500 so I can get a longer history of making payments.)

Keep in mind this will still keep me well under the 60 month term so I shouldn't have to worry about any issues letting it go a little longer since it's still be payed off way in advanced. But I would rather just pay it off immediately if there is no benefit to prolonging it (again, it would be payed off early no matter what option I pick)

* Credit Union 1 has a checking account at 0.25% interest with a $1/mth fee that we'll close, a money market with 1% interest with a $250 minimum, and a share with a $25 minimum and a 0.75% interest. For this one, we're thinking about just keeping the share open with the minimum balance. 
* Credit Union 2 has share account with a $100 minimum to avoid fees, 0.03% APY.  

What we're thinking:  

* Pros - If we move back to the area, it will be beneficial to keep our memberships here. We could easily get membership to CU#1 through family ties, but CU#2 we likely wouldn't be eligible for unless we ended back up at the same employer. These CUs also have great interest rates on loans, so we may be able to use them for mortgages or car loans in the future.

I'm currently saving ~10k a year, which isn't terribly great. I use Simple Bank and it has a feature where you set a saving ""goal"" and an end date and it automatically stashes x amount a day into savings to meet that goal. 


Curious for some general advice / ""what should I do next"" sort of input. What would you do in my position? My other expenses are fairly minimal, $60/month for cellphone, $70/month for internet. Food for me + my girlfriend breaks down to anywhere from 300-600 a month depending on how crazy we've been eating out (usually around 400/mo though).


Is my 401k enough? Should I be investing outside of the 401k? Roth IRA/mutual funds? ANY tips/advice/feedback/comments are appreciated!",finance,1468362681

personalfinance,Looking for advice on whether to finance or purchase a used car in my specific situation.,"Hi - 

I work full-time and make approximately $40k/yr. I don't have any debt besides my credit card which I pay in full every month.

I just sold my only vehicle for $7500 and I am likely to buy a new vehicle this weekend for $13000. My liquid savings amount to a little over $19k after selling my vehicle. I could purchase this new car in full, but I'm not sure if I should finance it in this case.

I went to my credit union and they informed me that my credit score was top tier and offered me an interest rate of 2.99% on an auto loan, or 3% on a secured two-year loan. I would *at least* put $7500 down on this new vehicle, but was thinking about putting $9500 or $10500 down if I finance it.

My question is whether I should finance the vehicle and take the small hit on interest (while hopefully building my credit further) or just purchase it in full from the dealership. Thank you.",finance,1468364106
personalfinance,Interpreting PF plan correctly?,"I'm a convert from Dave Ramsey, but was getting distracted by the political speak, the rants, the inflexibility.  He's great for many many people and I respect him a lot, but he's maybe not so much for me.

Also I appreciate a good sound plan based on logical principles.  I want some help knowing I am interpreting these steps properly.

Some background: I am single, living with someone.  I make ~70k a year.  I have stopped contributing to my 401(k) as part of the DR plan in order to focus on my debt, which I have brought down to 13k on a student loan and a car loan around 23k, both interest rates are well under 4%.

I have no credit card or other consumer debt.  All credit cards are set to be paid in full automatically.  I use YNAB to manage my budgeting and have incorporated their cash flow plan.

I am due to get a (for me) large bonus of about 7k this month.  I want to make sure I am handling this appropriately.

Plan as I see it (please correct me where I am wrong)

1.  I have budgeted every penny, set up small sinking funds for various expenses (car insurance, registration, gifts, etc.).  I've budgeted for a long time so I know what my real expenses are and they are all handled.

2.  I have a full month's income buffer.  I want to keep this full because it helps with budgeting.  Because I get paid on the 15th and last day of the month and use it to budget the following month, depending on what day of the month it is, it's either half full or totally full.  It's about $3700 at the 1st of the month.

3.  After ensuring the buffer is full, I want to save 1 month's expenses, the minimum I could get by on with a loss in income.  I have calculated this to be just over $2k.

4  After saving that, start 401(k) contributions again, up to the full match.

5.  Save 2 additional month's minimum expenses so the total is equal to 3 months plus a buffer.  I will keep all of this in my credit union's checking &amp; savings accounts.

6.  Max out my Roth IRA.  (Do I do a monthly contribution on this or should I lump sum it as I get chunks of money?)

7.  Go back and contribute to employer 401(k) so total retirement contributions is equal to 15% of pretax income.  Investments are in Vanguard 2045 target date fund.

8.  Save for long term sinking funds (new car, down payment for house).  Where do I keep this money?

9.  Once sinking funds are full, max out HSA.  (what is reason for waiting so long on this?  Can anyone recommend a good place to open an HSA?)

Am I doing this in the right order?  Any feedback is appreciated.",finance,1468365092

Then there are obvious legal requirements and benefits:   Use tax-preferred retirement / HSA accounts.  Keep insurance in force.   Know how self-employment taxes work. 

This post is about less-obvious but still interesting-to-redditors ways to use loopholes / benefits in existing US laws to your advantage.  There's an endless number of these, but some come into play frequently enough that it makes sense to raise awareness about  them.  [Edit: our friends in other countries, especially the UK and Canada, are welcome to lobby for local versions in their associated personal finance subs, see links in the sidebar. I don't know those laws...]

Here are some that you may not already know about:

Tax planning:

- If you earn less than 30K single / 60k jointly, you can use the [Saver's Credit](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) to get a tax credit for a portion of your IRA or 401k contributions, even for Roth contributions.  [Edit: full-time students are not eligible.]

- You pay [no taxes at all on long-term capital gains](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/no-capital-gains-due-for-some-investors-1.aspx) if your taxable income (including those gains) is less than the top of the 15% tax bracket.  That could be $95,000 gross income for a married couple filing jointly.  This is better than a Roth in that you can do this at any age.

- Sales of a personal residence often have [no capital gains tax](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-gains-and-your-home-sale-1.aspx) as well.  Various rules apply.  

- If you rent a room in your house, part of all of your housing expenses (including insurance and utilities) [can be ~~itemized~~ Schedule E expense deductions against your rental income](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) (but you need to declare the rental income).  

- Take advantage of ""[adjustments](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/cut-your-taxes-without-itemizing-1.aspx)"" like student loan interest, tuition, moving costs, etc., that don't require itemization if you are eligible.  

Retirement:

- Employer contributions to your 401k [don't count](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/retirement/employer-match-counts-toward-401k-limit.aspx) against the 18k limit.  

- If you change you mind about making an IRA contribution, e.g. your income becomes too high for it to be allowable, you can simply [remove the money](https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution) before the tax filing deadline without penalty.

-  For redditors with more ""life experience"", you can [increase your contributions] (https://www.trustetc.com/resources/investor-awareness/contribution-limits) to a 401k and IRA at age 50, and your HSA contributions  at age 55.

- Self-employed people have [lots of options](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) for retirement accounts.  This can apply even if you have employment retirement savings.

- [Edit: Think you make too much to contribute to Roth IRA?  Think again!  The [ever-popular Backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/backdoor-roth-ira-high-income-how-to-guide/) may work for you.  [But no, I am not adding the Mega-Backdoor Roth.  There are some places even I won't go.]]

Health insurance:

- If you change jobs and don't have insurance coverage for a time, you have 60 days to elect continuing (COBRA) coverage.  [This works retroactively](http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html); you can decide to take COBRA at day 59 and be covered for the previous 59 days.  [Edit: yes, we get that COBRA is expensive.  But it's free if you wait to elect it and don't need it, but you're still covered because you can elect it retroactively.  Any other health insurance you'd have to pay for but probably still not use.]

- You won't pay a penalty for lack of health insurance if you have a single  [brief coverage gap](http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-coverage-gap-exemption/), which is defined as ""less than three months.""  I.e. May 1 to July 28 is OK.  May 1 to July 31 is not.",finance,1468415438

personalfinance,"$100,000 in student loan debt, new job offered a moving allowance, should I move?","Background: I took a risk and doubled down on my student loan debt. I went back to school for a master’s degree once I finally got fed up with my dead end job and lack of prospects. After 2 years of looking (one while in school, one after graduating), I just started a new job that on the conservative side is a 30% raise. On the generous side it’s a 45% raise if you look only at my base salary. So the master’s has paid off!

The new job is great so far. Nice people willing to mentor me, more money, and opportunities for bonuses on top of that, also stock options. After a loonnggg job search I can’t believe my good fortune! 

The issue: The new job has doubled my commute. My old job was only 17 miles away and against traffic. It was only taking me about 15 to 25 minutes to get to work or home. My new job is 35 miles away and at prime Southern California traffic time. It takes at least an hour to get to work and 1.5- 2 hours to get home. The job has given me a $3,000 moving allowance that expires a year after my start date. The main issue is anywhere close to my new job is at least $200 more a month, $500+ if it’s somewhere you actually want to live. My lease is up in a few weeks and I have found nothing. My current rent is $1015 and is going up to $1070 in the renewal, it’s so low my current rental office asked if I was on low income housing :/. If I go month to month, to avoid being locked into a lease agreement, but I’m looking at my rent being $1270. Currently rentals in my own complex are going for $1300+ for a one bedroom. (Also roommates are not an option. I have cats and I like my space.) 

And then there is $100k in student loan debt. If it wasn’t for that I would move in a heartbeat but I can’t imagine paying huge amounts of money that could go to my debt repayment on a new place to live. It’s my goal is to avoid lifestyle creep and live on $30k a year (which for a single person I think is doable). I want to take my new raise and throw it all on my debt. But the drive is a killer.

I’m getting all kinds of advice from people: go month to month, resign my lease and use part of my allowance to break the lease (equal to one month’s rent) if I find something, or just stay and tough it out. I know part of this decision is purely emotionally (can you handle a long commute? Some can, some can’t).

So what would you suggest? Stay and lose the moving allowance? Resign my lease and use part of my allowance if I find a place at a reasonable price? What would you consider reasonable? I personally set a budget of $1300.

TLDR: Job has given me a $3000 moving allowance, I have to use in a year or lose it. Anywhere near my new job is more expensive and I have $100k in student loan debt to consider. Move or stay?

personalfinance,Pros and cons of Construction Loan,"Husband and I are first time home buyers. Both in our mid-30s, both self employed. Husband is an architect and is interested in building (and designing the home himself). He has several close friends who are contractors who have offered help us with the build at near cost. Buying a home (as opposed to buying a lot and building) is also on the table, so we've been looking at both houses and land. 

Heres where we need guidance: I don't know the ins and outs involved with getting a construction loan. Right now, the empty lots that we've looked at have ranged from 60-70K. We're estimating we'll need 300K for the build. I'm worried if we use a good portion of the money we've saved for our down payment towards a chunk of land, we won't be able to secure a construction loan because our savings will be depleted. I've also read that it's more difficult to obtain a construction loan than a mortgage, and that interest rates on construction loans are higher. Are we potentially setting ourselves up for a bad situation by pursuing the ""build"" route and would we be better off to just look at finished homes? Or is it possible that we could get ""more"" house/a custom house for a similar price if we build, and that the construction loan won't turn out to be as big a deal as I'm imagining? 


Heres our stats: 

Total annual income on average is about 130K

No credit card debt, two solid cars with no note

100K in student loans

Emergency fund has 10K, not to be used for house, also we both have IRAs with about 60K total in them

Have 75K saved for a down payment, plus family have offered us a no interest loan of an additional 10K

Only asset is a small chunk of land we bought a while ago at auction as an investment property and currently have on the market for 35K. Estimating that it will sell for closer to 25K.

No children currently, but one on the way

Houses we've been looking at average about 360-400K. Unfortunately, housing prices in our once-affordable city have ballooned and 400K still doesn't go very far unless you want to live in a dangerous neighborhood

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I’m writing about a complex student loan situation, so sorry for the long post but please bear with me.  I’ve been supporting myself in a big city for 5 years, and have already amounted a substantial amount of debt and just want to avoid any other financial faux paus that will bury me deeper into the hole.  This situation feels so over my head. So to avoid any other mistakes and before I make a rash decision, any wise advice would be greatly appreciate.

  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When I graduated, I got a job with the government and applied for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness  (PSLF) Program and thus, an income based repayment plan. I was approved and have been paying my student loans through Fed Loan Servicing. However, when I visited my parents this past weekend (I live in another state) I saw a letter from a loan servicer about a defaulted federal Perkins loan from my university that has now been accelerated because I haven’t been making my payments. I had no idea about this outstanding loan because I made the (wrong) assumption that all my loans were consolidated with FedLoan Servicing due to the PSLF.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I checked my credit rating afterwards and it has suffered immensely because of it. When I called the loans servicer who sent the acceleration notice, trying to explain the situation/resolve the matter, they said my loans were being transferred to another loan servicer. When I called the second loan servicer, they told me they wouldn’t be able to do anything until my account has been fully transferred and to wait until I get an email from them. They told me during this 3 month “transfer period” nothing would be sent to the crediting bureau and I wouldn’t be penalized for having a defaulted loan.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I asked them once I’m transferred, what my options would be. They told me I would most likely be able to “rehabilitate” my loan. This entails making 9 consecutive qualifying payments and then my loan would no longer be in default/ it would repair my credit.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Well, two days later I get a call from a THIRD company. When they called, I can already tell they were a little shady. They mentioned they spoke with my mother (and her name) but I know my mom would have mentioned it to me.  I asked whether or not they were a collection agency and they gave me a vague answer and said no, they work directly with my university. I thought that didn’t make sense and when I googled them, they were in fact a collection agency.  When I spoke with them they said they would be able to consolidate my student loans together with all my other loans that are in FedLoan Servicing with no problem and that my loan will no longer be in default. I mentioned the rehabilitation option to them and they told me if I went with that option I’d be obligated to pay the full amount in 9 months.  


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In summary, I feel like I’m being misled/scammed and given conflicting information because they know I’m young/slightly naïve when it comes to financial matters. I just would love to know what are the appropriate steps I should take moving forward and if anyone has ever dealt with a similar situation and what they did to remedy it.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Thank you in advance for all your help!
 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ps: I called my university who are the loan providers, and they had no idea that my loan was being transferred from my original loan servicer.  I’m still waiting to hear back from the head of financial aid to figure out what is going on but want to be armed with the appropriate knowledge going forward.


&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, yes, I’ve learned from my mistake and visited the student loan website and verified I had no other outstanding loans that were not being paid for. This Perkins loan is the only one that wasn’t consolidated by Fed Loan Servicing.",finance,1468424887

'ARTICLE 3 - Remuneration

I understood that the money would be coming in to my account, in monthly payments. I hadn't got convenient access to my account for a while so hadn't checked; and assumed all was in order.
Turns out I haven't been paid yet. 
Until now I wasn't overly concerned about this as I had enough money to keep going, and assumed it would work itself out in time, but as it near the end of the season, I'm beginning to wonder. 
In a short discussion I had with the manager once, he claims I need to keep receipts and pass them on to him, for him to do whatever with and then reimburse me - up to x000 euros stated in Article 3.

investing,What if the fed never raises rates?,"I've been struggling with this concept for a bit and was wondering if anybody could shine some light, or correct my assumptions: The fed is having troubles raising U.S. rates because the economy has not demonstrated strong fundamentals - because rates are low, everyone has been flocking to stocks and bonds, thereby inflating the stock market and the bond market. Despite the fact that investors continue buying bonds, the yield on the bonds is low. 

If the fed never raises rates, and everyone continues investing in the stock market due to lack of other options, could the stock market continue to grow to infinity? Why not?

Why is the yield on bonds low? Is it because everyone is buying them anyway, the treasury has no incentive to offer good rates of return?",finance,1468430564

PS. I also have a sixth mortgage which is my primary residence. It is 4% interest rate 30 year and only at around 90% LTV so there is expensive mortgage insurance ($200/month) on it, that if I had the free cash, I would get rid of by paying it down.",finance,1468432771
personalfinance,[x-post from studant loans] Need help with a specific situation for my student loans,"Wall of text:

I have one year left on my degree and have found it the best time to go back due to personal reasons and finish my degree this fall. My issues are listed below:

-Bad credit ~500

-Federal Loan defaulted, went through consolidation program which is supposed to end tomorrow

-Just recently applied for a private loan with a cosigner and was denied

I let a federal loan (~15k) go in to default and have literally just finished bringing that loan out of default through a consolidation program which in hindsight I should have rehabbed the loan it seems. I am having a very hard time securing the rest of what i need to pay tuition and all other fees/costs. The federal loan I had in default meant that I could not lock down my FAFSA contribution but it seems that I should be able to do that now. I have estimated all costs for the next year to be $40,000 and have used that number to apply for a few private loans, which are a slippery slope as is. The co-signer is my father who has an immaculate credit score (770+)

I am looking for any advice/help/information to help me secure the money I need to finish my degree. ANY information is GREATLY appreciated!

consolidation has been approved, I am waiting on the delivery of my credit letter for the federal loan that was in default, so that I can present that to FAFSA and potentially any loan applications that I do apply for in the near future.",finance,1468433153

personalfinance,"24, married. Both unemployed. Basically starting from scratch, except now with debts. Stay tuned?","Late in the game of r/personalfinance or this may have all been avoided. Feeling dumb now, but here's my story.

Happily married after joining active military about two years ago. First time on our own, so young and dumb us decided we could take on the world and proceeded to open several lines of credit (under my name) with just my military job. Spouse soon had own job and started paying off his three debts in collections, responsibly. Except we didn't put anything into savings and constantly spent everything we made that didn't go into bills. ""Why work hard if you can't spend it?"" dumbass high school-ish philosophy.

All was bueno until I (honorably) discharged the army at my two year mark with no deployments but an awful chain of command that may or may not have contributed to my now social anxieties that led me to the decision in the first place. I proceeded to immediately regret that decision when the spouse decided to quit his decent paying job to try to class A truck drive, expecting to make big money and support us. Only he didn't finish the schooling after I took out a hard considered loan (again in my name) to get him through it so he could then take up some marketing job. And then quit two days later because it 'didn't pay enough'. He knows he fucked up, so we have forgiven and not yet forgotten. But okay, no big deal, I'll work a full time job while he job hunts, right? Well, I haven't had any call backs or follow ups to the several interviews I had in my field of HR, even with me calling them each week. Turns out I'm also overqualified to be in a part-time position in even a pet store or fast food. Now we are crashing with friends, going into month two of unemployment. (I started to see why so many veterans struggle with homelessness...)

Not sure if I'm supposed to give all the deets but we have two vehicle loans, an overdue storage unit, and about 4 other lines of credit that I have been call declining for a few weeks now. Mainly bc I have a tendency to avoid worrying thoughts and situations by pretending they don't exist, yet constantly worry that these situations don't go away because I avoid them- I know it's a problem. I just can't seem to buckle down and grit through it without going full on panic attack for an hour while the spouse calms me down. Also, spouse avoids same way, without the panic attacks. Aka, we think we are both irresponsible adults. On the plus side, we both think that. And we now realize that and made choices based on what we know works.

Now he is attempting to sign up with military, but there are complications that aren't private, but I shouldn't discuss. Ayntk is that his chances are 60/40-ish in favor of getting in. We won't know this until maybe late August, says our recruiter. In the meantime we made an executive ""adult"" decision to move back to our hometown two states away to stay/work with our parents. Job rates are dwindling tho and we are not hopeful that we will be able to do it for longer than August. Everything is on such a short timeline that I almost want to avoid moving entirely and just call decline and ignore everything until military gets back to us. Buuuuut we also know that we should be in a position that we can quickly plant new roots and get on our feet in case military says no. 

As far as my benefits go, I'm waiting for a disability rating to come back for a knee injury I had. I don't think the VA can help with much more than that. I still have four months of medical left, but neither of us have dental now. We considered unemployment or state help/welfare but have never done that before. Would it be worth it to even apply knowing that we may be working in another state next month? If we do get approved does it just go away when we get jobs? I'll be doing research and maybe going to talk to a case worker in the local office today, maybe? Lots of maybes. Lots of unknown that makes my skin crawl and my breath short just thinking about it.

Like, was there a memo on how to adult without crashing and burning in fits of anxiety? Because apparently I didn't get the memo and that's what's happening. Really tho, I've been reading some really good r/personalfinance success stories and am hopeful that we can do what we need to to get through this if both buckle down and learn some stuff. After all, we're still technically young, but we don't have to be dumb (or overly anxious and avoid responsibility) anymore.

Tl;dr, Month two of unemployment for us, we have loans and debts building each day, but trying to do what we know works to get back on track. Determined to become a r/personalfinance success story before the end of the year.

Not sure if looking for advice or just some outside perspective and input on the situation. We are simple minds, not very mathematic, so ELI5 would be great! I'll be around today to edit, AMA or whatever. Thanks for stopping by.

Unrelated sidebar, this is my first Reddit account and post ever. Nerveracking af putting my life story in here like this. But I appreciate you all for what you do for this community. I hope to give back someday when we are in a better place.

EDIT: I have applied to positions through USAjobs and my state's gov search! I will actually still receive emails from positions I applied for months ago saying that I do not qualify for the position. I have my fed resume set up also.

EDIT 2: To clear this up, the second job my husband took on promised twice as much than was actually received. When signed on and he began work, they dropped it down to practically 9$/hr at 20 hours. Not that that excuses quitting the job as it would have been out only income, but it was a very sore subject to deal with in our condition and the boss at the firm basically told him 'it wasn't his problem that he misunderstood the terms'. We had both agreed to try for a better position somewhere else but I didn't expect him to leave until then. Yes, we have discussed that he needs to weigh the consequences before making decisions like that and we are now both on the same page of what needs to get done and what needs to happen in the future.",finance,1468435448

stocks,Student Loans and Stocks?,"Hello everyone,

Over the past couple months I have become more serious/interested about my finances and investing. I am an Aerospace/Mechanical Engineering student with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Florida. I do well in school, and am involved in a few engineering clubs.


My family, however, is by no means rich, and I have accrued a solid chunk of student debt. I am in my third year, and two years out from graduation. After the next two years, my debt will be floating around **$45,000** if I don't pay off anything until then.

Over the past three years, my interest rates have fluctuated between **3.86%** and **4.66%**. Each semester, about 25% of the loan was subsidized, and the rest was unsubsidized.

All that being said, I got a $100 stock gift card, and was thinking of supplementing it with a couple more hundred just to get a stock to play around with and keep track off. (Note: I have had a 20hr part time job for the past year and a half).


One of my friends mentioned he had an educational **Roth IRA**, and suddenly that seemed like a good place to put my money. I thought about it more, and then realized, unless I am getting a guaranteed interest rate over 4.66%, it is best to just start paying off my loans, because I am essentially getting that return immediately. It's not the sexy option, but seems like the smartest.


All that being said, aerospace/mechanical engineering has an average entry level salary anywhere from **$50k - $70k** from what I have seen. So I think I will be able to manage my debt. I definitely plan on diving into stocks when I am financially stable, but since time is so valuable, I figured I would try to start early and set myself up for a financially secure, stress free, late 20s and beyond.


TL;DR - As an engineering student that has decent job prospects, what is the best way to manage my loan money and part time job money early on to set myself up for a thriving 20s and 30s. **Stocks? Roth IRA? SOFI?** Or just straight up paying loans off and spending less than I earn.


Sorry for the super long post!

personalfinance,"23, 50k Direct Students Loans coming off deferrence next month, what is my best option?","Good afternoon PF, long time lurker here making my first post. I am beginning a job teaching middle school science and coaching football/track at my dream district this Fall and am about to start paying Navient back the 16 loans worth 50k that they are servicing. My income will be $58,000 before taxes (I live in Texas). My expenses not including Groceries, Entertainment, and Misc/Emergencies is $1,200 a month.

Because of my subject and district I am teaching in I qualify for a forgiveness of $17,500 after 5 years of service (currently 1/2 under my belt). Also after 120 on-time payments the leftovers of my loan are completely forgiven. 

I plugged each of my individual loans into unbury.us (which learned about in this sub!). My question for PF today is what would my best option be? Should I try and pay off the $33,500 + interest by the end of my 5 years? Should I pay the minimum amount possible on each loan for the next 10 years and wait for it all to disappear? Should I consolidate the loans into a Federal Direct Consolidation loan and follow option 1 or 2?

edit: I opened up the Federal Direct Consolidation loan application and they are offering me 5% interest on the consolidated loan.

personalfinance,"Pay off everything and start over, or slower debt repayments over next years?","Heya PersonalFinance,
This is a fact finding mission, I've been thinking about this more and more and I wanted someone that isn't 'in it' to take a glance at it for an outside opinion.  I'm sorry if this gets long, I like to be through. 
Back story.
Wife and I were almost debt (one student loan for $10k remained) free 4 years ago, saved up $24k and a friends daughter was going through a divorce so she wanted to sell her home.  We were able to snag it 10k under costs so we she didn't have to go through a broker and we got a deal on the minor things we had to fix.  
We went from saving almost $3,000 a month to only saving $1,300 a month.  Everything was fine, and then this winter my wife came to me and wanted to change jobs.  Her job was killing her and after a long series of talks, I agreed.  The down side was that she took a 30% pay cut to get out of the field entirely.  

Things went belly up financially but she needed the change and I was willing to work through it so we could recover.   It's taken 9 months but we're no longer bleeding money, but we aren't really making massive headway either.  We pay maybe $300 to $400 in extra debt payment per month.  

The problem is we have just shy of $32,000 in debts now.  A combination of a loan we took out that's got 30 months left on it, that student loan still, which is down to 9k I believe, and 11k in CC debts.

**Debt numbers**  
Unsecured loan  12,250 remaining, 407 per month payment  
Student loan 9,000 remaining, 98 per month payment  
Credit cards 11,000 remaining, 530 per month payments combined.  
  
My thought/plan for your approval/disapproval.
I've always been a big saver, my wife has come around to this over the 11 years we've been together and has been 'on board' for the last 6 years.  I don't have a thought that she'll go behind my back and go charge a bunch of debt behind my back sort of deal.

My thought is this:
I've grown our IRA's to just shy of 32,000.  The debts are close to the same amount. I know there will be a penalty AND taxable event if I drain them to destroy most of the debts.   With that said, I believe the penalty is 10% and all of the money we take out will be added to our taxable income to boot.  I believe we are now in the 77k range (married filing jointly), so this would dump us into the 105k tax bracket (which is the same tax bracket).   Liquidate both accounts, use everything to pay off the unsecured loan and Credit cards, use remaining funds to pay penalty, and whatever is leftover to pay tax bill.

Then by freeing up 937 per month, make that our new 'savings debt' per month into an account until we cover the taxes for that year, I'd go to my tax professional for all of these figures up front, I don't need any surprises.  After that figure is hit, the remaining funds go back into repaying ourselves ASAP.

The aftermath, or Jan 1st going forwards.
This would leave the 9k student loan as our only debt and considering it's interest rate I believe is 3.3% (it's my wife's, I'm sorry I can't recall the interest rate or the exact amount off the top of my head) I don't think it's that critical to pay off before the loan or credit cards, all of which are at 8% or higher.  I hate debts, she's grown to be the same, but I couldn't take her working 60+ hours a week at a job that was killing her and making her come home in tears almost weekly.  I'd rather share the pain and work towards getting us out of debt quicker.

With that said, we wouldn't go back into debt again on the credit cards ever.  We have our $1,000 emergency fund, and that's been there the last 5 years since we started paying our debts off.  I've only used it one time when we had to do a medical co-pay for her spraining her ankle which we repaid the next month.  

I believe this plan COULD have merit if we go back to saving $1,000 a month again compared to making 2 to 3 years worth of snowball or avalanche payments.  

The sticking points that I have.  
1.  I've been very attentive (notice I didn't say 'good') at researching and doing 'my homework' on our stocks in the portfolios.  I turned our 11,000 into 32k in 3 years working my ass off and positioning ourselves in the right places without 'chasing returns'.    I have a feeling that if I 'cash us out' and pay almost everything off, I'm going to miss a massive jump to the upside.    
2.  I don't like taking a 10% penalty OR paying taxes on the money I've grown since I could easily avoid it by just leaving things as is.  
3.  I worry that the tax bill will be higher then I expect (6k to 8k?) since we'll have used up all our deductions like we normally do per year.   
**The good points I'm considering**  
1.  We'd be out of debt in about a month, the rest of the year we'd make a 3 month to 6 month of all combined income emergency fund.    
2.  We'd go from debt service payments a month of $1,000 and savings of $0 to debt service of $94 and savings of $906.  Without considering 'excesses' that would be more likely to end up in our retirement funds compared to 'a little extra debt repaid'.  I think this would honestly 'feel better' in a morale sense.  
3.  We'd avoid paying a TON of interest charges on the Credit card debt.  
  
I've worked in finance before, I've listened to Dave Ramsey before, and I've taken us over a 2 year slog eating beans and rice to pay off $36k last time.  I just see this point where we could have it all over with, almost tomorrow, and we'd start saving for our retirements instead of a long period of 'payoff' again.

And we aren't living 'high on the hog' type of stuff.  We budget our food per week, we go out to eat maybe once a month (mostly $30 total to have a little date night together), we don't drink out, we don't smoke, we don't drive new cars, all vehicles are paid for.  

I'm just unsure and need to know what I'm missing or what I haven't considered.  At the moment I'm not going to touch anything, but I need to know if it would be a good move for us if we weren't going to go out and max the credit cards again.   Honestly, I'd cancel em entirely if I didn't know I'd need to keep building that credit to build our 'forever home' in 5 years.  

So here I am, I hope I can be given good AND bad points for both sides of this I haven't considered.",finance,1468447194

## Recent financials

It's been an aggressive acquirer, so the 5 year view isn't organic growth. 2 years after buying the New York Stock Exchange, finally the synergies have started to come thro'.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|

## Competition

When describing the competitive environment $ICE says:

&gt; The execution markets in which we operate are global and highly competitive. We face competition in all aspects of our business from a number of different enterprises, both domestic and international, including traditional exchanges, electronic trading platforms, data vendors and voice brokers. 

The cosy duopoly of NYSE and Nasdaq is long gone. Trading in all assets is now global, but... if you look at their margins, the figures are anything but shabby ;). Certainly the business is doing a lot better than Nasdaq, and the _monopoly_ players internationally.

## Cash / Debt?
Intercontinental Exchange Inc has $6,273M of net debt. That is 2.6x it's latest operating profit. That's higher than I like... but perhaps given the stability of its revenue stream...

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $285.36 for Intercontinental Exchange Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 11% to their target.

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. It's a little surprising that they don't get more love than Nasdaq or BATS. And why are the commodity exchanges so much more valuable?

# Dividends

Intercontinental Exchange Inc is forecast to pay a dividend of $3.40 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $3.10 per share. That is a 10% growth. The forecast dividend of $3.40 compares to a forecast EPS of $13.88, so plenty of cover. Though given the debt levels, we should be happy to see them using earnings to pay down debt.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 11% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -1%. That's against a backdrop on sales up 36%. Net income up 17%. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ice/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. Where they said

&gt; We delivered solid revenue growth, strong operating margin expansion, and once again, double-digit earnings growth. And importantly, we see strong demand from our customers and encouraging trends across the markets we serve.

So perhaps this is still a top line growth, margin expansion, and de-leveraging story? Apart from those, I can't see any other catalysts. You?

personalfinance,"Graduating nursing school with ~45,000 in debt. Student loan questions.","Okay bear with me as I'm going to give you the rundown on my situation. I'll try to keep it concise. 

As the title says, come September, I'll have about $45,000 in student loan debt. 25K of that is federal loans with a fixed interest rate of ~4.5%, and the remaining 20K is a private loan with a fixed interest rate of 8.24%. Both of these I am not required to start paying off until next March. I currently have about 10k in savings as I've been working through school. My expenses total about $1000-1200/month (living on the cheap), and I'm making about $1500-1600/month. I've also been offered my first nursing job which I will be able to start in mid October making ~60k/yr. I've started making minimum payments on my private student loan. My questions are as follows:

- Should I make a lump sum payment right now of ~4K (leaving me with 6K in savings) to pay off the current interest and start paying off the principle on the private loan? I'll also be receiving $2500 from my employer for working there and going to school in August.

- Once I start my actual job as a nurse I'm planning on putting down as much as possible towards the private loan to pay it off ASAP. I've never made near this much money before and am wondering how much I should put away monthly for tax season?

- What other financial steps might you take in my situation, if any, regarding paying off the loans and continuing savings?

Thank you all so much for your help. If I've missed some crucial element of the story let me know and I'll try to fill in the gaps. Thanks again",finance,1468454288
personalfinance,"(US) Auto Loan, high interest. How would I go about this?","Hello, long time reader, and I've gotten myself into a bit of a pickle, or at least something that I think can be improved. Due to an auto accident earlier this year, my wife and I found ourself needing a car on short notice, without a lot of cash on hand. We didn't want to completely wipe out our emergency savings, as it was low from some unexpected medical bills prior.

Long story short, I didn't do my due diligence on the auto loan. The salesman predicted ""About 2.5% if you use our guy"", which of course ended up being 4.990% on a 48 month loan from Wells Fargo Dealer Services. Both my wife and i are on it. I have a 790 credit score, but my wife had no credit history, so we thought this would be a way to build it.

We currently have just over $6,000 left on the loan. I've been making above minimum payments ($250 instead of $150), and have been putting almost every extra bit of cash into this that comes my way. I currently have 29 months left by my calculations, 20 if I can put down $2,000 I have coming in unexpectedly this month.

Here's my question: Is there a way to either refinance this, or to take out a personal loan through my bank to pay this loan off and end up with a lower interest rate?

personalfinance,"Mortgage Lender performed two credit checks over 4 months apart. As a result, credit score dropped and offered interest rate has increased.","Hello,

Let me start by saying I have great credit (average of ~760 from the 3 majors). As a result, I went mortgage shopping in March 2016 for a mortgage and got pre-approved for a great rate from a large Credit Union. Please keep in mind that I had several hard iniquiries within this 3-4 week period, but this is covered by the hard inquiry grace period that allows individuals to shop around for the best rate.

Fast forward to now: I went into escrow on a house late June 2016, and the mortgage lender created a new application and performed another credit check on me on in July 2016 (without my consent). As a result of this new hard inquiry, my credit dropped to an average of ~740.

The mortgage lender is now telling me, because of this drop, they can no longer offer me the rate they were previously offering me and instead have to offer me a rate that is 0.05% higher.

In reality, this is a nominal fee that results in me paying a small amount more a month. Having said that, I do not feel like I am entitled to pay this extra amount per month given that it was not my fault my credit decreased. I did not authorize a second credit check, either - if I had known a credit check would happen I would have prepared my accounts for it. 

What is /r/personalfinance's thoughts on this? The lender seems sympathetic, and he has forwarded a letter I have written about the situation to the credit union sales manager.",finance,1468455915

personalfinance,"New to USA, wife wishes to take a loan to pay off credit card debt. We feel confident to be able to not reload the credit cards.","Hey all,

So, recently married (i'm canadian, wife is american) and I've moved down to the USA.  HURRAY!!! Finally with my family...

My past:  I've always had a good job (in canada) and it allowed me to manage my finances so that I'm debt free with some retirement cash (in canada at the moment) and some emergency fund (also in Canadian dollars...so i'm not looking to use it unless I HAVE to).  Currently, I've got a stable employment making 45k/y.

My wife:  Different story... has a job for many years (45k/y).  Had to live paycheck to paycheck due to some bad decisions (and previous bad marriage).  She's racked up about 15K in credit card debt (multiple cards), all of which is at over 20% interest.  Most debt was not racked up by her..she's just stuck in the mess.

*Plan 1:
We feel confident that we can take out a loan (IF they lend to us... credit score for my wife is about 700 depending where you look) and pay off the credit cards without resorting to using the credit cards in the meantime and due to my emergency fund (again, which is in canadian so I would rather not convert it right now).

So, how does this work?  We could go to our bank and ask for a loan/line of credit but there are so many other options if I go on bankrate.com or lendingtree.com.  Much better than what our bank is offering... 

How does it work?  I'm not from the USA and it seems a little bit more complex here than in Canada.  Do we simply take the lowest interest rate? Example... it seems that Lightstream and LendingClub come up often... do we simply apply and POOF, that's it?

*Plan 2:
Snowball/Avalanche method (which I think is preferred here on Reddit).
- If this is still the consensus even with what I wrote above, is there a website/spreadsheet that would show the difference between paying things off Snowball/Avalanche **VS** equal payments on all her credit cards? 

My wife doesn't feel too fond of opening another credit card account and transferring the amount onto a lower % card (even 0% for 12-15 months)..... so that's not an option unfortunately for the moment.

Advice and thoughts on how to proceed would be welcome.  
Does this make sense?  


Thanks!

personalfinance,College debt,"Hi! So I owed my community college a little over $1,300 for a summer class I took last year. I never set up a payment plan but was saving up money to pay the debt in full. 

Recently I got a letter from a collection agency, Maryland department of budget and management ""notice of intent to offset."" 
The letter informs me that I now owe $1,500 and that interest will continue to accrue. 

They tell me I have an outstanding balance for marylsnds ccu and it says that any federal vendor payments that I may be entitled to will be applied to this debt unless I make satisfactory arrangements within 60 days. (What does that even mean?) 

Then they say that the department of treasury charges a $17 fee for each payment offset which will be deducted from my payment amount. (What does that mean?)

 I didn't know that my school could default my loan to a ccu and wasn't given notice that they would be sending the debt to them if I didn't make a payment. I also didn't know ccu could add in interest while you were still enrolled in school. 

If anyone could offer advice on what to do and clarity on what exactly this letter is talking about in regards to ""federal vendor payments"", I would really appreciate it. 

If the only thing I can do is save up and pay as quickly as I can, that's fine. Such is life. But I don't want to be taken advantage of due to a lack of knowledge.

personalfinance,"If I'm in the 0% capital gains tax bracket, can I sell and immediately buy back my gains to ""launder"" them as purchases for future sales?","I'm on pace to make about $55k this year but am deducting a lot through tuition expenses, my 401k, HSA, Roth IRA, etc. My aim is to deduct just enough to get to the 15% federal income tax level of $37,650.

Not only is this income level optimal for income tax, but anyone in the 15% bracket also pays 0% on capital gains taxes. I'd thought this capital gains tax wouldn't matter to me much, as I'm mostly just saving this money for a house/condo in about 10 years and not planning to sell my index funds anytime soon (and pay the corresponding capital gains taxes).

However, I recently had an epiphany: My Vanguard index fund has earned about $7k since I started investing 2+ years ago. Would it make sense for me to:

1. Defer enough income into my 401k this year such that I'm just below the 15% income (and corresponding 0% capital gains tax) level.

2. At the end of 2016, sell all my index funds (and gains they've made) that I've held for over a year (i.e. would qualify for the long-term capital gains tax rate), and pay 0% capital gains tax on all of those gains.

3. Immediately buy back my index funds and bake my previously accumulated capital gains (on which I just paid 0% tax) into my portfolio so that these assets are ""laundered"" as investment purchases rather than as capital gains (on which I'd have to pay capital gains taxes on in the future when my higher income puts me beyond the 15% income tax bracket).

Is this plan a good idea?",finance,1468463117

personalfinance,"Getting 14k unexpectedly, could also use some 403b/Roth advice","I know that I'm not in terrible financial shape, and I know I am very fortunate. However, i'm trying to learn as much as I can and would like to get some advice. So a bit about my current situation: 

My mom recently sold her house and wants to give me 14k. 

I'm making 40k a year, contributing 12% to my 403(b) with a 4% match (yay!). Most of my money goes into a Vanguard Target Retirement Account, about 15% goes into the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX). I also have a Roth IRA through Vanguard (opened this year, about 3.5k in it), which again is a Target Retirement Account.

I'm in grad school, and have taken out loans to pay for it. Interest rate is 5.8%, so I've been paying it off as quickly as possible. I have about 9k left in undergrad loans, but they are around 3% interest so I have not been paying towards them lately. I'll be in deferment until Jan 2018.

I have no credit card debit, no other loans or mortgages, cheap and good health insurance. However, I also have no emergency fund. My mom has made it very clear that she would help in emergencies, luckily for me I haven't had to take advantage of that, and I would not want to. 

So my plan is, and please offer any suggestions!, is to:

1) Establish an emergency fund, about $2000 for right now, likely in an Ally savings account. I'm open to other account suggestions, including investing in bonds or something.

2) Max out my Roth for the year. i'm not sure if I've made the best investment choices with the Target fund. Any suggestions? It seems like I can't get the typically recommended Vanguard index funds on my account for some reason.

3) Put about 12.5k towards my loans.

4) Have about 1k left over for some travel this fall and a little discretionary spending.

Thoughts? Should I pay less towards my loans and invest some of that money? Any recommendations for funds to consider through Vanguard?",finance,1468465845

personalfinance,Collection being returned to original creditor...what do I need to know about interest rates and setting up a new payment plan?,"Okay, I'll be as briefly specific as possible.

Debt originated from a credit union, the accounts were closed because I got scammed by a fake offer of employment (another lesson learned, unfortunately). Checking account and credit card account sent to collections with outside agency, we'll refer to the company as EX from here on in.

Accounts totaling over $5000 combined, no income and no job to speak of. When I do finally find employment, they start harassing me about my payments, I start paying $50 since I'm only working part time at minimum wage. I end up getting promoted at work, and since EX is keeping tabs on me, they call my employer to ask about my new pay rate to try and figure out how much they can  squeeze me for. I make a payment arrangement with someone for $125/month, the absolute highest I can afford, and they agree and I start making payments.

Couple of months down the line, I get contacted by another representative from EX, demanding $300/month or they're going to take legal action. I flip my lid, and reach out to my contacts - one of whom happens to be a lawyer. He's not in collections law, but having an ""Esquire"" on correspondence regarding the matter seemed to calm them down - I got served papers at work (embarrassing) regarding the suit, but they eventually backed down after my lawyer friend told them - essentially - they were being idiots, since i was still making timely payments, just not in the amount that they would prefer.

Sorry for all the backstory. Found out today while making calls on other collections that just came to my attention (don't even get me started) that my debt at EX had been sent back to the originating credit union. I called the credit union and spoke with a rep (who was, admittedly, very new to the company - she'd been there a week maybe) who said I could continue making the monthly payments of $125/month that I'd been making to EX. When I asked about an interest rate on the debt, she said she didn't have enough information and would have to call me back. She hasn't - so I'm trying to figure out exactly what happened...if there's an interest rate on the balance due, if the payment amount of $125 is going to cover the interest AND pay down the balance, or if it'll just be a drop in the bucket. Any advice is appreciated. I live in WA state if that's any help for jurisdiction, and the debt is currently at $3000 outstanding.

Thank you!

UPDATE: I called the credit union and asked them about the interest rate and everything - since I had been making regular payments to EX on the principal balance since it had been sent to them, the credit union was willing to negotiate a settlement for 80% of the principal balance, and I will not be responsible for any interest accrued while the account was with EX. My lawyer has recommended that I talk to the credit union about the lawsuit filed by EX and ensure it is dismissed with prejudice so EX can't file again. Lesson - call and ask, be polite, and gather as much information as possible before agreeing to any payment plan.",finance,1468468435
personalfinance,Need help understanding mortgage equity over 30 years,"Hi all,

I'm not sure I am understanding equity correctly so though maybe someone can answer it for me.

We are purchasing our first home and I've found that with a 4.5% interest rate, after about 30 years, if you bought a $200,000k house, after 30 years you've really paid close to $400,00k - so almost double.

Well, the thing is, unless the house increases in value too (doubles) - haven't you really lost a lot of money in interest? Instead of ""gaining"" equity?

For example if you own the house after 30 years yes you ""own"" at least $200K in equity, maybe the house is worth $300K by then - but you've paid $400K, so really haven't you ""lost"" over $100k?

So, I'm not sure I see why equity is such a big deal? Because you've paid a lot of money out. It's not really gaining you anything - unless the property at least goes up, but to really gain it would have to also double in value too.

Am I just confused?

For example if someone rented for 30 years at $1500 / month they would probably end up paying the exact same, but of course I guess they wouldn't have $200k in equity left? But they've..""lost"" less?...

As you can tell I'm a bit confused as to how equity really works to your advantage (I know the rent guy's rent would probably just go up over time too - one of the benefits of a mortgage is your payments stay the same, although property tax can keep going up though)

personalfinance,Financial advice needed for an older student who is taking on debt!!!,"Hello,

I have a few questions about investing money while being a full time student who is incurring debt. First off, I am 27 years old, married, and have a 3-year-old child. I had been working in the food service industry while going to community college. In January I quit my job to become a full time student ( BS in Nursing.) Last year my wife and I made a combined income of $55K. For the previous 3 years I had been making about $30K a year working full time. I had been contributing to a 403b, and also to some sort of retirement pension account, one or both of which were being matched at some rate by my employer. I quit that job after 3 years, I believe I needed to work there for 5 to be vested, and I am not sure how much money I have in each account. I also have about $3K in a 401k from a job a few years ago.

I own my home, which was purchased 3 years ago for $169K with an FHA, and is worth about $280K now. I will be graduating in Dec 2017, and should start out making about $70k-90k a year, before tax ($40-50/hr, 36 hrs a week, 50 wks a year). Unfortunately, in the mean time I am having to rely on student loans to pay my mortgage, and some of my bills. I currently owe about $12K, with three semesters to go. The student loans are federal, some of it is subsidized and some is unsubsidized. I recently got approved for a HELOC at 4.5%, but that rate varies with the market each quarter, unless I lock a portion in. My max is $40K, but I haven’t touched it yet. 

I have no credit card debt, but have $250 a month in car payments between two vehicles. The principle balance between the two loans is about $8300. I have $6500 in savings. My wife had to quit her job due to my school schedule and now works as a waitress on the weekends. She usually makes $100ish each night on top of her hourly wage. 

Should I start contributing to a ROTH IRA? Should I try to take the money from my other retirement accounts and put it into a ROTH IRA or some sort of ETF? Should we try to use some of the money my wife is making to contribute to some sort of retirement account, or use it to incur less debt? I am a little scared about taking on this much debt to make it through school, but absolutely do not want to sell my house. I should be ok as long as I can land a job in my area.

Any thoughts, advice, or reading material would be greatly appreciated.

I know everyone says get a beater and pay in cash but I'm wondering if a dealer would be able to get me a loan. I'm aware a beater would be a smart decision but with my current budget I can afford to make payments easily since I have no bills. I currently checked and my credit isn't looking too stellar, it's at 600. I'm 23, just opened a credit card in November. I have low utilization, one loan out with a balance of $2500 from college and that's it. I'm currently paid off the books which in hindsight wasn't the greatest move.

I'm going to be getting a new job soon which will require me a drive so I need to start looking for a car. After checking a few cars full coverage would be around $300 a month which leaves me with about $2100 for car payments and gas which I assume is a lot. My boss has offered to pay for the car with no interest but that would require high payments of about $400-500 a week and that would leave me with almost nothing for a while.

Is there anyway I could get a loan for that amount? My boss has offered to write me a letter stating how long I've been employed with my weekly earnings and his contact information as well. I looked at a few non-certified dealers that say ""anyone can be approved"" and they only asked for a job letter and bank statements. My bank statements show I deposit about $1500-1800 a month so I don't know if that would be a problem since I usually just pay cash.

personalfinance,Serious dilemma. I am starting med school in a month but live in Gf/soon to be fiancee needs a new car though.,"Hello everyone. A friend told me about this subreddit.

This is my dilemma. 

My live in girlfriend / soon to be fiancee (have not asked yet, but we have been discussing and looking at rings) needs to get a new car. 

The GF
* current car= 03 audi with $5100 still owed (was ~13% interest rate when she got it, she didn't want a cosigner) . She currently pays ~$425/month (car +insurance)
* Income= ~$55K/year, but about to increase to ~65k/year when she starts her new job
* Savings=~$2000
* Credit score=~695 Transunion
* Debt=~60K (~90%is due to student loans)

Me
* Currently no debt
* Have about $6K in savings
* At the moment make ~$45K/yr
* Credit score is = ~760 transunion
* Starting Medical School in 1 month.

The credit union we went through is willing to give us ~22K  for a used car ( 2013 Subaru) but only if we both are on the loan. This would be in addition to the $4000 we would put down.
She likes because it has a good warranty still, and comes with a few nice things like moonroof, leather, touchscreen infotainment, etc. Dealer is willing to give us $1350 trade in value, but we will still owe ~$3750 which would be rolled into the cost of the car. 

Am I over reacting a bit in thinking that this vehicle is a bit too much money, especially when I am about to start med school. The biggest issue is that we have to rollover the negative equity from her audi. 


**TL/DR**

GF/fiancee needs a car but wants a $20K car, but still owes $5k on her old one. Bank will give us $20K but only if we are both on the loan. I am willing to put in $4K as a down payment, but only have $6k saved up. I will be starting med school in 1 month while she will be making ~65K but owes ~$50K in student loans.

personalfinance,How much do I need to earn to claim an expense on my taxes?,"**I got a pretty solid answer. See Edit, below.**

I'm fresh out of college, and I'm trying to save all that I can.

Currently, I work as an analytical chemist, but I do work on the side for beer money on [Rev](https://www.rev.com/) (freelance video captioning).

Of course I'll be paying federal taxes on my regular job, but Rev doesn't take taxes out (I think.). You're considered a freelance worker, there. Anyway--with that being said, since Rev requires an internet connection, would it be possible to claim my internet bill as an expense? I make no more than $30/week on Rev. Saying I'd earn an annual $1500 is generous. 

My internet bill is $60/month. As it is required for the job, I can convince *myself* that it could be classified as an expense, but I'm not sure if I'll be laughed out of the office if I try to claim my $1000 internet bill should be an expense for my $1500 job. Worse yet, if I do my taxes on my own, and wind up committing a serious crime in doing so.


EDIT: Thanks for the quick answers. I understand that I could claim a percentage of my bill, relative the amount of time I spend using my internet for business usage, but for the small amount of time I'm spending, and money I'm making, it's likely not worth the effort of saving the legal $6 or so I'd claim.",finance,1468499575

gaming,G2A gray area and scam 2016 (All Sellers &amp; Buyers should respond here!),"Hello there, I am going discuss how we can stop major scam that happens in 3rd party sites that sell products while having marketplace where buyer and seller can interact to purchase product cheaper than what official MSRP offers.

Now as a buyer I had the worst experiences of how G2A system judge before confirming ""seller"" can also be a fraud with stolen key, I am not saying every seller do have a stole key code or purchased stolen ones.

No matter how hard G2A tries to please customers and consumers over the years, there's one way or another of marketplace system gets abused by frauds, both parties as buyers and sellers.

Even if evidences provided that seller or buyer can be fraud or seller did obtain an illegal copy of a game which was sold in marketplace, there's no way that as buyers can confirm if the game copy was illegally purchased or not..

Yes some sellers are legit buying keys from manufacturer and can buyer at fault sometimes for not confirming the key while copying or just typing key incorrectly and at times it's sellers fault of not manually checking if key was typed /copied correctly.

So it's depends on both parties.

Now how scam can happens?
It's really easy anyone out there can provide an evidences or false evidences which that needs an extra investigation, but in G2A  Resolution Centre department once evidences provided fake or is not it will return to the most believable evidences.

So basically it's such shady business that those who do pay 2 euros for G2A shield in FTC(Federal Trade Commission), that considered permanently illegal, G2A should follow full standards for buyer and seller protection for free and it can become illegal when x seller been scammed from a buyer or x buyer been scammed from purchasing a marketplace product that listed by a seller.

No matter what G2A system offers of protection by default any ""scam"" shady buyer or seller G2A should follow standards of making sure that doesn't happen.

As i mentioned about FTC, yes it's correct I've filed up a complaint with of how 5 attempts from sellers trying to get the cash flow from me, main while I've purchased over 51 products and G2A system did misjudge the out come of the last attempts from a fraud.

So in conclusion if you're a buyer or a seller of legal age as 18 in some states or 21 in some countries and you felt that G2A system did misjudge the out come of your personal case, I would encourage you to contact me privately so I can update the FTC case with enough evidences, I would like to ask a real evidences that you could provide so i can include them to the current case when they would ask for an update.

I do encourage Buyers and Sellers who uses G2A marketplace to stay out from it for the main time, also if fraud attempts did happen to you or someone you know, let them to read this topic and hopefully

personalfinance,IRS withholding calculator is telling me 16 allowances - is this thing right?,"Hey folks,

New to /r/personalfinance. Long story short, I own a house and expect to pay ~$11k in mortgage interest and ~$13k in property taxes this year. I got married last year as well and ended up filing 2015 taxes jointly with my wife. Our combined income is bit over $140k. Currently both our withholdings are not setup correctly and we received a $9k federal refund this past year. I want to adjust my withholding significantly so my biweekly take-home is higher. Call me lazy, but I'm finally getting around to it. I plugged all of our numbers into the IRS online calculator including taxes paid for current pay period and year to date. At the end, it told me I should setup 16 allowances for myself ($120k job) and 2 allowances for my wife ($20k job), and that we should both change our W4 status to 'married'. The married part obviously makes sense, but the number of allowances for myself seems high. Is this normal?

The calculator also stated that these numbers are good for the 2016 year - but would need to be re-calculated at the beginning of 2017 and withholding re-adjusted. My suspicion is that the allowance number is high for myself due to the fact that I've already paid a substantial amount of property taxes and mortgage interest thus far in the current year, and my paycheck has already withheld a good chunk of federal taxes too. Does this sound right?

Thanks in advance! I'm so glad I found this subreddit as I've already learned a ton regarding IRA's as well!

These are mostly stocks in individual companies like Apple, Proctor &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson and a number of others I have not been made aware of yet.  Considering markets are volatile, and individual businesses are exceptionally prone to stock swings I am concerned that having large sums of shares in any one business is too much of a risk for an inexperienced investor.  

I currently own a home which I purchased 8 years ago for $115,000 at 6% interest, which is down to almost exactly $100,000 in principal.  Considering the high interest rate I was so blessed with (stupid kid and made bad decisions with money) it seems like taking $100,000 of the inheritance and liquidating it to pay the mortgage would be fairly beneficial thing to do.  

I work as a software engineer and have stable employment so I do not foresee the home as being a burden in the future as an illiquid asset.  I would start saving a considerable sum of what my mortgage payment used to be in short term CDs and an emergency fund, as well as increasing contributions to my 401k and Roth 401k.

personalfinance,Accelerate mortgage payment or invest in index fund? What factors should one consider?,"I’m trying to determine whether to pay extra on a mortgage or invest that extra amount instead. I’ve read on this topic in a lot of places, including this sub, and I’ve seen very different advice. It’s not clear to me what factors or analysis to use. Here’s the scenario:

•	30 year mortgage @ 3.75%. 29 years remaining.

•	35% marginal tax rate. Itemized deductions = interest payments are fully deductible

•	$500 / month available for extra payment or investment

•	Investment will be Vanguard index. Assume tax-favored retirement investment (401K, IRA) is already maximized.

•	Selling house within 5-10 years

I’ve calculated my effective mortgage interest rate is ~2.35%. If I assume an average annual 5% rate of return on the investment, the rate of return clearly exceeds the effective mortgage interest rate. Seems like the investment has a clearly better return, but is that the end of the story?

Using the calculator on Bankrate, five years of extra payments results in ~$33,000 reduction in loan balance compared to standard payment schedule (I used year 6 for this comparison b/c I am 1 year into the loan). By contrast, $500/month in an investment account at 5% compounded annually is ~$34,000. The investment beats out the mortgage by $1000 after 5 years. After 10 years, the gap appears to be about $5,000 ($72,000 reduction v. $77,000 investment total). So investment appears to be a better option, although it isn’t as pronounced as I might have expected.

But shouldn’t I also consider the difference in tax treatment when the gains are realized? Proceeds from the sale of a primary residence will be tax free (assuming exclusion eligible), while gains from the investment will be long term capital gains at 15/20%. So now the numbers look more like:

•	5 years: $33,000 from pre-payment v. $33,400 or $33,200 post-tax from investment ($4000 gains taxed at 15 or 20%)

•	10 years: $72,000 from pre-payment v. $74,450 or $73,600 post-tax from investment ($17,000 gains taxed at 15 or 20%)

So now the difference between the two appears negligible. Is this the right answer? Or am I excluding factors I should include, or including factors I shouldn’t? Or is my math wrong somewhere?",finance,1468515747

personalfinance,Paying down student loans?,"Hey all! Its about that time to start paying down my student loans and I'm looking for the most efficient way to pay them down to avoid the most interest. My loans are all under the same provider, but are grouped into different ""groups"". Here's my data:

Group A: 3,500 @ 4.5%. Current month interest = ~13.00

Group C: 8,077 @ 3.4%. Current month interest = ~22.00

Group D: 4,588 @ 3.86%. Current month interest = ~14.00

Group E: 2,332 @ 4.66%. Current Month interest = ~8.50

Group F: 2,334 @ 4.29%. Current month interest = ~8.00


Now I know about the avalanche method where you kill the loans with the highest interest rate first. Though, seeing the high dollar amount in interest on my lowest interest rate makes me wonder if I need to alter that practice to get the best results. My loan provider allows me to pay directly to one specific loan if I choose to do so,

I was thinking about focusing on Group C at first (not the whole balance), and ignoring the interest on all other loans besides group C, thus allowing them to capitalize, but it would also give me more money to pay down the principal on group C. I would continue these payments, and then once another loan starts accruing more interest for that month, switch to that paying that one.

Eventually all of the loans would end up roughly equaling out for their accrued interest per month, then I would pay down the highest interest rate from then on.

Am I missing something? It seems a little convoluted, especially since I would be allowing interest to capitalize on the other groups, but it seems like this would be the cheapest way to go about eliminating my loans?

We talk about what their construction loans entail, interest rates, etc. I mentioned that the final loan would be a USDA rural housing loan, and I was told they didn't think that was possible. She immediately called someone at their main branch to confirm, and then she told me that USDA loans like we were wanting to get could not be used when building a house. The reason given was that at the end of the construction loan, it would need to be refinanced to pay it off and be turned Into the permanent loan we are seeking, and a USDA loan cannot be used towards refinancing anything, except in the case of another USDA loan. 

As this confused me greatly, I spoke with my mortgage lender, and she told me that person was mistaken, and she had done this multiple times using a USDA loan for building a house, that they consider it a new dwelling since it is a new construction. 

At this point, my wife and I have tried to research this on our own, but we are finding conflicting information as well. So, we turn it over to you guys to help set us straight. We want to be fully informed with this, and we can't right now until we have this cleared up. Any information you can provide would be great, and if this is the wrong subreddit let me know where I should go and I will post there.

personalfinance,"ESPP, Max 401k, Payoff Debts, or Taxable Brokerage Account?","Hello everyone, I have just started down the path to r/finacnialindependence and was hoping I could get some advice from the PF community.

I'd like help deciding my next FIRE move and if my employer's Employee Stock Purchase Plan is worth it (15% discount)? I have concluded that for the most part it should almost be a ""guaranteed return"" for me. I am just unsure what I should do next. 

For 2016 I have opened up the HSA (will max this tomorrow) and my roth IRA (should max in November). I am not contributing to the 401k yet because I am not eligible for the 6% match until April 2017. In early 2017 I hope to front load the max to both the HSA and IRA and then throughout the year contribute up to the match for the 401k. 

I still have some debts and will pay off a 6.55% interest rate student loan by year's end. Now where to go from here? Pay off the rest of my debts? Max the 401K? Max the ESPP? What are your suggestions?


ESPP details:

""You may contribute the minimum of $25 of each paycheck on an after-tax basis. The maximum contribution allowable in any one calendar year is ($25,000) $21,250 by employee. XXX funds the cost of the 15% discount that is included in this ($25,000) maximum. Your payroll deductions are held by XXX in a non-interest-bearing account through what is typically a thirty day “purchase period” and at the end of the purchase period shares are purchased. Typically, the purchase period will be between the 16th of a month and the 15th of the next month. The purchase price is 85% of the closing stock price of XXX stock on the last business day prior to the 15th of the month (assuming the typical purchase period).You may increase, decrease or cancel your contribution only once during a purchase period; any change is processed as soon as administratively possible.

XXX requires you to hold stock purchased under this Plan for a minimum holding period of one year. You cannot sell or transfer this stock during the 1-year holding period. Earnings associated with the disposal of your shares of stock are subject to taxation but will vary depending on how long you have held them. XXX pays all expenses associated with Plan purchases. As the participant, you will be responsible to pay all commission fees on the sale of your stock.

personalfinance,Paying of Loans/Emergency Fund,"Hello All!

I have a question about my student loans and whats the best way to repay them.

Firstly, I have just graduated from undergrad and I am looking forward to starting graduate school in August. From my undergrad I have three loans:

Direct Sub Stafford Loan: 2,841.17 (4.66% fixed interest)

Private loan: $3,500 (Interest rate increases per year first six years. Starts at 1% and caps off at 6%; will accrue during grad school)

Private Loan: 8,000 (interest rate for first 2 years: 6%, after 8%, will not accrue during graduate school)

I have about $5,800 in my emergency funds right now and would like to pay off one of these loans. 

Is this a smart idea? If it is, which one should be the first to go? I was thinking about paying off the Direct Sub Stafford Loan, but wanted to see if the users of /r/personalfinance had any suggestions.

personalfinance,"I'm in collections for a semester in grad school (18,000 USD but not from student loans). What are my option?","Hello,

As you see, I am using a throwaway. I apologize for the length of this post and thank you for any advice. 

Anyway, I am in a slightly unusual situation. I grew up in the United States but am undocumented so I never qualified for any government loans to go to college.

I was able to attend nonetheless thanks to scholarships and some financial assistance from a wealthy family friend. After I graduated I was accepted to a prestigious but expensive graduate school. 

I didn't have a good enough credit history to receive a loan to cover the costs nor could I find a qualified cosigner. Even so, the same family friend that helped pay for my undergraduate degree said that he would help me out with the costs of grad school as well so I decided to attend. Unfortunately, stuff fell through so I wasn't able to pay and after the semester I was on the hook for roughly $20,000.

While this might sound like a sob story so far, let me take a quick interlude to note that I know how badly I screwed up in the situation and that I take full responsibility for it.

Anyway, after failing to pay, I found a professional job and started making payments of $1,000 a month to the university (which really left me with no disposable income) in the hopes that they wouldn't report me to a collections agency. Eventually, I was able to bring what I owed down to $14,000.

Even so, I wasn't paying fast enough so the school ended up reporting me to a collection's agency nonetheless. 

A few months later, I was contacted by and talked to a debt collector. Because of the fees associated with reporting my debt, what I owed jumped back to about $20,000.

After speaking to the debt collector, I got on a $600 a month payment plan and I currently owe a little less than $18,000.

Surprisingly enough, throughout all of this (a time frame of about 6 months) my credit was not negatively affected by my being in collections. In fact, despite a relatively low income for a professional job ($36,000 a year) I was managing and had good credit.

About a month ago, the debt collector called me and informed me that the reason my debt never showed up on my credit report was because they had trouble with their computer systems and weren't able to report it.

He suggested that I take a loan to cover what I owe and pay them back before they report my debt (within a time frame of about 2 weeks). I tried to do that but my earnings weren't enough to cover an $18,000 loan and, once again, I had no qualified cosigners to ask for help.

This is where I am now. While I realize that I screwed up by attending a school I was unable to pay for I do feel hard done by for basically throwing away $6,000. What is more, with payments of $600 a month, I hardly feel like I am making a dent in what I owe (given the high interest rates).

Unfortunately, I am living pay check to pay check and really have no more money to give the debt collectors. Now that I know my debt will be reflected on my credit report shortly, I almost feel like I have nothing to loose and so I am looking to see if there is anything I can do to lower the amount I owe.

I am wondering if any of you have any advice you can give me?

I would love to pay back everything I owe but, honestly, given what I currently make, I see no way of ever digging myself from under this debt.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1468526742

personalfinance,Risks of taking a 401k loan to pay off massive amounts of credit card debt?,"Hello! 

I'm in need of some advice from people who know more than I do about this kind of stuff. 

I'll make a long story short and try to stick to just the pertinent 
facts to make this easy on everyone. Also, I'm in the US if that matters at all.

Basically, I'm swimming in debt with multiple credit card payments that total more than my monthly take-home pay. 

I've made payment arrangements with a couple of the cards that had a minimum monthly payment upwards of 700 each to bring those into manageable payments of half that, but lately I've been considering taking a loan against my 401k to help pay the rest.

The interest rate is 3.5% and I can qualify for just over $20k pre-approved, with which I can pay off many of the lower balance cards I owe (for some reason the lower balance cards seem to have a higher monthly payment). I have to recheck my math, but I think if I do this, then I can afford the rest of the monthly payments for other outstanding credit cards.

I've looked into this a bit (a very slight bit), and the only real risk anyone has pointed out is that if I lose my job I have to repay the loan within 60 days or suffer outrageous taxation. While it may be foolish to believe so, my job is quite secure so that's not a real concern of mine currently. 

What other pitfalls may I not be thinking of or could possibly otherwise encounter? I've got to imagine they've got to be better to deal with than my current gambit of selectively choosing which cards I pay this month and which ones will end up being 30-60 days late. 

Overall I owe about $60k in credit card debt, most of which was accumulated by cashing out credit cards to help finance a trusted partner's business venture which was ultimately successful but at a much slower pace than originally hoped (due to circumstances, what should have taken 6 months ended up taking 2+ years, so credit card interest rates have kicked in hard!), so I have started to receive money from that as well, though not on any regular basis to be counted upon yet and not in any amounts that are significantly noteworthy. I don't expect consistent repayment from that venture for at least another 3-4 months. 

So in short, in considering taking a loan from my 401k, aside from job security, what am I not taking into account that might end up harming me more than I've already been harmed?

Also, my credit score is kind of wrecked now I think though I haven't been brave enough to look at my FICO since I started being consistently late with payments, so what kind of suggestions would you have in dealing with credit card companies, as far as requesting pay for delete if I pay off the balance? Can I negotiate with them to pay off say 70% of the balance upfront and have them write off the rest as well as clear negative marks from my credit report or is that a form of wishful thinking? 

Thanks to you all for reading this and any comments or advice you can give.",finance,1468529209
personalfinance,Back to School @ 27. Private Loans? (x-post from r/studentloans),"I've been in school since 18.  Have ~$30k in debt after two full years at a University and 5 years part-time at a Community College.  Have held a full time job since beginning @ the Community College.

I will be heading back to school to finish Undergrad and Grad School.  3 years.  9 Semesters.

As of right now, I have free housing and (nearly) free food.  While I am moving away from home, some family members graciously allowed me to move in with them.  I do plan on seeking employment as soon as I move.

However, my Financial Aid package barely covers the 16 credits I am taking this semester.  It doesn't cover my books, or the roughly $2000 in CC debt I have.  

My 403B will more or less pay off my car and the associated tax penalty, per my accountant.  My plan was upon finishing my job was to keep the car money in the bank, pay off the CCs, and get a job.  It should be enough to float me on the car payment for a few years, leaving about 6 months of shortfall somewhere around January 2019.  I should be able to make that money back long before that point to finish paying on the car.  And before anyone suggests it, selling the car is not an option at present.  I do have positive equity and could dump it almost immediately if it were an emergency, but that would also leave me without reliable transportation when I am commuting 10 miles per day..

I was considering taking out a ""one-time"" private loan as a safety net.  I don't see off-campus living as a ""smart"" option at this point and time.  Perhaps things will change next year when I report 1/3 my current income on my FAFSA?

Our school uses the FASTChoice portal for loans, but I honestly have no idea where to begin.  I have a ~680 Credit Score.  It was 720-730, but Great Lakes fucked up sending in my Forbearance and the account was temporarily marked as 90 days Past Due until they received notification that I was back in school full time.  I am drafting a Goodwill letter to get this situated, but I feel that continued payment on the car and CCs (as well as lower CC utilization) should improve my beacon score by graduation.

Anything in particular I should look out for?  I have never ventured into the Private Loan side of things, as Federal Loans always took care of things.  I filed for a special consideration due to my changing Financial Aid status, but that cannot be looked at until I physically quit my job in 3 weeks.",finance,1468529300
personalfinance,Help! Electric Motorcycle vs. Electric Car vs. Gas Car?,"I live in LA, CA where things such as electric cars, charging stations, etc. tend to be very progressive and I want to make the jump to electric. Especially after going on a recent road trip with a buddy of mine in his EV (Kia Soul) and noticing how it wasn't really that much of a change (very similar to charging a smartphone nightly), it seems like owning an EV should be a no-brainer.

I'm lucky enough to miss the majority of traffic, as I live four minutes away from work, and pretty much every store and outlet I need is in close proximity. I feel bad owning a gas-powered car since I'm near everything I need. It just seems wasteful. 
I've considered bicycles, but I'd prefer to be in the car lane for safety (there are some major roads near me which are tough for bicycles) and would like the occasional road trip that an electric motorcycle could offer.


Some questions:

• I understand that I'll need an M1 license, but what are some pieces of insight to riding a motorcycle in sometimes potentially heavy traffic areas in LA?

• Electric Motorcyles can range in price from around $7k-$16k, before the accessories/gear. From the sound of it, the reduced cost of insurance, maintenance, cost of ownership (compared to electric cars), and fuel, along with the added benefits of federal and possible state (I believe CA is on a waiting list now), will possibly make it a smart investment. Buying vs. leasing is a whole other topic.

The company Zero looks really appealing for electric motorcycles and last year they knocked off $1,350 on all models due to rising competition. 
Additionally, they have $1000 cash back for their 10th anniversary this month, so I'm really debating it

personalfinance,Vehicle frustration,"I will start from the beginning

It was july 2014 and I was 19 at the time and was eager for my first vehicle, and made the decision to fiance a used 2013 dodge dart with about 11,000 miles on it from my local Ford dealership. At the time I didn't know the difference between CPO and used, but I later found out. 

The vehicle needed service the 2 months later and it took a month just to have the issue fixed. This wasn't the last issue, I had to continue to take the vehicle to have it serviced several times after and in January of 2015 my clutch burned out, and unfortunately this was not covered by the warranty so I had to pay 2,000+ for a new one. I was skeptical as they were telling me it was drivers error while having it serviced it at the Dodge service center even though I had only had the vehicle for 6 months. At this point I was extremely fed up with the vehicle, but continued my payments as I didn't know my options as to what I could do about it. The car continued fine for about 8months after that with eventually another ""check engine light"" sparking my frustration again. It was a simple issue and resolved and it's been fine up until last week when the RPMS would drop while idling and car has had noticeable irregular vibrations. Now 2 years later,  my standard warranty just gave out as I am over 36,000 miles, and reluctant to take it to the service center even though I haven an appointment for next Friday. 

I'm pretty fed up with dealing with these issues and have turned to reddit as to what I can do in regards of trading the vehicle in. After this experience I'm done with dodge vehicles and very disappointed in Mopar. 

I have around 12,000 left on the vehicle, and my credit score is 760 plus now. I don't know if that matters. I have also kept a record of every service issue and have copies scanned onto my laptop.

personalfinance,What can I afford to spend on a used car? And should I even spend that much?,"Hey guys,

First - thanks for any and all advice. I have no familial resources to ask these questions to, and I highly appreciate any help you can give me!


So: I'm looking to buy a used car. A little backstory: I am currently driving a POS 1999 Chevy 1500 truck. It clocks around 15 mpg. I actually inherited 1/3 of the car after my mother passed away. When my original car broke down for good, my two sisters (who ""theoretically"" own the other 2/3 of the car - it is legally in my eldest sister's name) agreed to let me drive it until I found a new car. The ultimate goal with this truck is to sell it for a little bit of cash and to split the sale evenly. (I'd estimate, based on historical sale prices of comparable trucks, that *we could get $1,500 cash for the truck - $500 of which would be mine*)


That being said, I have poured about $500 into repairs for this car in the last year. Many of these repairs were split between the 3 of us, as they originated before my mother passed away (it was essentially the family work truck - never intended as a daily driver.) However, now I am at the point that whatever repairs come next will be my sole financial responsibility, and rightly so. 

Here is some pertinent information:

1) I just started a new serving job at a lucrative restaurant in town that I intend to keep through finishing college. Income in serving jobs obviously fluctuates, but after speaking with many of my fellow employees I have deduced that I should expect to make 30-35k a year. Some servers there many around 30k, while two others have reported ~45k on their tax return.
**Note:** All of out tips, cash and credit, are reported on our W2. I.e. There are no ""under the table"" cash tips.

2) My credit score hangs around 740ish. 

3) Currently I have a **net worth of around $6,000**. In addition, I have about **$7000 in an MMA** stemming from my mother's estate. 

4) Relevant Financial Goal: I want to get back to having a **$10,000 safety net emergency fund.** Before the previous restaurant I worked at closed SUDDENLY, I had around 13k total (not including MMA money from my mother's estate). After 4 months of unemployment and ""taking a break"" (worst financial decision in recent memory) I strongly desire to rebuild my emergency fund. **Note:** This was a year ago - I didn't roll through 7k in the last 4 months. I took a pay cut by working at a much less-lucrative restaurant for awhile. 

5) My fixed expenses (rent, internet, pets, phone, current car insurance, student loans, netflix, etc) sit at **$745/mo**

6) My variable expenses (groceries, gas, cigarettes, entertainment, utility costs) average around **$500/mo.**

7) My estimated net income, taking an average between the 30-35k estimate, would be ~$2000 a month. After fixed and variable expenses are accounted for, this leaves me $750ish. However, I want some of this to go toward rebuilding my emergency fund. I'd also like to do some modest traveling, and spend a little more in groceries (lets just say I eat a lot of spaghetti)

7) My **debt is around $1400** - all in federally held student loans. My monthly student loan payment is $56 currently. **As a side note:** these will go into deferment next January when I return to school.  

8) I only need a car that will last me the next 4 years. I intend on getting a modest, certified pre-owned vehicle when I exit college and start working in my degree-related field. 


So, what would you guys do in my situation? 

- Should I purchase a used car straight cash? 

- I have been warned against buying a used car on a monthly payment plan, as i'd be SOL if it were to break down before I paid it off. What are your opinions on this? What about a small (~1k-2k) loan to help free up cash now? One that wouldn't bankrupt me were the car to fail?

- What can I afford to spend? In my situation, seeing as I only need a daily driver for the next 4 years, should I even spend what I can afford? What would you do?

My TA is telling me it will continue pushing higher and im willing to continue long on the pair but at the sametime there are quite a lot of traders thinking that the GBP should push to lower lows so if it did reverse it could reverse fast....very fast.  Overall I think a buy, its a personal favourite pair of mine for the fact that it just has absolutely EPIC moves and makes me quite alot of profit. 

USD/JPY: So ive personally been expecting a large hike in prices since before Brexit it was Oversold just before Brexit and the Brexit pretty much destroyed it temporarily (hopefully). The large moves of the week from a TA perspective have been forecast for a while. Even last week I lost a few trades to it expecting a spike higher. Currently nothing much is holding it back on Fundis that ive seen as far as this week.  Personally I think the pair can hit as high as 109 which isnt to far from where it is now.

5. Don't buy a car, use a bike or public transport. If I do buy a car, it will be a used Toyota Corrola or a Honda Civic. 
6. Enjoy $20 from allowance every month by putting it in debit, save $60. Look into a higher interest rate for my savings like Ally bank.

personalfinance,[Retirement] Interesting 3-month internship 401k predicament,"-I am participating in a 3-month internship - my anticipated income for the year is approximately $6,500, and I am a full-time student and dependent.

-I am allowed to participate in my employers 401k plan, which matches dollar-for-dollar up to 5% of my YTD income.  My HR rep has advised I contribute around 12% of my paycheck to this fund (this rep is obviously not guaranteed to give sound financial advice)

However, I've currently contributed ~$305 to the fund, with my employer so far matching ~$128.  With my $305 contribution thus far being roughly 5% of my anticipated total earnings this year with the company, I assume they will continue matching 5% of my YTD income with them until reaching around the $305 mark at the end of my internship.

Here is my big question: Is it now harmful to continue contributing beyond what will be matched into this fund, considering it is tax deferred?

My reasoning is simple: As a student I pay barely any income tax to the feds or the state, isn't my best move (by *far*) for further retirement savings to pay what pittance of tax I owe now and set it aside into a Roth IRA, rather than let this extra capital compound for ~40 years or so and *then* pay tax on it when I'm in an upper tax bracket?

personalfinance,Borrowing from my retirement to pay off current debts.,"I currently have $6,700 in debt. Most of these are on credit cards with very high interest rates. To even hope to make a dent I would have to work an insane amount of overtime I neither want to work or exists. So I came up with the idea of borrowing from my TSP (federal employee) to pay for my debt. 

Basically I can borrow up to $9,000 from my TSP account. If I take out this loan, it won't count against my credit. The annual percentage rate is 1.5%. All the money I'm paying back including the interest goes straight back into my TSP account. I can pay off the loan earlier if I want.

 I can't really see a downside to this. I can keep working at my current pace and pay less a month than I'm currently paying on bills. It's not like I'm going to retire anytime soon either. If I'm lucky, I have at least another 29 years to put into this retirement fund. So not only will I be paying off the loan, but I'm still going to put money into my TSP account every paycheck.

The worst thing I can see is that I might be missing out interest rates, but I never touch my TSP account so it's not like I'd be losing all that much.

I was thinking of taking $7,000 out and paying $91.96 for 3 years every 2 weeks.

personalfinance,I think I goofed. Recourses? (Credit Card Auto rental policy),"Hey guys,

My wife and I recently rented a car while in another country using Chase Sapphire's collision waiver policy.  We prepaid the full charge to her card, because she was going to be the primary driver.  Then we left her credit card at home.  This is where the problem starts.

Europcar required two things from us that morning; the card we paid with and, if we wanted to forgo Europcar's collision waiver, a letter (email) from our Chase confirming that Chase's insurance would cover our rental.  The email was simple enough, just had to call chase and have the rep send over.  Since we did not have the original credit card, I was added as a driver on the account, and, I had thought everything was being changed over to my Chase Sapphire credit card.  Turns out the original charge was left on my wife's card.

Note:  On the terms and conditions for the Chase Sapphire policy, the card you make all the payments on and the card that has the 5000 Euro collision waiver need to be the same credit card.  This is the step we missed that morning.

Which was going to be fine, I thought I was just saving money and not having to pay for the auto insurance.  Then we accidentally collided with a guard rail and got to go through this process.

I have emailed Europcar explaining that I expected everything to be moved over to my credit card, and called Chase Sapphire's benefits line to explain my situation in a hypothetical sense.  The Chase rep just said ""Yeah, you're welcome to submit the claim but if your T&amp;Cs weren't met then that's grounds for having your claim denied.""

My expectation at this point was that it was my responsibility to ensure that the T&amp;Cs were met at the rental car agency, and even though I was told we needed to move everything to a different credit card or they wouldn't rent me the car that morning, I should've known the original charge wasn't moved over and that I'm out of luck.  

I'm waiting for a response from Europcar to the situation, and also awaiting the exact dollar figure for damages, but if neither wants to budge do I have a recourse other than eat the costs?",finance,1468583039

What is the best way to handle the taxes? I do have the money to pay the taxes on the rollover (approx $6,800)

So do I withhold 20% (income is 75k) and then I should be good for my taxes does this change the status of the rollover?

I'll be linking to this thread in the complaint, so I'd encourage people with other similar experiences to post here or contact the CFPB themselves. 

American Express is offering me a payment plan called the CARE Program, which stands for Customer Assistance Relief Environment. I had some American Express credit card debt which was then sent out to a third party, Central Credit Services. 

I have been making monthly payments consistently with CCS. This month, they offered me to elect to join the CARE program, which purports to be a monthly payment program which will alter my interest rates on the debt. They told me some of the terms on the phone. It sounded like they were offering to waive all late payments, but they said that the terms could change if I did not make my payments on time, so I was suspicious. I asked the people at Central Credit if I could get a written disclosure either digitally or in writing that contained the terms of the payment program. They told me they could not send me the terms until I agreed to join the program. I told them multiple times I did not want to sign up for anything without reading the terms, and they told me they could not send me the terms until I was in the program and kept stressing to me that I might not continue to be eligible for the program if I didn't sign up today. I told them I'd think about it and get back to them and they continued to stress that I might lose eligibility for the program if I didn't sign up today and agree to a number of agreed monthly payments (which were higher than my current minimum payment). 

I told them no, and when I transferred back to make my monthly payment, I was asked to verify the amount I would like to make in my monthly payments. I told the representative I would only like to make one payment, and they finally backed off.

personalfinance,"IRS Victory after 4 year battle! IBR, Community Property, 8958","TLDR : 

1. It is possible to beat the IRS
2. It can take a looooong time and many many hours of effort for you and your accountant
3. You will get stonewalled at every turn, even if you use all of the resources available. 
4. PSA : For married couples with very different incomes, IBR can save you a crapload of money
5. PSA : For married couples with very different incomes, *in a community property state*, even without school loans, consider filing separately to reduce tax bracket. 

--

So this is a bit complicated. 

1. I make 6 figures, my wife makes essentially 0 (stay at home mom, a few part time hours here and there)
2. We live in a community property state
3. My wife has massive school loans 90k+ (All accrued before we married) (For a graduate art degree...)
4. She is repaying them under the IBR (Income Based Repayment)
5. Part of the deal with IBR is that you don't have to count spouse's income for repayment calculations
6. In order to not count spouse income, you have to file separately
7. Community property states mess that up, because I have to ""give"" 50% of my income and withholding to my wife when we do taxes. (IRS form 8958)
8. On the upside, because I make a lot, and my wife makes nothing, filing separately turns us into two filers at 50% of my income, which lowers my tax bracket (mostly balanced by losing the joint filing tax breaks and deductions)
9. For the purposes of IBR, we don't have to count that 50% as her income *for repayment purposes*, but still have to file separately. (Because the Feds say it would be unfair to have loan repayments for similarly situated students be radically different based on where they live)

Essentially my wife's payments are 0 due to her income. Not deferral, she gets counted as making a payment each month of zero dollars. After 25 years the loan will be forgiven (currently a big tax liability in 25 years, but that might go away with some currently percolating legislation). 

Anyway, the last two years, everything has gone fine. Our accountant fills out 8958, my income and withholding and deductions are split. My wife and I both get refunds.

But 3 years ago, 8958 had just come out. Nobody knew how to file it. We did what we thought was right with my accountant, and sent it in. 

The IRS split my income, suddenly my wife made 50k. They took 50% of the withholding from me, but did not apply it to my wife. So they said she owed ~5k in taxes. (In reality she should have gotten  a ~2k refund). 

We've been fighting it ever since. They took her next two years refunds to pay the 5k. They've made us refile our taxes like 5 times. They kept sending us letters back denying things like injured spouse adjustments (that we had not asked for). We appealed multiple times. We called in our senator. We called the Tax Advocates. Nothing worked. 

Most of the people we talked to at every level had never dealt with the situation of married filing separate in a community property state. Our accountant says for everyone else in our situation, he doesn't split the income, and nobody notices or complains. He only does it for us because I knew that we were supposed to do it on day 1, and thats why we went to him at all. (Otherwise I could file it myself)

This week, my accountant went to some IRS conference, and each attendee is allowed to bring one case for review. He brought it in and was shot down. Escalated to the reviewer's supervisor, and finally we won! He called me and said we are getting a check for 7k plus interest in a month or so! In the end they are ignoring all of the splitting for that year, and just re-applying the withholding to my taxes. Since I now get 100% of the withholding, but only 50% of the income, I get the refund.

Still need to confirm that the numbers line up for the money my wife was owed for refunds for all 3 years, but its in the ballpark.",finance,1468595350

I make around 1800-2200 per month right now but am planning on job searching (definitely staying within this area) within 9 months and any prospective job I'd get would more than double what I make now.

I found a 1br condo to buy that, at the end of the day, will cost 75k/$6000 up front (downpayment and closing)/$900 per month all costs considered (even my phone bill thrown in). $900 a month is about $100 more than I'd pay renting with roommates in this city. I'd be liquidating my savings to pay closing costs and the down payment - that being said, I have only been saving consistently for 7 months straight so I believe I would be able to make this all up again. I looked into all issues with the condo association - special assessments, fee histories, recent work, meeting minutes, etc. so I'm deeper into this than I seem and know enough about it so far.

It's a waterfront (no flood zone) condo with kayak outlets and a patio and its cute as hell. Small but perfect for a single person and an eventual dogbaby.

I have lived with roommates my entire life and it has NEVER been positive so this is what spurred my interest in the first place - signing another year lease and potentially ending up with more crazy/dirty people would surely mentally break me and cause more isolation if I can't even feel comfortable in my home bringing home guests or being social which has been the case with my living situations so far and its been a huge bummer and strain. I feel the need to nest somewhere and a homebody like myself I think would benefit from an aesthetically pleasing environment that is my OWN. So that's the main factor behind this.

My hesitation is that I'm emptying my savings firstly. I'm also scared about the resale costs/possibility of not being able to sell it eventually and also the HOA's rules on renting out are sketchy and potentially leaning towards 100% no rentals ever which makes it scarier because then lets say a job opportunity came up in 5 years, I may be fucked.

The Company operates through nine segments consisting of Exelon Generation Company, LLC's (Generation's) six power marketing segments, including Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, New York, ERCOT and other regions; Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd); PECO Energy Company (PECO), and Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE). 

## Recent financials 

Revenues have been doing well in the last while but the earnings and dividend trajectory is anything but impressive.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $29.4bn | $27.4bn | $24.9bn | $23.5bn | $19.1bn|
|EPS | $2.54 | $1.88 | $2.00 | $1.42 | $3.75|
|DPS | $1.24 | $1.24 | $1.46 | $2.10 | $2.10|

## Competition

When it comes to utilities, competition is really only one of the major factors to think about. There is energy prices fluctuating, regulators having a go at them, interest rates affecting their considerable debt piles, and then in terms of competition it comes in both the generation of electricity and how you deliver it to retail clients. 

To some extent competition is the slowest moving of all these factors. And regulation and energy prices can be must faster at impacting the business and stock price.

Looking at EXC versus other multiline utilities, it's not that impressive on either a margins or returns basis. Not sure if that reflects their mix / management or if it's a potential opportunity for them. Anyone got a view?

## Cash / Debt?
Exelon Corporation has $34,886M of net debt. That is 4.3x its latest operating profit. Not that far off the level of debt it's peers are willing to bear.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $36.41 for Exelon Corporation and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 0% to their target. :( So scratching my head on that...

# Valuation
The following table shows the key valuation metrics. FCF yield is lower than its peers, even though the PE ratio is also lower. Seems like the business just isn't turning the cashflow into earnings or paying it out in dividends. For a striking example look at Duke.

As a sector, am a little surprised that it's high teens PEs for a regulated industry with pedestrian growth prospects. Is it just a chase for yield?

SO | $50,316M | 19x | 3% | 4% | 14%

# Dividends
Exelon Corporation is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.26 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.24 per share. That is a 2% growth. The forecast dividend of $1.26 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.50. So no concerns there. Though utilities are subject to lots of restrictions by regulators on what they can and can't do with their cashflow. Obviously they don't want the lights to go out!

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -1%. On a 1 year view the stock is up 8% with earnings only up 2%. Said it before... pedestrian.

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/exc/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers. On that call they said:
&gt; we are affirming our full-year guidance range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share

I really don't know the utilities industry, so am at a loss on what the catalysts could be. Is it wholesale gas prices? Smart acquisitions? Better management? If you've got a view, please let us know. Thanks.

My girlfriend and I (will get married in the next couple years) have high incomes (between $300k-350k HHI), but we rent an apartment in NYC so our federal, state and city taxes are quite high. 

We already max out all the tax friendly accounts I can think of, and our financial snapshot is as follows:

* Large emergency fund (at least ~1 year coverage)
* Max out 401k 
* Max out Backdoor Roth
* Max out HSA
* Max out Employee Stock Purchase Program
* Already contribute to a 529 despite not having kids

We're still paying a big chunk in taxes, with NYC taxes alone costing us ~ $9k/yr. My goal is to become FI in ~10 years, and I do think owning property is an important component of that. So as a result, I'm considering saving up for a house in upstate NY to use on the weekends, as well as to rent out when we're not using it. Then when I'm FI, I could move there on a more full time basis. 

I think I could get close to covering the mortgage/expenses with rental income, and the tax deduction on interest might be worth it. And if I made that my primary residence rather than my rental apartment in NYC, I could save $9k/yr in NYC taxes.

Curious what others thought about this strategy and if there were any other suggestions?",finance,1468612522

personalfinance,"Paid off house, does it make sense to get a second mortgage and reinvest it at a higher rate of return (please check my math)?","From [This Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4st8mm/made_my_last_mortgage_payment_today/d5cd2yi) in /r/financialindependence

I have a paid off house, what are the costs/benefits of taking out a second mortgage for the max principal/max period/min interest rate and reinvesting that money?  For the math below, assume I can get a 417k mortgage at 3.2% interest for 30 years now.  You are using your house as collateral to get a large, low-interest loan and then immediately reinvesting that into something else.  Unless the market drops consistently, you should have enough enough in the investment accounts to liquidate them at any time and pay off the entire remaining mortgage balance.  

The math below says that at a rate of return on my investments of &gt;4%, I am growing my wealth.  I am already mortgage free in this situation, so the math below is compared to me paying nothing each month.  **Please convince me what si wrong with this scheme.**

I used [Mortgage Calculator](http://www.mortgagecalculator.org/) to get the monthly/annual payments; here are some hypothetical balances:

**First year**

 * 1st year Mortgage Principal Paid = ~8,500
 * 1st year Mortgage Interest Paid = ~13,085
 * Remaining Mortgage Principal 417,000 - ~8,500 = 408,500
 * **Investment account (-5% return)** = 417,000*0.95 -&gt; 396,150
 *      396,150 - 408,500 -13,085 - 8,500 = -33,935 net loss
 * **Investment account (0% return)** = 417,000 -&gt; 417,000
 *      417,000 - 408,500 -13,085 - 8,500 = -13,085 net loss
 * **Investment account (2% return)** = 417,000*1.02 -&gt; 425,350
 *      425,350 - 408,500 - 13,085 - 8,500 = -4,745 net loss
 * **Investment account (4% return)** = 417,000*1.04 -&gt; 508,320
 *     508,320 - 408,500 - 13,085 - 8,500 = 3,595 net gain

**At the end of 5 years:**

 * 5 year Mortgage Principal Paid = ~45,600
 * 5 year Mortgage Interest Paid = ~62,500
 * Mortgage Principal 417,000 - ~45,600 = 371,400
 * **Investment account (-5% return for 5 straight years)** = 417,000*0.95^5 -&gt; 322,666
 *      322,666 - 371,400 - 62,500 - 45,600 = -156,833 net loss
 * **Investment account (0% return for 5 straight years)** = 417,000 -&gt; 417,000
 *       417,000 - 371,400 - 62,500 - 45,600 = -117,208 net loss
 * **Investment account (2% return for 5 straight years)** = 417,000*1.02^5 -&gt; 460,401
 *      460,401 - 371,400 - 62,500 - 45,600 = -19,098 net loss
 * **Investment account (4% return for 5 straight years)** = 417,000*1.04^5 -&gt; 507,344
 *      507,344 - 371,400 - 62,500 - 45,600 = 27,844 net gain

**Some potential issues:**

 * MAKE SURE you get a mortgage with no early payment penalty, this could put you in a bad situation if you ever wanted to get out of this scheme.
 * How easy is it to pick investments or funds to consistently get 4%-5% interest?  A diverse set of stocks/funds staying below 4% for 5 straight years seems like an extreme situation.
 * How does capital gains tax work on large investments (and eventual sale of those investments)?  What are the limits on mortgage interest tax deduction?  I'm sure that the taxes on your investment earnings and your mortgage interest tax deduction do not line up exactly, but how do they fall?
 * You need sufficient cashflow in the first year to make the mortgage payments while you wait to get your first round of dividends (I only know so much about investing so I assume there are stocks that pay out right away).
 * I assume investing fees could eat up a lot of your profit (I am not a saavy stock investor yet)",finance,1468618359

personalfinance,Looking for short-term planning advice.,"So I'm trying to plan out my financial direction for the next couple years. I am 23 and currently gross only $31k, but my expenses are low. I am currently able to save about $15-18k a year.

I've read through the steps provided in the FAQ. I am taking full advantage of my employer's 401(k) match (6%/6%), and maintain a small emergency fund of $1000. The remaining loan on my car is $11.7k (it wasn't the best financial choice, but I love the car anyway), and my next payment due date is 6 months away (I have been paying it off pretty hard). At my current rate, it will be paid off in about 5 months. The holdup for me right now is the interest rate, which is 3.95%. The FAQ indicates that a loan is considered ""high interest"" if it is above 4%, so mine is very close to that threshold.

Knowing this, should I stop paying on my car for the time being, and start investing in a Roth IRA? Or should I keep going and get my car out of the way? I'm assuming the answer will hinge on whether 3.95% is considered high or not. It also may be that my question is too short-term, and won't be of much consequence either way.

I also want to begin saving for my own house, but I know loans and IRAs come first. It's a still a factor, though, so I mention it.",finance,1468619271

personalfinance,(24) Trying to Buy My First House and Tesla,"I'm going to try and keep this as concise as I can. I've already thought about where I want to live and Employment future.

Moved Home recently and now living with my parents to save for a down payment (I think we are going work out $400 a month rent, including utilities)
Rent for an apartment would be at least $700 for something decent since I have a dog - Not including utilities
Managed to keep my job of 2 years working from home remotely 40k pre tax base with chance for overtime and bonus + benefits - More likely to be more than 43k. I was due a raise, but that was put on hold per the position change.

* I contribute 3% match to my 401k
* Put 4k into IRA last year - debating how much to put in this year per saving for house down payment
* I have 5400 in my IRA currently
* ~30k liquid funds - 2700 of that is my HSA - will try to leave that alone
* I can add a solid $1300 per month; if I watch myself, closer to $1500.
* $100 per month goes into HSA
* $500 per month goes into a savings account ($18074) with 1% interest.
* $250 per month goes into checking with ($742).75% interest.
* $1650-$1800 per month goes into main checking account (Laughable low interest. Not sure what it is)

Expenses:

* Debt free - minus the revolving credit debt 
* $400 Rent 
* ~$250 Food 
*~$100 for my dog - I currently pay ~$67 for a health plan + Pet paws insurance. The health plan will be ending in October and I might get a new one depending on what's in my area - currently about half that cost + food, treats, toys, etc
*  $250 - I budget that every month for my personal fund - probably half of that can go towards the house savings if not more depending on how I'm feeling. (Prime day ate most of that up this month) :P
* **Tesla** I said it, I know most people here will hate me for it, but I've wanted a Tesla since before most people knew what they were. Model 3 obviously and I'm figuring 42k cost for it. I plan to have a down payment for it and have already put the $1000 down for it. I'm guessing to have mine in Early 2018. My current car since 2010 is a 1999 Hyundai accent and has been a good car for the time I've had it, but time to move up a little.

Okay, for the real questions: 

* First, I should state my current plan is to keep the home 5-10 years while I continue to save for some property and eventually have a home built on said land. Obviously this can change, but is the general plan. I'm thinking &lt;200k for the home. I'm trying to research the neighborhoods in the area because that's important to me. I feel I can get one for 150k that will need a little work, but is livable. I'd prefer to find a cheaper home I can fix up a little, not a full out remodel, but you know replace the flooring, paint the walls, update the appliances, etc... Fairly easy upgrades. *Just over a year ago I went to go see what I'd be approved for on a mortgage just for shits. (220k was the highest amount I'd be able to get. (That's including a car loan of 25K) so ~190K for a house.


Actually, here are the questions: 

1. What should I be worried about when trying to take out a fairly large car loan close to a mortgage?
2. I'm worried about PMI I see you have to have 20% down to avoid PMI and I don't currently have that. Say I were to put 10% down now and tack on PMI. If I were able to pay 20% value of the home with in 1-2 years, would I be able to drop the PMI?
3. I heard you can use your IRA savings for taking out a Mortgage? 
4. Any tips, concerns, feedback?
5. About how much should I expect to spend on things other than the mortgage? I.E. Closing costs, inspection

**TLDR: I want to buy a house and a Tesla - Help me plan this out!**

*I'll take constructive criticism, but please no, ""You are a fucking idiot for trying to buy a 40k car and 200k house at the same time!""* 

Edits:
I also completely forgot about the tax credit! I'm most likely going to qualify for the $7500 tax credit on the Tesla.

&gt;So if Tesla delivers its 200,000th car on July 1, 2018, then all of the cars its sells in the United States from July 1 to September 30 (Q3) and from October 1 to December 31 (Q4) qualify for the full tax credit. After that, for the next six months (two quarters) the credit decreases to 50% ($3,750); then decreases to 25% ($1,875) for the following six months. 

I'm very likely to receive the full credit as I believe I'm near the 100,000 pre order point, meaning I feel I'll get mine the beginning of 2018. Essentially, I wouldn't be paying federal taxes that year.",finance,1468628511

gaming,"007: Legends is kind of a sad game. It's not the complete disaster some claim it is, but its deep flaws cripple it.","I've been replaying the game on PC. I first played it a few years ago. Basically, the game is Eurocom being put in the same position as Quantum of Solace PS2, which was heavily rushed to meet QoS's theatrical release.

They were forced to make a James Bond game on an insanely tight schedule in order to have something ready for Skyfall. The perils of movie tie-in games.

The good-

* Real actors reprising their roles. James Bond is voiced by a sound-alike, but pretty much everyone else is voiced by their real actor from the film in question. It lends the game great authenticity.
* The gunplay is decent.
* When it actually works, the stealth is decent.
* Some areas are quite pretty.
* The music is largely recycled from Eurocom's GoldenEye, but it works.

The bad-

* The QTEs are mindblowingly awful, especially on PC. Quantum of Solace PS2 had extremely frustrating QTEs, and this design problem crops up again. It's so bad it almost sinks the game singlehandedly.
* The production values are all over the place, and its extremely short. This isn't a case of the project being mismanaged or the developers being incompetent. Eurocom were a good developer staffed by talented people. It's very clear that the game was simply not ready and Eurocom were forced to release a half-finished game.
* When the stealth decides it doesn't want to work, it's frustrating and awful.
* Cementing this problem, the last chapter is DLC, and was released after Skyfall.

And what undercuts this this all is that the writing is not very good. Bruce Feirstein does to these iconic Bond films what he did to GoldenEye 2010. He strips them of their sociopolitical subtext and nuance. License to Kill is no longer about drugs, sharks, and Wayne Newton. It's something, something, HE MIGHT BE FUNDING TERRORISM. USE YOUR PHONE, BOND, TO FIND THE PROOF THAT HE IS FUNDING TERRORISM. This goes for most of the stories. Die Another Day revolving entirely around Korea and dreams and our face being a mask is all thrown away. They even removed the iconic scene where the antagonist goes ""Parachutes for the both of us!"" THROWS AWAY SECOND PARACHUTE ""Whoops! Not anymore!"" All the richness and life is drained out of these James Bond stories. We're left with a lifeless shell where Bond is just fighting ""terrorism"".

About the only exception to this white bread nonsense is the Moonraker chapter, which is more wacky, and really is a highlight of the game, with Michael Lonsdale reprising his role as Hugo Drax, and doing an absolutely fantastic job.

And that's what bothers me. The game is worth playing just to see digital Hugo Drax and digital Jaws. These actors put in great performances. It is a clumsy love letter to the Bond franchise.

But... there's just so much alienating, frustrating bullshit that torpedoes the developer's hard work. For every awesome section is a frustrating or just plain dumb ""Wow, this was clearly thrown together in a frantic rush"" moment.",technology,1468656727

personalfinance,Should I refinance federal student loans.,"Hi PF, I currently have 53k in student loans (grad and undergrad) in my grace period. Average interest rate is 5.925% over 7 total loans. Monthly payments checking in at $606/month for 10 years for a full repayment. I will be making 67k gross, which, after 5% 401k deduction (which is what my employer matches) and taxes, comes down to about 3800/month if I did my basic federal and state withholding calculations right. Would I be able to refinance for a lower rate? Is any lower rate worth losing my repayment flexibility with federal loans?",finance,1468683722
personalfinance,Should we refinance?,"Hello, PF! Long time lurker, first time poster. I need your help deciding what we should do regarding our home loan.

Backstory: My husband and I declared Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2015 because of our financial dumbassness. Fortunately, a year in, we've got back our financial stability. (Before you ask: we have completely done a 180 with regards to money; we have a budget we stick to, we’ve been able to save up a small emergency fund, and have been finding ways to reduce our monthly expenditures and get back on the good credit train. So, hooray for that.)

Our attorney generally suggests getting a refinance after a year of being in Chapter 13. Our options are limited, but since rates are so low, we decided begin researching because low rates mean more savings, right?  

Well, I’m not so sure. That’s why I’m here. Would you take a look at our numbers and suggest what we should do?

Here’s the breakdown:



**Old FHA loan (originated November 2009; almost 7 years in):**

Original balance - 186,182

Interest rate: 5.125%

Mortgage payment – 1013.74

Currently with escrow - 1470.89 

PMI (incl. in above payment) – 74.84 (will go away when we reach 78% LTV)

This loan is a 30-year fixed mortgage.



**New FHA streamline refinance (originating probably September 2016 after we get approval from the court):**

Loan balance: 168,888 (incl. closing costs, etc. rolled in)

Interest rate: 3.25%

Mortgage payment: $735.01

Predicted payment with PMI and what we’re currently paying in escrow: $1,267

PMI (incl. in above payment): $110 (goes away in 11 years)

This loan will also be a 30-year fixed mortgage.



As you can see, a refinance would reduce our payments, but we’d also be starting over with a new 30-year mortgage. I see three options.

Option 1: Get the refinance and put the extra money into retirement or savings. Once we’re out of Chapter 13, we’ll get a conventional refinance for a 10 year or 15 year loan.

Option 2: Get the refinance and continue to pay the amount we’re currently paying. That’ll be an extra $200 per month towards the principal balance, and once we’re out of Chapter 13, we can either refinance or not depending on what interest rates are like then.

Option 3: We hold the course, keep paying what we’re paying, and either wait until later in the repayment plan to refinance (giving credit scores a little while to improve) or wait until we’re out of Chapter 13 and figure out what to do then.

Are there any options we’re not considering? Thanks in advance for your advice and suggestions.",finance,1468684137

personalfinance,"Financing Master's Degree in Germany, funding problems.","Hello, long time lurker. First time poster. So, long story short I applied to a two year program, MSc in Economics, in Germany and recently heard back that I was accepted. I am 25, have 3 years work experience at a financial firm loved by this subreddit. There is no tuition, I just need to cover living expenses of about 750 euro/month, or about $10K USD a year, and to qualify for a student visa I need those funds set aside in a blocked account where I can only pull out 1/12 of the balance at a time. 

Naturally, during my first year I will be doing everything I can to find a source of side income, which my visa will allow. As well as applying for grants, scholarships etc. 

I have about $13K saved, net of moving expenses, to pay for one year without touching my retirement savings (about $30K between 401k/Roth IRA) with a little left over. Plus about $28K in federal student loans that will go back into deferment during my time in the program.

My problem is funding 2 years worth of expenses. I was aware the program I applied to is not covered under federal student loans programs. What I did not know in my initial research is that it also disqualifies me from private student loans or I would not have applied and probably would push this back a year to let me save more.

Since I have no relatives that can reasonably lend my $10K, nor will I touch my retirement savings, I have been looking into personal loans for about $12K at around 12% APR for 72 months to fund the first year paying for the second years living expenses out of pocket as well as making the monthly payments on the loan until I graduate and reenter the work force. I have applied to a few places and am waiting to hear back from Discover, the last one on my list with terms that aren't stupidly expensive. 

I can't think of any other way to pursue my dream of becoming an economist since I lack the math prereqs (i.e. a BS in Math) for a respectable PhD program and a Master's program in the States will cost more in tuition alone than my entire 2 year program in Germany including interest on a personal loan! 

I would need to setup the blocked account within the next month to have any chance of getting my Student Visa and housing settled before I move in the first week of October so an incredibly short amount of time to figure this out. 

This post is is my Hail Mary pass. 

I would be happy to answer any questions that might help the collective Reddit hivemind help me follow my dreams. There is a lot more I could write but no one likes a massive wall of text.

personalfinance,Discover Banking vs. Credit Union,"Hello Redditors,

So I am currently trying to consider what my next move will be for when it comes to my banking choices.

I have a Credit Union Savings, Checking, and Credit Card account while with Discover I only use their credit card service. I have been thinking about transitioning due to higher interest rates offered by Discover, the $0.10 cash back per cleared check, and my general lack of use of paper cash. I have enough money to make the initial deposit of $500, so I am thinking of creating an account and slowly transitioning myself to Discover and keeping my Credit Union as an emergency. My questions are:

1. What drawbacks are there to Discover's services? I know they charge overdrafting fees, but is their system buggy? I'm responsible enough to not overdraft in the first place, but I was charged at least three times for overdrafting by Citizen's Bank before I ended up closing the accounts (I had all of them corrected after they reviewed it).

2. Are there any current promotions that I can take advantage of? I dropped the ball on the Discover Credit Card referral cash back offer. If I can avoid dropping the ball again I would be happy, but I can't seem to find any promotion at this moment.

For context I am a 20 year old college student who will only have ~$500-1000 in my account at most times. I am trying to pay for my schooling out-of-pocket as much as I can. If an emergency would occur I am able to rely on my parents for temporary help.

If any other advice can be given, do so. I cannot seem to find any more scholarships to help me before you ask.

crypto,PGP key -- ECC-sign and RSA-encrypt for GnuPG,"I would like to advocate / seek feedback on the idea of having GnuPG offer and promote a key set with two parts: ECC for signing (ECDSA, EdDSA/Ed25519, ...) and RSA for encryption.

Currently there is an option for RSA-sign with RSA-encrypt and there is an option for ECC-sign with ECC-diffie-hellman-encrypt.

While Diffie-Hellman and ECDH and Curve25519-DH are great for streams, openssh, tsl, and messengers, they are not entirely apt for e-mail.

When I use a federated messenger with XMPP (Off-the-Record v3 protocol) or a centralized messenger like Signal or Whatsapp (Signal protocol) or encrypted chat, I am locked into a session or have established one.

Email should be simple enough to send and forget. No negotiation or set up necessary. Just look up my pub keys on a server or a reputable site, send me a message only I can read, then move on regardless of my ability to perform an exchange at the time.

If someone contacts me by using ephemeral email addresses, then a consistent public encryption key tied to my email address for that person to use at any time -- such a key -- would be necessary

Since people check email both asynchronously and from different devices, I prefer RSA encryption -- i.e., a public encryption key tied to an identity.

If I transport my keys, then I am fine.

However, DH requires access to last old emails for the exchange to work.

A plain RSA key allows for anyone to anonymously get a public key and send an encrypted message -- all in one message sent once

The current set up has easy options for RSA (sign) and RSA (encrypt) as well as ECC (sign) and ECC (diffie-hellman).

I would like to see more adoption of ECC in signing and in certificates.

F-Droid app store packages, more cases of tsl (e.g., Facebook), OpenBSD packages, Signal, etc. use ECC signing keys which are faster (you can sign digests and establish https to visitors more quickly).

If we encourage ECC signing and RSA encryption for PGP, then someone could use an ECC signature in cleartext, and use an ECC signature when signing .deb packages, and in regular emails, *while *also maintaining a simple public encryption key for others to contact.

I like the idea of having a nice neat ECC public subkey that I can use to sign clear messages, add as a detached signature (an endorsement), use for signing and including in packages, while at the same time encouraging others to use the same key tied to that same trustworthy identity for encryption.

Many GUI programs like F-droid and signal post eddsa public keys for easy verification.

The key would contain two parts: main key ""subkey"" for certs and signatures as ECC (ed25519, NIST P, etc)  and an encryption subkey (RSA).

As an added feature (much later), my overall key fingerprint would be SHA-1 hash of it, but I could also easily post the public portion of the ECC signing key. Since multiple GUI programs show public part of eddsa keys, mailers could look at hash of whole thing and gui package managers for .debs (in the future, for example) could show just the signing key.",cryptocurrency,1468730364

Well not anymore it seems. Far from it.

It has become apparent at least to me personally that the Ethereum Foundation are strongly influencing public opinion to try and sway the votes in their favor for the DAO hardfork. 

I have seen posts about how they intend to stay neutral, then only to be followed by **heavy** encouragement for a hard fork.

I have seen members saying that carbon vote was not to be used as an official gauge of polling, only to then be used to determine which side of the fork would be implemented as the default configuration for geth. To much dismay I might add. Just click on the following link. The carbon vote cannot be seriously taken as an effective opinion mechanism. https://postimg.org/image/m3se2js41/

Of course, such is human nature when you stand to financially gain/lose as a result. But the wider community who care about Ethereum at large don't need to fall victim to a failed experiment of an application.

This entire DAO situation was rushed to begin with and is what got us into all these problems. We are now rushing into a hardfork that if anything else goes wrong will cost Ethereum well and truly for good. I do not see the need to risk the entire network over a small amount of funds lost as a result of something that acts only as an application layer.

There are real risks associated with the hardfork that can open up even worse attack vectors than the DAO problems we had in the first place. There is an unhealthy egotism going around here by many simply writing any legitimate concerns and contingencies raised as just FUD. The arrogance is unreal honestly.

**Another highly disturbing event lately:** Ethereum has proven itself to have it’s own virtual Federal Reserve like boardroom in the form of an IRC chat group between principal key stakeholders in the ecosystem. See the below article for details on this: https://medium.com/security-news/immutable-decentralized-consensus-yeah-right-ethereum-foundation-just-proved-it-isnt-ab98c6fd7794#.6m4rx5t68

My entire views of Ethereum have become sour, nobody should be able to flick switches and levers behind the scenes as the Ethereum Foundation have demonstrated time and time again now.

Ethereum is showing itself to be moving away from it's core ideals it once so proudly represented, and this has all be a huge learning experience for all of us.

I don't want to see Ethereum fail, and I don't wish to risk it all on the line to save a few who knew the risks in investing in something as new in the DAO in the first place. The hard fork is a bail out if you accept it or not, and the wider community needs to remember that they have the final say and should really think before making their vote final in the new Mist update.

I would like to end with the following quote.

I have an international friend coming to visit me this year. 3 years ago she was studying abroad here in the US and opened a checking account. Before she left to go back to her country, she received a letter for an overdraft fee to the bank for ~$15. 
Long story short, she NEVER paid it and we're wondering how this would affect her. Will she face criminal charges (i.e. go to jail) for this if she comes back here?... She doesn't know what interest rate she signed up for when getting the card, so is there any way of knowing what general amount she would have to pay back to clear her name? Will this permanently affect her credit score? (she'd like to possibly move here in the future)

personalfinance,Home equity loan to consolidate debt? Good idea or no?,"So my wife and I have been tossing around the idea of taking out a home equity loan to consolidate our debts. Together we have several credit cards, etc. that vary in interest rates. It is taking a long time to pay our debts off because we can't afford to make large payments and still maintain our standard of living. We are only able to save a little bit each month and practically live paycheck to paycheck. So onto the house part. We have been super lucky with the timing of buying the home we live in. The market is growing so fast that our home value increases from $1-4k per month and has done so for the past year and a half. We will likely be selling in 1-4 years because my job moves me around a lot. We currently have about $85k in equity and the market is safely maintaining its growth. Would it be wise for us to take about $30k on a home equity loan to pay our debts off and start saving more/not need to have credit cards? We planned to pay off these debts when we sold the house anyway so the way I see it we would be saving a ton on interest for the next 1-4 years while also having extra money every month to save.

financialindependence,PSA: What Wealthfront doesn't tell you,"I see Wealthfront, Betterment, et all often talked about here, but I think they are a bad deal for nearly everyone. You're best off just reading the Boglehead wiki and putting your money into low cost index funds on Vanguard manually. Wealthfront makes highly deceptive claims about their benefits, so I decided to write a rant debunking it.

On their front page, Wealthfront claims that TLH offers +1.0% return. If you dig down into the details, they say

&gt; For example, let’s say you had a $100,000 portfolio at the beginning of the year that produced a 10% return for the year and 1% in tax alpha.

&gt; That means, your portfolio is now worth $110,000 ($100,000 plus the 10% return). What’s more, the portfolio has also generated $1,000 in tax savings – meaning that you’ll pay $1,000 less in income taxes for this tax year than you would ordinarily and thus will have an additional $1,000 to invest for the future.

&gt; Note that Tax Alpha is dependent on your tax rate. For example, if your combined Federal and State income tax rate is 50%, the portfolio in the above example would have needed to tax-loss harvest $2,000 in stock losses to generate $1,000 in tax alpha ($2,000 times the 50% tax rate). Thus, it is easier to generate higher tax alpha in high tax states such as California, New York and Illinois.

&gt; What’s more, portfolios that generate Tax Alpha are effectively able to achieve elevated levels of after-tax performance. For example, the portfolio in the above example has actually effectively returned 11% for the year (10% in investment return and 1% from tax savings).

&gt; This is the reason that the combination of Wealthfront’s Daily Tax-Loss Harvesting service and the Wealthfront Tax-Optimized Direct Indexing are able to add 2.03% in additional annual return to your Wealthfront investments.

These numbers are highly exaggerated and misleading. 

First off, take the assumption of a 50% marginal income tax rate. If you live in California, a notorious high tax state, you still need to make over $415k a year in order to reach the 50% tax rate. This is hardly something that applies to the average person. And if you really are making so much money, why would you only have $100k saved? 

Technically, it is possible to have a much higher tax rate than the headline brackets, due to the complexities of the tax code. For example, the social security phaseout leads to very high marginal rates at certain incomes. However, if you are getting social security benefits, you're probably not looking to start a retirement account.

Second, they fail to mention that the benefits of TLH are capped. You can only deduct up to 3k per year against income. Anything above that is only useful for offsetting captial gains. If you manage your portfolio properly, you should almost never have short term capital gains, which means that it is offsetting LTCG, at a marginal federal rate of 15, 20, or 23.8%, far from the claimed 50%.

What this means is that the 100k figure cited is basically cherrypicked for maximum benefits. Since the income deduction is capped, this isn't an extra 1.0%, it's a fixed dollar benefit. The more money you invest, the lower the ""additional rate of return"", and yet you still pay increased fees to Wealthfront proportionally. Even if you accept every other absurd assumption in the text, simply scaling up your investment to 1000k would be enough to halve the supposed benefit.

Third, these numbers completely neglect the impact of the deferred tax liability. Like many of the other caveats, they allude to it elsewhere on the site and then just leave it out of all of their calculations. TLH doesn't eliminate taxes, it only defers them. The benefit comes from a) if you have a lower tax bracket in the future, and b) returns from the saved money in the meantime. Obviously this depends a lot on individual scenarios, but any reasonable calculation needs to deduct the net present value of the deferred taxes. For example, if you cash out 10 years from now, your tax bracket stays the same, and you earn a 5% after-tax return in the meantime, then the actual present value of saving $1000 today is only $386.

Fourth, these numbers assume the alternative is no TLH at all. Wealthfront continually touts its daily TLH, which does theoretically increase the losses that can be harvested. But even if you only manually harvest losses every once in a while, you can still capture most of the benefit. In fact, since the benefit is capped at 3k, in some circumstances, there is no additional benefit to more frequent harvesting. A fair number would have only shown the benefit of daily TLH compared to what you would have done yourself.

Lastly, there is the matter of Wealthfront's fees, which they don't include in any of their projected return numbers for some reason. Once you've taken into account all of the above factors, TLH obviously isn't bringing you +1.0%, but it still brings some benefit (usually). Isn't a, say, +0.1% return still a good thing? Not once you take into the account that Wealthfront is charging you 0.25% for this service!

Edit: Side note which is possibly irrelevant

It is questionable whether more frequent harvesting is even positive in the first place. To see why, consider a more extreme scenario: assume for the sake of argument that you can make instant trades at no cost, and you harvest losses every millisecond. In that case, you would incur heavy losses. Why? Because *tax loss harvesting only benefits you to the extent that the asset being sold is correlated with the replacement asset*. It is (almost) always better to not have a loss in the first place than to have a loss and pay reduced taxes. The tax benefit is just a consolation prize for bad luck in the markets. 

The theory behind TLH is that you hope the asset being sold will go back up. Since you can't actually just rebuy the asset due to wash sale rules, you instead bu a correlated asset that you hope also goes back up. In the case where you are harvest losses on the order of milliseconds, all of these ""losses"" are likely to be just random momentary fluctuations that won't be captured in the correlated asset. Therefore, you'll lose all your money for no benefit. The more frequent the TLH, the more likely it is to run into this problem. Is daily harvesting safe, or is it too frequent? I have no idea, but it's definitely something you need to take into consideration. Also note that in the real world, frequent harvest has other costs - transactions aren't free and they aren't instantaneous. All else being equal, you're always better off doing fewer transactions.",finance,1468784525
personalfinance,"New potential opportunity after finishing grad school, but as an independent contractor","Hello all,

personalfinance,Help a brother pick a first credit card!,"Hey r/PF!  

I'm looking for my first credit card and I'd like to ask around to see what people have to suggest for me. I'm 27, have a master's degree and a full time job (not huge salary but consistent) but I'm starting to understand that building credit will make my life easier in the long term. My college loans are in good standing and, since they're all through the federal government, I pay the same amount each month with a fixed interest rate. I have no desire to rack up debt with this card, but I do want to be able to spend like $50-100 a month (I don't go out much and I'm an impeccable saver) to grow a stable &amp; healthy credit profile. I ran my annual credit report through the government's website and had all ""green"" zones in all three reports with a score of 678. Other than federal direct loans for school, the only other time I ever used credit was for invisible braces a few years ago. The procedure was $3,700 and the denist's card came with 2 years of no interest if paid in full in 24 months. I paid more than the suggested rate each month and had it all paid back in 18 months; I left the account technically open because I've read that closing accounts is worse than leaving them inactive, so I don't use it but still have it. The age of the account is about 4 years, so that makes my credit life around 4 years old.  

Anyway, I plan on using my card enormously responsibly. I plan to pay off my complete balance every month several days before the due date and have no need to ever borrow money from the card through an ATM. I prefer to live my life through a debit card because I never want to spend a dollar I haven't earned, but that doesn't help grow a credit history and I'm sure I'll need it for a house someday.  

I've looked at the Discover IT (they've sent me a lot of stuff) and a Chase card, but I want to put forth my goals to outline what sort of suggestions (thank you for the time, too!) I'm looking for:  

* I want to travel someday. I know people use cards for miles and that can be turned into free trips, but I'm not supper concerned with that now. I know that you need to spend like $10,000 to accumulate enough points for a basic flight with these things and I'd rather just save up to be able to pick my flights on an open market. With that said, I may as well get a card that accumulates miles that don't expire because - the way I see it - I can accumulate them for the future or just let them waste away.  
* I want to get a text each and every time the card is used. My cousin set his up to alert him every time there's a purchase over one penny, so he gets an immediate text when his card is used. This is probably standard but it's a requirement for me.  
* I want one that comes with a free credit score on the invoice every month so I can track any improvements I may be making. Again, this may be standard but it's definitely something I don't want to miss out on.  

The card that seems really cool - but also doesn't look like a starter card for someone in my situation - is the Chase Sapphire Preferred. Would it be wise to get a JV version of a Chase card and ""build up"" to that good one, or is that unnecessary?  

I basically want to start responsibly building credit with a company that isn't sketchy. I've read so many life-crippling reviews of credit cards and I want to make sure that I don't sign up for something ridiculous and get screwed 40 years from now for it.

I got a letter from the bank that gave me a loan for my car, but there's a few confusing terms I wondered if you might be able to shed some light on.

First paragraph states that my monthly payments will remain the same.

Second paragraph says my loan remains prime + 1.99%.

Third paragraph gets confusing. ""Based on your loans current unpaid balance and new payment amount, the interest rate at which the payments would not cover the interest that would accrue between payments is 22.98%. On the date following any payment that is insufficient to meet the accrued interest on your loan your payment amount will be reset.""

Huh? Here's what I get from this... my payments aren't going up, but I assume prime has, and therefore my payments will no longer cover the interest that is accruing. When the interest I owe gets to the amount of my current payment amount... I don't know. They'll take one of my payments to cover outstanding interest? Send me a new letter informing me of a new payment amount?

I figured this ""reset"" meant adjusting monthly payment amounts because prime had changed, but in the first paragraph it says my monthly payment will remain the same.

I'd appreciate a translation. :)

personalfinance,In a serious pickle with a recently purchased home (VA loan) and an upcoming divorce!,"I find myself in a serious dilemma. My wife and I were finally able to buy a home in the crazy housing market in CO. We purchased the home at the end of April and got a decent interest rate. We used QL and bought with a VA loan. Last week, my wife asked me for a divorce and, with all my might, I have tried to stop it from happening but it seems hope is lost. It is very unfortunate but I'm moving forward and looking at the situation objectively to so I can put this behind me. She isn't interested in getting a lawyer and neither am I since we simply cannot afford it and we plan on cooperating as much as we can to make sure this goes smooth. 

We both love the home we bought and both want to stay in the area. She told me that if I didn't want the house that we cosigned a VA loan on, she would try to keep it. When I said that I DO want to keep it, she put up no contest and said that's fine. I really do want to keep this home since it's in a great location and the home is beautiful. We didn't overextend our selves at all with the home purchase with a purchase price of $279k and a monthly payment of $1344.00 but we did have to cosign to get approved for the home but we were well under our pre-approved amount which was approximately 345k. We have the exact same pay since we are both federal employees and are currently GS-7s with Denver locality pay. In September I get a bump to GS-9.  

So, how do I keep the house? She says she wants to be out of the home ""by September"" so this will come before the pay raise is effective so I'm assuming I still cannot qualify for refinancing by this date since I couldn't qualify by myself to purchase the home. We have no other assets to speak of other than a Jeep that we have equity in but has an outstanding balance of $17k ($340/month). We also have a personal loan that we used to consolidate debt and get a better interest rate which is about $8k ($230/month). The only other thing I have is a student loan that is a $70/month payment and I don't know the current balance but I know it started around $7k and I've been paying for over 2 years (I also cannot currently remember my login info). My gross pay after my grade bump will be $52,642 and it seems like I should be able to afford the payment we currently have ($1344+$180 for HOA) with this income.  

First off, is refinancing my only option to get my STBX off the loan? Am I crazy to think I can afford this house on my pay (rent here is just as bad for a one bedroom unfortunately)? If I can't qualify by September for a refinance can I consider a parent cosigner or is this even an option. I've done basic research and have a call scheduled with QL and another lender that I hope to talk this through with but I also know this sub is a great resource.

I wish we could say, ""Yea this was an unfortunate situation, sorry about that, can we say a dent in a 12 year old car full of other dents is worth $100-150 and call it even?""  If the price comes back very high, I will propose that.

If we simply buff out the new dent that's one thing. But if the only way to remove it is to replace it with a new panel, it will make me feel like I'm paying a premium to get a ""like new/never happened"" result when the panel already had some dents in it and is not new to begin with.  

Also, I do not want to get insurance involved. 

Anyways. I am in the wrong. I am going to make it right. It should not have happened. I already had a big bill on the contractor fixing things and this will be next. So I am just nervous I guess. Has anyone had a situation like this?  What is your advice?",finance,1468815719
personalfinance,"$700 loan through credit union, $350 in CC debt--what to do with the rest??","I'm 21, part-time employed at ~800 a month, full-time student. Rent is 500 a month, just for perspective on my financial situation.  The 350 is medical debt; didn't meet my deductible amount and had to pay out of pocket, which ended up on the credit card. Tomorrow morning I'm going to the bank and paying off the 350 in full because the interest rate is INSANE and monthly payments were killing me. Like, rent and living on ramen killing me. I wish I'd known about the loans through my CU before getting the card but oh well. 

&amp;nbsp;



So now I have a 700 loan (minimum amount I could borrow) at 18% interest and 12 months to pay it back. I'm leaning towards putting the entire amount I don't use towards the loan, cutting down the principal although the 90$ a month payment would remain. 

&amp;nbsp;


Alternatively, I could keep the remainder in savings and use THAT to pay the monthly payments until it was gone, and then pay the rest myself. OR I could buy groceries with part of it, and then use the rest to do either of the options above.

personalfinance,My wife and I want to buy a house.,"Please help. We don't have the first clue when it comes to this stuff. Seriously zero. I understand interest rates and I'm good with numbers. 

My plan was to go to our bank who we have an account and credit card with and try to set up something to see what our borrowing power is.

Finance details. She makes 75 a year before taxes. Most of it goes to her student loans which are about 1300 a month with high interest rates. Her credit score is most likely 750-800. 
My income is zero and my credit is 700-750. 

Right now we have 7 grand in credit debt but have no interest for the next 20 months on it. We have zero saved up to put on a house right now.  Any extra money we try to put towards whatever debt has the highest interest.

My questions are would there be any advantage to me being included in the loan process? I have a no income and a worse credit score. Should she apply for the house and loan solo? 

What type of interest rate should we look for? We def want to do a 30 year mortgage to lower payments so the school loans get paid off quicker as they have higher interest rates. I've read low 3% is good.

I'd prefer to buy land and build my own house? Would this affect my interest rate? Would I not be qualified for a first time home owner deal? 

Is there anyway to buy a house without a bunch of cash up front?

Other things to consider. We currently pay 850 for rent and live a good distance from her work which adds to cost. I live in a recreational state and can grow thousands of dollars a year legally. 
Thank you. 

Edit: we can save up money for the purchase. Would it be better to save up money for a down payment or pay off a 11% interest rate school loan. We put extra money to these bills when we can Instead of saving.

personalfinance,[credit] Potential myth: Regularly settling credit card debt is bad for credit score?,"Hi all,

Just wanted to get some opinions on a potential myth I keep hearing and see whether it is really true or just nonsense.

The theory is that paying off the balance in full at the end of each month is actually seen as less ideal for credit companies because they can earn more with interest rates if I actually pay something closer to the minimum payment?

So hypothetically, credit companies will see me as less profitable for them because I spend £500 in a month on the credit card and then pay the full £500 back at the end of the month rather than paying over the minimum payment but leaving some of the balance which accrues interest for them. I've heard this is something other credit companies take into account.

This sounds like something loosely pluasible but surely it can't actually work like that. Anyone have any experience which can dispel/confirm this?",finance,1468838933

personalfinance,ELI18: Personal finance tips for young adults (US),"Are you just starting out your independent life, and looking for financial advice on how to adult?  Have we got a forum for you!  Here's a collection of pointers to topics of interest to many 18-year-olds;  the specifics pertain to the US in some cases.  These are  topics we get a lot of questions about in /r/personalfinance.  

If you don't see your favorite topic here (e.g. houses, retirement accounts, investments, etc), stay tuned for additional posts coming shortly, oriented towards 22-, 30-, and 40-year olds.  (Here's [ELI22](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tlqsd/eli22_personal_finance_tips_for_older_young/).)

- To start out, you can benefit from [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/teachme) with planning and education advice for those in high school, and recent grads.

- The big change in your life at 18 [19 in Alabama/Nebraska] is you are now legally an adult for contractual purposes, so time to get [bank accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/financialinstitutions) in your own own name, i.e. not with your parents.  You want a savings account and a no-monthly-fee checking account.  Small banks and credit unions typically have [better customer service](http://www.consumerreports.org/banks-credit-unions/choose-the-best-bank-for-you/).  

- You're not going to get rich off interest, sorry!  But you can find better savings interest rates (1%!) at [online-only banks](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/nerdwallets-top-high-yield-online-savings-accounts/).  Put away savings as soon as you can, it's a good habit to get into, and starts your [emergency fund](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/emergencyfunds).  We'll cover investments and retirement savings in future posts;  with limited or part-time income, savings are a better bet for now.

- You can apply for a [credit card](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/creditcards) once you have income.  This is different than the debit card your bank will provide with your account. This has pros and cons, but is a reasonable move for many people.  It's the best way to independently establish credit without paying interest. A [secured](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-secured-credit-cards/) or [student](http://www.creditcards.com/college-students.php) card is probably your best option.  Pay the balance in full every month!  If you can't do that, then you are not ready to use a credit card.

- If you need money to continue your education, learn about [student loans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans).  This is a complicated topic with many options.  Be careful what you do here, since these loans [will be yours](http://blog.credit.com/2015/06/what-happens-if-i-ignore-my-student-loans-84434/) / your parents until they are paid off!  People who find themselves [in trouble](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/08/heaviest-college-debt-burdens-fall-on-3-types-of-students) later usually took  out bigger loans (~$100,000) vs. smaller loans (~$20,000).

- For cost-effective education, it's hard to beat [community colleges](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/four-reasons-to-choose-community-college-2013-11-15).  If you're not sure what to do about continuing your education, look into [two-year degrees](http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/associate), as well as taking credits that [transfer to four-year colleges](http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/professors-guide/2009/09/16/10-tips-for-transferring-from-community-college).  

- You may find yourself working part-time or even full-time.  This is a good time to learn about your [rights and responsibilities](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/employee-rights)  as an employee, including [how you are paid](http://money.howstuffworks.com/wage2.htm) and [taxed](https://www.irs.com/articles/understanding-payroll-and-withholding-taxes), as well as what your employer can legally do with your hours and even when you can be let go.  Fortunately, taxes are low for most young people (if only because their income is low...), and you may even get a refund if you file taxes!  While your lifetime income is the single biggest determinant in your personal finance situation, at this age, your priority is not on current income as much as preparing for the future, thus the focus on education.  

-  This is also the time to start learning about [budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting) if you have significant responsibilities; more on this in future posts. 

- If you want to save money, live with your parents as long as you can.  Seriously!   But there comes a time when you want to / have to leave, and you'll need to rent a place.  Landlords will want to see that [you have income](http://www.myfirstapartment.com/2015/06/how-much-rent-can-i-afford-on-my-income-two-simple-ways-to-estimate/), so try to keep payments below [30% of your takehome pay](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/how-much-rent-you-can-really-afford-renters-solutions-186462).  You may need a co-signer if you have minimal credit history.   You'll need first month's rent and a security deposit up front, and even utility deposits sometimes.  Read your lease before you sign it, and know your [rights and responsibilities](https://www.ziprealty.com/buy/renters-rights.jsp) as a tenant, and what organizations can help you if you encounter issues.  

- Roommates are a popular way to save money on rent.  Be aware of the issues that can come up with roommates though, since circumstances change, and you may be on the hook for their share.  Have all roommates on the lease.  You might even want a [roommate agreement](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/renters-rights-book/chapter6-2.html).  Perhaps Sheldon Cooper has it right after all?  Alternatively, consider renting a room from someone who owns their own house.

- Aside from rent, cars are the biggest expenditure for many young people.  You can save a [lot of money](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/total-cost-owning-car/) if you don't need to pay for one!   It's not just the purchase cost.  There's gas, repairs, and especially [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance), which is  [very expensive](http://www.carinsurance.com/Articles/cheapest-minimum-liability-insurance.aspx) for young people, typically at least $100/month, and can even be $200/month in some places, or if you have a tickets / accidents. 

-  Your best bet if you do need a car is to save up $5000 or so for a [reliable used car](http://www.carsdirect.com/used-car-buying/best-5-reliable-used-car-models), then pay cash, so you can avoid finance charges and make your own insurance choices.  If you do need to finance a car, be very careful of financing offers for young people.  Double-digit interest rates are a Bad Thing.  You do not want to ""build credit"" that way! The loan and the car are different things.  You can't give back the car and be done with the loan, since you will typically be ""[underwater](http://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/being-upside-down.html)"" and owe more than the car is worth.  

- Choose your spending wisely.  Money spent is unavailable for anything else. Make sure it was your highest priority use of that money.

That's all for now.  Stay tuned for the next installment, [ELI22](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tlqsd/eli22_personal_finance_tips_for_older_young/), about more on these topics, as well as retirement accounts, repaying student loans, health insurance, and other such fun things.",finance,1468850706

1. I am an independent contractor (commercial real estate broker).

2. Because I am relatively young in the business and it takes a while to get rolling in terms of income, my firm pays me an annualized ""draw"" of $40,000/year. Each paycheck is $3333.33, of which I save a large portion for tax payments. 

3. In 2015, commissions earned exceeded my draw amount, however for the purposes of income security, I have decided to remain on the draw until a future date. Unfortunately, for 2015, my taxable income was on the commissions I earned, and not the draw amount ($65K v. $40K). 

4. Therefore, I was short by a few grand (4-5K) in terms of what I owed to the IRS, despite my monthly efforts to set aside 25-30% of each check purely for taxes. Had my taxable income been $40K, I wouldn’t have owed much if anything. 

5. I have enrolled in the installment plan to pay back what is owed. 

6. At some point in the next few months I will have built up enough of a surplus (commissions less draw payments) to comfortably stop receiving the draw payments.

7. I am still saving 30% of each draw paycheck for future taxes owed for 2016. Once I am finished with the draw and receiving commissions directly, this practice will continue in the form of quarterly estimates. 

8. I would love to pay back what I owe the IRS for Tax Year 2015 as soon as possible. Right now I am set up to pay $68/month back to them at a 5-ish% interest rate. 

Here’s my question: 

Is there a benefit/detriment to taking the money that I am now “saving” for 2016 taxes/quarterly estimates and just throwing it at what I owe the IRS for 2015? I'd prefer to be rid of this debt as soon as possible and am not super savvy in this area, hoping you guys can help me out!

6/21/16, after talking it over with my fiancé, we decided to cancel services because of the exorbitant amount of money and proceeded with contacting other transportation vendors. I left a message for Ted on his Cell phone making it extremely clear that I was canceling services that I contracted the day before. I made contacts with at least two other transportation companies after calling Ted on his cell phone. 

6/22/16:Ted called back the next day and in his message to me said I received your call and wanted to talk to you. He already seemed irritated in the message that his service was cancelled.
According to the National Black Car terms and conditions I was never given prior to contracting, I had to cancel 48 hours before the event to be refunded 100% of fee. Also according to T&amp;C according to National Black Car. I was supposed to be charged the amount when booking. I was never charged until after my wedding had taken place. 

7/2/16: The morning of my wedding I received an email confirming my transport for the day. I immediately called Ted on his cell phone.I called explaining that I didn’t know why I had gotten an email when I cancelled services. He said I never cancelled services and that it was too late to do so, that I’d be charged the full amount. Upon my clear dissatisfaction with his response he went on to say that if I declined charges I’d be arrested for theft of service. He knew Frankfort PD and would have me arrested on my wedding day. He also proceeded to say he was good friends with the owner of my wedding venue and that he’d personally see to it that my wedding got eff-ed up. He also threatened to physically show up to my wedding to “settle this bill up.” Last he said he ended with eff-ing your wedding and the c**t you're marrying. 

7/2/16: I contacted venue owner who said he really didn’t know this individual and guaranteed my wedding would be unaffected and that security would be notified. At this point, despite the emotional stress my fiancé, family and I decided to worry about this incident later given the fact that it was our wedding day.
7/2/16: After phone call to owner got a series of nasty responses from Ted from his cell phone number to mine. After minimal responses Ted ended the last message with “One more word out of you and you will be in court. Shut your mouth and go away. Just know I’m letting off the hook.”
Despite desire to respond I did not at the advice of my family. I considered the whole ordeal settled, dramatic, but settled. 

7/5/16: Charged full service fee from National Black Car Transport. 


I made a mistake in hiring this individual for my transportation services and quickly realized that and cancelled. The nature in which he responded to me on my wedding day proves in my head he got my message and ignored it to create a scenario. I contacted him the day following my phone call to him and proceeded to look for alternative transportation methods which I would not have done if I was contracted with Ted Malecki. On personal level he acted completely disrespectfully to me and my wife whom he had never met. I am still unsure as to what caused him to escalate his aggression towards me in such a quick manner or for him to act completely unprofessional. He caused her and myself significant emotional stress that day, which is the greatest regret of this entire scenario.

With a daily newspaper route, 365 days a year unless I get a substitute, starting at 4:30am and ending at around 7am that I do in my car I make about 500-600 dollars every two weeks depending on complaints. Great money for the amount of time put in for a college kid but, my car broke down early my freshman spring semester and my father told me I needed to buy a new car. 

Not knowing much of anything about cars or their value and such at 18 my father took me to a car dealership and sort of pressured me into purchasing something that day so he didn't have to worry about it anymore. I'm not blaming my dad but I had no idea what I was doing and now I have a car payment of 345 dollars a month for another about 2/3 years. A brand new car too so the value depreciated immediately and now I'd be upside down if I sold. Not to mention gas since I drive so much for the route 

So one expense isn't so bad but because of my early route my sleep suffered/suffers and my education suffers and I lost federal funding and had to apply for a few private loans. My private loan interest payments are 117 a month. 

I picked up a serving job where I try and make at least 300 a week working 3 days a week but it fluctuates greatly because of business. 

Now my parents are asking for about 250 dollars a month from me for expenses I owe them such as rent and food and cell phone. 

To really put the cherry on top doing newspapers is considered sub contractor work so I'm considered self employed by the IRA. The tax year of 2015 I apparently owed 900 dollars. I'm STILL paying back taxes from 2015 I'm almost finished but then I have to pay a few 300 or so from this year. 

I know this is a long mpost but I don't know what to do. I can't keep getting up at 4:30am then with school and work and rugby going to bed around 10/11 at the earliest it's destroying my chances of success in school. But I can't give up the route because it covers my stupid car. 

I want to move out but my parents would still demand at least 150 dollars a month for cell and other expenses and my car payment is basically the same as a rent payment.

I am young, and working my first ""real"" job, where I make enough to actually care about how income taxes work. I am in a state where there are no state income taxes (yay). I am filing single federally, and currently withhold 0 on my W4. When I file my return, I will claim 1. My current question is this: How much can I expect this allowance (claiming 1) to waive from my required tax payment? For example, in 2015, I believe each allowance was ""worth $4,000. For example, if someone paid $5000 in taxes, and claimed 1, they would only owe $1000. Is this correct thinking?",finance,1468863342

personalfinance,Pay down student loans by individual group or as a whole?,"I feel like this might be a stupid question, but, I currently have a total of $31,485 in student loans and I have actively trying to pay them off.  Currently, the total of my loans are divided up into 8 different ""groups"" as my loan servicer calls them - A through H.  Loans A and B are interest free so for now I am just paying the minimum on those and putting the bulk of my payments to the others.  Loans C - H range in amount from about $3,100 to $7,400.  Loans C - H also all have the same 6.8% interest rate.  I have been just putting my payments towards these groups as a whole and it has been divided evenly among them.  However, I also have the option to specify where I want the additional payment amounts, i.e., I could put all of my extra payment to one specific loan amount.

MachineLearning,Sequence Classification Inputs and Outputs,"Hello,

I'm trying to figure out if using a RNN would fit my problem. Here is my input data:

I have 1000 sequences. Each sequence contains 6000 samples. For each sequence, I have a single label, either 1 or 0.

I have read many sources such as http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html and 
http://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/, but I can't seem to figure out a definitive answer to some of my questions.

I don't have a label for each sample, just a single label for the entire sequence. Can I still use a RNN to classify the sequence? It seems like I should be able to, but I can't quite figure out how the training would work. If I understand correctly, I would wait to perform the backward step and update the weights of the network until all of the 6000 samples were fed into the RNN. I would get a single label once the 6000th sample is fed into the RNN, and I would compare this with the actual label for that sequence. Does this sound correct? If so, then what does the backpropagation look like compared to if I had a label for each sample, is the only difference the number of times that I perform the backward step?

I'm a little lost, any help would be greatly appreciated.",technology,1468877415

personalfinance,Buying points in a 30y fixed rate mortgage.,"Hi y'all.

I'm in the process of purchasing my first home (in the US) and recently was offered a couple mortgage options but am unsure which one makes the most sense to me.

I'm borrowing $250k at a Par rate of 3.875 (4.08% APR, 1,175.60/mo). There are a couple options to buy a cheaper interest rate, but I'm not sure this make sense. I've been treating it like a 30y annuity to see what the implied interest rate is. I'm not sure I'll own the house for thirty years; right now I think it'll be at least six.

* For $312 (0.125%) I can knock the interest rate down to 3.96% APR, $1,157.80/mo
* For $3125 (1.25%) I can get it down to 3.8% APR, $1,122.60/mo, and
* For $5000 (2.0%) I can get it down to 3.74% APR, $1,105.24/mo.

Right now I'm inclined to get the 3.96% mortgage for an extra $312 upfront, but I'm having trouble reasoning through this.

Money not in the mortgage will be in index funds, so I'm balancing a sure 4% return against a somewhat risky ~7%. There's also a mortgage interest tax deduction that I don't really understand, but which I assume makes higher rates more attractive.

Is there some resource that can help me construct the right scenarios for a comparison?  The house, including insurance and property taxes, will eat a little less than 30% of my after tax income, which is the max I was comfortable committing.

personalfinance,"Fishy Car Dealership, please help ASAP!?","Ok so I'm going to apologize for the length up front.
Sorry.

Now, my wife and I bought a brand new car on July 2nd,2016 from a VERY well known Toyota dealership in Texas.   We signed all the papers and agreed to terms with the dealer. 600 dollars a month at a certain interest rate financed through Toyota.  Now fast forward to today (07/18/2016) and my wife gets a call from the finance lady that worked at the dealership and did all her paperwork and she says that they struck a better deal for 575 a month at a lower interest rate with 0 down with Security Service FCU.  She then goes on to say that the finance company called the dealership and said they needed 1000 dollars down like they had originally wanted but I had said ""no way zero down or I'm out"".  Let me say that we traded in a car that we were upside down on and I had told them I didn't want to put anything down. So the finance lady tells the finance company that the customers (us) had no money down to give and that it wouldn't be possible. That's when she said so we got you a better deal at security service.  So this is what's fishy... 

Why would they try to get me a better deal two weeks after I signed contracts with them and with a company not even affiliated with theirs. They lose 1800 dollars just in payments I haven't even done the math on the interest in saving.  They have nothing to gain from it. Also, how would they get my wife and I approved at security service if we already signed a contract two weeks prior and we never gave them authorization to run our credit again.  I'm sure that's illegal?  This all after the finance lady tells my wife that the original finance company (Toyota) wanted the 1000 dollars down after all.  We also checked my wife's credit report and there is a hard inquiry on 07/14/16 from security service which were assuming is for that new deal they're trying to strike. We're assuming this is for the auto loan because we have not applied for credit with anyone after our vehicle.

So I feel like this is extremely wishful thinking but I see this going 1 of 3 ways.

1. I go in and sign for a lower payment and lower interest rate.

2. I go in and don't sign and turns out they did nothing illegal and sincerely were trying to get a better deal and I stay at my current rates.

3. I see through the bluff and say I smell something fishy and ask why they ran my credit at which point the finance lady caves and tells me they NEED to redo the deal because there is just no other way and if I don't sign they take the car away... Which would mean they take the car and either give me my old car back PAID OFF because they already paid the loan off of my trade in or don't give it to me because they already sold to auction.
 (I really wish this one could happen so I could just buy a used car with no payments and save the extra 900 a month with insurance.)

This car had 100K and was in bad shape already. I wouldn't mind them taking the car and not giving back my old one because they essentially just paid off my upside down loan and are in too deep in that car to give it back. Because I would not sign to owe on that car I traded in. I would save so much money on car payments and insurance. I really only traded in my original car because I had just ran out my warranty after putting 100k and was trying to mitigate my damages by trying to get a newer car with a new warranty as my old car was breaking down.

Sorry for how long it is or if it's confusing. I'm just trying to give as much info as possible.

Please let me know if y'all need any additional information.

financialindependence,"(Wall of Text-ish) More ""realistic"" financial situation, moving toward ""financial luxury"" as opposed to independence","Verbatim copy + paste from another thread.  Someone brought up that the people in /r/financialindependence often seem to have circumstances that don't apply to most of us.

To be completely honest, and I think you'll see it in my post, I do make more money than the average Joe, but &lt; $100k / yr and have basically $0 in savings.  In fact, I have a lot of debt.

I wanted to share to demonstrate how the goal doesn't always have to be ""financial independence"", as simply having significant monthly savings can be a huge luxury as well.

If anyone can tolerate reading all of this and you have feedback, I wouldn't mind at all if you shared!

----------

Okay, my situation as it pertains to your post:

* 2-year old kid, who I don't find expensive at all to be honest.
* Separated from daughter's mom
* Paid all expenses while daughter's mom went through school so that she and my child could have a better life
* After she graduated and got a job, I got my own place.  We split time with our child 50/50.  I still have to help her with rent every now and then.
* $15k in vehicle debt, was $20k+ until I started paying it down due to high interest rates (nearly 11% APR)
* Cars are probably out of warranty.  I'm used to paying for their repairs, anyways.
* 6k in credit card debt, was higher until I started paying it down.  Currently taking advantage of 0% interest offers
* $2k in personal debt from a very, very good friend in another country.  Thank fucking goodness.  Without him, I'd be in a lot more debt or homeless.
* Decent insurance, but I don't have time to utilize it
* Community college / dropout education.  ""Self-taught"" developer.  Hurt me at first, but I've busted my ass playing catchup with my CS peers for a few years (the stress is still *horrific*), and now my salary's almost on par with my peers and I have $0 student debt.  That being said, I still don't know shit about algorithms or data structures in the formal sense... I've just acquired a lot of intuition about what makes sense and what doesn't.
* Basically no savings, and I don't contribute to my 401k currently because I'm short-term driven.
* I pay rent, which I'm not sure is better or worse than a mortgage.
* No side work because I am stressed the f*** out as it is, sometimes.  I contemplate quitting my job due to inability to balance everything maybe every other week, which really concerns me because I might actually do it once I pay off my debts.
* Midwest making ~$70k / yr before taxes.  That's actually really good and I'm thankful.  I actually had more money when I was making $40k - $50k / yr though because I had a lot less debt.
* 25 going on 26 years old.

Current expenses vs. income:

* $3,940 net income each month on average, but I get paid 3x a month twice a year.
* $3000 - $6000 in monthly costs.  Insurance renewals and other big expenses are things I try to do during the months I get paid 3x.
* $3000+ monthly expenses on average while I try to pay off all my debts, including $700 / mo rent, $1000 / mo on credit cards, $1000 / mo on car loans, $400 / mo daycare, $200 / mo on food, and $200 / mo spending allowance (which usually goes to food).
* You can see my [public finance template here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xy0e3-X6qF3O9JOjpU5H2rIwLIIQ0ar57CN1C4SBVOQ/edit).  It's very basic, but it's effective and I can go through it once or twice a week no problem.

My path to financial luxury / possibly independence (unlikely, but I don't need to retire at 35 if I want to be completely honest):

* Managed to negotiate a $15k / yr raise over the next 10 months.  This is going to help a lot with comfort, but it ""only"" brings my 5-year savings from $80k to $120k.  I know that's a huge difference, but I achieve a point where I can save independent of any raises, which is good in case anything negatively impacts the market.
* Next November, my cars will be paid off, because I'm so aggressive with payments.  I've slowed down a bit, because it's eaten any savings I had, but I still pay more than the monthly minimum.
* Because of low and zero-percent interest cards, I can take my time paying those.  They'll be paid off within 6 months.
* Because of this, starting early 2018 my expenses should be &lt; $2k / mo.  (About $1800 / mo.)
* Combined with the raise, which again I am incredibly thankful to have received, my savings will average $3k+ / mo.

That is really, really luxurious for me, considering I felt ""rich"" the last time I was free of car debt and only had to worry about ""regular"" bills...  That's enough to fund a vacation every month and it kind of blows my min.

Without the raise and a more ""standard"" wage, paying off these debts would instead take me about 3 years instead of 1.5.  And I'd end up with $1800 / mo in expenses and $1400 / mo in savings.  Still really good in my mind.  It's just I've had the goal of being able to save more than I spend each month because even though I've been working a few years, I'm still not used to it.  My peak performance is at like 20 - 30 hours a week on average.

What's really hard to do is stay focused on saving.  It's hard to cook at home instead of going out to eat, especially when I get tired of my own meals.  (This is actually the #1 rule that I break.)

It's hard when people run into trouble who I love, to instead suggest that they go through the same pains I've had to, instead of just throwing money at them.  (Honestly, doing that solved absolutely zero actual problems for me, so I'm glad I stopped.)

It's hard when I imagine being able to work only 6 months out of the year, to not actually do that.  Not trying to sound like a spoiled ass, even though I know it's a huge privilege, but once I hit $3k / mo in savings, I'm seriously, seriously considering at least taking a sabbatical.  It has just been too crazy trying to keep up with everyone else who seems to function as a ""real adult"" at this point.

When I have extra money, I don't mind spending it, because money has so little apparent value that I just stop giving a shit...  Staying focused is key.  I might not care about money that much, but it's nice to have.  After I started using Mint.com recently, I came to realize that I need multiple bank accounts setup for different things, and that I shouldn't ever really have to touch my emergency funds or reserves for other things outside of their intended purpose...  It's kind of crazy to think about seeing money just sit there, even if it's invested in stock or something, but it needs to be.  The answer isn't ""financial independence"" for most of us, I don't think.  It's to set aside a decent safety net when you can and *just keep working* - not to death, but it's just the best thing you can do.  If you don't touch it or flaunt it, more money is almost always better.  Seriously.

Being in debt has actually been a bit of a blessing.  I've had a lot of time to think about finances, my life, the value of money, and the value of good work ethics and trying to maintain expertise in my field of employment.

In the longer-term, $120k is a lot of money to save in 5 years like that.  I could actually get a cheap house since I'm in the Midwest and keep on saving money until its paid off.  Paying off the house could reduce monthly expenses significantly (on average, at least.  I know house maintenance is a bitch.)  That could lead to genuine financial independence within ~15 - 20 years.  Sooner if stocks perform well.  So retirement at 45 or younger.  Last time I did the math, I only need about $500k to ""retire"", even though it wouldn't be the best retirement.  I'm sure that will go up significantly as time goes on and inflation occurs... Just 0% interest cash savings would put me at $720k if this keeps up.  I actually really like housework and have considered becoming a landlord years from now...

Anyways, sorry this became a rant.  And I know there are some details a little vague / inaccurate esp. when it comes to longterm expenses and retirement.  But I never wanted to ""have to"" work while I was growing up.  The thought of living a life I didn't enjoy was on my mind a lot as a kid.  So I have thought about this all a lot...",finance,1468902862

stocks,The Housing Market Is Hanging On By A Thread Signals High End Real Estate,"The housing market is hanging on by a thread. The thread that is holding it up? Super low interest rates. This is keeping the real estate market floating but significant weakness in high end housing spells trouble. While many areas across the United States are showing increases in housing prices, this is mostly in middle to low end housing. Once you move north of $1+ million, demand has cratered. Why? The upper income buyers have too many questions about the future of housing in relation to the domestic and global economy. In many areas, housing has jumped dramatically from the 2010-12 lows, some places it is approaching the highs from 2007. The wealthy tend to be more housing savvy in regards to finding a good deal. They are also the buyers who use all cash, meaning they are less likely to care about interest rates being a historic lows. The high end real estate buyers are more likely to follow the global news and realize Europe is a mess, Brexit may have a long lasting impact and the United States election in November could have major consequences. Canadian buyers have also left the high end United States markets because of the collapse in oil from over $100 per barrel. While it has recovered somewhat, they are not yet inching back into the market.

Ultimately, high end real estate weakness may be a signal of a downturn in all of housing. Smart money is usually the first to leave the market. The scariest of all is what will happen if interest rates rise even a tiny bit. Look for a major slow down to spread from $1+ million housing into all of housing.

I've recently started to drift away from my target of 35% bonds, currently at 28% all in VBTLX. My question is this:

I spoke with an advisor at Vanguard yesterday, and they suggested that my bond exposure is lower than it should be. However, with interest rates near all-time lows and talk of rates rising, does it really make sense for me to start putting more money in bond funds right now? In fact, if I expect interest rates to rise (which seems pretty likely), why should any of my money be in VBTLX?

I'm a bit concerned that most of the advice I've gotten up to this point has been from advisors who are interested in getting me into managed accounts, but I'd really prefer to pick some good index funds and stick with them. I'm really interested in hearing some of your thoughts on what you'd do with bond funds right now, given that strategy. Thanks!",finance,1468914677

personalfinance,Tax correction due to no state tax being taken out for a year.,"Long story short, I lived in a CA for a year , but my company (in a no income tax state) was not taking out state tax for California income tax.  So now I have paid off the back taxes to the state.  My federal income tax has already been taken filed and taken care of, my question is, does that mean I got over charged on the federal taxes in the long run since federal was charging me at a rate that didnt include the fact I was already paying state?",finance,1468934688

personalfinance,Which private student loan company to look into?,"I'm a rising college senior who's been mostly bookrolled by both financial aid grants and government loans up until now. However, this last year both my parents and I have seen a little bit of increase in money, mine due to a summer internship I'm currently doing. I'm on the hook for about $14,000 dollars for this coming year that I don't know if I'm going to be able to afford. As a result, I'm looking into private loans to cover this cost. 

However, I think I have a unique situation compared to most students at this point. I have decent credit (721 from my last peek) and no derogatory marks, but my parents have the worst credit in the world (back taxes, bankruptcies, unpaid accounts, you name it) and on top of that, aren't in any financial situation to help me with expenses. So basically, I will have to go in without a cosigner or any extra help.

With this in mind, what companies should I look into, and what interest rates should I be okay with?",finance,1468938532

personalfinance,"Cosigner wrecked credit, can I get loan company to help with credit score on loan pay off?","Six years ago I co-signed a loan with my then husband for a car.  We divorced about a year later, he has the car and has never made a payment on time.  I should have put the loan in our divorce but I didn't want any trouble with him as it was an abusive relationship and I just wanted the divorce over and done with.  I spoke to the car loan company and they said the only way for me to remove my name off the loan is if he refinanced in his name elsewhere. (Car place would not refinance) Said he was going to do that then never did, at his lowest paying job he made $46 an hour, car payments are $250 a month at a ridiculous 30% interest rate.  He could make the payments easy but I feel did it as his usual passive aggressive revenge.

As far as I know he should have the payments done this summer or fall. He keeps taking me off the loan contact info according to customer service so that I can't see what amount is left or be notified when the payment is late anymore. He's done this twice. However my name is still on the loan.  

When I used to get notifications he'd be late every month with the payment and then they would start threatening repo every three to four months.  As you can imagine this has destroyed my credit along with another $48,000 debt he's put me in. Right now I've been trying to get a simple bank account since Feburary and no bank will touch me.

My question is: When he's paid off the car is there anything I can ask their CS for in regards to fixing this credit history?  I'm not familiar with this so I don't know if they can delete anything or help improve my score.   Anything advice would be helpful.",finance,1468939616

personalfinance,"Major debt, lack of income.Safe to say poverty status.Any advice appreciated.","My wife had a major mental health crisis back in April, lost her decent paying job as breadwinner &amp; our plan to have all this debt paid off by the end of the year is now at the window &amp; our life is in complete shambles. My wife was always the one to take care of the financials stuff, I admit I didn’t involve myself as much as I should of and so I too am to blame for everything being so fucked up. We are currently living in a camper on parents in laws property, shits just bad. The only positive thing going for us right now is we’ve applied for income based housing which we hope to get approved for and into starting in September. My wife used to be very smart and in tune with this financial stuff, she was well aware of how in debt we were and was very keen on how we were going to better manage our finances &amp; fix it asap. She’s had a majorly bad time &amp; cannot handle dealing with any of our financials anymore (or much of anything for that matter) &amp; I am just plain stupid when it comes to finances. No idea about interest rates, consolidating debt, no idea what the fuck to do. We have no health insurance, we’re trying to do what we can with what we’ve got &amp; the more I try to add up these numbers and sort it all, the more depressed I get realizing we’re in a really bad position. My wife wants to kill herself everyday  and I’m now seeing too why she’s having such a hard time dealing with her mental health on top of all of this. Lifes really fucked up. I guess this is what poverty looks like.

Here’s the numbers, I’m hoping someone can give an idea of what the fuck we should possibly do. 

I bring home about $250-300/week as laborer, I plan to seek new employment in the next 6 months as soon as we get into some stable housing that is closer to work opportunities. I’m juggling so much trying to keep my wife okay,and get us into a stable living environment again on top of everything else we're dealing with on a day to day basis. 

My wife was able to get re-hired at her former workplace &amp; this is the only job she can manage right now with her severe mental health issues. We both have never had an kind of insurance provided with our jobs &amp; she has no decent access to mental health care &amp; we are unfortunately managing this crisis on our own as best as we can. She’s now bringing home $150-200/week when prior she brought home $350-400.

We have a 2003 Toyota Camry on finance, $400/month. We owe about $6500 on it still, and this is our only reliable means of transportation. Insurance is about $45/month. We’re spending more now in gas then ever cause we are very far away from our workplaces I’d estimate close to $150/200 a month on gas.

In exchange for living in this camper on relatives property, $200/month.  We also have all of our items in storage right now costing us $45/month.

Phone bill is $120/month. We owe on the phones and cannot switch to a lower or cheaper plan until our phones are paid off which will not be until Jan 2016. 

On the six credit cards, we’re paying all the minimums but owe as follows:

Capital One has a $3500 limit, 22% interest rate, &amp; we owe around $1300, minimum payment each month is about $70 dollars 

Quicksilver card has a $1200 limit, 22% interest rate, &amp; we owe around $950, min. payment each month is about $30

Citibank card has a $1000 limit, not sure on the interest rate on this one but we owe $650 &amp; the min. payment each month is about $25 (interest tends to be $15.00 or less I’ve noticed)

Wells Fargo has a $1000 limit, no interest on this one but I think the interest will kick in soon cause we’ve had it about a year now, we owe $850 with a min. $25 payment each month

We have a Chase Slate Card which we used to balance transfer some older debt off the capital one card sometime in the last 6 months, it has a $1000 limit, and we owe $890.00 on it, $25 minimum payment, no interest and I have no idea when the interest starts on this one.

We also got a Chase Freedom card with a $1200 limit, we owe $950 on it &amp; I think it has no interest  as well but not sure when the interest will kick in on it. $25 minimum payment on this one as well.

We’re skimping by on whatever food we can afford, typically we spend $60 a week which is meager.We have $500 in savings which was the return on our prior home deposit &amp; we are trying not to dip into that  but we’re cutting it close &amp; fear we will have to soon just to eat. We can’t apply for food stamps because my wifes parents already apply &amp; receive food stamps where we live &amp; apparently if we apply &amp; get approved it will “mess theres up”. This is our only living situation right now &amp; so we can’t rock the boat trying to pursue these even though we desperately need them. We’re 26 &amp; trying to figure this out as best as we can. Any advice would be appreciated. The only advice I’ve had from outsiders is to try to get a bank loan or a loan online (Springleaf &amp; Lending  Tree have  been mentioned) and pay off our debt to consolidate payments since they’re all over the place &amp; of different interest rates,etc. Our credit scores are both in the 630/640,my wifes will soon suffer further when hospital bills start rolling in from her issues in April. I’ve got no idea what to do. Should we get a loan, can we do anything about these credit cards? I just wish we could pause paying on them for  like a month &amp; get on our feet little bit more so we can start figuring our better work prospects &amp; gain a sense of stability again. So far the only thing I’ve thought of is calling the card companies &amp; telling them I can’t make any payments for the month of August, let them ad late fees &amp; start paying on it all again in September but I don’t think that is how that works &amp; I realize we’ll be farther behind.

personalfinance,"Keep renting, or buy now? Looking for advice","I'm at a crossroads.  My apartment lease is up soon, and I can sign a new one, or buy property.

I don't have enough saved to put 20% down right now, but I have great credit (over 800) so my PMI would be fairly inexpensive, about $50/month.  Interest rates are also great right now, so if I wait a year, I worry that they'll have gone up and that even after putting 20% down and avoiding PMI, I'll come out behind where I would be if I buy now.  They're at about 3.5% right now, but if they trickle up to 5%, the benefit of having waited would be questionable, and if they hit 6% then I'd be behind.

I've found a place but wasn't able to get it for the price I wanted, and am in negotiations with the seller.  If we come to an agreement, I'd be looking at having $400–$500 left over in savings each month after obligations and discretionary spending.  This is compared to about $1000 left over in savings each month in my current apartment.

The place is in good condition and I don't anticipate having to make repairs anytime soon, but it'll happen someday, and since I won't be renting, it'll be on me to pay for repairs from my savings.  I also worry that I won't find a place as nice as the one I'm looking at.  I have very specific tastes, and while this place isn't *perfect*, it's awfully close, and who ever finds *perfect* anyways?  I'm concerned I might be upset with myself a year from now if I pass this place up.

I'm also mildly worried about my salary not keeping pace with inflation, and potentially finding myself in a situation where my monthly savings have dwindled and I need to get a second job to stay afloat. Compare and contrast with worries about not being able to retire when I'm older.

In the short term, renting is obviously better, but long term, buying is better (at least hypothetically), especially after I've paid off the mortgage and am looking to retire.  What would you do if you were in my situation?  Buy now or wait it out?",finance,1468941340

personalfinance,ELI22: Personal finance tips for older young adults (US),"Yes, it's me....back with a second installment in our series, ELI22.  This assumes you read [ELI18](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tfc76/eli18_personal_finance_tips_for_young_adults_us/) ( even the links...you'll learn 10X more from the links!) and have done  things pertaining to your situation.  

The ""22"" here  means you're done with full-time education, have a career with meaningful income, and are responsible for your own support.  Some people start this at 18, some at 26; age is not important.  Specifics pertain to the US in some cases.  This assumes you are a single childless renter employee; [ELI30](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uoycd/eli30_personal_finance_tips_for_thirtysomething/) will cover marriage, home ownership, and children.

You have money now, congratulations!  Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) excellent summary of how to handle it.  Here's a [ginormous flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/1rPEkGQ.png) showing what to do first: bills? loans?  investments?  Good self-study!  We'll highlight three Big Ideas to get you started.

- **Taxes**. Your employee income is taxed / withheld like so: 7.5% of the first $118K goes to [social security/medicare taxes](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751.html). (We hope you will benefit in the future, too!)  Then your income is taxed at [higher rates](http://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets) as you make more.  Assuming no special deductions, 0% for the first 10K due to standardish deductions.  Then 10% of the next 9K, 15% of the next 28K, and then 25% tax rate kicks in; this is your rate from 48K  to 102K gross income, so a popular rate.  (It's only 28% up to 200K, as well.)  This is your tax bracket / marginal tax rate.  (Most states also have state income taxes of ~6%ish but they vary a lot.)  Higher brackets only affect your additional income; [you always come out ahead](http://blog.taxact.com/how-tax-brackets-work/) even if more income means a new top tax bracket.   You reduce your taxes with credits and [deductions](http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/personal-income-taxes/tax-deductions.htm).  Big Idea 1 is: [reduce your current taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes) by making less of your income  taxable.

- **Debt**.  You borrow money now so you can spend it, yay!  But then you have to pay it back, and typically pay back more than you borrowed, boo!  You've lost money as a result.  The extra amount you repay is determined by the [interest rate](http://banking.about.com/od/loans/a/Calculate-Interest-You-Pay.htm); the annual rate is called APR.  
3% APR student loan?  You'll pay $30 annual interest on $1000.  Not bad.  
12% APR car loan?  You'll pay $120.  Not good.  
  23.9% APR credit card?  You'll pay $239.  Yikes!  (Never do this!)
You repay the money you borrowed, too; that's called principal.  The longer you take to repay the loan,  the smaller each payment, but the more interest you'll then pay.  It's a tradeoff.  Big Idea 2 is: [reduce the amount of interest you pay](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) by getting lower interest rates, and avoiding / quickly repaying higher interest debt.

- **Investing**.  In ELI18, I noted bank interest won't make you rich.  The good news in ELI22 is: investments can make you  [current millionaire rich](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/save-million-calculator.aspx).  The catch is: it takes decades, and you must regularly invest significant sums.  This why you start at 22!  The ELI22  introduction to investments is based on the [Target Date Fund](http://www.finra.org/investors/target-date-funds-find-right-target-you), wherein you buy shares of a mostly stock-based index  fund  designed to be worth a lot more when you retire at a target date 40+ years in the future.  Historically, these accounts gain about [6% annually](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/) after inflation, though it varies significantly year to year.  Your money doubles every 12 years, and goes up by 10X in 40 years.  (All numbers are  after taking inflation into account.)  So that $5000 you put aside at 22 could easily be worth $50,000 of today's dollars at 65.  (But, there could be years where you temporarily [lose 10%, 20%, even 30%](http://www.finra.org/investors/reality-investment-risk) of your savings.  Do not panic!  It will come back eventually.)  Big Idea 3 is: invest early and often for your future, especially your retirement.  

Got the the Big Ideas now?   Good!  Let's see how we combine them for some meaningful benefits for your ~22-year-old self.

- Retirement contributions. You are going to retire someday.  Invest and perhaps reduce current taxes by letting your employer contribute a percent of each paycheck to your [401k account](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k) (or similar things with different names for government employers).  A recommended investment percentage is 10%, but it's up to you; more is better, the annual maximum is $18,000.  The cardinal rule is [Take The Match](https://www.smart401k.com/resource-center/retirement-investing-basics/company-match) if you have one.  A typical employer adds 3% of your salary when you contribute 6%, so that's like Free Money.  Take The Match.  (Your actual match depends on your employer's rules.) The  money is invested for you, available penalty-free when you retire after age 59.5 (usually.)  If you change jobs, the money can go  with you.  A 401k can only invest in what your employer offers.   Most employers have target date funds, so choosing one is an easy decision.  If you need or want to, you can sometimes achieve an  even better result by picking other available choices.

- ""What do you mean 'perhaps reduce current taxes'?""  Retirement savings are wery wery complicated.  (Thank your  congresspeople.) A ""traditional"" 401k reduces your current taxes because it exempts your contributions from your taxable income.  You pay taxes when you take the money out, deferring the taxes, but you still pay something.  If you would prefer, you can reverse this if your employer offers a ""Roth"" option.  In that case, you pax taxes on your 401k contributions , but no taxes when you take the money out.  The best [choice](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) is complex; for those below the 25% bracket, Roth is usually better.  

- Yet more retirement options: IRAs.  [Individual Retirement Accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) are do-it-yourself 401ks.  You set up an account with a company like Vanguard, Schwab or Fidelity, and give them up to $5500 annually to invest for you.   You have more investment choices, target date funds plus other options.   Depending on your income level and whether you have an employer 401k, you open a traditional or Roth IRA, with tax treatment equivalent to the previously described 401k types.  IRAs are your go-to option if you have no employer 401k, but you still may (and even should) want to use an IRA, especially a Roth IRA, even if you have one.  You can  tap IRA and  401k resources before retirement for certain allowable reasons, though it's not usually recommended because you lose future gains and might owe current taxes.  A Roth IRA is the best choice for raidable retirement savings because contributions can be taken out at any time without taxes or penalties.

OK.  That was a lot of information!  Ready to repay [student loans](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans)?  Let's find out:  

-  If you do have student loans, the interest rate clock is ticking.  Loans are typically 10 year repayment, so you'll owe about 1% of the loan balance each month for ten years.   
If you owe $20,000, that's $200/month.  Like a car payment.  Not terrible.   
If you owe $100,000, that will be $1000/month.  Like a mortgage payment, only without the house.  Not fun to pay.  
You have to pay these back unless you get them forgiven.  You have [several approaches](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans) available for repayment:

- Pay them back on schedule.  It sounds crazy, but it just might work!   If your income supports it, pay the minimum on low-interest (&lt;~4%) loans.  If you have even more income, repay them faster with extra payments, especially on higher interest loans,  and save by paying less interest than you would over time.  This is your primary option on private loans.   If you have high-interest private loans, look into [refinancing](https://studentloanhero.com/refinance-and-consolidate-student-loans-0042/) them; if you have good income and credit, you'll qualify for lower interest rates.  

- If you have a lot of federal loans but  little income, look into [reduced payment plans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) like Income-Based Repayment (IBR) and Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) plans.  You'll pay less (even nothing) each month, based on your current income, but you'll pay longer, and ultimately pay more over time in many cases.  

- If you are really in a deep hole, maybe over $100K federal with only $40K annual income, give a special look into [Public Service Loan Forgiveness](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) (PSLF).  This program allows you to work for ten years in public service, make minimal payments, then your unpaid balance is magically forgiven, which is a really sweet deal if you can get it.  (This differs from forgiveness programs for IBR/PAYE that will charge you taxes on any amount forgiven in the future.)

Enough about  student loans.  Let's wrap up with a few other topics of general interest to 22 year olds:

- Grad school can be a good idea, but can also be a very expensive idea.  If you are sure this is for you, try to get someone else to pay for it, whether the school via scholarships / stipends, or your employer, if they do education reimbursement.  Med school is worth the money no matter who pays.   Law school and MBA return on investment is iffier these days.  Going to grad school because you are not sure what else to do is probably a big mistake, especially so if you have to pay for it.

- You may be responsible for your [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance).  (You could be on your parents' plan until age 26 in many cases, though that may cost them something.) If your employer will pay for it, that's your best option.  They may offer a lower-premium [High Deductible Health Plan](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/10/should-you-roll-the-dice-on-a-high-deductible-health-plan) (HDHP), where you pay routine costs, but insurance kicks in for major expenses.  This is a good choice if you have good health and make few claims.  You  should take advantage of a [Healthcare Savings Account](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/what-is-an-hsa/) (HSA) with an HDHP.  This lets you deduct contributions to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses, with  other unique features that make them attractive.  You can contribute $3350 annually to your HSA.  Some employers pay some of this for you as more free money.   

- If your employer doesn't offer health insurance and you can't use your parents' plan, you'll want to get an individual plan such as those found on [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov).  You can only sign up at certain times, including open enrollment  in November / December.  If you don't have health insurance of some form, you could [pay a penalty](https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/) of up to ~$2000 at tax time, unless you have an [exemption](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/exemptions-from-the-fee/).  

- With more income, you can rent a nicer place within the same 30% of takehome guideline.  You may not even want a roommate!  Of course, any money you spend on housing is money you don't have for other things.  Living with your parents is still a viable option if you want to save, e.g. to pay down student loans.   Please make sure you have renter's insurance, it's well worth the small cost.   (Note that we assume you are not yet ready to buy a house; you may not yet be sure where you  want to live long-term, have limited work history, or have insufficient down payment.) 

- You can also afford a nicer car, since you have better credit, and  lower insurance rates.  (You don't have to upgrade your car, and you'll save money if you don't.)  Paying cash is still an option, but if you qualify for a 2% car loan, consider taking it to free your money for purposes like retirement investments and loan repayments.  A good target price is perhaps $15K, with a $10K loan, which works out to 4 years at $220/month.  Your total cost-of-car would be about $5K annually.  Selling your old car privately should get you 20% more than you would by trading it in to a dealer.  

- With more expenses, budgeting becomes much more important.  You'll want to have a bigger emergency fund; we recommend at least three months' expenses, to cover that bad day when you lose your job and your car breaks.   With more expenses to track, look into a program like [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (ynab) or [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) to help keep track of where your money is, and where it needs to be in the future.  Look for ways to economize where you can, whether by cheaper cell-phone plans, learning to cook so you want to eat at home, or taking advantage of employee discounts.

I had this huge multi paragraph essay explaining my situation and my bills and expenses along with my income to determine if we should stay the course or get this loan, but it got deleted because fuck Alien Blue's app.

I make roughly 2,500 a month, and have calculated that even at 15.99% APR we would still pay less a month (my credit card has a large interest rate that this bill would eliminate). We would also avoid collections on several of my newborn son's medical bills and get out of collections for 4 bills as well.

personalfinance,How should I consolidate my debt?,"Hello, I'm looking at consolidating some debt from a high interest card into something more manageable. I also need to get some work done on my car in the next few weeks that could total more than I have in cash right now.

The card I'd like to pay off I've had for a very long time since I had pretty bad credit and has a fairly high rate. It's also a Discover so it's not widely accepted, like at my preferred mechanic. I have good credit (but not great) and the percentage of my total credit used is high. Right now I'm considering trying to get a Chase Slate and use the 15 month 0% balance transfer with no fees, or getting a personal loan from my bank that would consolidate debt and help me get some work done on the car, at a much lower interest rate.


Things I've been thinking about:

* With what I'm paying now, I could easily pay off my debt within the specified time using the Chase Slate card whereas it would take me quite a bit longer to just make my payments normally.

* I've heard that an installment loan is better for your credit score than multiple lines of credit, is there any truth to this? This should allow me to still lower my monthly payments while getting some extra things taken care of.

* Being that most of my credit available is tied up on a high interest card, would it be easier to get an installment loan to pay it off with?

* Is there anyway I could do both? Get the personal loan, then transfer that balance to a 0% card and pay it off in the perscribed time with slightly higher payments. Seems like that would get me the best of everything.",finance,1468946001

personalfinance,"Medical debt, student loan, taxes","I was disabled for 2 years starting 5 years ago. It drained all my savings, medical expenses accrued faster than income and I was basically destitute. I didn't file taxes for a couple years because I didn't make anything, lived partly off student loans, credit cards, then eventually family members.

Eventually had a brain surgery 3 years ago and turned things around.  http://i.imgur.com/xyfSLEx.jpg

If I wouldn't have had insurance I would have qualified for medicaid or hospital charity, but because I had insurance (through my girlfriend's work) I was stuck with a lot of bills above what the insurance would pay.....and at the time more than my income....

I have never missed a credit card payment, have paid a mortgage for 13 years on time. At one point last year I had all my credit cards paid off completely.

Last Oct I was hospitalized again for a collapsed lung, sticking me with another $3k+ in bills on top of what the insurance paid, plus medications, co-pays, bunch of crap.

Just for the $3k bill from Oct, I told the hospital I could afford $50/mo towards it considering all my other monthly expenses, and they said the lowest they could go is $250/mo without sending it to collections. 

I put that on an auto payment on a credit card, along with another one for the same amount, then I hit a slow period at work for a couple months, and let the card max, then paying a few hundred a month which the card would then let a charge for $100 more than what I paid, putting the card over the limit and declining one of the two charges, and transferring the medical debt to CC locks me in at high interest rate.

At the same time, I've been mostly paying $377/mo for student loans, but with all these other bills I feel like a slave. I talked the student loans down to $250/mo which is better.

Then after surgery, I transitioned to a new career, where I started making a lot more money, but last year I was a contractor, this year I got hired as an employee. I didn't realize the self employment tax is another 15% on top of the federal income tax. I set aside enough for the federal income portion, but not the 15%. 

I owe the IRS another $22,000, filed an extension and factor in the penalties, my one good year I ended up with &gt; 40% of my income going to taxes, along with all this medical stuff, student loans, etc.

Then this spring we hit a lul where I didn't have a pay check for 2.5 months, and put a dent in savings again, but I hung on because last year I made $3k - $3500/week without getting overtime which I now get, but we've been slow this year in between a few major projects. I have ~$12k saved up towards the $22k I owe the IRS. 

I had an accountant file an extension and am trying to get the money together to pay them off, but I'm also spending all this other money to less important bills which I should probably be saving for the IRS....

What should I do with my medical debt? I just a couple weeks ago learned there's a statute of limitations on debt, which sounds amazing, but it starts from the time of my last payment. Around half of it I've ignored, some is 5 years old now, never had anything garnished but they call every day. 

I also live in Seattle, which is very expensive just to live, let alone pay all these medical bills I had no choice over, and especially when I would have qualified for assistance if I didn't have health insurance and wouldn't have the debt in that case.

It's been 5 years and I never filed bankruptcy, not sure if it's worth it now or what I should do so I'm asking for any advice you may have....",finance,1468952932
personalfinance,What strategy for combining finances would you suggest for a couple with significant income differences.,"Hello! This is my first PF post, so my apologies if I do something wrong or say something stupid. 

After many years of long distance, my fiancée [34F] and I [29F] finally get to move in together! We've both lived with partners before, but never with a life-long commitment in mind, and never under these financial circumstances. 

Here are the details- I just finished my PhD and will be starting my postdoctoral fellowship this fall. My salary will be **$43,692** per year plus benefits. She works for the state government and makes **$103,000** per year plus benefits. 10% of that gets taken out automatically for her pension, so it's actually more like $92,700.  So she makes more than twice as much as me.

Both of us have significant student loan debt (her much more than me, but her law school helps pay some of it off), but no credit card or other debt. She has significant retirement savings (over $100k) and I have a decent emergency fund (~$9k). Our rent will be $2300/month (ugh, Boston), plus utilities. 

So far we have split the joint housing costs (first and last month and security) evenly. We've also been evenly splitting our wedding savings (getting married this fall- wedding will cost around $10k, parents contributing $6k combined).  We have a joint savings account (all wedding stuff right now), joint credit card, and just opened a joint checking account. All of this has so far been split evenly.  

My question is how should we split our bills and such? We were thinking of each contributing a percentage of our net income to join expenses (rent, bills, savings, etc) and keep the rest for our personal expenses. That seems like it would be the most fair for both of us- I won't have to spend my entire salary on living expenses, but she still gets to keep more for personal expenses. Is this a good idea? What percentage would you recommend? 

I'm also not 100% certain how to handle all our student debt. She has $126k, I have about $77k total. Her law school pays for a percentage of her loans and she's also currently doing income based repayment for her federal loans (the bulk of them) so her monthly payments aren't too bad. Unfortunately I fell into the New Jersey NJ Class loan scam, so most of my loans cannot be adjusted based on income. So I'm looking at around $900/month for my loans. 

Do couples usually consider student loans joint expenses or totally separate ones? I'm kind of inclined to think of them as joint since we will both be benefiting from the education we received in terms of career and salary for the rest of our lives. Any suggestions on how we split these bills?

personalfinance,I'm so lost on creating a budget... can someone tell me if I'm doing it right?,"I am starting my first career job out of college in a few months and will be making 33,000 a year. The second year my pay goes up to 40,000 (two year fellowship-type deal... after it ends I am hoping to either go to grad school or get a job paying a similar amount). I will be living in a major US city but it is one that has a much lower cost of living than the Bay Area where I grew up, which is part of why I am having such much trouble because I am used to family/friends spending 50% of their income on rent. I think I might be going a little crazy because I am very excited at the prospect of being able to afford a decent-quality studio on my salary because I never would have imagined I would be able to do that in my life from knowing about rent in the Bay Area. 

I have calculated that I will be making approximately 25,000 the first year after taxes. So this means I should be spending around 625 a month on rent, right? Does the traditional 30% include utilities or not? Is it terrible to spend 725 a month on rent if it includes internet? I need a tool or person to help me plan a budget... all the ones I see are for people who already have expenses. I have literally no idea what I'm doing and if I am stupid for wanting to spend so much on rent. I don't know what I'd be spending on utilities but from my renting experience in college I doubt it would be more than 100 a month. Is this reasonable to expect? Am I being completely stupid and should I live far away from work or live close to work with roommates (both options would potentially bring me down into the 600s or even less)? I'd like to live in the same place both years so want to plan my rent my first year budget rather than my second where I will be making significantly more.

I have no student or car loans. If I live close enough to work (which is why I am wanting to live in a place that has rent in the 700-800 range as opposed to 625), I don't think I would spend more than $70 a month on transportation ever (high estimate). I also will have around $100 personal property tax for my car a year. At least for my first year, my parents plan to keep me on their health insurance and cell phone because they currently do not pay extra currently to have me on these things and the family plan is cheaper, but this may change in a year due to sibling situations. My stepdad will be paying for my car insurance also the first year, most likely. I am not sure what other expenses to consider than rent, utilities, food, transportation, and ""extra"" stuff (which would be whatever is leftover after savings)? I typically don't buy a lot of clothes or other personal items. Am I forgetting things?

My main question is how much I should be saving. I have approximately 13,000 in savings right now. I am assuming this will go down a bit with moving expenses and paying a security deposit etc. My original goal was to save 500 a month (I know I would need low rent to do so), but then I have no idea how much I should be putting into retirement (working for the federal government so they have a good plan and I know I should use it). How much should I save in my personal account and how much should I save in my federal retirement account? How does the retirement account even work? When I'm done working for the govt do they give it back (I do not know if I will be permanently working for them after these two years).

I just want something that will tell me what I should be reasonably spending on things but can't find anything to help. Can anyone give me advice or a basic budget? Or a budget-builder? I think if I know how much I should be saving then I could make a potential budget myself- this is what is holding me up so much.",finance,1468959673
personalfinance,"(US) Law grad with loans, looking for help","Good afternoon r/personal finance. Hoping for some guidance and advice. The following a debt (student loans) question primarily, but I’m also happy for any other advice.

So I graduated from law school a handful of years ago, and like many of my fellow compatriots I had some difficulty with job hunting. Honestly, going to law school in 2009 seemed like an okay idea… apparently it wasn’t. Anyway.

When I graduated I was top 1/3 of my class from a top 50 school, and my debt was just shy of 100k. A lot but not insane for a lawyer. I had a job offer I was set, which I lost due to market conditions (not my fault).

Anyway, in a fit of depression I ended up ignoring my student loans until I got my career back on track (my fault); a period of about two years. During this time I was underemployed/unemployed.

Apparently because I was making less money at the time I would have been eligible for deferment, but I didn’t apply for it. (Again, my fault)

I have now been employed for the past 10 months in a job that is related to my law degree, but not in a law office. 

I’m very happy professionally, but unfortunately I’m only bringing in 45k. I live in an expensive city and while I am not struggling to feed/clothe/house myself I am up against a wall with the whole get married and start a family financial aspects.

I went back to try to get a handle on my debt early this year, and while I am now on IBR (income based repayment, which is 10%). However I found out that in the past 2.5 years, the fees and interest have ballooned my debt to over 200k (from less than 100k principal).

My current payments are going towards refurbishment, which I finish in two months.

I seem to be losing ground on my debt, even as I’m repaying it. Am I just stuck paying 10%+ of my income to the US government for the next 20 years? Is there anything I can do (other than up my income, and try to apply for more law jobs which is unlikely?)

Thankfully all of my loans are federal grad plus loans, so I’m not dealing with any private entities. I have no other debt, and I own my car outright. The only other thing I am paying is rent (1k a month).

I am also paying 3% to my HSA and 7% (which is matched) to my retirement fund.

After this I have been able to save $200 a month, which I am putting into a savings account.

What can I do about my debt? I am fully refurbished in a month, and then I get sent back to the USDOE from my debt collector. I’d like to have an idea of anything else I may be able to take advantage of.

personalfinance,Questions about the role that Eurodollar bonds play in portfolio investments,"As a portfolio manager dealing in managing capital investments on behalf of investors, why would you prefer to purchase a Eurodollar bond of a US company over purchasing a US company bond issued in the US? From my understanding in the class, the interest rate paid on bonds issued outside of the United States is lower because of the demand for US Dollars outside of the United States. So, why would you want to receive a lower interest rate for the loan than if you bought it in your own country?

Also, I get that people outside the US really want to get their hands on US dollars, but how does buying a Eurodollar bond equate to ""getting your hands on dollars""? First off, the currency denomination of Eurodollar bonds are dollars, meaning you have to pay for them in dollars, right? So if you're trying to get your hands on dollars, why would you get rid of whatever dollars you have by buying a US bond, and, even moreso, why would you take a LOWER interest rate for doing so?

Also, once the bond reaches maturity, the US Company sends a US check to the foreign bondholder for the principal+interest? How does that in any way mean the Eurodollar bondholder is going to get dollars back? They have to deposit the check somewhere, and unless they have a US bank account somewhere, how do they get it back as US dollars?",finance,1468961763

personalfinance,"Restructuring debt through a refinance, not sure which way to go.","I've been casually browsing this sub for awhile, and am generally aware of personal finance principles.  I'm on step 3 of the ""How to handle $"" wiki on the sidebar, and am in discussion with a lender on refinancing my house.

Note: Sorry for the round numbers, but they allow me to wrap my head around the big picture easier.

Current situation: Bought the house at market value for $388,000 in 2012, 30 year fixed at 3.625%, rolled in the fees for $396,000 loan amount giving me a monthly mortgage payment at ~$2300 which covers taxes and insurance.  We currently owe about $365,000 on it.  Because of timing and neighborhood the house value has increased to ~$600,000, magically giving us about $235,000 in equity.  We want to take about $100,000 in equity and pay off some high-interest credit card debt to help lower our monthly output.  I make about $95,000 per year and my wife makes about $85,000 per year.  She is now 4 months pregnant, baby is due in December, at which time we are planning on her not going back to work, so living on just my income.

Refinance situation:  We only want to do a fixed-rate loan.  We watched the crisis of 2007/2008 and are terrified of a rate adjustment.  We are going to go with a VA loan which has a specific cutoff for our lender.  If we borrow less than $417,000 we can get a 3.2% interest rate, if we borrow more than that we get a 3.625% interest rate.  If we just take a loan for the equity of $100,000 I don't remember the interest rate but the payment is going to be around $1,000 per month.  Insurance and taxes are not included in that amount; I would guess taxes are probably $4,000 (2 payments of around $2,000) and insurance is ~$600.  If we spread that out monthly maybe $400-ish per month?  So, possibilities that we are thinking about:

1. Refinance the full amount we are looking for, $465,000, at 3.625% which puts payments around $2100 per month.  This is better than our current situation (if we don't think about taxes and insurance) but might not maximize our effectiveness.  Total output around $2500 per month for 30 years.
2.  Refinance just the first mortgage, $365,000, at 3.2% which gives a payment of ~$1,600 and take a separate $100,000 loan for the rest of it at the $1,000 monthly.  The advantage that this approach has to me is that once the $100,000 loan is paid our mortgage is a very manageable $1600, so we can probably live on 1 income for a long time.  I know we won't be paying off $100,000 before December but if we put everything we have into it we can knock down quite a bit before December, and then maintain for awhile until it is fully paid.  So, for now the output would look like $3000 per month and then drop down to $2000 per month long-term.
3.  Refinance the $417,000 at 3.2% which gives a monthly payment of about $1800, and then take a separate loan for the other $48,000 which should give a monthly payment around $500.  This approach maximizes the amount we can get at a low interest rate and it's probably attainable to nearly pay off the $48,000 by December, but we would be committing to a long-term mortgage $200 higher.  It's not a big deal, but I can see that being important sometimes.  For now, output would be $2700 and long-term drop to about $2200.

We are both incredibly fortunate to have great jobs - but we literally have no idea what to do with our money 

Salaries - she makes 250k and I make 188k and we also get annual bonuses around 40-60k at the end of the year 

House - we own a house that we bought 2 years ago at $388- it is now valued around $400k. Principal remaining against the mortgage is $310-315k (we paid under 20% down)

Savings - we have around $150k in savings in the bank. 

Investment accounts - we both max out our 401ks at $18k a year - have 80/20 and 70/30 splits in those doing low cost index funds 

Debts - other than the mortgage I have $10-11k in student loans at a 6% interest rate

Expenses - our expenses (I think) are relatively low given our income status, we don't have a car and we don't have any other debts other than my student loans and the mortgage - so this allows us to save $50-75k a year plus whatever we get in bonuses

Now to the kind of upsetting part.

My wife, before we were married got sold a:

1) whole life insurance policy by her current financial advisor. She is 2 years into the payments ($12k a year) so it is essentially worth nothing right now from a cash value perspective. I think at this point it makes sense to keep paying this for a couple of years so that we haven't set $24k on fire - at the end of year 3 it will be worth $11.5k

2) the same financial advisor has her putting $6k a year into an investment account with a 1.4% net expense ratio 

3) rolled over her IRA into a 1.02% expense ratio 

He has stated that the whole life policy was a good idea because it is tax-sheltered upon withdrawal after retirement age - is this true? Does this make sense?

Goals: and questions:

we would ideally like to purchase a home in the next 12-18 months - this will probably be in the range of $950k-1.2mm. 

- is this timeline realistic?
- can we afford to buy this without immediately selling our current home?
- should we wait for any other reason?
- should we fire the financial advisor who sold the whole life policy to my wife?
- what else should we be thinking about from an investment perspective?",finance,1468994541

Hi all

About a year ago I asked if my method for paying back my loans was the most efficient way to do so.

After racking up 100k of student loan debt for 4.5 years at a state university ( crazy right!?), I landed a job where I could allot myself $2500 a month to pay back my loans (while living at home w parents).

My method so far has been to pay the minimum on all loans, then take the difference of $2500 - sum of minimums, and put that at the largest loan with the highest interest rate. I have knocked off 3 private loans in doing so. Here is a summary of the past year: http://imgur.com/Jd7CWAG

$40k down, 66k to go.

My question is whether i should continue To do this, or try to refinance the 3 private loans I have left. I also have two private loans that are nearly identical in principal owed and interest rate. Should I split my bulk payment in half and pay them both back faster, or do it one at a time? This image might clarify what I mean. http://imgur.com/cefKk7U

Is it worth it to refinance or change up my game plan, or is what I'm doing the most efficient repayment method?

•	$775 rent (I am 2 months in to a year lease in a high rent region – nope not moving for a while to reduce this. I already have 2 other roommates as well splitting costs. My rent will also go down when I begin to split a room with my SO starting next year.)

•	$40 for electric (all other utilities are included in rent)

•	$20 for my share of internet

•	$330 starting in January for student loan repayment (I’ve applied for a lump sum to put towards the principal on my loans through the Student Loan Repayment Program. For people who got it last year, it was about $4,800 after taxes. I have $32K in student loan debt in total – a combination of direct subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans)

•	$53.74 biweekly for health insurance (not possible through my parents even though I’m under 26)

•	$200 for groceries, gas/transportation, and misc. necessary expenses per month

•	$300 or so MAX on travel/weekends with SO since we’re long distance in a month

•	Shopping around for car insurance so maybe $80/month on that

•	Aunt has graciously agreed to continue with me on her phone bill, though I will pick that up when I likely get a raise in a year (~$10K raise expected)


This is $1,884 spent and $476 left over per months with 2 pay periods. This is with me assuming the max I’d be spending in some categories when I’m often less. I’m planning on taking that left over portion, as well as the entire third paycheck for months with 3 pay periods, and depositing it into savings. So, r/personalfinance, how am I doing and what needs to change?

personalfinance,At a certain point does student loan debt become monopoly money?,"Hi r/personalfinance!

I need some help with the girlfriend's situation.  She's afraid to post here because she thinks everyone will be mean to her. :-p  Here's the deal:

She currently works full-time as a nurse.  On her way to becoming a nurse she got various advanced degrees (she currently has 3, two in nursing and one in epidemiology) and has racked up approximately $300k in federal student loan debt (all Stafford and Plus loans).  She now wants to go back to school to become a nurse practicioner. She thinks this is her dream job.  This program will cause her to accrue another $150k or so in student loan debt.  Realistically, with her income she's probably never going to be able to repay a $300k student loan and even less likely to repay a $450k student loan.  

Her plan has been and continues to be to use the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service).  Fortunately, most hospitals (where she is interested in working) are non-profits.  Under this program as we understand it if she makes 120 payments (10 years) the rest of the loan is forgiven tax-free.  

To make those 120 payments, she'll do an income based repayment program and if we were to get married we would file separate tax returns so that my income isn't added to the student loan payment amount (my income is in the $X00k range, where x &gt; 1). 

So, what are the holes in this plan?  Based on these circumstances is there any reason for her not to take out additional student loan debt to pursue the career she really wants? 

The only risk I see is if the program is changes significantly before she graduates, in which case I'd expect her existing loans at least to be grandfathered in.   

Any and all thoughts welcome. :)

personalfinance,Seemingly Insurmountable Student Loan Debt,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

I'm 25, two years out of college (BS in Geography, emphasis in GIS), and I've screwed up pretty bad, mainly by going to a school I couldn't afford and assuming that it would land me a fancy job, so that I could easily pay off my loans. The fancy job part didn't happen (I'm now a GIS Tech for a small county government), and I'm realizing how deep of a hole I'm in. Here's my current situation:

Annual income (after taxes): roughly $26k.

Loan 1 (8 federal Stafford Loans with one loan company): total balance of $30k (3.4% to 6.8% interest), paying $190 monthly.

Loan 2 (3 state loans [Texas] with one loan company): total balance of $50k (5.25% interest), paying $380 monthly.

Loan 3 (4 parent PLUS loans with one loan company): total balance of $115k (7.9% interest), paying $710 monthly (in forbearance until October, but this one is going to *kill* me.)

Credit Card: total balance of $2k, have been avoiding using it, and make the minimum payment monthly of $25.

My monthly expenses vary, but it's mainly my half of rent ($475) and gas. I need to cut back on frivolous spending, too.

My girlfriend pays the other half of the rent, and she insists on handling all utilities, cable, groceries, etc. because she makes over twice what I do, and wants me to focus on this debt first. I'm extremely lucky to have her.

I just need a plan. I need to know what to pay off first. I can't consolidate my loans, because one is federal, one is state, and one is in my mom's name. I **will** pay the one that's in my mom's name, and I **will** pay it on time, because that's what we agreed on, and I'm not going to let my decisions affect her credit. I know that I'm not necessarily legally responsible for that loan, but I have a great relationship with my mom, and I'm not going to let money cause tension. I've already called the loan companies and gotten them to reduce the payments as much as they can based on my income, though I could probably do the same for the parent-plus loan.

Any advice, anything at all will help me out.

personalfinance,How can a bond fund can yield 15%?,"I'm seriously lost when it comes to bonds. Simply pointing me in the right direction with some reading material or links would be fine. For those who are patient I have a couple of questions.

Vanguard Long-Term Treasury Fund is yielding over 15%. https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&amp;FundId=0083 Compared to other Vanguard funds it is outpacing all target retirement funds and all other stock funds for 2016.

I thought bond funds were low risk with stable yields through good times and bad times. I never would have expected a bond fund to yield anymore than say 5%.

This brings up a few questions. 
Is this only occurring with Vanguard bond funds or are most bond funds outperforming stocks?

Should an investor pick and choose bonds like stocks?

I understand the inverse relationship between price/yield... but is this really being exemplified in the market. I thought yields were lifted by the fed, but how does that explain a significant increase in bond prices to justify an increase of yield in the mentioned mutual fund?

Am I missing the total point of how these funds increase in value? Doesn't price of assets increase the price of a fund. Do they obtain yield by cashing in from these bonds thus benefiting from a rise of yields?

I know the interest rates are good right now and as a first time homebuyer with very good credit I should be able to get a loan with a low downpayment I understand (3 to 5% I think?)

**Income:**  $2,650/month (after taxes, healthcare, pension, etc)

**Money** (in checking account): $12,500

**Student Debt**(3 loans): $(15,500) = $(92+332+95)/month=total of $519/month

**Car loan debt:** $(2,800) = $260/month

**Rent:** $(800)/month

So between my rent/car/student loans I'm paying over 1,500/month (55% of take-home).  I can free up $780 month by paying off my car/student loans.   I would like to buy a house(or condo) with a mortgage/taxes/HOA/etc of around $1000/month or less.   Should I just use my savings of $12.5k as a downpayment and keep paying my loans as normal and put off buying a house for a year?   I've ran my budget though next year, and I can pay off all my loans by next January (6 months from now) and be DEBT FREE with $5,000 left in my checking.  

My payoff debts as soon as possible budget puts me Debt Free by January 2017, and at $18,000 savings by January of 2018 but still renting.  So debt free and a bigger downpayment, but puts off homebuying for 12-18+ months.

My homebuying budget (and not paying off debt early) has me using $10,000 for a downpayment in the next 6 months, means I would still be able to save and payoff all my loans by January of 2018. Just 1 year later.

I really want to get debt free, but I really want to buy a house and stop wasting money on rent too.   If I pay everything off first before saving for a downpayment, them I'm renting for another year, and that's another $10,000 spent on rent.  

I'm really leaning towards paying off my loans first.  Do I risk interest rates going up by waiting a year, and if the economy keeps improving I'm also nervous about rising home prices too.

I feel like we're in a good position financially for our new addition, but wanted to ask the crowd of knowledgeable people here what you think.

Right now we have an emergency fund of nonretirement savings equal to 7 months' expenses (or likely 6 months' expenses when you add in the monthly pro-rate of the USDA's annual average cost of raising a child), and with us cutting back our splurges slightly we're putting away $1k a month into that fund.  We're both 32 and are contributing our respective 401(k) amounts necessary to get the maximum match from our employers.  We rent our home, and own our car outright with no outstanding payment.  Our only debt is that we go through $5k a month on credit cards to earn points, paying off in full each month.

I figure my goals should be:

1) When baby arrives, set up a 529 plan for him/her right away, the dollars I put in now will reduce my highest-tax burden, so $100 in will be a lot less than $100 reduction in take-home pay, and it gives the most time for money to grow in the market.

2) Expand our Healthcare FSA for anticipated baby medical expenses (delivery is likely to be free as wife is a nurse and all care is free at her hospital).

3) We may be able to ""trade off days"" with a friend who also has a baby for childcare, but if that falls through and we need to actually cut checks for childcare I'll need to set up a dependent care FSA as well (will probably be better than the credit in our case).

4) Look into living revocable trusts and wills, just in case.

5) Life insurance/AD&amp;D insurance through my employer.  I get one year of coverage automatically through work, but I think it might be worth increasing, at least to top out the cost of raising a child were I to get hit by a bus and my wife need to go it alone with our kid?

One note: we have no need to buy a home.  We live in the DC area, and lived in the NYC area before that - both places with very expensive home prices.  If we were to have to move to Wyoming, we'd buy in a heartbeat, but our savings level reflects an assumption we made over the years that we'd be renting as long as we're in this part of the country.

***MY BIG QUESTION IS: WHAT AM I MISSING, WHAT AM I FORGETTING?***

Another question: there's a chance we could get put in a childcare situation where we need to buy a second car.

btc,A General Summary for John Nash’s Proposal: Ideal Money and its relation to the ethereum hard fork.,"The following is a general summary for the proposal “Ideal Money”. The suggestion here is that the ICPI or consumption index, that John Nash spoke of and wrote of, as a possible ideal basis for backing a currency, is truly only a theoretical side street used to abstract a solution proposed by him and referred to as Ideal Money. In order to understand this point and the purpose of his side street we will outline a few key factors of the proposal.

First we must necessarily make a quick note of Hayek’s essay “The Use of Knowledge in Society” in which he explains the fundamental problem of economics lies in solving the ideal distribution of useful commodities .  Hayek not only describes this problem in great detail, but also a very clever machine we might use to solve it: the entirety of free markets as a pricing mechanism. Hayek is careful to explain no other subset of the markets, let alone an individual, could do this so accurately:

&gt;…the “data” from which the economic calculus starts are never for the whole society “given” to a single mind which could work out the implications and can never be so given.
    
&gt;The peculiar character of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely by the fact that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess.

Interestingly, at the end of the lecture Ideal Money Nash admits there is a parallel line of thinking between Hayek and the proposal of Ideal money:

&gt;…after consulting with some of the economics faculty at Princeton, I learned of the work and publications of Friedrich Von Hayek.  I must say that my thinking i apparently quite parallel to his thinking with regard to money and particularly with regard to the non-typical viewpoint regarding the functions of the authorities that in recent times have been the sources of currencies.

We must keep Hayek’s solution to the market pricing problem in mind in order to understand the proposal “Ideal Money”.

The initial consideration from “Ideal money” can be summed up from the following excerpt:

&gt;…”ideal money” currencies could be arranged for by using an appropriate index of the prices of internationally traded commodities.

We can compare this point with a concept from Adam Smith’s TWON in which he explains that excess monies printed beyond the value of the commerce it represents, necessarily returns to the banks in exchange for a medium that better represents the underlying commerce and/or might be traded beyond the reach of the paper money:

&gt;The whole paper money of every kind which can easily circulate in any country, never can exceed the value of the gold and silver, of which it supplies the place, or which (the commerce being supposed the same) would circulate there, if there was no paper money. If twenty shilling notes, for example, are the lowest paper money current in Scotland, the whole of that currency which can easily circulate there, cannot exceed the sum of gold and silver which would be necessary for transacting the annual exchanges of twenty shillings value and upwards usually transacted within that country. Should the circulating paper at any time exceed that sum, as the excess could neither be sent abroad nor be employed in the circulation of the country, it must immediately return upon the banks, to be exchanged for gold and silver. Many people would immediately perceive that they had more of this paper than was necessary for transacting their business at home; and as they could not send it abroad, they would immediately demand payment for it from the banks. When this superfluous paper was converted into gold and silver, they could easily find a use for it, by sending it abroad; but they could find none while it remained in the shape of paper. There would immediately, therefore, be a run upon the banks to the whole extent of this superfluous paper, and if they showed any difficulty or backwardness in payment, to a much greater extent; the alarm which this would occasion necessarily increasing the run

In relation to modern day Keynesian economics Nash, in a curious and backhanded way, points out such an over printing of money, verses the underlying value it represents, effects “quality” in the gresham’s or “ideal-ness” sense:

&gt;The idea seems paradoxical, but by speaking of “inflation targeting” these responsible official are effectively CONFESSING…that it is indeed after all possible to control inflation by controlling the supply of money (as if by limiting the amount of individual “prints” that could be made of a work of art being produced as “prints).

This relationship highlights the concept for a new standard for measurement-a currency’s supply in relation to the underlying commodities/value it represents:

&gt;…its was the observation of a new “line”…for “central banking” functions relating to national currencies that gave us the idea for the study of “asymptotically ideal” money.

However Nash also notes the difficulties of implementing this standard:

&gt;…although that scheme for arranging for a system of money with ideal qualities would work well…it would be politically difficult to arrive at the implementation of such a system.
    
&gt;…for the government of a state, acting on its own independently of other states, to rationally contemplate the evolution of the inflation rate for its currency towards zero there are clearly some very relevant considerations relating to tax revenue expectations.

This levates the possibility for a very interesting solution proposed by Nash:

&gt;…it occurs to me to think that that which is not achieved by a grand action of establishment by “fiat” may alternatively tend to come into existence as a consequence of a process of evolution.

Since only the markets can properly price commodities, and since ideal money functions in relation to an ideal basket of commodities, then only the markets can determine optimal currency supply.

It stands to reason then, in order to rein in the suppliers of each respective (Keynesian/central bank) currency towards an ideal policy standard, one simply creates a market for the currencies. By using the pricing mechanism Hayek spoke and wrote of,  the “players” of the markets naturally sort out the value of each currency (with respect to the relationship highlighted by Nash and Smith).

Consequently players in the great game of central banking/monetary policy control are FORCED to participate in a “survival of the fittest” market environment:

&gt;“Keynesian” players in this game have natural opponents (or co-players, beyond zero-sum perspectives) who are interested in not being themselves “outsmarted” by those who control the options that determine, say, the quantity supplied of the national currency.
    
&gt;And so the various currencies managed with “inflation targeting” would be comparable by users or observers who would be able to form opinions about the quality of the currencies.  And what I want to suggest is that “the public” or the users, those for whom a medium of exchange functions as a basic utility, may develop opinions that are critical of currencies of lower “value quality”.  That is, the public may learn to demand better quality of that which CAN be managed to be of better quality or which can be manged to be lof the lower quality observed in so many of the various national currencies in the 20th century.

Furthermore Nash notes, a standard that is as decent (or better!) as comparable present day standards in this respect, will necessarily evoke such evolution:

&gt;I think of the possibility that a good sort of international currency might EVOLVE before the time when an official establishment might occur.
    
&gt;To be quite respectable, in a Gresham-advised sense, money needs only to be AS GOOD as other material commod-ities that might be hoarded.

&gt;Now the possible area for evolution is that if, say, an inflation rate of between 1% and 3% is now considered desirable and appropriate in Sweden, then, if it is really controllable, why shouldn’t a rate between 1/2 % and 3/2 % be even more desirable?

Because of bitcoin, as a decent (but not necessarily ideal!) benchmark (and especially since it is exchangeable in nearly every country), the result of market competition is that any currency wishing to survive MUST evolve to better represent it’s respective underlying ICPI:

&gt;Starting with the idea of value stabilization in relation to a domestic price index associated with the territory of one state, beyond that there is the natural and logical concept of internationally based comparisons.
     
&gt;The currencies being compared, like now the euro, the dollar, the yen, the pound, the swiss franc, the swedish kronor, etc. can be viewed with critical eyes by their users and by those who maybe have the option of whether or not or how to use one of them. This can lead to pressure for good quality and consequently for a lessened rate of inflationary deprecation in value.

Therefore, the solution for connecting currencies to an (ideal!) ICPI happens without actually ever determining an ICPI or any formula or implementation for it:

&gt;It seems possible and not unlikely, however, that if two states evolve towards having currencies or more stable value as measured locally by national CPI indices that then also these distinct currencies would tend to evolve towards more stable comparative relations of value.

&gt;Then the limiting or “asymptotic” result of such an evolutionary trend would be in effect “ideal money” but this as a result achieved without the adoption of anything like an ICPI index as a basis for the standard of value.”

&gt;…intrinsically free of “inflationary decadence”..a true “gold standard”, but the proposed basis for that was not the proposal of a linkage to gold

The impossible trinity still holds as impossible, however EFFECTIVELY “Ideal Money” solves the problem humanity has been prevented from overcoming by it. There is then an asymptotic approach to global stability-a true monetary standard!

&gt;The metric system does not work because french chefs de cuisine are constantly cooking up new and delicious culinary creations which the rest of the world then follows imitatively. Rather, it works  because it is something invented on a scientific basis…

&gt;Our view is that if it is viewed scientifically and rationally (which is psychologically difficult!) that money should have the function of a standard of measurement and thus that it should become comparable to the watt or the hour or a degree of temperature.

&gt;…this standard, as a basis for the standardization of the value of the international money unit, would remove the political roles of the “grand pardoners,”…

The conclusion outlined in this writing is that the new standard of “ideal-ness” whether solely theoretical or not, isn’t bitcoin per se, but rather a theoretical (or future!) money who’s supply and monetary policies functions in a stable and predictable relation to its’ underlying ICPI. This theoretical Ideal has been shown as impossible to reach in design yet effectively and naturally achievable with the implementation of a universally exchangeable money that has a truly competitive predictable and stable nature in the “Nashian” sense (ie bitcoin).

&gt;…my personal view is that a practical global money might most favorably evolve through the development first of a few regional currencies of truly good quality. And then the “integration” or “coordination” of those into a global currency would become just a technical problem. (Here I am thinking of a politically neutral form of a technological utility rather than of a money which might, for example, be used to exert pressures in a conflict situation comparable to “the cold war”.)

&gt; So here is the possibility of “asymptotically ideal money”. Starting with the idea of value stabilization in relation to a domestic price index associated with the territory of one state, beyond that there is the natural and logical concept of internationally based value comparisons.

In turn (and in time) this evolution will naturally cause each currency (that survives), to asymptotically approach stability and predictability in relation to it’s respective underlying ICPI.
Lastly since bitcoin does have an interesting relationship to Nash’s proposal of ideal money, what is further curious is Nick Szabo’s seamless tying together of money with computer science, telecommunications and networks:

&gt;Metcalfe’s Law states that a value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its nodes.  In an area where good soils, mines, and forests are randomly distributed, the number of nodes valuable to an industrial economy is proportional to the area encompassed.  The number of such nodes that can be economically accessed is an inverse square of the cost per mile of transportation.  Combine this  with Metcalfe’s Law and we reach a dramatic but solid mathematical conclusion: the potential value of a land transportation network is the inverse fourth power of the cost of that transportation.

Which is exactly what Nash hoped and predicted we might eventually do:

&gt;…since we are so dependent on our use of it and so much controlled and motivated by the wish to have more of it or not to lose what we have we may become irrational in thinking about it and fail to be able to reason about it like about a technology, such as a radio, to be used more or less efficiently.

&gt;…money itself is a sort of “utility”, using the word in another sense comparable to supplies of water, electric energy or telecommunications.

&gt;…we can consider the quality of money as comparable to the quality of some “public utility” like the supply of electric energy or of water.",cryptocurrency,1469061113

3 years ago I bought a car cash because I crashed mine in the winter solid car Honda with 100K miles on the clock. everything is fine no issues just serviced and the timing belt snapped destorying the motor (contact motor) just started a new job. Started taking my motorcycle to work and started car shopping I only got a few hundred for selling the car with a blown motor. 

went to a few dealers and they all told me i had crap credit (was unemployed for a stint 5 years ago and lived off credit)  and they banks would only finance a used car with moderate miles got sold on refinancing. found a car with a payment i liked $300 a month but it was 20%+ interest. I needed a car winter was coming and my bike was not great for turnpike everyday so i bit the bullet.

Fast forward to now, I was recently helping a friend car shop and started looking for me I really started looking for something that is going to save me gas money because the car I bought uses high test and doesn't get great mileage. And my car is going to need a new clutch ($1800) and new Tires ($600) within the year.

In my hunt I found a car but I am upside down $5000 on mine. Now I found a car that was close out and talked to the dealer and we negtiated to the point where they are giving me more for my car and talked to the price of the new car down and we have meet at MSRP out the door.

I feel like this isn't a terrible financial decision. the cost per month goes up to $357 but I'm going to save around 80-100 bucks a month on gas and insurance.

personalfinance,Foreigner in the USA looking for a checking (and possibly a savings) account,"Hi guys. I'm a foreigner (Indian) in the USA. I was using chase earlier while I was in NYC. But I moved to Boston recently and discovered that chase doesn't really exist in Boston. I thought this'd be a good opportunity to open an account in an online bank or a credit union so that I can avoid the random fees that big banks usually charge.

With online banks, I narrowed down on Ally, because of their relatively high interest rates for savings/checking accounts. However, there was one big problem. Which was that I couldn't transfer money back to India. I expect to invest a lot of money in India over multiple times (~3 times a year) and this becomes an important thing for me to have. I could do a domestic transfer to my Chase account, but I'd hate to be charged by both Ally and Chase just for the domestic transfer itself.

Another option is to go for a credit union. I was strongly recommended DCU by a relative. But I found the only difference from Chase was that 

1. there were ATMs in Boston 

2. their minimum balance is nearly 0

3. incoming wire transfers are free

On further research I discovered Alliant (which has a decent interest rate but pretty high transfer fees) and PenFed, which seems better in every way than Alliant on paper. When it comes to PenFed, I'm not sure if I am eligible to have an account, on account of being a foreigner. Also, I read on various sources that they are pretty conservative and they don't offer large credit and the rates are not all that good (I could be wrong here).

So, I guess my question is if you guys think going for a checking (and possibly savings) account at Alliant or PenFed is indeed the best option I have? Do you guys have any other suggestions/advice on this? Thanks in advance.",finance,1469070074

btc,Ideal Money is (possibly) money that doesn’t lose its purchasing power over time.,"Money with an unstable purchasing power (over time) cannot be said to be ideal, especially if the purchasing power is expected to decline.

Central Banks use monetary policy to target inflation for economic growth. There is an accepted “slight” devaluation of our currencies over time.

But leaving these governing systems to create their own index for “stability” creates a centralization of power, a(n unnecessarily) security leak in regard to stability of purchasing power.

National fiats also get into a position of wanting to devalue to encourage export.

The US can’t necessarily devalue without changing its role as the (de facto?) world reserve currency.

Our Keynesian attempts at stabilizing currencies and growth are doomed to failure, built on naturally corruptible metrics that cannot possibly hope to be forward thinking enough to achieve the intended goal of stability.

Hayek teaches us ONLY the totality of the markets could have such precision, information, intuition etc.

So “Asymptotically Ideal Money” is this:

“Good money” is to be favored by the markets and this would show up in price, provided we have a universal exchange for getting in or out of each national fiat.

Today because of bitcoin, and as adoption grows, citizens of each respective nation has the choice of either their nations fiat, or bitcoin (or any other option available in the future).

So even a self interested government, trying to manipulate currency for their own gain (taxation, capital gains etc.) still must respond to the new game this option creates.

There is then an asymptotic evolution, where the markets lead the Keynesian/central banking policies in the direction of stability of purchasing power.

Ideal Money essentially achieved through either adoption of bitcoin AND/OR national fiats of increasingly better quality in the gresham/nashian sense.",cryptocurrency,1469073591

personalfinance,What to do about my credit card debt?,"I'm in a bit of a pickle about what to do about my credit card debt and I was hoping r/personalfinance could help! I have one credit card, with Wells Fargo, which I've had for a year and nine months. I let my bad habits get the best of me and the balance ballooned to $5800. I haven't used it in six months except for $30 per month recurring payments for Spotify and Netflix and I've gotten it down to $4220. The current interest rate on the card is 22% and I get 1% cash back on all purchases (woopdedoo). My current payments are around $120 per month and the interest is close to $80 per month. 

I recently graduated with a degree in ""Agricultural Leadership and Development"" (shit shit shit major I know, and I took out so much loans it's embarrassing to talk about) and as you can probably imagine, I'm have trouble getting employment. However, I have great restaurant management experience (3.5 years total, including 1.5 years as a general manager) for a well respected company. I quit that job in May when I graduated for various reasons, mostly wanting to get out of the industry, but I now see that restaurants will be my most lucrative option. I have been interviewing and expect to get a job within the next month making $45-50k salary. I also mow a lawn for an older couple that pays me about $550 per month (it's a big lawn) but I don't know how long I will have that lawn because they recently were put into a facility, and two smaller yards that pay me  about $100 per month combined. Those amounts will probably drop when winter comes around, although I am in Texas so the grass never really slows down THAT much. Once I'm employed, I plan to put every penny from mowing towards my credit card debt as it is severely impacting my credit score. I'll also put any bonuses that I may get with a restaurant towards it, so I am confident that I can pay the total down in a year or probably less. 

My question is, if I can qualify for a credit card with an interest free first year, should I get one and move the balance to it to curb the interest charges? Will this affect my credit report worse than just having a high credit utilization for a longer period of time?

(1) He is catering to the lowest common denominator. Take a look, top post yesterday (2 days ago?) was a Lily Allen Twitter Twit from like a month ago, NOTHING about a successful Ethereum Hard Fork or about what this means for bitcoin needing to fork as well. NOTHING about the network limit...

(2) Looks f-ed up right? It is from our perspective, but think about the 40-50 year old middle manager who has been hearing about bitcoin for a few years now. He finally decides to do a google on it, ends up at r/bitcoin... Now, do you want him to see a bunch of contentious news that may as well be in Greek for him, OR, that the pop star his wife likes also likes Bitcoin!

(3) We need a Theymos. If Bitcoin was a corporation we would have a marketing dept. that is Theymos. Developers HATE marketers, consumers HATE marketers, upper management HATES their marketing department, they are professional salespeople/liars, but every major company has them on staff, and that is what we need for bitcoin too. Would we call only seeing positive ""news"" on r/McDonalds Censorship? no, of course not, it is a subreddit controlled by their marketing team. Right now r/bitcoin is just being controlled by BS's marketing team. 

(4) It is not censorship, it marketing. Why insist on calling the removal of negative/contentious posts censorship at all. If I go to r/McDonalds and give a detaild post about how a 50 pc. chicken nugget gave me the shits, it would be removed (I'm gonna try this just to make sure). And that is OK, because I can make a new subreddit at r/McDonalds_gave_me_the_shits if I want, and really we don't want the two to overlap necessarily. 

(5) TL:DR, its time for r/btc to grow up, move on and LINK BACK TO r/bitcoin as an ""official bitcoin sub for beginners"". There should be a beginners and advanced bitcoin sub and the sooner we move in this direction the better for everyone. We will do more good for ourselves and damage to u/theymos if we just let them be what they are, a bitcoin (BS) marketing platform.",cryptocurrency,1469112527

WFC and Amazon entered into this partnership today -- ""Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by market value and the second-largest private student lender by origination volume, will shave a half a percentage point off the interest rate on student loans it extends to applicants who are members of Amazon’s Prime Student.""

""Wells Fargo had $12.2 billion in student loans outstanding at the end of 2015, compared with $11.9 billion at the end of 2014. One of the largest private lenders, the bank sold substantially all of its government guaranteed student loan portfolio in 2014.""

As a huge fan of WFC, I am worried by their pursuit of the student loan market. I don't know how competitive they can remain with the rise of smaller innovative business models like SoFi. Moreoever, I'm also worried that the bank sold substantially all of its government guaranteed student loan portfolio -- I think this was a risky move granted student loan repayment is so dependent on the economy, and that millennials, as as a group, aren't doing too well.

In regard to the actual partnership with Amazon - I think it will largely be a wash. I don't think it will have much of a dent on bringing in new customers. As a former student loan borrower myself, half a percentage point in interest was not enough incentive for me to make any significant decisions on choosing lender, if other terms  (like deferral) were not the most favorable. Still, its nice to see my favorite bank partnering with amazon.

personalfinance,"""Found"" a small retirement fund. Leave it be, or knock out a small credit card?","Preface: My financial situation is, well, awful.  I'm a failing lawyer with a crapton of student debt, a small mortgage that now exceeds the (very low) value of my house, an upside down car loan (although there's hope on that front as the manufacturer will be buying my car back for more than it's worth in a few months), and over $20,000 in credit card debt, about $4000 of it at rates over 20%.  I have about $400 in the bank with a little over $1200 due in the next week as receivables from clients, but I'm behind on bills by far more than that.  I won't be ""caught up"" for at least the next $3000 of income.  

I'm also fighting through substantial disabilities and other obstacles.  I just suck at life in general, I guess, and I have bipolar disorder and ADHD which have really impaired my ability to earn a consistent living and manage my money effectively.  I'm trying, but I keep failing.  

I'm a military veteran and a few days ago I decided to look into whether I'd left anything in the Thrift Savings Plan when I got out ten years ago.  Turns out I had and I'd just never gotten a statement because they had my address wildly wrong.  There's about $1100 in there, not much but something.  If I understand the statement correctly (I may not) that's a pretty astounding amount of growth from the only $200-300 I remember contributing to it.  

So the question is, what to do with it?

The obvious go-to advice with a ""found"" retirement account is to leave it alone and let it grow until I reach retirement age.  At this point I have no other retirement savings, having cleaned them all out to help with living expenses during law school, on the flawed assumption that I would be making enough after school to pay it back.  (I expected to be earning six figures by this point in my life; instead my earnings this year are on track for about $45,000.).

In the most optimistic scenario, the small amount in this account could blossom to enough to live on for a few months by the time I'm 65, but the problem is that at the rate I'm currently going my debts will be increasing more and faster than that.  

If I were to cash this account out now, I would lose about 30% of it to taxes, leaving me about $800.  That matches the balance of my smallest and highest rate credit card.  So I could pay that off and eliminate a $30 monthly payment and have the psychological benefit of being a little closer to debt free.  

Next, I could use some of the surplus from selling my car back to the manufacturer (VW scandal) in the fall to pay off my next two high-interest credit cards, and while I'd still have over $10,000 in credit card debt, I'd at least no longer have any truly horrendous interest rates, and with my utilization rate and DTI down I might have a chance at actually restoring my credit score (currently around 620-640 depending on who I ask) and being able to refinance some of my other debts to lower rates, ideally by getting a home equity loan (mortgage is through family so on paper I own my home free and clear).  

So for the moment, the question is this: cash out this small account and pay off a small credit card, get the psychological benefit of making progress on my debts but lose an extra $100 to taxes and whatever long-term potential the account holds, or leave it alone and know that I've at least got *something* going towards old age?

Then the next question will be, when the car deal happens, use *that* cash to pay down credit card debt, or leave the debt alone and keep some cash on hand so I've got some breathing room for a few months?

Thanks for any pointers.",finance,1469122020
personalfinance,"Car Purchase - Buy with cash, or take loan to build credit? (Also looking for house soon)","I'm sure this has been asked before, but I couldn't find it in the search, so I apologize if a similar question has been answered.

Here is my situation. I am going to be buying a used car soon, and I have the cash to cover the purchase (EF all set, no other debts, saving for retirement just fine). My credit score is good (about 720), but reading the Wiki makes me think I should shoot for a 740. My current score is also based solely on 2 credit cards I have opened with an average account age of 18 months with no late payments. 

The big kicker is I'm looking to purchase a house in about 8 months and would obviously like to get the lowest interest rate on my mortgage as possible.

Would getting a loan (and paying it off quickly to avoid as much interest as possible) to buy the car benefit my credit score? Will that benefit be outweighed by the hit I would take from a new line of credit opening? And would that possible increase in credit score happen within ~6 months so that I would have a better score while searching for mortgages?

personalfinance,"Currently living in a storage room, $1,500 per month net income. I have the opportunity to take a $10,000 coding bootcamp for FREE. But it's 4 hours away. Trying to figure out how to make this work.","**Current situation:**

I live in a storage room with rotting floors that has made me sick a couple of times this year. I badly want to move. Very badly. I moved into and have stayed in this place because I am able to save $400+ a month.

*Edit: It appears people think I live in a storage shed or something similar. To be clear what I mean by ""storage room,"" I live in a storage room of an old mobile home. I'm essentially surrounded by boxes but I have space for my yoga mat or whatever it's called (6x2 folding pad). It's my own personal room, so to speak, with carpet from the 80s smelling of old cat piss and shit...I don't know if that's better or worse than people thought, but there you have it.*

Now I have $4,400 to my name. I own next to nothing: laptop, phone, clothes, mini fridge, 2-burner camping grill, two pillows, blanket, a yoga mat for sleeping, and my car is all I got. But it's all I need right now and it will all fit in my car.

I have been awarded a federal grant to take a coding bootcamp. It is 4 hours across the state. So, if I do this I will have to move. If I had a tent, I would just try to camp (edit: yeah, everyone is right. Camping isn't an option during the late Fall/Winter; so scratch this idea).

I am currently reaching out to friends to see if they have friends I could stay with, but nothing has materialized yet (found a friend to stay with! Heck yeah!).

It's a 16 week bootcamp from late September through January in Omaha, Nebraska.

I am just trying to brainstorm options because I want to make this happen.

I am currently in retail sales and hate it. 30 years old and finally getting my life together.

This could be my ticket out of this entire situation (retail sales and storage room).

My employer hires software developers too, although those jobs are in Texas, California, and other states more than 1,000 miles from me. Software developers start out at $75,000 base pay for this company and take home is around $99,000-$110,000 depending on bonus.

Needless to say...I want that, and the job listings say they DO NOT require a bachelors degree in computer science or related. They want to see portfolios though. I am not expecting to get that salary right after the bootcamp, but after a few years I could always try.

Right now, there is 0% chance I will ever come close to six figures in retail sales. 

Based on my situation, here are my questions:

1. How do I approach my manager to discuss this opportunity? I would like to ask her if I can just go on non-paid leave while I take the coding bootcamp. Then come back and apply for software jobs within the company. I'm skeptical I'll get anywhere near $100,000, but I could 2-3 years from now with extra training. The problem is, I am asking her to hold a job for me that I expect to leave. Also, I don't want to put myself on bad terms with her because well, I just don't want to do that. Secondary to that is I need her and my direct manager as good references for the future. I don't want to piss her off by asking for a leave of absence during the holiday season.

2. How much money should I be willing to offer for a room to stay in from friends of friends that I have never met? With only $4,400. I feel like the max I could afford is $200 per month ($800 total). That would leave me with $3,600 for 4 months for food and whatever else (fuel is paid for by the grant). Hopefully I could pay less (or nothing) for the couch to crash on/room to stay in. But how should I manage my money? All cash so I see exactly where I'm at each day?

3. Is Airbnb even an option for 16-weeks? I don't need much, just a place to sleep. I will be in bootcamp from 8-8 every week day and on weekends I would probably be at the public library doing more research...or mixing in with the other homeless people, lol (not really laughing).

If it helps, I was hired as a temp and they liked my work enough they created a position for me. The district manager has already said that when anyone of us leave (team of 12 people) they won't hire anyone else because we are over staffed.

Even if my current employer will not save the job for me, I still think this is a really good opportunity. If I could get to Omaha and take the coding bootcamp, complete it, and get a job, my life satisfaction would be so much higher. Also, the worst case scenario is I am back on the job market for sales, just in a different city.

What are my options here? From a financial perspective, I think I have to take the chance. 

Thank you for reading.

Edit: I would essentially use this coding bootcamp as a ""foot in the door"" and get experience. Then I would try to find employers that have tuition assistance and get my bachelor's degree in computer science part-time while I work full-time.

Edit 2: RIP Inbox. Wow, I appreciate all the comments. I will get back to them when I can. As for now, I am off to the library for some books and I am checking out Code Academy and Coursera to get a leg up on the code camp.

**Edit 3**: For those wondering how I got into my situation. Let's simplify it like this:

* Graduated college in 2011, couldn't find job, first person in my family to get a degree

* Depression set in, then got out of it.

* Used my last $600 to play poker in Council Bluffs full time. (Turned that $600 into 12 months of living expenses)

* Couldn't do poker full time any more because putting rent money on the table got too stressful.

* Got part-time job where a friend worked, commission cut four times in three years as cost of living rose, good friend and manager died of a heart attack at 28 years old. Kinda got depressed again.

* Stayed at job moved in with co-worker as commissions were cut again

* Co-worker caused a bed bug infestation which led to me losing all of my belongings

* Moved away for better opportunity

* Didn't find that better opportunity, unemployed from August 2014 to July 2015

* Found a part-time sales job

* Chose to live in a shitty place for $100 a month to save all of my money so I could move to China and teach English. The week of July 17, 2016 I applied for a teaching job in Shenzhen, I found this grant. I saved $4,400 to move abroad and now I have an opportunity take a $10,000 code camp for free because I'm a poor mofo.

* Posted to reddit.

* Here I am.

That sums up my last 5 years of life from age 25-30.

Edit 4: Unfortunately, I do have debt. $42,000 student loan from the federal government that is on PAYE (pay as you earn). At 6.5% interest it adds on another $230+ in interest each month. Then I have a credit card in collections with $9,200 that I am currently trying to negotiate. It will probably take all or most of my $4,400 to get rid of that debt. Oof! It's my own fault though.

Edit 5: For those saying I'm an idiot for staying where I am, I appreciate your forwardness of criticism. However, it was either this or paying $600 per month in a 1BR/BA or $400 in a 2BR/BA. If I did that I would either be living straight up paycheck to paycheck or worse. Living the way that I have allowed me to save the money to get out of my situation. Looking back, I could have gotten another part-time job to help build a savings faster. Regardless, I'm in a position to get out of the living situation, and out of the town where jobs don't exist and nothing ever happens.

Brutal details: Have 225K in student loans. 100,000 is Navient (private) between 7-11% , 125,000 is federal between 3.5-7% . 


Although I have a high balance, I was still making payments while in school to try and keep the balance from ballooning.

A week before my graduation (in May of this year) I found out that they were closing the office in Southern California and moving the employees out of state. I had specifically taken this job because it was located in Southern California and I did not want to move. The company offered to ""buy-out"" my job offer and basically give me compensation for the fact that they changed the terms of the offer and I had already made arrangements to move 500 miles from my college (also in California) to the city where this office was located. This was obviously a thinly-veiled attempt to prevent me from suing them.

I accepted their ""buy-out"" and they are in the process of sending me the money. I signed a legal settlement stating that they would give me the full amount, and I would be responsible for paying the taxes, and they would send me a 1099-MISC at the end of the year.

I have already found a new job in the area and I can withhold extra money from the paychecks for that job to make up for the federal and state taxes that are not withheld from the settlement.

If I do have to pay FICA taxes, how do I do that? If I don't, then what do I need to do when I fill out my 2016 taxes to indicate that this settlement money is not subject to those taxes so I don't get in trouble?

personalfinance,"How to allocate extra money? Paying down student loan &amp; credit card debt, trying to save, living almost paycheck-to-paycheck with little wiggle room","Some background:
I graduated last year and plan to go to medical school in 2-3 years. In the interim, I'd been working odd jobs for a year (didn't make very much), and as of a few months ago made a big move (due to family situation) and am completely financially independent.

I have a great job that offers great networking and experience in preparation for medical school, but I only earn $34k, though my benefits are great. I also work an additional contracting job that's pay-as-I-go, so I may make anywhere from $0-200 extra per week (currently around $50 on average).

I can cover all my necessary monthly expenses just fine, but after a student loan payment of $200 (temporarily in repayment until I enroll in school again--I've opted for the graduated repayment plan, and these are federal loans with fair interest rates) I only have anywhere from $200-400 left to pay off other expenses that I've put on my credit card (more on this later).

So, here's my main area of confusion and need for advice: I had a mutual fund set up through a previous employer that I left sitting for a while, and nearly forgot about. Because I have credit card debt (0% APR for now) and student loans in repayment, and I'm still getting my life on track, I decided to sell all my stocks so I can get myself on more solid footing. This has given me a boost of $1600. I know this isn't a huge windfall, but it has the potential to make me feel more comfortable and give me a little buffer to help me save more.

Now I'm trying to decide if I should allocate a certain amount of that to debt, next month's needs, and savings (currently $0--I know, it's bad, I'm working on it), or just put it all in one place or another.

Here's a full breakdown of my current debt obligations:
Student loans: $28k, currently being paid in $200/month payments; interest rates for each few-thousand-dollar chunk range from 3.2-6.6% (rounded)
Credit card: I have multiple cards but only let debt accumulate on one card, totaling $1,300 at the moment. This card has 0% APR until early 2017, and once that offer ends I have another with a $0 balance transfer fee that would give me 0% APR until 2018. 
Personal debt: $2250, 0% interest rate (brother was kind enough to lend for my first months of rent)

Given all of this, what do you think I should do with that extra money? Put it in savings and/or put towards next month's essentials? Pay down debt (credit or student)? 

Are there any other options I should consider?

personalfinance,(CAN)Should I sell my car if I don't need it even though I'm underwater and will have to roll the balance to another loan.,"Hi all, I have a question to ask all of you.

Currently I have a car, I pay $479 per month (2.79% interest), plus $199 for insurance and maybe $50 per month in gas. I live close enough to work to not own a car and bike/take public transit if absolutely necessary. I don't plan on moving outside of my city any time soon, and I really don't think my job is at risk of being lost any time soon.

I still owe 31,000 on my car, and could probably expect to get 19-20k for it from a dealership, maybe 23+ privately. Meaning I would need to pay an additional 8-12k to close the car financing loan.

I have a line of credit that has a 7.7% interest rate with 2% minimum payments or $50 whichever is higher, with a limit of $30k

I have $7.8k on my Line of credit as we speak, mainly from school. 

Disregarding my dumb frivolous purchase of a car. Does it make financial sense to sell my car even though I'm underwater seeing as I don't really need it? Insurance is just a money pit of $200 per month, and I would be able to feel more comfortable in my finances and ability to pay off debt without it.

personalfinance,Should we try to pay our mortgage off early even though the interest rate is low?,"Recently, we were lucky enough to buy a house from a family member who also offered to be our lender.  We set up a 30 year mortgage for about $475,000 at the federal allowable interest rate, which was 2.22% at the time. 

I'm a bit torn on whether to make extra payments to try to pay it off  sooner.  We're 43, well over the age of most first time homebuyers, so under the current plan the mortgage won't be paid off till we're well into retirement age.  It makes me nervous to think about still having a mortgage when I'm 70. On the other hand, the very low interest rate suggests that we'd be better off funneling any extra money into alternate investments.  The extra cash would otherwise be earmarked for medium term or retirement savings and would currently only be a few hundred a month, although that will increase as our kids hit school age and we're not paying for preschool anymore. 

 (Relative doesn't care if we take the full 30 years--his mortgage was long paid off, it wasn't his primary residence, he has ample funds otherwise, and the sale would otherwise have triggered a lot of capital gains tax for him because the house has appreciated a lot in the 30 years he owned it).

personalfinance,Where to start......,"Married with two kids. I'm 32 wife is 30. 

I just graduated and wife is working and still in school. 
This year we will make 185k before taxes about 130 after. 

We have 340 k in student loans, all federal (about 5.2% average interest) currently wife's loans deferred and I have gotten a payment plan that for the time being keeps my payment low, will go up to about 1200 a month next year. No other debt. 

After wifey graduates we should be clearing about 170k on 250k gross. 

Our rent is 2300, a mortgage would be cheaper but we need to save for a while for a down payment. We have decent credit. 

So, where the hell do we start? 

Should we tackle the student debt or pay the income based payments until some of the balance is forgiven. Granted we plan on making more money each year so maybe this is a dumb idea.

personalfinance,"Need cash flow/credit, business and personal offers, plus an adverse account......","I hope r/personalfinance can help me! I appreciate your response greatly. Warning, 1448 words, no TL;DR, gasp!

I have 6 main questions. I own a S corp and am a sole proprietor also, and have both personal and business related-questions. (Hopefully not too much unrelated information here.)

1. Business Credit Card: Should I take the Platinum Business card offered to me through my bank, Wells Fargo? What other credit cards might you suggest instead or in addition? I want rewards points! 

2. Cash flow issue: Should I take the Line of Credit offered to me through my bank, Wells Fargo? 

3. I have one adverse account now on my credit report. Under what circumstances can that be removed other than waiting until 2022?

4. Should I wait to get my Business credit card and/or personal credit card until after I get my adverse account removed?

5. Personal Credit enhancement: What can I do to improve my personal credit? Should I get any additional personal credit lines?

6. I know I need to be better about budgeting. Especially as I plan for early retirement. Any overall concerns or tips? Any tax-liability reduction tips? I am so unhappy with the service my current tax preparer has provided. I've paid penalties every year despite asking for help with estimated payments. I've also paid penalties for every year's worth of $800 for my corporation. This is on me, and I want to be much more organized and well-informed in the future. I can't rely on any preparer. 


About me: 

I'm almost 25 years old. My income has been as high as 68k (after taxes). Last year I went through a lot of medical problems and was not working very much. I am self-employed and thankfully have a residual income which helped. I also had a lot of savings (nearly 2 years' income) which are now depleted entirely. My financial situation did a complete flip-flop due to personal choices and medical complications. I knew better, but didn't make preparations prior to my medical issues. (Life insurance, disability, retirement, even with all that liquid money.)

I'm hoping to get my income back to a decent level as soon as possible. Currently I'm only making about 18k. I make residual income and otherwise am full commission so now that I'm healthy I have a great shot of getting back to 50k+! I'm hoping to do so within 3-6 months, ramping up along the way. In the meantime I owe the adverse account about $850 and the FTB in CA about $1200. 

I have enough money to pay my bills until 8/15/16. I have until 8/15/16 to make income as well. That's without paying the combined $2050 I owe. Hopefully I can make $1500-$3000 by then. If I make at least $2500, that's enough to pay bills until 9/15/16. I'd need $4550 to do it all. I currently have $1400 or so available on the $2300 card, and have budgeted to pay the $900 off in full on 8/15/16.

I'm worried that I won't make the $1500-4550 I need. I'd like to maintain my good credit through these last hard months. Sometimes my commissions take 120 days, so even if I start earning income, it could be some time before the cash flow comes in.

My busiest months are December and January. I'd like to do everything I can to market and maximize that time. Really October to January is full of opportunity. Any cash I use from the potential Line of Credit or any marketing I put on the Business Credit card could really benefit me at this time. Even just purchasing additional leads, which have a low-risk and a good, reliable ROI.


Details:

I read https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/creditcards, and https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building and will read https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections.

1.  I'm Pre-approved for up to $50k with Wells Fargo, the minimum offer would be $2500. Despite pre-approval, the gentleman I spoke with suggested I would likely be offered $10k as a final offer.
I've also received several other credit offers pertaining to my business over the years. I'm often pre-approved for 0% for 12 months and up to $100k. I do travel for business, usually once a year possibly as much as four trips. I used to drive 500-1000 miles a week, but don't anymore, so gas is not as much of an emphasis. I'd love cash back rewards, primarily, or if not travel rewards. I'd also love a FICO estimate on my bills, something I learned about from r/Churning.
More information on this card: https://www.wellsfargo.com/biz/credit-cards/platinum-card/
I found information on other cards at: https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/search?restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3A%28%22New%20CC%20Offer%22+OR+%22New%20public%20CC%20Offer%22%29&amp;feature=legacy_search

2. I'm pre-approved for 10k-100k pending the application. I would accept the minimum they offer. The interest rate would be Prime + 0% for 12 months, they waive the start up fee, and after 12 months I'd be looking at an APR between Prime + 1.75% to Prime + 9.5%. Basically, I'm given access to 10k, but I only pay interest on the portion(s) I withdrawal as needed. I don't know if Lines of Credit are common or if I have competitors to compare against??

3. The Hospital that sent me to collections had a wrong address and a wrong phone number for me. I was not thinking very well when I was first admitted, and so I never received a single notice or call.

What the FTB suggest I read...... https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2015/15_100s.pdf

4. I'd like to have as large of a credit allowance as possible, so that any spending becomes proportionately smaller compared to my credit limit. Therefore, if I need to wait, I could try to squeeze by. Or do only the line of credit or only one credit card, rather than both. If I can easily increase it my credit limit later, I will, but I'd like to prevent hard pulls to my credit.

5. I spend roughly $1285 on bills, my other expenses being rent and food, and totaling about $1000 additional expense per month. (rent may decrease by $150 in August or September) I'd like to put all my bills (which I already auto-pay) on a credit card auto-pay to earn points. I paid 14k on a car and got no points!!
My credit report was perfect, until this Adverse Account mentioned in #4. I may be able to have that removed, it seems. I've had a car loan and a bed loan (memory foam, which I love) both to be paid off in full in October 2016(included as “bills” above). I've had a Wells Fargo personal Credit Card since 02/2012, I believe it started off with a $1000 credit limit, got increased to $1500 automatically, and was just recently increased to $2300 after I called in to inquire. (Oddly, I declined the offer, but they increased it anyway.) As I see it, any increase should only help my credit by making my spending appear as a lower percentage of the credit limit. My last FICO score was above 700 in 2014, I forget where in the 700s it fell.
I am hoping to buy a adjustable base for my bed some time in the next 12 months, which costs between $800-$1600. I was approved for up to $4500 of bed and bed accessories at 0%, based on promotion offerings. So I'd have 12 months to pay it off at 0%, most likely.
I paid 2k-4k on a CareCredit dental card as well, also at 0% promotional APR. I provide this information just as credit history. Again my credit report is literally perfect (all “ok” aka current, on every single payment, on all accounts) other than the one medical bill. I'm young so that's not too much to speak of, but I'm glad all the same.
I'm dreaming of buying a house, in cash, in 2021. I have roughly 50k in company stock that vests in 2021 At that point it could be work 1k or the estimated 100-150k, plus any stock I'm awarded in the meantime (hoping for $100k-$400k). This is what I'm preparing my credit for (in case I don't buy cash). I may also decide to finance both a rental property (possibly a multi-unit) as well as a home. I should have a higher residual income in 2021 and after, if all goes well. I'd like to start contributing to a SEP IRA, and also to begin investing with mainly medium risk, as my income allows.

btc,I just canceled my Coinbase account!,"Hello Everyone!

I've been a loyal customer with Coinbase since 2013. When I first set up my account I did all the KYC/AML verifications to have my CC and bank associated with my account. All has been good until recently.

For the record, other than briefly trying their trading platform, all I have every used Coinbase for was to purchase BTC when I had some disposable funds. Once the BTC was purchased the funds would be sent to a wallet that is under my immediate control (Electrum, Ledger Nano, Mycelium, etc.) I *NEVER* used my account for anything else.

As time has gone by Coinbase has grown and has added many new features. But this growth has come at a cost. It used to be that you could ask support a question and get a reasonable response in a reasonable period of time. You could feel that your funds were in good hands and that your account status would be stable.

But now it seems that as Coinbase has grown, so has their contempt for their customers. If you ask support a question the delay in responding has become much longer and when you receive a response, it typically is asking for more information that you have already given in the original request thereby delaying any actual resolution. This indicates that Coinbase support is only cursorily skimming ticket content and not actually *READING* the contents of the request. An example of this behavior can be seen on a recently posted support thread at:

https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/4qbpwo/can_gdax_find_their_ass_with_both_hands/

This behavior seems to be the norm now rather than the exception. 

The final straw was when I logged into Coinbase to buy some BTC and discovered that my daily purchase limit for my CC had been lowered from $2000/day to $40/day. Why did this happen? What did I do wrong? Was there any warning? NO! Was there any explanation offered? NO! Was there a trial before I was hung? NO!

Am I fed up with these tactics and canceling my Coinbase account? YES!

I know that the effect of my account cancellation is nothing to them and it's like a single grain of sand on the beach. But if enough people are tired of these tactics and cancel their accounts maybe one day Coinbase will wake up and realize that their customers should be treated with respect and dignity instead of contempt.",cryptocurrency,1469178550
personalfinance,5k tax debt with very high monthly rate and no saved money - should I get a loan (with low monthly rate) to be able to start saving money?,"Hi, i'm a freelance (IT / software engineering / r&amp;d blockchain and cryptocurrencies).

Last year (2015) i did not managed very well my income so now i have to pay taxes but in the same time i want to start saving money. I MUST save money because i won't getting myself into the same situation next year where i have low savings to pay taxes.

I have a 2k loan with my bank, 1k payed, 1k to pay with 90€/month rate.
I've just payed of my cc debt (~800 €) so no more cc debt
The tax debt is 5k, with 4 month payment schedule (1.2k each month).

My income (before taxes) is variable and this is how things goes in 2016:
- from Jan to April: 10.5k €
- from May to July: 12.6k €
- I expect to gain 10k € from August to December 2016.

My outcome is 
- 500€ month for rent
- 100€ for bills
- 150€ for grocery/food etc
- 100€ gasoline

It's insane paying 1.2k/month for Aug/Sept/Oct/Nov to pay off tax debt so do you think getting a 5k€ loan with a 7% interest rate to pay off in bulk my tax debt and paying it off in 18 month with a 293€ /month?

I want to do this because i want to save money as much as possible. And paying the tax debt with 1.2k per month will not allow me to save money. Instead, paying off a loan will enable me to do that.

I create savings accounts for different things to help with budgeting (emergency fund, bill fund for bills that aren't on a monthly cycle, vacation savings, savings for my wife to work from home when we have a kid, etc).

Last month I got a nastygram about exceeding the number of transfers between savings accounts. The warning was that if I did it again in 6 months, they have to close my accounts (i know, federal regulation). The problem is they no longer seem to list the number of transfers left on their website. They used to have it posted as part of every transfer, plus you would get sent an email after executing the transfer stating how many transfers you had left.

personalfinance,Advance Due Date for student loans with Nelnet?,"Ok. Background. I'm 21. I ""graduate"" college next spring and then have 1 more semester (fall or spring) to finish my requirements. I have almost $14k in federal student loans with Nelnet. I'll be at $25k after this year. My grace period is finished, because of a leave of absence, so once I graduate, I need to start paying loans immediately. 

I'm terrified that I won't get a job right after college next summer (even though my school has great post-graduation hiring rates and starting income), so during this 6 month grace period, I've been saving up 6 months worth of minimum payments on my loan, to make my own e-fund/grace period, and I have 1 month of living expenses saved, but want to get to 3 months unemployment fund eventually. I've built up $500 of general emergency fund that I think I can grow to $1000 before the summer ends. 

I also have $2000 that I'm going to pay on my student loans in the next couple of days. 

Nelnet has an option to advance the due dates of your loans by paying more than twice your monthly payment. It seems to me that if I pay them the full $4.5k that I have saved for loans, that I would be able to advance the due date for significantly longer than 6 months, which would fulfill my goal of making a 6 month grace period for myself, and would save me interest. 

Arguments: 

* **CON**: I'd lose access to that money. Even though this saved money is earmarked for student loans, I could still use it for a general emergency fund if I really need to, and paying 4.5k right now removed that part of the safety net. 

* **NEUTRAL**: I still have $500 earmarked for a general emergency fund, as well as money for car or health issues. I also have money saved specifically for use while I'm in school with minimal expenses and minimal income. I have a good relationship with my parents, who are in a good place financially. I can handle an emergency. 

* **NEUTRAL**: I was going to put this money in a CD. I wouldn't have had access over the next 9 months anyway. 

* **PRO:** Unless I'm misunderstanding, this money gets applied to the loan *now* and just delays when I need to pay next. The interest I save (~4%) by putting that extra $2.5k down now would beat out the CD (~1%) easily. 

* **PRO:** This doesn't prevent me from continuing to pay monthly if I'm able to. Plus, it would give me some room to breathe on these loans at any time I'm struggling. 

Am I missing anything? Am I misunderstanding anything?

personalfinance,Advice please - Sell appreciating condo and be debt free or grind it out but remain on the edge?,"Some basics:
- Male (48)
- Income - $95K a year 
- Debt - $36K student loan; $30K home equity loan; $16K car loan; $100K Mortgage

I need some advice. As you can see, I'm older. I make a good living. I have excellent credit. No credit card debt, but too much other debt. 

I currently own a condo that is in a good area and appreciating quickly. I think with the market currently, I could ask and get $325k for it.

Here is my quandry. I am older and living on the edge. I have not much retirement and no emergency fund. Because of my age, my ability to get a different job at this income level is I wanted will start getting harder I think. I chip away at the perpetual debt, but it is a slog that never seems to end. And I feel beholden to my job and salary because of the debt.

On the other hand, I have this condo that is appreciating quickly. I can see it easily getting to close to $400k within the next few years. It is currently on a 15-year fixed rate at a great interest rate.

What I am trying to figure out is whether I should sell it, zero out all my debt and really buckle down on catching up over the next 15 years or so, but give me some breathing room. But to do that, I would have to let go of my largest appreciating asset, and give up any money it would potentially appreciate over the years. Basically, start over from zero, but with a steady income.

I find that the debt, and being beholden to my job and situation is a bit suffocating, and grinding down the debt over the next number of years still leaves me vulnerable and exposed, but allows me to reap the appreciation of the condo.

I would welcome and appreciate any constructive thoughts.  Thanks.",finance,1469200001
personalfinance,Retirement advice for 31M with $30k debt,"I'm posting on behalf of my SO. To make a long story short, he spend his early twenties making bad decisions, and we've spent the last 5 years getting him out of some debt and into a decent position. He currently earns about $28k per year working FT. We have been discussing future prospects that he can pursue once I am finished with school (2.5 years).

He currently has about $30k in student loans (he did not finish his degree). I don't know what the interest rate is on these. He knows almost nothing about them. They were in default, but he has been making income-based payments for over a year, so they are in good standing, although right now he is not even paying the interest. Right now his plan is to keep doing the repayment for 25 years and then just let them be forgiven. I plan to make about $80k+ in my career, so my plan is to pay these off once I pay off my own.

He works for a small, family-owned company. He has great insurance, but no 401k. He has no retirement savings. He isn't all that concerned about it (he did not grow up in a family with good financial habits), but I am worried that he is so late in the game for retirement.

**Does anyone have any idea which is the better option: Make manual payments towards high interest loans vs auto-payments with .25 interest reduction.**

I have several loans not higher than 6.8% interest rate.

Thanks for the help.",finance,1469206515
personalfinance,"I might *actually* have won money doing a survey, but I'm skittish.","Good evening,

I studied abroad last semester and I participated in a master student's survey twice (before and after the semester, a span of 4 full months), where the incentive was potentially winning 100 euros. I never win anything and just did it because I was bored and wanted to help, I guess. Today I got an email telling me I actually won, and since the surveys were seemingly legit (pretty involved, 15 minutes each, etc), this then also seems legit to me.

But now she wants all my info: name, address, DOB, Bic number, account number, bank key (I don't even know what that one is?), and routing number. I'm not the most well-read on such things, but I'm pretty sure that if she's not real, I'd be f***ed giving her even half of that info. 

I think her survey was sent through the International Relations Office of my host university, or through some other official, exchange-related conduit. She didn't just randomly email me, I chose to do it and gave her my email during the first survey. I was thinking of asking her to send me a photo of her student ID to verify she's who she says she is, then I really would be willing to send her my info...I could use the money and I had to email my bank details to my host university before, when I was arranging to go on exchange, which makes it seem not so bad.

I would really appreciate some input here! Please and thank you!

tl;dr: Chose to take a legitimate-seeming survey, was informed that I actually won one of 3 prizes for it. Supposed master's student wants all kinds of info to verify my personhood, meanwhile I want to verify hers.

Edit: A lot of people are misunderstanding; the survey was created by the master's student as a thesis about exchange students acclimating to a new culture. She attends neither my home nor host university. She knows nothing about me and wants to verify that I'm a real person. I did ask her for a photo of her ID and she returned my email 33 minutes later with her official ID card and her student ID card. The photos match that of her email, which is her personal email, not a student email. I think she used her student email before, because I can't find this email in my contact list. I voluntarily participated in this survey, which was emailed to me from a separate, reputable and legitimate channel for students studying abroad. I'm just concerned about the information she asked from me.",finance,1469206939

investing,Unless you expect negative rates in the future I strongly suggest CDs over sovereigns and IG corporates,"Yields of up to 2.25% on 5 year CDs at credit unions with the same credit risk as US Treasuries, zero duration exposure besides (on average) 180 days lost interest on early withdrawal.

I don't see the upside potential on sovereigns being worth the risk at this point for your typical, unsophisticated investor. You have massive downside risk with little upside potential. Why play with the big boys in Treasury securities and even bond funds like AGG when you can receive significantly higher rates in a sector unavailable to larger players?

2.25% 5 year CD with a 1.125% early withdrawal penalty and no credit risk to principal versus 1.72% SEC yield on AGG with an effective duration of 5.19 years and credit risk.

In order to get the same benefits using sovereigns (obviously without the upside potential) you would have to purchase *30 year* Treasuries and even then they yield a mere 0.04 basis points higher than a 5 year credit union CD. 

Personally I think you'll see helicopter money before you see negative long-term rates in the US, so even in a recessionary environment I see little upside potential and massive risk to the downside.

Anyway, just my 2 cents since no one ever mentions CDs here. They certainly aren't inversely correlated with stocks as high quality bonds have been in the past so I suppose it depends on your monetary policy outlook in the event of a downturn.",finance,1469211304
personalfinance,[US] How to Pay for Drug Costs that Are Nearly Equal to My Parent's Annual Income,"Hi Reddit. My mom was never good with money and squandered all of her retirement savings years ago. She lives entirely off Social Security now. I manage her finances and through very careful management (with the help of YNAB) I manage to make sure that all of her expenses are covered just barely. I physically take her grocery money to her every week as well as any other money she needs for legit expenses (within the limits of her budget), pay her mortgage, etc. 

Her Social Security payment is high enough that she will never qualify for Medicaid. She currently gets her health insurance through the federal exchange, but she is turning 65 this year and so will be transitioning to Medicare. 

We sat down earlier today and made several hours' worth of calls to Medicare, health insurance providers that offer supplemental plans, etc. Everything was going pretty well. It looked like she might actually save some money compared to her current Healthcare expenses... 

But then we got to discussing the prescription drug coverage supplemental plan. What we were told, essentially, is that if we spent $107 per month, we would have to pay only nominal co-pays for the first $3K worth of prescriptions but after that we'd have a coinsurance obligation of roughly 50% of the costs of any additional drugs! 

Ballpark figures: my mom gets about $30K worth of prescriptions every year. If we get the prescription plan, the amount we'd have to cover would in effect be cut down to $28K (net of premiums paid for plan). Being on the hook for roughly half of that would mean being on the hook for an amount that is roughly equal to my mom's annual income. Does anyone have any ideas for dealing with this situation? 

**TL:DR: the cost of my mom's unmet annual prescription drug needs is roughly equal to her annual income. Does anyone have any ideas for how to go about dealing with this?**

personalfinance,"32/m - $85,000 in debt making 60k a year.","Hi Reddit.  I’ve been looking at this thread for a while now and I thought I would post my own situation for some help.  I’m 32/m and my finances are kind of a mess.  I recently had a conversation with a 27 year old friend of mine about money and he told me (for whatever reason) that he has 50k in cash in his bank savings.  I was blown away.  I’ve never saved anywhere close to that much in my life, and it struck fear into me about my situation.

I make a 60k p/year salary and I have basically nothing to show for it.  My company matches 50% for the first 6% of my salary, so I contribute 6% to meet the match.  I’ve been doing that for just over a year and the 401k balance is at $7200.  I have $700.00 in cash savings.

After taxes, healthcare, auto insurance, and 401k I take home $3200.00 per/month.  I’ve detailed my per month expenses below.

$600 - Rent + Utilities (I pay my gf rent, she owns the apartment)

$400 - Private Student Loan – $29,640 @7.5% (10 year fixed term)

$165 – Fed Student Loan – $32,700 @5.5% (IBR)

$382 – Car loan $11,159 @2.49 % (31 months to go)

$380 – Minimum CC payments- 3 cards totaling $13,590 @14-17.9%

$160 – Savings ($80 each paycheck)

$220 – I pay a loan for my parents.  My dad’s health is not good and they don’t have much.

That leaves me with $893 a month for food, gas and other expenses.

Now I used to be the guy who would never get a credit card.  I hated the idea.  But over the past 2 years I managed to somehow get 3!! I’m so disappointed that I fell for these vultures.  Some people just shouldn’t use credit.  I’m one of them.  So at 13.5k in cc debt I have cut up my cards.  I’m saving for an emergency fund and I have read Dave Ramsey’s book.

I’ve also looked at YNAB, but to me the layout of that website is like looking at hieroglyphics.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.",finance,1469212185

**CREDIT**

Currently I have a college rewards card with my bank with a 1% cashback reward on all purchases and a limit of $1300. I was thinking of opening a Discover It student card very soon but I'm unsure which one to get that will most benefit me. There is the Discover it for students, Discover it Chrome, and there is another Discover it student card that they are offering on Amazon as well but I'm not sure if it's the same because it offered $50 Amazon credit for opening one up last I checked. I currently have a 793 credit score so should it be a problem opening up a second card as a student? And if I were to open up another card, are there instances where I would use my bank credit card over the Discover CC?

**SAVINGS**

So I currently have the 10k in a savings account with my bank with an interest rate of 0.01%. Is there any way that I could get a higher interest rate? I'm a little scared of looking for an online savings account because I'm unsure of how secure they are. That and I'm not quite sure how I would transfer my funds over to an online account. I guess I am just a little overly cautious of what might happen if I were to need money from my Savings if anything were to happen as well.

**RETIREMENT**

At my current internship they don't offer a 401K plan to interns so I was thinking of opening up a Roth IRA account (I think that's what I should open up) and contribute the max of $5.5k for the year. Is this a good idea considering the fact that I'm a student? How do I go about getting the money into said account from whatever money I take home? Should I invest in index funds with my Roth IRA targeting my expected age of retirement? I'm just a little terrified of investing because of it possibly dropping in value and losing money.

## Recent financials 

Finance is really not the same as any other business. Just look at the smooth ""net interest income"" and the hideous ""realized and unrealised gains / losses"". 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Net Interest Income | $1.7bn | $2.1bn | $2.3bn | $2.6bn | $3.1bn|

|Operating profit | $0.5bn | -$0.8bn | $3.7bn | $1.8bn | $0.4bn|

No wonder the EPS is a rollercoaster with multiple loop the loops. And still the dividends keep coming, with the net effect that shareholders equity continues to dwindle.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|

## Competition

From their SEC filing

&gt; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of these securities. In acquiring our target assets, we will compete with financial institutions, institutional investors, other lenders, government entities and certain other REITs. 

So, here's the data we get from Reuters. But frankly, it really doesn't mean a lot to me :(

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. | $781M | 15% | N/A
American Capital Agency Corp. | $174M | -ve | -ve
Starwood Property Trust, Inc. | $753M | 33% | 9%
New Residential Investment Corp | $812M | 43% | 16%
Chimera Investment Corporation | $831M | 69% | 8%
MFA Financial, Inc. | $545M | 57% | 10%
Blackstone Mortgage Trust Inc | $470M | 45% | 11%
Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc | $603M | 49% | -ve

## Cash / Debt?
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. has $60,670M of net debt. That is 518.5x it's latest operating profit. Again, the actual debt levels are pretty meaningless in Financials... or at least they don't make any sense to me.

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $10.91 for Annaly Capital Management, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 1% to their target. So Wall Street isn't hot on this stock

# Valuation

Then we get to the valuation. Given REITs have to pay out their cashflow to maintain their tax status, it's hard for the PE and divie to diverge. 

But the tax situation is more complicated, as the REIT doesn't pay corporate and income taxes, instead the shareholder does. So an 11% yield from $NLY isn't the same as 11% from a widget maker.

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/nly/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:
NLY | $9,989M | 9x | -7% | 11% 
AGNC.O | $6,484M | 9x | N/A | 12% 
STWD.K | $5,093M | 11x | 6% | 9%

BXMT.K | $2,700M | 11x | 3% | 9% 
IVR | $1,598M | 8x | -1% | 11% 

# Dividends
Annaly Capital Management, Inc. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.17 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $1.20 per share. That is a decline of 3%. The forecast dividend of $1.17 compares to a forecast EPS of $1.21. Which isn't a shock given REITs having to payout their cashflow.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 5%. On 6 month basis the stock's up 22% even though the earnings are only up 5%. 

Here's a [link](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/nly/transcripts) to the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers.

&gt; In my remarks last quarter I also discussed our outlook for 2016. I stated that because of our diversified platform and low leverage profile, we were positioned to, take advantage of current market volatility, expected industry dislocations and the unforeseen opportunities we've been waiting for. I was signaling the benefits of and our desire for enhanced size and diversification in this volatile world.

So what did they do...they decided to buy another mortgage REIT, Hatteras. The deal will close later this year and perhaps it will give then increased scale? Cost synergies? A new pipeline of mortgage assets to acquire?

But is this all moot? Is it really just a play on interest rates and mortgage prepayments? A ""leveraged"" play? I don't get a lot of confidence from the CEO's comment that they want to get big and diversify ""in this volatile world"". 

Not my kind of investment, not a ""widows &amp; orphans stock"", is it. But would love to hear why anyone on this subreddit is a fan. Happy to be persuaded! :)

personalfinance,Looking for the Best Way to Split Up Bank Accounts and Advice in General,"Hey reddit, my 20th birthday is in a few days and I've been having some serious introspective crises regarding my life direction, so hopefully I can get some advice. I apologize in advance for wall of text.


Pertinent Background Info: I'm 20F married to 26M with an almost 2 year old daughter. We've been married for a bit over two years. Growing up my parents not only never talked about money, they were horrible with it. I used to think we were poor until I filled out my first FAFSA and realized that theoretically my father made plenty of money. They were in a crazy amount in debt (my mother's extravagant spending) even though my sister and I had to go without a lot growing up. Simply put, I didn't have a great family life and left when I got pregnant at 17. I had a small amount of savings at that age (2-3k), but my extremely religious family made us have a wedding to cover up the ""scandal"" and we had to pay for it ourselves. My dad had promised for a good year to match whatever I saved to get a car but reneged on that agreement, so I started my new life dependent on my husband with no money and not even a car. 


Before I found out I was pregnant I had just received news that I was accepted to one of my top choices in schools: small, private, 13 hours away by car and cost 65k a year. Having absolutely no experience in money I had absolutely no idea how freaking expensive that really was. I wanted to get as far away as possible and go to a big name school for the hell of it. After I got pregnant I was determined to still go, so I deferred for a year and just finished my first year this past April.  I was given a merit scholarship for $25k a year and received additional financial aid but still took out about $7k in fed plus loans. I did really well in school, but that was about the only thing that went well. 


I left finances completely up to my husband since he had lived on his own several years before we got married, and I trusted him to know what he was doing. However, I soon learned that he had a tendency to rack up debt paying for necessities after spending our earned money on things we didn't need. His favorite way of dealing with debt was pretending it didn't exist. I did have a job for the year that I took off, but once we moved to the state my school was in I stopped working to focus on school. 


I suppose it's worth noting that I suffered from severe post-partum depression and I did not even attempt to help with finances or notice anything was wrong until it was too late. Three months after moving to our new state and signing a lease on an apartment I know now we couldn't afford, we missed a payment and were evicted. We had to pack up and move to my grandmother's house 20 minutes away (thankfully I had family there). It was still about the same distance from school however. At that point I had a bit of a wake up call and told my husband that we really needed to be on the same page about finances. He claimed that he didn't tell me how badly we were screwed because he didn't want to add anymore stress on me. I made him promise he would tell me if we were in financial trouble and he said he would. A month later our (brand-new, also non-affordable) car got repossessed. Again I had no warning. 


Fast forward to today (a whole year since we initially moved down here). Things are not great but we are hopefully moving in the right direction. I have decent credit after getting a few credit cards and using them responsibly. Husband has a good job as a bartender and takes home on average 2k a month. We bought another car (used VW, 8 years old with 40k miles, stick shift with great gas mileage) in my name, put down 2k and financed the remaining $7.5k at 5% for 4 years. The monthly payment is very doable and less than half of what we were paying for our other car. I've paid off about $3k of debt so far, but we still have about $4k of his credit card debt left. Husband's credit is in the crapper since most of his accounts are delinquent.  


The good news is that I transferred schools to a (still great) university back home where I still qualify for in state tuition (8k a year). We saved up enough money to put a down payment on an apartment within walking distance of the university, and we move in a week. I've received enough financial aid to essentially pay our rent for the entire year along with school expenses and still have several thousand left over. 


Today I read that I need to start saving for retirement at 20. I need to save for my daughter's college. I am tired of feeling, like I have my entire life, like I do not have enough money to live comfortably. I don't want my daughter to feel this way. I am majoring in Chemistry and am on the premed track. Hopefully to go to med school and then do a surgical residency. I am looking at a way to efficiently have separate bank accounts with my husband but perhaps have a shared one for family expenses, a savings account for when I get refunded my financial aid from the school, and something to save money for my daughter's college. I know I need to get rid of debt, but after that point I'm not sure what to do. I want to do better, and honestly I don't know where to start. 


I know this ended up more a drama than a normal personalfinance post, but if you made it this far I truly appreciate you. Any kind of advice and critique are welcome. 


TL;DR - Almost 20 with a husband and daughter. Financially unstable. What can I do to turn it around and set up my daughter to be more responsible than me?",finance,1469226653
personalfinance,2-year old son diagnosed with devastating (and costly) neuromuscular disease (SMA). How do I proceed without robbing him of insurance and destroying our budget?,"Longtime lurker here with a significant question for the PF community.

Our family just recently received news of our youngest son's (2) diagnosis of SMA Type II.  The diagnosis has been difficult for us to digest.  The long-distance specialists, devices, wheelchairs, and other health and financial implications have been overwhelming.  We have decided to attempt to take some control and channel our emotions and energy into raising money for the necessary medical costs and equipment.  We’ve created a website and have been working with our community to raise awareness and support. 

We have been told that due to the nature of the disease as a permanent disability that we would be eligible for Medicaid for insurance.  In addition to that, we have been told that there are asset/income restrictions for Medicaid that we should consider when receiving contributions.  We’ve given to charities and organizations in the past but have never been on the receiving side of things. 

What steps should we take to make sure that we don’t inadvertently sabotage our son's insurance coverage?  We've only raised a couple hundred dollars so far from small efforts but are already getting community attention and support that may drastically change that.  All of our money so far is stuffed in an envelope ready to be deposited to a bank account.

What steps should we take to make sure that any money we raise for equipment and services won’t remove our son’s eligibility for Medicaid or other support?  Should we open a bank account in our name or create some sort of non-profit legal entity that pays for all the necessary costs?

There is one final potential implication that concerns us.  Do the funds incoming count towards our taxable family income?  I am the only income for our family and we have significant student loans that are currently utilizing income-based repayment to be manageable for our family of 5.",finance,1469228457

btc,Study on marginalized risks of bitcoin based on the loss of the gold standard,"**Introduction**

Gold standard is a favorable system, but it is unexpectedly eliminated by the government. Gold boasts unparalleled advantages. However, that cannot prevent the government from killing the gold standard. Below is a close look at how the gold standard is wiped out by the government step by step and how bitcoin should avoid repeating the tragedy. 
 
**Chapter 1 Gold as a natural currency**
 
Gold has been the most time-honored and widely-used currency in the human history. Its advantages cannot be ignored. 

There are 118 elements on the periodic table of elements. Gold, the No. 79 element, is adopted by humans as a symbol of honor and wealth. On the periodic table elements, there are elements in the gaseous state or the liquid state; elements whose form is unstable or which can go into combustion easily; elements who can do harm to human body; elements which are rare, hard to smelter and difficult to find by ancients. Excluding all the above elements, gold and silver are the only two elements left. In terms of stability, gold has an edge over silver because silver can be easily oxidized or vulcanized into a black color. Therefore, gold becomes the natural currency.

Featured by a stable chemical property, it means gold can act as an enduring transaction medium. To serve as currency, gold should be able to be split and cut for the convenience of carrying. Alas! Gold has all these characteristics. With a favorable physical ductility, gold can be molded into various shapes. Last but not least, gold is a rare existence in the natural world. It was generated by the explosion of new stars when fixed stars died. Up to date, humans have not yet developed the ability to make the element of gold. The only way for humans to obtain gold is to exploit gold mines on the earth. 

All these characteristics have made gold the most successful currency in the world. Gold can be traced back to 5,000 years ago. Gold was once the most popular currency, leading to the emergence of the gold standard system. Despite of the many undoubtable advantages, the gold standard was still eliminated by humans in modern times. To put it more directly, gold was marginalized in terms of its currency position. **Despite of the many undoubtable advantages, the gold standard was still eliminated by humans in modern times. To put it more directly, gold was marginalized in terms of its currency position.** 


 
**Chapter 2 Elimination process of the gold standard by the fiat money**

 **In the human history, the gold standard system has three realization forms, namely the gold coin standard system, the gold bullion standard system and the gold exchange standard system. The three realization forms constitute the substantial process in which the gold standard system was encroached step by step.** The symbolic case of marginalization of gold as a currency was the collapse of the Bretton Woods Systems. Since then, humans have entered the era of the fiat money standard system.

    The gold coin standard system refers to adopting gold coins as fiat standard coins. In other words, according to the gold coin system, gold is directly used as money, and currency manufacturing is not monopolized by the country. As long as one has the ability, he can exploit gold mines, smelter and make gold into gold coins. The gold coin standard system ruled for more than one century. 

**The gold bulletin standard system refers to replacing gold coins with bank notes. According to the gold bulletin standard system, bank notes can be equally exchanged into gold**. In China, bank notes were mainly issued by old-style Chinese private banks, which promised to settle their issued currency according to the fixed exchange rate of gold and silver. The exchange had no limits and was free. To some extent, this could guarantee that bank notes were corresponding to authentic gold. If one made false promises, one would suffer risks of being squeezed. However, this still impaired the nature of gold as a rare existence because of a non-100% reserve fund system, enabling the total number of bank notes to overtake that of gold. Under the currency system, currency issuance institutions with the right to issue currency emerged. The issuance of currency was realized through the issuance of bank notes. This suggested that currency issuance started turning into a right. 

The gold exchange standard system is a virtual gold standard system. The country required gold to be put in one place, such as the central bank, and then the country issued its domestic currency and promised to implement the fixed exchange rate of gold. If the government wanted to issue currency, it needed to purchase the equal amount of gold. To avoid abuse of the currency policy, the government pledged on national credit. This further destroyed the gold standard system. Currency issuance was monopolized by the government. The exchange rate based on the government guarantee was never realized in history.

The Bretton Woods System symbolized the peak of the gold exchange standard system. The US government in a dominating role promised to connect the USD with gold, clarifying that the price of one ounce of gold was equal to 35 USD. Later, governments all over the world issued their domestic currencies and connected them with the USD to guarantee a fixed exchange rate. If the US government wanted to issue the USD, it needed to get the same amount of gold. If other governments wanted to issue their domestic currencies, they needed to get the same amount of gold. The system greatly weakened the gold standard system. In this way, there were two anchors with the currency issuance right in principle, but in practice there were no anchors at all, because none had the right to check how much gold the Federal Reserve had. Governments all over the world did not have an institution to supervise the issuance amount of their currency. 

Quite soon, the Bretton Woods System collapsed, and the US president announced stopping exchange between the USD and gold in 1971. The gold standard system was eliminated. Since then, governments all over the world have adopted the credit money standard system. The credit money standard system has existed for nearly half a month. Despite that, gold is still regarded a kind of currency, universally acknowledged in the international community. However, its position as a currency has been weakened, just having the value storage function. 

**The process for the credit money system to replace the gold standard system was to first turn gold from a currency in circulation into a currency of settlement. Later, its settlement function was also deprived of, which turned gold into a value storage currency.** 

**Chapter 3 Risks of bitcoin to undergo marginalization of gold**

Bitcoin simulates physical properties of gold in terms of design. It is also rare, endurable, separable and portable. After more than seven years of market selection, bitcoin has grown into an indispensable Internet currency. It has also found its applications in the offline economic life. 

At present, development of bitcoin has encountered its bottleneck. The bitcoin block is too small to make room for more transactions. The bitcoin community is also hotly discussing about techniques to expand the transaction capacity of bitcoin.
 
Now, there are mainly two proposals for expansion of bitcoin. First, maintain the payment function of bitcoin, and directly refer to the onchain sacling with hard fork. Second, persist in turning bitcoin into a settlement network, build the second layer of network based on bitcoin and use the technique of side chain and lightning network to enhance the payment function of bitcoin. 

There is nothing new in the world. Though bitcoin is still a leading technique, it is a representation of historical events. After the gold coin standard system was stably implemented for one hundred years, the gold coin standard system was altered by a group of wise bankers and private bank owners into the gold bulletin standard system. After two world wars, the gold bulletin standard system was turned by those led by the US government into the gold exchange standard system. After two world economic crises, the US government took little effort to completely eliminate the gold standard system, thus building the modern credit currency system. 

**Bitcoin has not yet developed for eight years, but it has been faced with the selection of “bitcoin standard system,” “bitcoin block system” or “bitcoin exchange system.”**

Direct use of bitcoin is similar to the “gold coin standard system.” Here, the author gives it a new name, “bitcoin standard system.” In the lightning network, the main chain of bitcoin is expanded to the second layer of protocol, and the main chain just undertakes the settlement function, which is similar to “gold bulletin standard system.” Here, the author calls it by “bitcoin block standard system.” Use of the side chain to build a brand-new payment platform is similar to “bitcoin exchange standard system.” Here, the author calls it by “bitcoin exchange standard system.”

    When people used bank notes to replace gold coins as the currency in circulation, ease of use of bank notes was greatly highlighted compared with a pile of gold coins, and to print bank notes took less cost compared with mining, smelting and casting of gold coins. People were ready to use bank notes. However, there were no free banquets in the world. While enjoying the convenience brought by bank notes, people had to face the concentration of rights in banks. They obtained the right to issue currency and had some reserve fund. Apparently, the gold standard system was the only one to suffer from this. **In fact, people were deprived of their right to safeguard their private property.**
 
People take delight in using the lightning network and side chain to design a set of more convenient and cheaper payment network. They get not only convenient, but also cost reduction. People have to believe more block chain operators, the hub of the lightning network and the side chain platform. Maybe, we can confidently think that, with nodes, there will not be some reserve fund or cheats of the side chain platform and hub. However, more than a hundred years ago, developers of bank notes also promised so. Once users have to pay an expensive price to check their own accounts (the main chain settlement system must be expensive), users have lost their ability to verify their accounts. **In this way, the ability of bitcoin to protect inviolability of the private property will be challenged.**
 
If the bitcoin network turns from a payment network into a settlement network, it means the death of the “bitcoin standard system,” and the bitcoin will lose one of its three functions, namely payment, value storage and settlement, just like what had happened to gold several hundreds of years ago. With the increasing number of banks, more and more bank notes were printed, but the reserve fund rate was decreasing. Gold had to say goodbye to its settlement function. When bitcoin’s main chain is connected with various lightning networks and side chains, will the settlement function of bitcoin also be deprived of? Logically speaking, if the main chain settlement cost is too high, the market must find a cheaper way, such as connecting side chains with sub-side chains, or bridging two different lightning networks to achieve direct cross-chain settlement without the trouble of closing channel on the main chain. The last question is when bitcoin will be deprived of its value storage function. 

 
**Chapter 4 Failure of gold to protect the gold standard system and failure of the small block of bitcoin to protect the “bitcoin block system”**

Gold boasts lots of natural advantages. It is a decentralized currency in real sense, but the gold standard system was still eliminated. Natural advantages and physical properties of gold could not protect the gold standard system, but humans could. 

When Keynes challenged against the gold standard system, governments all over the world followed him. None wanted to stand out to protect the gold standard system or the protection force was too small. People were happy to see the increasing number of their paper coins and experience the convenience of paper coins, but were blind to the cost they paid for these. 

Bitcoins are decentralized and can ignore enemies like governments. However, the truth was gold could not protect the “gold standard system” with its physical properties. The decentralization property of bitcoin will not be so powerful to outweigh physical properties of gold. **Whether decentralization of bitcoin could protect itself relies on humans or talents which can maintain its decentralization instead of a religion-like small block.** The small block refuses more users to join the “bitcoin standard system.”
In the human history, the “gold bulletin standard system” and the “gold exchange standard system” which offered more convenient but were also more complex were created by allowing fewer and fewer people to join the “gold coin standard system.” At last, governments used the credit money system to totally eliminate the “gold standard system.”

**During the development process of bitcoin, will bitcoin repeat the tragedy of gold? The author thinks this will not happen, because people can avoid it by expanding its bigger block.** 

One after another world economic crisis reminded people of the gold standard system. Satoshi Nakamoto published “On brink of second bailout for banks” on The Times on January 3, 2009. Did it warn bitcoin fans that the “bitcoin standard system” was going to be eliminated? 


**Chapter 5 Not to refuse new techniques but not to let new techniques eliminate the “bitcoin standard system”**

 Here, the author does not refuse the lightning network and the side chain. These techniques are great. However, if they are accepted at the cost of refusing bigger blocks, people will lose the “bitcoin standard system.” That is the least expected.

    Here, the author supports establishing various high techniques on bigger blocks. While enjoying high techniques, people can also use the backward “bitcoin standard system” to protect the foundation of their private property right. 


**Chapter 6 Conclusion** 

One after another world economic crisis has aroused people’s nostalgia of the gold standard. As it is stated above, Satoshi Nakamoto had warned bitcoin fans of the potential risk of losing the “bitcoin standard system.”

**Bitcoin has not yet developed for eight years, but it has been faced with the selection of “bitcoin standard system,” “bitcoin block system” or “bitcoin exchange system.”**

Direct use of bitcoin is similar to the “gold coin standard system.” Here, the author gives it a new name, “bitcoin standard system.” In the lightning network, the main chain of bitcoin is expanded to the second layer of protocol, and the main chain just undertakes the settlement function, which is similar to “gold bulletin standard system.” Here, the author calls it by “bitcoin block standard system.” Use of the side chain to build a brand-new payment platform is similar to “bitcoin exchange standard system.” Here, the author calls it by “bitcoin exchange standard system.”

    When people used bank notes to replace gold coins as the currency in circulation, ease of use of bank notes was greatly highlighted compared with a pile of gold coins, and to print bank notes took less cost compared with mining, smelting and casting of gold coins. People were ready to use bank notes. However, there were no free banquets in the world. While enjoying the convenience brought by bank notes, people had to face the concentration of rights in banks. They obtained the right to issue currency and had some reserve fund. Apparently, the gold standard system was the only one to suffer from this. **In fact, people were deprived of their right to safeguard their private property.**
 
People take delight in using the lightning network and side chain to design a set of more convenient and cheaper payment network. They get not only convenient, but also cost reduction. People have to believe more block chain operators, the hub of the lightning network and the side chain platform. Maybe, we can confidently think that, with nodes, there will not be some reserve fund or cheats of the side chain platform and hub. However, more than a hundred years ago, developers of bank notes also promised so. Once users have to pay an expensive price to check their own accounts (the main chain settlement system must be expensive), users have lost their ability to verify their accounts. **In this way, the ability of bitcoin to protect inviolability of the private property will be challenged.**
 
If the bitcoin network turns from a payment network into a settlement network, it means the death of the “bitcoin standard system,” and the bitcoin will lose one of its three functions, namely payment, value storage and settlement, just like what had happened to gold several hundreds of years ago. With the increasing number of banks, more and more bank notes were printed, but the reserve fund rate was decreasing. Gold had to say goodbye to its settlement function. When bitcoin’s main chain is connected with various lightning networks and side chains, will the settlement function of bitcoin also be deprived of? Logically speaking, if the main chain settlement cost is too high, the market must find a cheaper way, such as connecting side chains with sub-side chains, or bridging two different lightning networks to achieve direct cross-chain settlement without the trouble of closing channel on the main chain. The last question is when bitcoin will be deprived of its value storage function. 

 
**Chapter 4 Failure of gold to protect the gold standard system and failure of the small block of bitcoin to protect the “bitcoin block system”**

Gold boasts lots of natural advantages. It is a decentralized currency in real sense, but the gold standard system was still eliminated. Natural advantages and physical properties of gold could not protect the gold standard system, but humans could. 

When Keynes challenged against the gold standard system, governments all over the world followed him. None wanted to stand out to protect the gold standard system or the protection force was too small. People were happy to see the increasing number of their paper coins and experience the convenience of paper coins, but were blind to the cost they paid for these. 

Bitcoins are decentralized and can ignore enemies like governments. However, the truth was gold could not protect the “gold standard system” with its physical properties. The decentralization property of bitcoin will not be so powerful to outweigh physical properties of gold. **Whether decentralization of bitcoin could protect itself relies on humans or talents which can maintain its decentralization instead of a religion-like small block.** The small block refuses more users to join the “bitcoin standard system.”
In the human history, the “gold bulletin standard system” and the “gold exchange standard system” which offered more convenient but were also more complex were created by allowing fewer and fewer people to join the “gold coin standard system.” At last, governments used the credit money system to totally eliminate the “gold standard system.”

**During the development process of bitcoin, will bitcoin repeat the tragedy of gold? The author thinks this will not happen, because people can avoid it by expanding its bigger block.** 

One after another world economic crisis reminded people of the gold standard system. Satoshi Nakamoto published “On brink of second bailout for banks” on The Times on January 3, 2009. Did it warn bitcoin fans that the “bitcoin standard system” was going to be eliminated? 


**Chapter 5 Not to refuse new techniques but not to let new techniques eliminate the “bitcoin standard system”**

 Here, the author does not refuse the lightning network and the side chain. These techniques are great. However, if they are accepted at the cost of refusing bigger blocks, people will lose the “bitcoin standard system.” That is the least expected.

    Here, the author supports establishing various high techniques on bigger blocks. While enjoying high techniques, people can also use the backward “bitcoin standard system” to protect the foundation of their private property right. 


**Chapter 6 Conclusion** 

One after another world economic crisis has aroused people’s nostalgia of the gold standard. As it is stated above, Satoshi Nakamoto had warned bitcoin fans of the potential risk of losing the “bitcoin standard system.”

personalfinance,The case for just paying it off (aka why to kill the golden goose),"There's quite a few posts around with the general theme of ""I have low interest debt, should I pay it off or do something else with the cash?""

The vast majority of advice I've seen in response has been to let the debt ride and make the money work for you, your goose is laying golden eggs! Well, I'm here to say I took that goose out to the shed and happily ended it's miserable little existence and I want folks out there to know that's a perfectly fine thing to do as well.

To put things in perspective, I had roughly 15k in federal student loans remaining and, due to my job, my interest was 0% with $0 payment, IOW full deferral. I make about 70k/yr, have my emergency fund, a budding yet growing Vanguard account, and very few expenses. Basically I'm a prime candidate for using that cash to make more money and pay the loans when they're no longer deferred. I've been rather lucky in life. So why did I kill the golden goose?

*Because it felt good!* 

Yep, that's right, I killed that sucker with a smile! Why? To be able to say ""I'm debt free!"". To know that there's no longer an account out there with -$15,000 in my name. To be completely sure that I'm not gonna get screwed when the loan servicer derps up some paperwork and ends my deferral early. To know that I didn't miss some clause in the paperwork that would end my deferral before I expect it. To not have to get those blasted emails encouraging me to look into IBR or extended payment plans, or a statement that looks like a bill though it just reads the same $0 due every month.

And you know what? Every time I think about that decision it still brings a smile to my face. To know that everything I own is completely mine and that I won't have some 5 digit bill coming up in the future.

As for downsides, I haven't noticed any. Sure, I'm probably missing out on a few hundred in potential interest this year, but that's ok, the peace of mind is worth it to me. Sure, creditkarma dings me on my account mix (only credit cards left), but thats ok, my score is sitting nicely at 796.

I'm not trying to say that keeping the cash and making it work is the wrong choice, far from it. I just want to add some voice to the other option.

personalfinance,Trying to pay off education loans 1 year after I graduate. Am I missing something? Advice would be wonderful!,"So I am going to graduate law school with roughly $45,000 debt that has approximately 5.75% interest/yr. Not too shabby! I have a job lined up with a salary of $120,000. I live in California and tried to estimate my state and federal taxes for the year (I am single, have no dependents, and own no property). My total tax liability (based on a very basic calculation tool and standard deductions) seems to be about $40,000, which means I take home about $80,000. My rent and utilities and food are about $15,000 for the year, with no car payment, so that takes my spendable income down to about $ 65,000.

EDIT: I can put up to $18,000 a year into my retirement account (I would assume they ""match"" some of it). Is this nontaxable and would that then lower my tax liability?

My hope is to pay off all $45,000 in loans in a single year. I don't know much about taxes and I have not been adulting for long enough to anticipate extraneous expenses. Does it seem feasible to finish my student loans in a year, or have my estimations gone awry somewhere? I live pretty frugally, but I just wonder if I'm letting my desire to rid myself of student loans quickly get in the way of a realistic expectation of repayment. Thanks!",finance,1469254742

personalfinance,New graduate planning on moving to Florida. Need advice on how prepare myself.,"Hey everyone, 

I just recently graduated from University in May with a degree in Computer Science and I was able to land a job near my parent's house that offers 60k a year. 

My girlfriend of many years is in a program in Florida right now that ends in January, and she is considering staying after the program ends, working full time. I would like to join her down there at the start of 2017

This is what I need help financing. I want to make it there and be able to survive in an apartment (or anywhere with a roof over our heads. We're not sticklers for quality) for least a month or two while looking for a job (hopefully I'll be able to find one before I move, but just in case.) How do I make sure that I'm saving enough money for the trip, while at the same time making sure I have enough money to be paying off my bills/loans, and have a little bit of money to live off of monthly.

Here are some stats:

* **I'm 22**, currently living with my parents in Chicago, IL. I am not paying rent and my parents are not requesting rent. They are not running me out of the house and don't mind me staying for as long as I need.

* I have withdrawn **two separate student loans for $20,000 each** from Discover. They are both fixed interest rates. The first being 10.365% (current balance: $23,732.01) and the second being 9.740% (current balance: $21,320.81). My grace period ends November 13th.

* I currently **do not have a car.** I am in talks with my parents about getting one fairly soon (after I receive a paycheck or two) As with my brother, they agreed to put a $4,500 down payment on a car of my choice, and let me pick up the rest through payments. I don't know a ton about car financing. What would be a smart purchase?

* I am on a family health insurance plan, but once I get my benefits package from the company, I'll be paying for my own. Also do not know a ton about this.

* I get **paid Semi-monthly** (on the 15th and the 30th. I started on the 11th so my first paycheck will arrive on the 30th.) I went onto [Paycheck City](https://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/salary/) and calculated my net pay every paycheck past taxes and witholdings. The total was $1,789.64. If I stayed until January 15th, that is **12 paychecks between now and when I'd like to leave.**

* **I don't really pay a ton of bills right now** other than Spotify and some other cheap payments. Maybe $30 a month.

I hope this is enough information. I'm ready to answer more questions if they are needed. I don't know a lot about planning or financing. I was never really taught growing up. I feel that most of my life I've been a reckless spender and now I want to stop and start planning for a better future.

personalfinance,(Ireland) I need advice on how I save. I (20F) started a job where I can save half my salary but won't be eligible for my company's pension plan until I turn 30. Where should I put the extra money?,"Hi all, thanks in advance for the help and I hope this respects the rules of the sub, otherwise let me know!

So, title says it all really, I just started my first job which is a grad scheme, pay is €31k (after tax it's about €2k/month) and I can save about €1k/month because I live in a cheap house share, don't go out much, etc. I was planning to dump that extra money mostly in a retirement account until I start thinking about mortgages and other major expenses, but it turns out I won't be eligible for the company pension plan until I turn 30 - in ten years' time! So I don't really know where to put that extra money. So far it's in an online savings account where I have about €3k, but the problems with that are that 1) I can access the money too easily and end up impulse-spending it and 2) I'm sure the interest rate is not the best it could be (I think it's 2%).

So I've been reading this sub and trying to figure out an alternative and wanted to get some advice on whether the following would be a good choice:

- Keep about €500 ""emergency money"" in the online savings account in case I forget to pay rent, need to pay a bill quickly, etc.

- Then, divide the 50% of my salary that I can save each month equally between:

 A ""real"" savings account (the type where I need 7 days to access my money) that I can in a few years divide up again to save for mortgage deposit, car, etc; and

 A personal retirement savings account (not sure at all where to find this/ how to choose one in Ireland???) - or alternatively, another long-term investment mechanism like the Vanguard index funds often recommended on here - again, I'm not sure where to find the Irish equivalent for this?

What do you guys think about this plan and where can I find specific pension schemes/ long-term investment schemes to join? Is it even too early to think of that and should I just keep everything in a savings account with my regular bank?

investing,"Thoughts on the ""bubblyness"" of US Real Estate?","In our area home prices have exceeded the 2007 peak. That peak was fueled by all manner of crazy loan schemes - when I was looking to buy another house in late '06 I kept hearing crap like ""don't put any money down, just take out a 2nd mortgage that's used as the downpayment for the first"" it was at that point I became convinced there was a bubble afoot. So all of the crazy mortgage schemes back then pushed prices way beyond what could be supported by actual incomes.  And of course, we know what happened...

Fast forward to now. Prices are even higher than they were then in many areas, but incomes haven't kept up - not even close. What's driven this runup? Some say it's all the easy money from the Fed finding its' way into Wall St. firms which are buying up houses to rent them out -  these are all cash purchases. It's difficult to find accurate data on all-cash purchases - I've seen numbers ranging from 15% to 40% in my area.

So if there was a bubble in home prices in '07, why isn't the current situation considered a bubble?  It also seems to me that interest rates will eventually have to revert to mean (between 6 and 7%) and at that point prices have to fall in order for people to afford the monthly payment. Of course, it could be a long time before we see interest rates rise here in the US so this could go on for some time.

Any thoughts on the potential for another real estate bubble?

We initially put 10% down and have made only regular payments, no additional ones.

Also I have a question on the loan amounts I see on the student loans I have looked at. Is the amount a total interest, a yearly interest on the remaining amount and what might happen to my interest if I don't take a loan with a fixed rate.

I am especially ignorant where loans are concerned. 

Any help is appreciated, thanks.",finance,1469310532

Background: bought a house in 06 for 110k. Got an employment opportunity I couldn't pass up in 2011 and moved out of state. I don't have a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae backed loan. Rented the property out in late 2011 and use a property management service which takes 10% of rent as fees, plus first month's rent for new renters. Loan was originally 7% interest for the first 5 years and has been variable ever since. (Was 2.5% roughly). Mortgage includes escrow for taxes and insurance. Wife and I bought a house in 2013 in case anything bad happened to my credit if I had to let the property go. 

The problem: First couple of years the property has maintained itself with the exception of a few minor repairs. Last two years everything has been going on the place. 6K for the roof, 400 for some flooding damage ( kitchen sink), 600 for an electrical problem, even had a mold scare (1500). Every two years I have to pay a renters license with inspection to the city. interest rate went up, as well as property taxes. Needless to say I am sinking on this place. Current renter is month to month so if I raise rent I might lose them. Working with the management company to see if they'll sign a lease if not I'll find someone that can. 

I still owe 80k on the loan, the home is worth about 65k according to Zillow. I don't think I qualify for refinancing because I have negative equity. I don't currently have a hardship, but don't want to be in that position either. 

I could walk away and destroy my amazing credit (820). I could try to short sale, but that is not an easy process. I could try to raise the rent and hope to stick it out. Personally I just want to rid myself of the biggest mistake of my life. But the market isn't great and the neighborhood the house is located in has declined since 2008-2009.

Has anyone gone through this? Any good advice? I'll take anything you have to offer at this point.

ethereum,"On Proof-of-Work and ""Consensus""","# On Proof-of-Work Consensus Mechanisms
### Or: how ""consensus"" became more centralized.

## Forward

So, just some context, because sometimes it needs to be said.

I'm fairly new to the whole crypto-currency space, so there are a lot of nuances and such that I'm sure I miss out on.  My experience with cryptocurrencies is mostly limited to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with some dabbling in day-trading on the side (Full disclosure: I suck at it).

Given that I follow Ethereum pretty closely, I've actually become fairly involved in the whole hard-fork debate.  I'm very strongly anti-fork, and am really not very happy about the fact that the hard-fork was not only accepted by the majority, but how that came about.  Watching the debate evolve over the last few weeks--and looking back on the history of similar debates in the Bitcoin space--I started to come up with some musings about PoW and what we call ""consensus"".

More importantly, this is my attempt at articulating why what we know as ""consensus"" isn't really consensus anymore, at all.

## On Proof-of-Work as Security

The entire point of Proof-of-Work as a security mechanism hinges on its ability to adequately deter attempts to rewrite or control history.  The illustrious ""51% attack"", as the term goes, refers to the concept of obtaining so much hashpower as to be able to (on average) control the writing of the blockchain.  The amount of hashpower required to ""rewrite history"" goes up the further back in time you wish to rewrite.  Thus, a ""51% attack"" merely refers to the minimum amount of hashpower required to, on average, control which blocks get added to the blockchain, and serves as a minimum threshold for anyone who wants to control the blockchain (and potentially rewrite its history).  Proof-of-Work, in theory, is designed such that miners, acting in accordance with their own selfish interests, prevent these sorts of damaging attacks from being economically viable.

In other words, it pays better to be honest.

Even if many miners were to collude to control the chain, the idea is that it should cost them more to do so than they could make by doing so.

Attacks such as these are further mitigated by the presence of nodes, which enforce the rules of consensus, refusing to relay blocks that don't follow the agreed-upon protocol.  The simplest attack that this prevents is the attack where the miners collude to pay themselves more per block.  If the nodes don't also agree to this change, the miners will be wasting their time mining blocks that are then rejected by the network.

Again, it should pay more to be honest.

Note that there are some assumptions at play here.  The first is that miners are acting as individual actors, acting in their own individual best interests.  This creates a large population of individual, (assumedly) rational actors, leading to an overall more secure consensus among them.  The second is that miners are incentivized to maintain the health of *the* chain, meaning they won't act in such a way as to destroy the value of the chain they're mining.

Another note:  ""consensus"", as used within the context of PoW, refers to agreement among *all* miners, as individuals.  This implies that miners who refuse or fail to act upon a vote that requires their input are implicit votes for the status quo.  The idea behind the concept of ""a non-vote is a vote for the status quo"" is to impart inertia upon the network.  If a change is desired by some miners, it needs to be compelling enough that it's in the economic best interest of the majority of them to make the change.  If a majority of miners cannot be incentivized to vote, the vote should fail.

This prevents a highly-incentivized minority from seizing control of the chain before the apathetic majority can act.  In fact, the idea is that there is never such thing as a ""no"" vote--just votes for change, and votes for the status quo.  This ensures that changes can only be made when there's sufficient incentive for the majority to vote *at all*.

These concepts--that attacks should be economically infeasible, that miners act in defense of the chain through their own economic self-interest, and that highly-incentivized minorities cannot control the chain--are what govern the security of a PoW blockchain.

## On Mining Pools and Altcoins

Since the original implementation of PoW in Bitcoin, many other coins have been created that leverage the same scheme for security.  Most of them differ in terms of what algorithm is used to provide the proof of work, and most of the generally rely on the same assumptions and mechanics to guarantee the security of their own chains.

Mining pools (as far as I can tell) originally started out as a measure of convenience, and a way to minimize the variability of getting paid.  By joining a pool, the randomness of mining blocks can be smoothed across the entire pool, leading to more regular payouts for everyone in the pool.  The pool operator is incentivized to run a pool by skimming a little bit off the top of every block mined, presumably to cover their own expenses.

Altcoins come in many flavors, some of them created as scams, others to fill in perceived gaps in another coin's functionality.  It's widely regarded that most are (ultimately) scams, but a few important ones have been created along the way.  Ethereum, after all, is one of these altcoins.

The creation of many altcoins, the advent of pools, and the fact that most altcoins can be mined on the same GPUs has led to changes that affect the assumptions of PoW.

One of the more interesting ones is the advent of GPU mining.  This allows anyone with a GPU to mine a coin, greatly expanding the set of miners.  In the one-chain scenario, this would be a very good thing.  However, since that same GPU can mine nearly any other altcoin, it represents a shift in the incentives for that miner.  No longer are they only incentivized to see the value of the coin they're mining increase--they're incentivized to see the value of any mineable coin increase.  If the one they're currently mining depreciates in value, they can easily switch to another, more profitable coin.  If another coin comes along and surpasses the coin they're mining in value, they can easily switch to that one.

This has led to the commoditization of mining power.  People can rent their miners out to whomever is willing to pay them the most.  People can configure their miners to automatically switch to whichever coin is the most profitable *right now*.  By pointing these miners at mining pools with consistent payout schemes, their losses in the event of needing to switch coins are even futher reduced.  Consistent payout schemes reduce the time a miner has to wait until their next ""paycheck"".

This shift in incentive for miners leads to a very large population of ""apathetic"" miners--miners who are completely on auto-pilot, and often aren't even in control of which blockchain they're contributing their hashpower towards.  All that matters to them is that they're getting paid the most they could be paid right now--regardless of which coin that is.

This breaks the assumption that miners' economic self-interest is aligned with the economic interests of the coin they're mining.  This also breaks the assumption that miners are interested in the long-term health of the chain they're mining--since it's now in their best interest to just mine whichever coin is worth most *right now.*

In essense, miners see mining more like investing in an index fund rather than in an individual company.

## On Pool Operators

With miners' investments in mining no longer tied to a single coin, but rather to a large set of coins, we end up in a scenario where the majority of hashpower is entirely apathetic to any single coin's current status.  Combined with the fact that the vast majority of hashpower on any given chain belongs to a pool for that coin, the number of economic actors for any given coin has been reduced.  Instead of consensus of miners being consensus within the population of all individual miners, it has now been reduced to consensus among pool operators for that coin.

Many pools even service multiple coins, meaning their relative investment in any one coin is reduced.

It also continues to be in a pool operators' best interests--economically, again--to align their hashpower with the will of the other pools. This further shrinks the number of individual actors controlling the hashpower to the few largest pools.  Where they go, the smaller pools follow.

## On the Modern Hashpower ""Consensus""

All this leads to an outcome that mining was supposed to defend against: the centralization of the security of the blockchain among a small group of actors.  The original concept of PoW security was partially predicated by an increase in the number of economic actors--the more there are, the harder it is for any subset of them to control the network.  However, with the majority of hashpower for most coins belonging to 2-5 pools, the number of actors controlling the hashpower of the network has dramatically shrunk, not increased.

This is further compounded by reducing the likelihood that any split be ""contentious"", at least from a hashpower perspective.  Even when the users of a coin are strongly divided on its future, the outcome will be that the majority of miners are on one side or the other.  Some would argue that this is good for the coin--but others argue that it reduces the mindshare of the community by distilling it to one group or another.  The other problem is that this is largely divorced from the actual control over the blockchain.

Pool operators, in general, don't care which side of a fork wins.  They just care that they all agree, since being in agreement is what's economically rational for them to do.  Less important is the how and why a particular side of an argument wins.

This defeats one of the final assumptions that PoW rests upon: the inertia of miners.  No longer does an apathetic majority of hashpower lend a dampening effect to the direction of a chain--now it can be used as leverage by pool operators to encourage the agreement of other operators.

Again, given that pool operators will be largely unconcerned about *which* side of a contentious fork wins, this makes them especially susceptible to manipulation--both social and economic.

## On Nodes and Exchanges

Which brings us back to nodes.  The only mechanism still in place to prevent collusion among pool operators is the consensus of the nodes that relay their blocks.  Among these nodes, however, are a few important actors: exchanges.  Given that exchanges are the entrypoints into a coin (from another currency, usually), whichever side of a fork they pick will most likely be the one that retains its value.  If a coin is no longer listed on an exchange, it becomes extremely difficult to gain more users, and thus more value.

It's worth examining the incentives of exchanges at this point.  Most will, like pool operators, be apathetic to the actual reasons for a fork.  This is because their incentives mostly revolve around volume of trades, and less around the relative value of any given coin.  Like an index fund, their profitability is ""smoothed"" across the value of all coins they offer.  They can offer one side of the fork, or both, and suffer little in the way of losses.

Like pool operators, that leaves them more susceptible to influence--again, both economic and social. If they can be convinced that it's in their economic best interests to support one side of the fork or the other, they'll support that side.  It's also in their best interests to be aligned with the pools on which side of the fork they pick... They only risk losing out if they pick the opposite choice as the pools.

The reverse holds true about the mining pools: they only risk losing money if they pick differently than the exchanges.

So all things being equal, it's in both the exchanges' and pools' best interests to be aligned on the outcome of a fork.

Which leaves us with the rest of the nodes.

## On Defaults

With nodes, same as miners, on decisions that are unrelated to the protocol, the default vote is a vote for the status quo.  Nodes that do not upgrade should continue to be on the same chain as nodes that do--unless there is a required change in the protocol.  The design here is the same as with miners--the inertia of the implicit vote for the status quo protects the network from a highly-incentivized minority taking control.

This is where the concept of defaults becomes a little tricky.  For changes to the protocol like bug fixes, it should be assumed that the default would be to support the fix, with nodes that fail to upgrade becoming orphaned.  For changes to the protocol along the lines of upgrades, the same story should apply.

However, for forks involving things other than changes to the protocol, it's assumed that the default vote is a vote for the status quo.  Again, the assumption is that this for the protection of the entire network, and that nodes should be apathetic to anything other than the nature of the protocol itself.

Where this gets sticky is when the change is a matter of opinion.  Here, whichever setting is chosen to be the default exerts extreme control over the outcome of the vote.  This, again, is because it leverages the ""apathetic"" nodes to sway the vote.  Instead of them being a ""vote for the status quo"", they can become an implicit vote for change.

The control over the default is also in the hands of a very small number of actors, even when there are multiple implementations--like exchanges and pools, they're highly incentivized to align on the default.  In fact, they're also highly incentivized to align with pools and exchanges, for the same reasons pools and exchanges are incentivized to align.

## On ""Consensus"" and ""Trustless Networks.""

What this boils down to is this:  in the event of a contentious hard-fork--one that is neither a protocol upgrade nor a bug fix--the outcome is likely not determined by individual nodes, individual miners, or individual users.  Consensus among miners is likely impossible, due to the lack of involvement--and consensus among users or nodes is mostly predicated by the defaults set within the code they're using.

This reduces ""consensus"" from ""consensus among individual miners, users, and node operators"" to ""consensus among pools, exchanges, and developers.""

Rather than the network securing itself in a ""trustless"" (trust-minimized) fashion, it now depends on the opinions of a very small set of actors.

## Conclusion

The security of Proof-of-Work is still sound in some ways, but it's based on outdated assumptions.  The assumption that the number of individual actors mining the chain grows over time is no longer true, as that responsibility has been centralized among the pool operators, whose largest incentive is to be aligned, not pick a side.  The assumption that miners' interests are aligned with the blockchain's goals is broken by the ability to switch coins based on current profitability, rather than future profitability.

Which, of course, begs the question... What do we do about this?  This should be a question on everyone's minds, especially in the Ethereum ecosystem.  Ethereum, in particular, is at risk of forking again, this time over the upcoming ""difficulty bomb.""  It's in pool operators' best interests to fork the difficulty bomb away, since it drastically reduces the profitability of mining Ethereum.  This would lead to an exodus of mining hashpower, as Ethereum loses its place as the ""most profitable coin to mine.""

This, in turn, means it's in the users' best interests to fork the bomb away, as well, since no one wants to be using a blockchain whose security is decreasing over time.

Which leads to the biggest question of all: how does the switch to Proof-of-Stake play out in this world?  It's decidedly against any miners' best interests to support a switch to Proof-of-Stake, so how do we prevent them from creating a fork in which Proof-of-Work continues to be supported?  Exchanges, on the other hand, might be highly incentivized to see Proof-of-Stake become a reality--because they currently hold the largest reserves of Ethereum, and have the most to gain from staking some portion of it.

The only way I see the switch happening is a clean break, with the nodes defaulting to the switch, and with the exchanges on board.

But the ""interest rate"" of PoS is small, meaning miners could bribe exchanges into not supporting the PoS coin.

This means the decision might ultimately fall to the users of Ethereum--the same users who just recently revealed they were fine with giving up on some of its core values under extenuating circumstances.  This carries the potential of it dividing the community, yet again.  With those who feel the mostly strongly about Ethereum's core values--those who opposed the hard-fork and are still on the minority chain--already having left the community, it will be interesting to see how it plays out.

After all, when it comes to manipulating consensus, the cheapest way to do it is with politics.",cryptocurrency,1469330690

Polo support responded denying my claim for ETC.  The moderators also confirmed with me that I have used all of my administrative remedies for resolving this issue.  

Hi x,

It seems indeed that at the time of the hard fork you were lending out ETH. Only ETH in your possession was eligible for receiving the ETC balance

If your ETH was loaned out when the fork occurred, it was not in your possession. You had exchanged it for a debt of ETH plus interest owed to you. The borrower does not owe you anything.

While possession of this ETH may have earned while it was in his or her possession; the borrower owes you only the ETH borrowed plus the agreed upon interest.

I hope this clarifies the issue.

if you feel that there is still an issue concerning this ticket then please let me know by replying here.

financialindependence,Traditional vs. Roth Comparison Tool,"My friends were telling me to invest in Roth over traditional 401k because rates will go up in the future.  My thought is that you should favor traditional contributions if your effective income tax at retirement is much lower than your top marginal rate today.  I ran the numbers to compare effective tax rates vs. top marginal rates for a given taxable income level from 2013 to 1950.  At $100k taxable income your average effective tax rate in retirement is only 12% (assuming 80k annual withdrawal) vs. a top marginal federal tax today of 25%.

personalfinance,"23 year old, 50k in student debt, $42k a year job","I'm living with my parents and have no other debt right now except my student loans. I have extremely high interest rates on private loans and fed loans are smaller/lower interest rates. I occasionally get my self in up to $1000 credit card debt. I created myself a plan a few months back that I've been doing for a while and want to know if this is a good idea. 

I bring in $2300 a month after taxes and investing in Roth. I'm paying the minimum on my fed loans and tripling my private loans. That means I'm paying $1844 a month to loans. When my credit card gets high, I pay that off first and might not pay as high on my loans that month. Figured that's best since interest rates are so much higher. I'm not saving any money but in the long run will be saving myself tons of money not paying interest over 20 years. I plan to start overpaying on my fed loans once I get private paid off. This will all take me about 2 years for private and I haven't done the math on fed yet. 

I'm curious if this is a good plan or if I could be screwing myself over?",finance,1469364985

personalfinance,Is this a realistic retirement plan?,"I have a govt job that pays a pretty good pension.  The multiplier is around 3.2%.  If I retire at 25 years I will get a check for approx $8000 a month.  I have 6 more years to go before I hit that point.  I also have a 457(b) deferred compensation plan.  I wish I had put in more when I was younger but it is what it is.  Current balance is $140k and I put in about $17000 a year in it.  My wife has a traditional 401k with about $170k in it and she puts in about $16000 annually counting the matching $$ from her employer.  I just started a ROTH IRA that I think I can max each year that I am working.

We currently have about $48k in our savings as an emergency fund.

I have a 20 year mortgage with about 18 yrs left on it.  My interest rate is very low (2.75%) and our payments are about $1500.  That's very manageable for us right now.

I have my credit cards paid down to practically zero but I have two car loans that run me about $1000 a month total. 

Based on what my employer is telling me, keeping my wife and I on my health plan after retirement will be about $575 a month and the provider is considered to be a high quality plan.

The wife and I are both going to be 50 when I hit my 25 yr mark.  We'd like to retire at that point and spend time traveling the world together while we are still young enough to be active.  I anticipate doing some part time work eventually once I get bored but I'd prefer that to be a choice and not something I have to do.

So my question:  Is this going to be enough?  I know we will take an income hit once my wife stops working but we want to travel around together and just enjoy not working for awhile.  I know the biggest point will be how much we spend while traveling.  While we don't plan on staying at 5 star hotels, I am past the point where I think hostels are a good option either so I guess it will be middle of the road for lodging.  

Any thoughts on these plans?  We will probably end up keeping the house and using it as a home base while we are still in the states (maybe 3 to 6 months out of the year).",finance,1469366504
personalfinance,"23, signed a contract for 12 months at 2.1 million korean won a month. $8000 in credit card debt, $20,200 in student loan debt.","Hello, 

I had a house fire about 2 years ago, got fired from my job because my brother was trapped in the house and the leave I took was considered too long so all of my clients were traded off, a bunch of breach of contract that I couldnt afford a lawyer on. 

Floating through the insurance process and surviving the time between employment (my job post fire had a 6 month gap time) used up all of my savings and my credit card debt skyrocketed from a manageable 2k to about 6k.

 I've dilligently paid over on my student loans (3.8-4.5%, loans are broken up by semester and have different rates), but due to some desperation on my part the job I took was underpaid, barely 1600 take home but luckily my car is paid off, (this was about a 45% paycut for me overall). I spent the year averaging about  $80-120 net savings, but emergencies kept forcing my credit card debt back up. 

So, I'm moving to Korea in September, I have about 2k in savings, my minimum student loan payment has dropped considerably due to overpaying it well for 2 years (now the minimum is 150 from 250 before) and I've done a balance transfer on my card to get my interest down to 14.5%APR 8,000 in debt on that. 

My questions are: 
1) are there any recommendations for how to most cheaply keep two currencies organized and exchange between them at as close to zero fee as possible? 

2) is it really as simple as pay the highest interest rate first? I want to get my credit card debt lower, but it's going to be the only card I can use in Korea as it has a 0 foreign transaction fee and I won't be allowed to open a bank or get internet in my home until I am a legal resident (2-3 months from job start date) so I am worried about how to literally just pay the bills when they are in USD anyone have experience with this? 

3) what ratio of my savings/debt/loans budget should I aim for in each category?   0/850/150 seems weird to me but it is technically the most efficient if I only look at interest rates. There is no way I can beat 14.5% in the market right? 

3) I've googled cost of living in Incheon, SK and my ~1750 take home pay in USD (free housing, no car needed) should work really well.  Does anyone with experience in a foreign country know how I can learn more about cooking my own foods with their common ingredients though?  Eating like an american there is not feasible, even milk is like $9. 

Thank you for all your help, I currently have Mint but it really wasn't working for me due to spending a lot of time reorganizing categories and the trends were consistently off due to not being paid regularly, I was being paid once a month on a random day of the last week, sometimes spilling 2 paychecks into the same month lol it was weird.  can I make Mint do a complete refresh and start over for Aug 1st?

personalfinance,Consolidating Loans - good or bad?,"So I recently graduated from college, and after 5 years there I've got ~$90k in student loans (and that's with a bunch of scholarships etc). Many of them are federal loans, namely direct subsidized, direct in subsidized, Perkins, and one PLUS loan. I've also got 2 private loans (much higher interest rates) that are about $30k total. That being said, I was wondering if there's any downside to consolidating these loans, as I've worked through the amortization schedules and whatnot and found my ""ideal"" interest rate (the point at which I would be ""saving"" money). Is there any other pertinent info about loan consolidation that I've missed? Also, tried to go through student loans.gov for a consolidation loan, and they were about 1% above my ideal interest rate.",finance,1469368372

personalfinance,"Student loans, living expenses, and mental health","The tl;dr of my life story to this point: I've been working on an associates of mathematics, which I will finish this coming fall semester, and then intend to transfer to a 4 year school to complete an engineering degree, currently electrical engineering but may go more computer science depending on how the prospects look. This year I'm being classified as an independent as I have a child on the way (see: previous PF post when my financial situation got turned upside down and I had to get myself out of that), and so for the first time have access to both Pell grants and Stanford loans.

My current student loan debt is sitting at 11k. With a ten year repayment that's looking to be around ~$120/month and will tack on about 3k interest on it (4.4% interest loans).

I have obtained an industry job that pays better than my previous work and, with overtime, is enough to keep the bills paid and everyone fed. It's a bit of a frugal existence but it does work. This comes with some problems, though: firstly, the job is far from secure. This company cycles through literally hundreds of workers a year, and has about ~300 hired staff at anytime. I'm in a temp-to-hire position, the only way they bring people in. The churn is huge, layoffs happen often, and the company knowingly hires more people than they need. If said people don't quit or fail their drug screening, like most are anticipated to, and there's not enough actual positions open, the remainder are gone the next day. So not super duper secure. The management is okay but the general environment is very negative and forced double shifts are far from unheard of.

Combine this with a lot of stress already going on in my life, and it's kinda reaching a boiling point for me. I have to worry about two families competing with each other, a child on the way, a wife who is nearly blind, school, and then the unstable work. Some of these I can minimize, some of these I can improve, but something has to go, and of the list, it's school or work to pick from.

I can't really justify to myself getting rid of school, as at this point I'm two classes away from an associates: I could take a break before getting my bachelors but stopping now is just a waste of time and money when my earning potential does go up, even if there aren't many jobs that list an associates of mathematics as a requirement. Having an associates in general is just a good proof of at least some higher education and puts you ahead of the diplomas. Right now I'm at $10.50/hr, I should be able to tack on a few extra dollars onto there with a job that does need some proof of being analytical. 

Thus bringing me back to the grants and loans: if I max out both, I can get about ~$7900 per semester. That would be enough for four months expenses over the fall semester, and to insure no sudden money shortfalls cutting off important things like rent, I would be setting up some pay-in-advance things (my landlord will gladly accept four months rent upfront). I probably won't completely stop working, as I would need some money on the side so the government doesn't come after me for spending my grant/loan money on the wrong things, but it'll be much easier on the mind and schedule to work, say, a morning/evening weekend job than a five day a week 9-10 hour job. For reference, my current living expenses come out to around ~1.8k/month, thanks to being on my parent's insurance and living in the plains, where cost of living is remarkably cheap.

I'm not sure at this point if I'd continue this plan into spring: it would depend on the job prospects. I'd be using my free time in November and December to hit the streets pretty hard to find myself a job my degree would be able to secure, but it's no guarantee that it'd be an immediate find. In the event that it does go into spring, the finances won't have changed that much so could continue to do it while I pick up the last few classes I can at the community college before heading over to the four year the following fall.

(A quick sidenote as I'm sure it'll come up: I'm not taking into account a lot of medical expenses from the child as the wife is currently on KanCare. While not a terribly great service, me being the only worker and on a lower wage does mean our medical expenses for her and the child are basically zero. There are some payments we will have to make but we have a minimal spenddown and the hospital's charity services where she's going have already said they'll forgive some due to our situation. We're fortunate that it really isn't going be as huge a blow as it is to other families, if you consider fortunate being we're subsisting on rice and beans and the occasional chicken to do it.)

So yeah. Tl;dr of the above: work is unstable and stressful, life is already stressful, and I'm debating maxing my financial aid to be able to switch to a much-less-work-load part-time job to finish up my degree, be at home with my family, and spend more time looking for another job while improving the mental health. The cons is that I will be adding another $5,000-$10,000 dollars to my student loan debt, which is about another $60-$120 extra a month when I'm paying them off. I know r/personalfinance is big on debt minimization, but I'm looking at opportunity costs and would like some second opinions on those. Is it worth it add to my student loan burden if it means potentially getting a better paying job that will actually advance my career goals? Certainly, there are people with far more in loans doing just fine, but I do have to remember that I have another one and a half to two years of four year schooling to go through, which will probably be a minimum of $20k more in tuition and fees alone.

personalfinance,(Housing) Interesting opportunity from in laws,"Posted before that me and wife of are starting to work on purchasing a house. A few days ago the in-laws brought something interesting before us. Here's the situation:

Background info: My grandfather in law, WWII vet, one of the best men I've ever met is in his 90's and it won't be long before he is no longer able to live by himself. The family has started planning everything that needs to happen when he does eventually pass (it will be a horrible sad day). 

One thing that will happen is his home that he has lived in since the 70's will be sold and the money from the sale will be split 50/50 between the daughter (MIL) and brother. My in laws are then planning on giving that part of the sale to wife of as her inheritance.

This is their suggestion: Buy out the other half of the sale from wife of's uncle. We get a home for half price (mortgage the entire amount and put 50% down for lower interest rate). 

120,000 home.
we get 60k and buy out the other 60k.
Add what we need for the remodel to the mortgage.

However, we will need to remodel the home due to it having some crazy bathroom system where the bathroom is connected to the master bedroom, there are two separate toilets and sinks, but one shower. So we will be adding on to the other 2 rooms to add a full, shared bathroom for both rooms and remodeling the current bathroom to make it into one master bathroom. Then minor remodels to the rest of the house to make it look less like 1970.

Is this a great idea, or will we be sinking much more money into the home than if we were to buy a home straight out from somewhere else?

My thought is, if nothing else, this will be a great tool to use to buy a nicer house in the future. Or am I wrong on this? Going off of my father's advice: ""You never have the money to put down for a first home until you have your first home""",finance,1469385422
personalfinance,What should I do here?,"Currently, I have $55k in a non retirement brokerage and looking to sell it off slowly and put more into my 401k. The problem is that I realized that I currently already put about $11k a year, so it'll take me a while to sell off to drain out the 55k and put it into 401k alone. Apparently, my workplace does not allow for after tax non-ROTH contributions after 18k, so I can't even entertain the thought of rolling that over to a ROTH IRA eventually. Workplace doesn't have a HDHP, so no HSA. I've already contributed to the yearly $5.5k ROTH IRA backdoor. Currently, I'm thinking these things:

* Continue my plan. It'll just take a while. 

* I currently have a 30 year mortgage @ 3.25% interest. Pay down the principal.

personalfinance,Medicaid eligibility income cutoff *very* close to my estimated income this year. What best to do?,"Currently wife and I on track to earn very close to the 2016 eligibility cutoff for Medicaid for a childless couple in NJ. As I understand it, that is 138% of the FPL, which for 2016 for family_size=2 is $21,983. Our income varies quite a bit because we do self-employed work, but my estimates have us coming in right around that number.

Because my estimate for 2016, made early in the year, went a bit above the Medicaid cutoff, we currently have a bronze health care plan through the federal Marketplace with a $5,600/person yearly deductible. We rarely need medical care, but now we have a few ""issues"" that, while not pressing, would be good to get looked at/treated. 

My concern is that if we *aren't* on Medicaid, we could be on the hook for the full amount of the deductible: $5,600 each. Even for ""minor"" health work, like treating a ganglion cyst on one's hand, I can imagine that if it escalates to same-day minor hand surgery, $5.6k is not out of the question, I'd bet. 

**My confusion is what is best to do.** Let's say we earn $21,900. Then we qualify for Medicaid, and, as I understand it, that ganglion cyst work would be probably much cheaper. Let's say $500? (No idea!) Now our yearly income is $21,900 - $500 = $21,400.

But if we pop *just* over the threshold and earn $22,000, now that same work might cost $5k. Now our yearly income is $22,000 - $5,000 = $17,000. Meaning we would be down $4,400 overall in this scenario. That's a huge hit for this year. And if my wife also has medical care, it could double it, meaning $9k or so. Yikes!

**Would it ever be wise to limit one's income for the remainder of 2016 to avoid the scenario above? That seems absurd and wrong-headed, but I know life/bureaucracy can get absurd sometimes.**

Is it really like this? Or is there some middle ground where we can get a few things looked at and treated without really taking such a hit? Then we can focus on earning as much as we can for the rest of 2016 and beyond.

Also, even if we really try to earn as much as possible, we still may fall short of the cutoff and *should* be on Medicaid currently, as per the Marketplace's rules. But it's so close it is really hard to call at this point. One person on this forum said that if we are on a Marketplace bronze plan and missed the cutoff, the Marketplace will *not* ""claw back"" the premium tax credit, but I have not confirmed that. So this is a worry as well.

personalfinance,"Buy a home now, rent for another year, or throw all my money at student loans?","Hi /r/personalfinance! I'm at a point where I'm undecided whether to buy a home or rent for another year and I'm looking for a bit of advice on which way to lean.

Let me frame the situation:

I have rented at my current apartment for nine months. I'm at the point where I'm looking at places around my city to rent for next year once this lease is up. I have to make a decision relatively soon. My coworkers are urging me to buy a home, and as of now, I'm agreeing with them for the most part. 

I have been steadily paying off my student loans for about a year now, just slightly above the minimum recommended payment. I've also been saving a decent bit of money. I have approximately $27,000 left in student debt and $15,000 in an auto loan. I have figured that I can pay off my student loans off in 2-3 years if I really hunker down and save. This means putting my bonus, tax return, and all savings (from here on out) toward that debt. My car is another story, I'm not as worried as paying it off before the five year loan is done, mainly because the interest rate is very manageable and the monthly payment is quite doable. I'm mainly interested in paying of my student debt as soon as possible, and most of the opinions on this SR suggest that's a smart thing to do.

Now, the dilemma that I have is that I feel that I'm literally throwing out money for no reason at rent. I'm renting an apartment for around $550/mo and its not a decent place. The cost of living in my area is fairly high when it comes to apartments worth anything ($800-$1,000). I am simply not willing to spend anywhere near that much money per month for something I will never own. The other option then seems to buy a small home where my monthly payment would be just about what it is now. I've been looking in the area and know this is a reality I can make happen. However, I don't want to really purchase a home at the moment because I am scared of tacking on even more debt. But if I owned a home, I could probably pay off my student debt more quickly because my mortgage will be lower than another apartment choice in my area. I also am aware that I could sell the home after a couple years where the worst-case scenario would be that I broke even on my investment, which in that case, I wouldn't have spent $800x12 months in rent!

That being said, my main question to /r/personalfinance is:

Should I rent or buy a home if I'm in the position to buy, knowing that my main goal is to reduce and eventually dissolve my debt starting with student loans first? Would buying a home save me more money in the long-run? Is renting ill-advised because its literally throwing money away that I'll never get back? Thanks for reading and I really look-forward to any advice you all are willing to share.


TL;DR?

I'm about to renew a lease, dunno whether to buy a home or rent for another year while trying to simultaneously tackle my student debt ASAP. But I don't really want more debt.

Desired International allocation: Not sure.

USD seems to remains strong as basically every other central bank is looking to ease right now. USD rate hike still unlikely, so initial decision will cause USD/xxx to decline, but positive rebound for hawkish sentiment / good recent econ data?

Same question for yen later this week. BOJ unlikely to cut rates, helicopter money rule out, but easing is likely. Initial decision of no rate cut causes xxx / JPY down, but long term play yen to the weak side?",finance,1469409463
personalfinance,Nationstar Mortgage HAMP Re-cast/Re-amorization program? Yay or nay?,"Hi, I tried searching both Reddit and Google and found some great articles about ""re-casting"" but none specific to the HAMP/Nationstar program and I think this is different.

Back in 2007 I did not foreclose/shortsell and instead I did this HAMP program which offered lower interest rates and it also offered up to $10,000 in principal reduction through ""pay for performance incentive"". I did pay every single month since then and I saw multiple (not sure if it was 10??) $1,000 reductions hit my principal (yay). 

Now I got a letter in the mail from Nationstar that says I can use these reductions (?) to do a re-cast, which normally requires the owner to cough up extra money, to amortize my loan. 

It says, without putting any money out of pocket, I can lower my monthly payment about 55 dollars/month but I'd pay $20,000 more over the life of the loan!!! 

I now use this property as a rental. I basically break even on the property so I don't pay much over the minimum due each month which means I may actually take the entire life of the loan to pay it off... so that extra $20k sounds painful. But on the other hand, I don't pay anything for this unit as my tenant is paying it for me, so maybe It'd be better to have the extra 50 bucks now and who cares how long it takes my renter to pay it off?

What this letter fails to say is if I decide not to recast, if there's like a 1 time rebate or drop in principal???",finance,1469409510
personalfinance,Yo-fixed income got reduced and debt is hurting monthly cash flow for MIL. Please help.=),"Hello kind people of pf!

We have the following situation and would greatly appreciate some advice. 

Mother-in-law’s husband passed away with no life insurance, will, or anything that really helped her from a financial perspective. Prior to his passing, their household income, expenses and debt were primarily funded from his military pension. They were together about 10 years but only married recently (less than 9 months prior to death) and she was unable to receive his pension benefits from the VA/Social Security due to the rules surrounding survivor benefits =(.

Currently the MIL has a low, fixed income from disability and SS (aged 65). Living expenses are also very low due to residing with her kids. The issue with her monthly expenses is debt incurred prior to the husband’s passing and decrease in income. 

The debt items that currently affect her monthly cash flow include 5 lines of credit with balances totaling approximately $3,500. They are from places like Old Navy, TJ Max, Home Depot, etc. 

The second item that currently does not affect her monthly cash flow is a car loan. This car loan is only in her name as one of her daughters drives and pays for the vehicle. I believe this is about $21k @ 10.59% interest on a vehicle not worth that. I’m not sure how this happened, but I suppose in a tight situation you might end up with those loan terms. Anyway, this is causing an expensive monthly payment for her daughter (who does not have the credit to get a new vehicle/loan) and a liability for the MIL.

So I guess the first question is should we attempt to use some type of credit consolidation service on the 5 lines of credit to reduce the monthly payment and if so, what type of service should we look for? 

I have no idea how to even approach the car loan. I am not sure that she would be approved to refinance the loan at a better interest rate with her credit and new income level. Allow a repossession? Speak to a bankruptcy lawyer about all of the above (probably will)? What about the daughter and how would she get to work if they lose the vehicle? Do nothing and continue with the daughter paying for the car and just try to reduce the consumer debt payments?

Thanks in advance.",finance,1469410334

personalfinance,"Trying to make some major life choices, while battling severe anxiety and depression. Need help.","So to start, here's a brief overview of my current financial situation: 

I've been at my current job for 11 years, in various departments.  (I'm 30.)  

I've been in my house for almost 7 years, with a 4.5% interest rate on the loan.

I owe about $11,000 on my car, which is two years old, financed at 3.85%.

 My dog needs surgery, and between that and some other incidental stuff, I owe about $2000 on a credit card, which I should be able to pay off during the 0% interest period.

I've got $4000 in savings, and a standing balance of around $1000 in my checking account.

And I am absolutely miserable.  I don't have a college degree.  My job is literally sucking away my will to live, and the last two years have been a slow downward spiral.  I live in a fairly small town, and finding another job that pays as well and has similar benefits is looking increasingly unlikely.  

I'm not married, no kids, and no family I'm really close to, so I could move out of state for better opportunities, but the idea of being in a strange place all alone nearly sends me into a panic attack.  The conservative southern town I live in has no support system for a non conformist like me (ie, no kids, minimal drinker, no church).  The very few friends I have don't understand how much my anxiety influences my choices.

I can't keep living the life I have.  It's pathetic, but sometimes the only way I make it out of bed in the morning is knowing I have to let my dogs outside.  I just can't figure out how to break away, without destroying everything I have.

Bitcoin,The vocal minority does not speak for us,"There seems to be a lot of drama these days around scaling Bitcoin, the decentralized (or centralized) nature of a cryptocurrency when it comes to hard forking, the reputation of various celebrities in the Bitcoin ecosystem including core and non-core developers.

I've been around Bitcoin for over 4 years now, and all this noise just seems like the exact same debates people were having back then but just with more volume. People worried about what would happen to Bitcoin given all the threats of altcoins, or what if the core developers became corrupted, whether Bitcoin could keep up with the demands of growth, and who could be trusted.

And all the answers are the same as before.

Bitcoin grew the fastest, because it came first. It has many advantages for that reason, but this obviously provides no guarantees for the future.

The cryptocurrency market (and in fact, the whole currency market in general) works because people will naturally choose the best currency for their needs. And there are many, many needs in the currency market. This includes things such as:

* Limited number of coins.

* Low transaction fees.

* Decentralization of nodes and miners.

* The principles underlying the currency's development.

* Ability to scale.

* Technology that enables advanced features.

In a healthy cryptocurrency market, there are numerous threats against the leader. This will either make the leader stronger (because the leader adapts to the demands of the market) or will replace the leader with a new superior one. These threats are good. They are not evil. In fact, they are necessary in order for things to thrive and become better as a whole.

There are many people, however, who have a vested interest and/or centralized mentality that ends up doing nothing but create a lot of noise in a system that does not need noise at all.

There are people who were not happy with the direction or speed at which Bitcoin was innovating and saw it as a ""huge problem"" rather than a ""huge opportunity"". They wanted to simultaneously secure their investments in Bitcoin while taking advantage of Bitcoin's existing popularity in order to fix ""a problem"". But that's simply not how a free cryptocurrency market works. Perhaps the mindset of ""central governments"" and ""central corporations"" plague their ability to think like a true free market individual.

With regards to things such as the blocksize limit, the right thing happened in the end. And really, it should have happened with far less drama. And certainly, without the whiny sounding names like ""Bitcoin Classic"" and ""Bitcoin Unlimited"". The whining seems to have continued with whiny sounding names like ""Ethereum Classic"". All of this whining should just be competitive altcoins, preferrably without the whiny sounds.

Those who whine the most are probably invested more into Bitcoin and locked into Bitcoin more than they should have, particularly if they didn't agree with the ethos of the core developers in the first place. And if it wasn't clear before, it should be clear now: decentralization is more important than transactions per second. If that's an ethos you don't agree with, either in principle or implementation, you are free to create an altcoin. That's not to say Bitcoin shouldn't innovate or hear what the community has to say, but rather, that if in the end, it's not what you want, you should switch to a different currency.

If nobody ever switched, that would either mean:

* Bitcoin is perfect. (Can't be true, since it's ethos and implementation is subjective)
* Market is unhealthy. (People are locked-in against their will)

So altcoins are healthy. Swiching is healthy. Even the unfortunately whiny-sounding names are healthy. All of them work to keep Bitcoin honest. And if Bitcoin fails to provide for the needs of the market in general, the market should (and will) change to adapt.

There's no need to _attack_ other developers for their competing ideas. State your case, in a civilized manner, show technological proof, evidence, tests. And let the organic nature of the free market run it's course. There is a lot of anger, frustration, and general discontent around here that is totally unnecessary. If you have a case for something better, and nobody is listening to you, then build it and let it prove itself. 

That's what Satoshi did. Nobody gave him permission to revolutionize the financial system. He didn't have to ramble on and on about how ""the current system sucks"". He obviously didn't like the current system and make subtle suggestions to that fact, but certainly didn't kick up a lot of dust and noise picketing in front of the Federal Reserve. He knew it was unnecessary. He knew the markets would decide. That adoption would prove what is the best or not.

The resolve of the core developers have given me even more faith that they would do the right thing as they have done so far. They seem to know that centralizing the idea of who owns what coins, and politicizing, and exercising that type of control would be against the very principles that attracted it's early adopters and more faithful holders. Have some holders changed their mind? Sure, perhaps. Or maybe some are still thinking about it. But personally, as someone with no reason to be ""locked-in"" to Bitcoin (I don't own a Bitcoin company or anything like that), and could and would happily switch to a better thing if it came along, I have yet to see a better thing come along.

And I think there is a very massive non-vocal majority who are happy with Bitcoin (if they haven't been rattled by the annoying whining yet). And the proof is in the adoption.

Cool features are great, but not at the sacrifice of the principles of decentralization.
More transactions are great, but not at the sacrifice of the principles of decentralization.
Smart contracts and programmable money are great, but not at the sacrifice of the principles of decentralization.

If Bitcoin ever seems 2nd rate to another cryptocurrency that is provably better at being more secure and less centralized, while providing a set of features that I find useful, then I'd be happy to switch. The thing is, nothing I've heard from all the noise seems to be significant enough to warrant such a switch. I think we're very far from it. But that's just my free opinion, and hopefully you'll be free enough to make yours. Without whining, of course.

I'm quite happy with Bitcoin. And I think it's worth stating that, these days.",cryptocurrency,1469430130

personalfinance,On the right track (I think),"I'm 38 and living overseas working for a federal contractor. The income I make is tax-exempt except for what I am required to pay for social-security/medicare. My paychecks are ~$2900 paid bi-weekly after the 5% I'm currently putting into my 401K (right now I have it capped at what my employer matches). My current retirement savings are a total of ~$75,000.

My wife is native to the foreign country I live in, draws an income of about ~$1000 each month, but is pregnant right now with our first child and receiving 100% of her income as a social benefit.

After some previous disasters I've managed to pay off most of my debt. I have no more credit card debt. I have a car I'm paying off with two years left go with a 6% interest rate which I am paying the normal payment each month for (~$390) leaving a little less than $10k as a balance. Finally, I have student loans I've been chipping away it ($1500 from each paycheck) which leaves a current balance of ~$16000.

I currently have an emergency fund of two months.

Our goal is to save up for an international move (probably selling/disposing of most of our possessions including my car, which would barely be worth shipping) not before 2018 (possibly 1-2 years after that). The contract I'm on has no provision for relocation. The move will be dependent on finding a good job in the US capable of providing for my family, but it could take place immediately if I happened to lose my current position for whatever reason. 

I have some furniture and household goods in storage back in the US but I estimate we could visit IKEA and fill in the gaps for about $2000. So the move might cost around $20,000 all told (new furniture, flight to destination, gap between jobs, acquisition of two vehicles, temporary housing). We're really interested in buying a home, but I don't want to jump the gun given my past financial mistakes.

My questions are about how to optimize my savings. I know I need another month of emergency funds, at least. I also know a hard minimum is the $20,000 for the move (and this might be way too conservative of an estimate). I'd like to be able to put 20% down on a home down the road. I estimate that I can save around $50,000 over the next 24 months after having paid off my student loan, but I know I should start maxing out the 401K as well soon after that (maybe after I've collected the minimum I need). I know it's recommended to just throw the money into a savings account for short-term needs, but, should I consider sticking money I have beyond the minimum needed for the move into mutual funds to hopefully grow the total a little?

Lots of Student debt, joined the military to achieve FI.  It's going great.

I wanted to share my milestone outside of the regular milestone thread for anyone who has struggled with college debt.  In 2012 my net worth was -$60K from student loans and on August 1st I will finally have a positive net worth.  No, my debts are not paid off completely, but this is a huge milestone for me.  I started to learn about finances and money in general after college because that debt felt soooo defeating.  This subreddit, has been a huge part of my success. 

~Background~
I'm 27 SNK, and I did not graduate college, (turns out changing majors 2-3 times isn't a reasonable plan).  After realizing I would have to incur at least 40K more in debt before graduating I decided to enlist in the military and earn a degree through the Tuition Assistance program while paying off my current debts.  When I joined they had a CLRP (College Loan Repayment Program) which paid off 7.5K of my federal loans over the first 3 years. In the last four years I've earned a salary between 20-40K  and thanks to a recent promotion I'll be making almost 50K in the next year.  Government jobs are not the highest paying, but they have great upward mobility and a very clear path for career growth.  It's extremely easy to estimate your future salary.

~Current Education~
I'm about a year away from graduating with a brand new major (my 4th).  I've got a great service record, and awesome mentors who tell me I have a really good shot at commissioning, so I'll be applying next year.

~Plans for FI/RE~
At first I joined to earn a degree while paying off old debts, but I realized that I loved the military.  It gives me the ability to achieve financial independence in the future, and it gives me the opportunity to lead people, which I intend to use later in life.  Obviously the military has a great pension program, so the goal is to do at least 20, and then be able to retire by 43 if I want to.  I contribute to the TSP which is the DoD 401k, and starting sometime next year I'll be able to max out the 18K limit.  In the last couple of years my salary has been divided 50%/25%/25% to Expenses, Savings, and Debt respectively.  I should be debt free in about a year which will allow me to go 50/50.  

My family was the typical conservative mid-west family that did not talk about money (not that we had any), and I'm grateful that this subreddit has taught me a ton about FI/RE.  If anyone has any questions about my career or general DoD/Government benefits I'd be glad to answer.",finance,1469451000

Ok, so on my W4, for personal allowances, the only one I did was 'A' ""enter 1 for yourself"", since nothing else applied.

Now... the ""Two-earners/multiple jobs"" section comes up, this amount comes up in line 6 ""Additional amount, if any, you want withheld from each paycheck"" So, as of right now, I followed the steps and ended up with $400 for each paycheck for me, and $800 for her...

Her parents are letting both of us live here for free while we get money together to move out. She is a civil engineer for a small local firm, and she makes roughly four times as much as me, so it would be pretty easy for her to afford rent when we decide to move. I, on the other hand, am struggling to really save up enough money to afford to live. I'm working full time as a produce clerk in a grocery store, and after union dues, social security, federal tax, medical insurance, and whatever else they deduct from my paycheck, I get around $280 per week. The cheapest rent we can find (by getting a two bedroom apartment and splitting it between my girlfriend, her friend, and I) is around $600 per month.


I have no car, so I walk to work. My shifts range from as early as 4 AM to as late as midnight, and buses don't run at those times. I can't use my girlfriend's car during the weekdays because she needs to use it for work. So, if we were to move, I'd need some form of reliable transportation to get to and from work, interviews, etc. I really don't know if I could afford a car on my income though. 


This brings me to my debts. I have a total of $31,968 in student loan debt (average interest rate of 4.4%), $5k debt to a friend's parents who loaned me money so I could go to school in the first place (with no time limit for repayment and no interest), and $5k in credit card debt. Fortunately, as a result of having a credit card for the past 6 years (and thanks to never missing a payment), I have a credit score of 725. Unfortunately, I have been struggling to pay off the debt for the past 4 years. When my student loan payments start up, they will be roughly $308/month for the 10 year repayment plan. On top of that, my credit card payments are roughly $130/month for the minimum payment. I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed about all of this. Especially since my girlfriend and I are desperately trying to move out soon. As far as money in the bank goes, I have roughly $900 in my savings account, and I limit myself to $10 per week for expenses... so I have $10 in my checking account.


The obvious fix is to just get a better job, and believe me, I've been applying for everything from Audit Specialists to Research Scientist to Software Developer, and I've only landed one interview which went...poorly. I've been learning as much as I can in my free time to make myself a more attractive candidate to employers, but still lack the experience for an entry level front-end or back-end web developer. So until the opportunity arises, I have to make do with what I currently get.

We have been working our way out of the debt and plan on paying off credit cards ASAP (possibly consolidating as well) and once those are out of the way, we can make more meaningful installments to the IRS. We also just took on two roommates that are paying monthly rent to help us pay bills/payoff debt.

We had started installments last year when we refinanced our home mortgage. It wasn't enough to pay off the taxes in a timely manner but it was still something start paying. Just today I received two certified mails from the IRS stating intent to cancel the installments and notice of intent to levy. One for each of those tax years. I assume that is mainly due to the most current taxes coming into the picture, as when I setup installments they told me I should stay up to date on any future taxes (and didn't).

Our monthly expenses are approximately $4000-5000 with credit card payments being minimum unless its the highest interest rate, which we are paying more than the minimum to reduce and eliminate. 

I haven't called the IRS yet to discuss, or reached out to any Taxpayer Advocates or other professional assistance, I wanted to get some feedback and/or pointed in the right direction on how best to handle this.

personalfinance,Can my parents take a tax deduction for the parent plus loan that I will be paying?,"As the title would suggest my parents took out a parent plus loan (during the first two years of college) to help me pay for tuition. I have since graduated, got a job and I'm waiting for my licensure paperwork to go through so I can start. I received a bachelors and master degree and have other loans that are in my name alone.  

I've asked my parents multiple times for the login information for the parent plus loans so I have it ready when they enter repayment and can add the information to my budget. 

Today I learned that my dad intends to have me pay him directly for the loans then he will deduct the interest off his taxes. I thought this sounded fishy. I mentioned that I plan to pay on the plus loan for a year and then refinance it into my name to get a better interest rate and haven't heard back from him. 

Also can my parents claim me as dependent for taxes and would there be any benefit for me? They paid my health and car insurance and gave me some money towards gas. I covered all of my other expenses with money I had saved on my own or a separate graduate loan that is in my name only. 

Would I be better off not claimed on their taxes?

personalfinance,[debt] Onward to Student Loans,"Hello, r/personalfinance.
I've been lurking for about a year now. After a student loan shock, we realized we need to get our finances in a better place. We put together a budget, followed it, paid off her car, my car and continued to snowball payments. As of this coming Friday, we will also have all our credit card debt paid off. That is the good news.

The bad news is we have a shit ton of student loan debt.

Now that we have paid off our credit cards we have about $600 a month to snowball into Student Loans, Savings or Personal Loans.

The budget breaks down like so:

$6140 monthly income (post-taxes, 401k, health ins.)

**Fixed Amounts**

* Mortgage: $1310.89
* Car: $0
* Credit Cards: $0
* Personal Loan1: $216.05 (@.6.97%)
* Personal Loan2: $166 (@ 4.00%)
* Personal Loan3: $100 (@ 11.99%)
* Parent Plus: $269
* Student Loan 1: $117
* Student Loan 2: $796

**Adjustable**

* Savings: 	$200
* Internet/Cell: $192
* Vehicle Fuel: $200
* Utilities: $250
* Car Insurance: $50
* Target/House Supplies: $350
* Netflix/Hulu/Spotify: $30
* Entertainment: $200
* Restaurants: $300
* Home Improvement: $300
* Health: $110
* Misc: $300

Total: $5456.94

This budget is what has worked for us for the last year; it's realistic for us. We don't use every ""bucket"" every month, so we have some rollover each month.

But here is how the Student Loan debt breaks down:

**Here is where I need help:**
Right now, both of our student loans are in an Income Based repayment plan. Do I turn attention to a certain loan in our student debt? If so, which one(s)? Or should I turn my attention to one of the personal loans at the top? 

If I start paying additional payments toward our student loans, will this do anything to our Income Based Payment plan?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: I meant 58k a year before taxes, not 52k. After taxes, my biweekly income is about $1800. My expenses per month are:

Rent: $695

Utilities (Power &amp;amp; Water): $100

Groceries: ~$200

Gas: ~$150

Phone Plan: $100 (should soon be around $70)

New phone: $27

Health Ins thru employer: $30

Savings: $500

Currently no auto insurance payment, it's still under my parents. I'll soon get on my own insurance.

Additional information: 

* No CC debt, no personal debt, other than the loans listed below. (I do have an American Express credit card that I pay off the whole outstanding balance every month; I only use it occasionally).

* $3.5k in checking currently.

* $5.3k in savings.



Loan information: 

Loan|Principal|Interest|%|Total
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
Direct Subsidized|$9,777|-|$9,777
Direct Unsubsidized|$5,500|$1,304|6.800%|$6,804
Direct Unsub.|$2,223|$216|3.860%|$2,439
Direct Unsub.|$2,000|$141|4.660%|$2,141

Federal Direct Parent PLUS|$4,000|Not sure|Not sure|???
Private Non Fed.|$17,223|$1,977|9.375%|$19,200


That all totals up to about $55k, but I'm factoring in more interest I guess when I say $70k total.

Seeing as the Private Loan has the higher interest rate, I figure I should start paying that off first?

The federal subsidized/unsubsidized have the 6 month grace period, the Federal Direct Parent PLUS I think does too, though I know we are making some interest payments on it now (my parents are at least; there's been an automatic payment of about $50 every month for the past year), and the Private Loan payments don't begin until Feb 16, 2017 (the e-mail says ""Anticipated Repayment Begin Date"").

So I figure I have some time before I'm required to start making payments, but I would like to get a head start and I would like some advice on where to begin. Obviously, that Private Loan is the biggest... Should I start making payments towards that one? Maybe like $400 to interest and $400 to principal every month.

Also, I was thinking about at some point getting a newer car (a used one), around $14-18k (the ones I've been looking at; I'll probably need to find some cheaper). Either getting a newer car, or I was thinking of going back to Spain in the spring of next year for a couple weeks. But should I even consider this with all the loans I have to pay off?

I had to get the private loan to help pay for studying abroad, which was required for one of my majors (graduated with B.S.B.A. in International Business and Operations Management).

personalfinance,I got a bit of money and I'm interested in investing and making savings. (ROU),"Hello /r/personalfinance
I have a few questions or maybe more. I'll try to make everything as clear as I can. I have around 2300 EUR in my national currency (which is around 10.000 RON) in a savings account that has plenty of administrative taxes and just a 1% interest rate. I have about 100 EUR in cash and that's pretty much it. I'm just 18 by the way. I'm curious about what should I do with most of the money, the best option for a savings account is a 2.35% variable interest rate and no admin. taxes at another bank. I've also been looking at mutual funds that had a profit of about 5% per year which also didn't have admin. tax.

Recently, I've tried trading, but with CFDs since I don't really have such a big amount of money. A certain site had a free bonus of 20$ so I gave it a shot. I had to make also a certain amount of points in order to withdraw the sum. I made around 200$ after about 7 successful trades in a row. Because of my excitement, at the 8th position I opened, I didn't want to close it when I just had a 20$ loss and in the end all the money went down the drain after a margin call. It seemed to be a riskier investment but it allowed me to make all the points I needed in order to withdraw the money from the site. I lost all the 200$ but I'm thinking about investing some of my money (about 100 EUR) and trying again. This time I won't be stressed with those points needed to withdraw at least.

So this is all I got at the moment, all my options/ideas for making more of the small sum I got. I hope that some of you have an advice or two for me about what I should do next and what I should choose.",finance,1469490914

Option 1: Use $200k cash to pay off all my student loan (totalling $180k) and rent a place at around $3200-$3500. No mortgage so no tax benefits, but also no student loans!

Option 2: Use $200k cash to pay a 20% down payment toward a $600k apartment in NJ. My monthly payment toward student loans is expected to exceed $2000, but I will benefit from deducting mortgage interest and property tax from my taxable income.

personalfinance,I don't entirely understand how refinancing works. I would like to on my current truck for a new vehicle. Help?,"So I have a truck that I took a loan on to get. I still owe 2k on it. The problem is, I've already put in 1k into it for repairs and it's currently in the shop right now as I write this due to brakes squealing and making a thump/clank noise when coming to a halt.


I don't want this truck any more. I absolutely loathe it. My roommate told me how refinancing would work, just wanted to get a broader opinion. So if I were to trade in my truck and let's say I get $500 for it in trade-in value. I'd still owe $1,500. The car I'm looking at now is 9k. From what my roommate told me, that $1,500 would be added to my new 9k loan to a total of 10.5k loan with my current bank loaner and I'd be making a single monthly payment towards that 10.5k. I would refinance with a credit union for a lower interest rate.


Is that right? Is that how it works? I just want to make sure I'm doing something right and not wrong. Or should I wait to pay off the truck then just go from there?

personalfinance,Should I consider a student loan?,"I've attempted to research this question, but I can't find any useful answers. I thought I'd try here. 

So I begin college next week on a full scholarship. Tuition, room and board, health insurance, all taken care of. The thing is, I come from a family of 5 children with a single mother. My mom makes under $22k a year, and while we receive government assistance, every month is still a struggle. As of right now, we have to choose between paying the water bill on time or getting me to school across the country.

I'm receiving $1k next month for books and such, and I have a federal work-study, but that's still not going to cover all of my expenses. I have no clothing for the new climate, my school requires me to do service work in the mountains which requires outdoor equipment like thermal sleeping bags and such (and I can't rely on borrowing), my 5yo laptop is on its last legs, and my meal plan doesn't even cover enough for me to have 2 meals a day. Basically, I'm going from living in poverty with my family to living in poverty alone. I don't even know how I'm going to afford making it home for the holidays, as my school doesn't allow people to stay on campus during breaks. I also have health issues, and without Medicaid, I have to start paying copays for medication and monitoring.

I used to be excited about being able to graduate with no debt, but I'm tired of being stressed about money. The stress almost kept me from graduating high school, and I can't afford to fail this time. My grandfather is giving me $500, but with this recent crisis, that has to go toward bills and travel costs. He offered to help me cosign a loan, so that's what I'm looking at.

I wasn't offered any federal student loans, but I have an account with Wells Fargo, so I was considering going with them. I feel like $5-7k would suffice for the next 4 years, and shouldn't be too hard to pay off, even if I end up as a barista. I know how to live frugally, but I also want to be able to have fun in college. I'm going to a top-tier private school, so I also want to avoid the isolation of being the poor scholarship student. I already dealt with that in high school and I need to be able to network.

I want to make my own way, and to not be a burden on my mom. Her health is poor, and she's at her wit's end right now. I need to make *something* happen. I have former teachers who offered to pitch in, but I don't wanna be a charity case. I know it sounds stupid and prideful, but I'd rather they help her out while I try to support myself.

I'm heading to the bank tomorrow. Since my direct costs are already paid, would they release the funds directly to me?

ethereum,I'm dissapointed of this community split.,"I got into ethereum because I was fed up with Bitcoin's stagnation and community. I didn't invest in DAO and I though it was crazy to see so much money poured into one experimental contract on a cryptocurrency that is basically only being developed. But I really liked ethereum's vision, I really liked fast transactions, I really liked scalability plans (PoS), I really liked the community, responsivness of developers, high compentency and professionalism of project's leader, Vitalik Buterin.

After the DAO vulnerability was found and abused I was split between pro-fork and no-fork. I got both views. At first I was anti-fork as I didn't think it was wise of investors to invest in the DAO in first place. It looked like everyone was just seeing it as a risk-free investment with guaranteed profit. On the other hand, what happened was obviously a theft and since ethereum as a platform doesn't yet have all the development tools, good practises, etc matured, it's understandable that these events might occur in these early stages. If there is a way to get community together and come up with a solution, why not?

Once the super-majority of community voted for hard fork, I accepted it and after the hard fork smoothly passed, I thought this is done deal. 

I was really surprised to see there is now motivation to run two seperate chains. Seeing all this division in community and all the problems associated with it (mainly replay attacks) saddens me. I had to tell my friend to wait before investing in ethereum as I'm currenlty not even sure what IS *the* ethereum. It's like living in some kind of quantum world where the stolen money is both returned and not.

It's really mind fucking especially to see more people in ecosystem to embrace it (exchanges, wallet developers, investors,.). I don't want to sound like conspiracy theorist, but it really starts to look like a way to destroy the ethereum.

I don't think 2 chains can coexist together and hopefully ETC will become irrelevant very soon as this only creates uncertainty and stops potential investors from investing.",cryptocurrency,1469525914

My student loans are due, since I graduated last May 2015 and chose to do an add-on certificate program that wasn't covered by loans. So, I've been in repayment since December 2015.

I don't have much in my savings account or anything set up for an emergency fund, investments, or retirement. I'm generally pretty clueless on all of that, and I don't know where to start. I'm 23 years old. 

**Rent:** $780 (one more payment for August)

**Student loans:** 

*Private #1 12.5%, $5900 left, $102 payment/month

*Private #2, 7.5%, $7400 left, $100 payment/month

*Federal loans combined (I have no clue on the interest, it's like 3.5%) $13,000, currently not paying due to income and they have put me in deferment

**Credit card** Don't know interest rate, but I carry a $3500 limit and $2500 balance right now, making minimum payments of $60 a month (this was an emergency)

**Cell phone** $80 a month

**Food** $40/week, generally $200/month

**Gas** $30/week, generally $150-180/month

**Car** paid off, 2008 Nissan Maxima, but running into maintenance problems

**Insurance** $35/month dental, health through parents

**Car Insurance** ~$90/month, but I do a biyearly payment of $500

**Savings account** $2300 + $700 security deposit returning + $1000-1500 work bonus soon

I take home about $1800/month, so $20,000 year after taxes and such. My goal is to pay down my student loan debt as much as possible and THEN tackle a savings account and retirement and investments. What can I do for each monthly payment? How much should I be putting towards the loans each month?",finance,1469542272

personalfinance,[IRA] Using IRA for down payment,"Hello,

Hopefully an easy question, and I think I know the answer, but would just like clarification/assurance.

I plan on taking from my Traditional IRA, some money to use towards a down payment on a house (in Arizona).

I know the maximum amount that can be used from a Traditional IRA for this instance is $10,000 and I also know it is still taxable. However, by using it for a down payment within a specific time period, I will avoid the 10% penalty fee.

My question though, is that $10,000 maximum that can be withdrawn BEFORE taxes, which would leave me with $7,060? Or, can I withdraw $14164.25, which after taxes would leave me with $9,999.96?

personalfinance,repayment options for student loans. 87100 in debt,"Hi all. This is my first post. I am 28 years old and finished a graduate degree last year. I make around 63/64k a year working for a gov agency. This is my first professional job out of school.  I am happy with my degree and save working 6+ years in my field, I wouldn't be able to have this job without my degree. (Degree in lieu of experience). I have solid career plans and within two years, planning to move on and up, but still within government. 

Now, debt freaks me out. I can thank my mom for that because she had to file bankruptcy a few years ago. I am not ashamed of her for that because she is a super trooper. Anyway, 6 years of schooling later, I am 87,088.38 dollars in debt. I want to pay this off quickly. I paid off my car earlier this year and so this is my only outstanding long term debt. I would love to be student loan debt free in 5 years. Sooner if possible. I have a single income and take home about 3170 a month. My living expenses are about 1400 a month I would say. I need to do a better job at tracking that but utilities fluctuate a bit.  I did a generic calculation and I would need to pay an additional 1800+ a month to pay off in three years. It's completely unimaginable. If I got a part time job, I think it would be minimum wage or something probably under 12 dollars an hour (not sure what retail jobs go for) and not more than 10/15 hours a week. I'm not sure if that would make a difference but I'm trying to think of what I could do to generate extra income. 

My ask - how can I pay off my loans the quickest?  Also, I'm trying to build up my savings to 5000. I'm a little more than halfway there. I don't want to touch that money. Once I do that, I want to start an Roth, my employer provides a state pension but I'm not vested until I've been here three years. 

I called my student loan servicer to ask if I can make multiple payments to reduce my interest compounding but they said I have to make the minimum payment which is ~555. Anything over that is fine, but it can't be split into two payments. Additionally, when I make extra payments I can tell them where I want that money to go. Which is why I posted my interest rates below. Would the snowball method work for me?

personalfinance,Estimated taxes (NJ and US),"I paid one estimated tax payment to NJ on April 18th when I filed my taxes, but I forgot to do the June 15th payment. **Question is: what to do now?**

Because we're both ""freelance""/self-employed for now, our yearly income is fairly hard to estimate. Back in April, I roughly (and wildly over-) estimated our total yearly tax for NJ to be $680, and made a 1/4 payment of $170 on April 15th.

Looking over things now, we may earn only as high as $24k (though much depends on what happens the rest of the year)--and that includes $5,500 of PA state unemployment insurance, which I don't know if it is counted as earnings but I'll count it--so the taxes on that, if I understand it correctly, and based would be:

- the first $20k:         $20k x 1.4% = $280
- the remaining $4k:  $4k x 1.75% =  $70

----------------

TOTAL = $350

So if *that* is true, we don't have to make estimated payments at all, since for NJ one only has to pay estimated taxes if you reasonably expect your tax owed to be over $400. 

However, who knows?--we might get a great job offer, start soon, and come in at $45k for the year, and then we'd definitely owe estimated payments to NJ.

I have the money to make an estimated payment of, say, another $170, though it will be about a month and a half late. Should I do that? Or should I just wait and make no further estimated payments to NJ until our income obviously jumps?

**Also**, I have made no estimated U.S. federal tax payments so far. Back in April, as I calculated it, we wouldn't be required to make estimated payments this year. I don't remember why I thought that, other than it may have been we would be likely to owe less than $1,000 this year in taxes (after deducting the personal exemptions and the standard deduction).

personalfinance,"[Investing] Inherited a large sum, need help investing and putting money in the right places","I will try to keep this as brief as possible.

My mother in law recently passed, unfortunately quite young at 55, but being that she was widowed (and there is no one in the picture) and my wife being an only child, means that she has inherited all of her possessions...which has been obviously extremely painful for our family, most especially my wife since that is the only family she had.


On to the money portion, a little background:

My wife and I haven't properly managed our money ever, we both grew up and began our lives together pretty poor, having lived with her mom for 8 years because we couldn't afford our own. We both started doing well for ourselves, and began to splurge a little. We are under the realization now that neither one of us have any self control, so we need to fix it now while we are still young.
She is 36, I am 30, we have two children, 15 and 8.

Debts (approx. remaining balance):

*Mortgage - 180,000 @ 4.0275%

*Boat - $25,000 @ 10% (luxury item, interest rates suck)

*Credit Cards - $10,000 (Various APR's, very approx as I didn't calculate it)

*Student Loans - $20,000 (Various APR's, between 5-7%)


Our combined income hovers around $100,000 a year.

Inherited Items:

*Home - $190,000 owed (Currently working on selling, realtor is estimating we will pocket between $30-60k, depending on how much work we put into it before we sell it. $30k with no work, $40k with light work, $50-60k if we do large upgrades. This is a whole other discussion, but we are doing light work, so we are guessing $35-40k in take home cash)

*Car - $18,800 owed, $3000 positive equity (have offer from dealer to buy it for $22,000)

*401k - $138,000

*Stocks - $7,000


Total minimum, we are assuming, is $178,000.


I have done some research on the 401k, but that is what I am most struggling with. The company that holds the 401k is going to transfer the money into a BDA-IRA account. The money is pre-tax, so the money can rollover into the IRA with no penalty and no tax needing to be paid. Our goal is to do a long term IRA (can't remember what it's called, Stretch IRA?) as opposed to the 5 year plan. We figure the money is better off there, making us money, even if we have to take out minimum distributions every year.


I called Fidelity, I have an account there currently (with nothing in it...for shame), and they said that in order to make the transition the most smooth with the least amount of hurdles and paperwork, I need to initially open the IRA with the company that has the 401k. The company that holds the 401k has another local company that they work with to rollover the funds, so we plan on rolling the majority of the funds into their account, and then transferring the account to Fidelity (who will pay any transfer fees, if we are charged with them).

That all being said, where I am most confused is where to put the money, the Investment Selection Form is essentially alien to me. The first page asks which Risk Based Model Portfolio we want to choose, and what percentage of the funds to go in each.

*Aggressive

*Growth

*Moderate

*Balanced

*Conservative


My gut tells me that we should do a mix, mostly conservative, some balanced, and a little moderate and/or growth…but this is not my cup of tea, I know nothing about investing, it frankly scares me, I don’t want to lose the money.

On top of that, page 2 has the Individual Fund Selection…I don’t know if I need to pick that, if I should let this company pick it, or if it doesn’t matter since they won’t have the account for more than a week anyways (again, it’s going to Fidelity)…so that is where I am lost. 

[Linked here is the copy of the page 2](http://imgur.com/5GvSLYn.jpg), which shows the investment choices – I don’t know if they differ from company to company.


Things I know:

The boat, the credit cards, and to a lesser extend the student loans, all need to be paid off. The average return since 2000 has been around 5%, so anything below that is typically okay to not pay off (IE the Mortgage), while anything above that should be paid off (according to a guy I talked to at Edward Jones, who seemed a little weird, but sounded like he knew what he was talking about...for whatever that's worth). I plan on rolling over most all of the 401k, as it is all pre-tax, but we do need to take out some to cover funeral expenses we had to pay out (and ultimately put on our credit).

What input or advice do you guys have? I feel like I'm on the right path...just a little lost. If I'm off kilter on anything, please call me out on it!

**Edit:** Just wanted to clarify, we plan on waiting to pay off the boat and student loans with whatever equity we get out of the house since it is already taxed money (I think?), rather than using the 401k money which is still pretax and I believe would be better served to stay in the IRA as long as possible. The credit cards we want to pay off immediately because we know how much it's costing us, and since we had to use them for funeral expenses it rang them up quite a bit.",finance,1469561893

Long story short, I am a recent college graduate, and I have a ""secured"" credit card through my bank. Essentially, it has a credit limit of $500 and is backed up by $500 in a savings account. This card is a way for those with no credit or bad credit to build some. I have had it for about 3 and 1/2 years. 

**My current credit score is 694.** From what I understand, that's not bad and anything over 700 is considered ""good."" It would be higher if I had not ran up the balance on the credit card a bit more than I would have liked to when I had an unpaid internship. However, now that I have a steady stream of income, I am slowly paying it down.

Once the card is paid off and my credit score is over 700, I plan on closing out the card to free up the $500. My bank wants me to open up a new credit card because they claim that if I close that card and do not have any other lines of credit, my credit score will go down. From what I understand, this all seems true. However, I am also aware of the dangers of credit cards and do not want to make a hasty decision. I am definitely closing out the card because it is relatively expensive (high interest rates AND a $24 annual fee), I just want some advice on what to do after that.

personalfinance,Indecisive Pharmacy Student Who Needs Help Deciding on Whether to Take This Loan or Not.,"Hey all, 

Background:  I'm in my second to last year of pharmacy school and am now just starting to take out loans to pay for this year's cost. I've accepted the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan for $20.5K and I pretty much understand that loan. 

However, there's a loan for health profession students called Health Profession Student Loan, which I applied for past the deadline and honestly didn't think i was gonna get the loan since I turned in the application way later than the deadline. But I was just notified that I got it, and I have some questions.

It's a loan for $5,000 max, with a fixed APR of 5%. The grace period is 12 months, in which I do not have to pay any interest whatsoever. Interest does not accrue until after those 12 months. 

The repayment plan is 10 years, and it's saying that the estimated ""finance charge"" for this loan is $1,363.93. So the total that I will be paying back will be $5,000 + $1,363.93 = $6393.93. 

QUESTIONS: 

1. What is this finance charge/where did it come from? Is this the calculated total interest after 10 years or what? 

2. If I choose to pay back the whole loan before the grace period of 12 months ends, do I pay the whole $6393.93 or just the $5K that I borrowed. This is what I'm confused about. It says I can make prepayments at any time without any penalty, so I figured since I will be making pharmacist salary, I'll be able to pay that amount back in no time. 

ALSO I need advice about another issue. The total cost of this semester just came out to be around $11.5K. I was told by an upperclassman that tuition was gonna be $13K so I wasn't going to be able to cover all the expenses with just the Direct Unsubsidized Loan of $10,250/semester. But now that it's just $11.5K I can easily pay off the difference with my own money plus a scholarship I got from the school of pharmacy.

Is it worth taking out the HPSL anyway? (for future tuitions?). After this next year in school, we will start the last year of school right when the summer starts, and it's another $10K just for the summer. Should I just accept this loan and save it for the summer and avoid having to take out private loans?

I'd really appreciate your advices and wisdom.

**VIEWPOINT:**

South Australia's green dream, or its nightmare?

South Australia is being watched closely by both energy companies and renewable energy specialists worldwide as a test case for what happens when high levels of intermittent energy, such as wind and solar, are introduced into a system that is not fully covered by other sources of readily available (dispatchable) power, writes Ian Hore-Lacy.

Recent performance in South Australia - where wholesale power prices have spiked dramatically, household electricity costs are the highest in the nation, and industry is threatening to quit - provides a good reality check. Early in July, electricity prices in South Australia have soared as it struggles with the consequences of an ambitious build of wind farms without firm power backup.

Eastern Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) operates the world's largest interconnected power system that runs for more than 5000 kilometres from North Queensland to Tasmania and central South Australia, and supplies some AUD 10 billion electricity annually to meet the demand of more than 10 million end users. NEM infrastructure comprises both state and privately owned assets, and is managed under the overall direction of the Australian Energy Market Operator, which was established by the state and federal governments. South Australia is a small part of this, connected only to the extent of only one quarter of its peak load.

To start, I would like to thank this sub and everyone in it for helping me be mindful of my spending and saving every single day. No one every taught me about money growing up and I owe a lot to this sub. 

Here is my situation. 

No credit card debt and I have about 40k debt that student loans. (30k federal/10k private) I am currently on Income based repayment for those loans. My credit score is 720. 

Im a photographer for a property company and I make $13/hr at about 25-30 hours a week and I sometimes I second shoot weddings/events which bring in about $500-$600 dollars.

Anyway, I have a bank of america travel rewards card that I got about two years back before visiting my girlfriend in europe. No foreign transaction fee appealed to me as we go quite often. The limit is 1k and I get 1.5 points for every dollar spent.

This sub has got me thinking I should maybe look into another card? I use it for pretty much every purchase I make and pay it off immediately. Do you recommend any specific card?
 
Also, I was curious about increasing my limit. I'd like to start purchasing my photography gear and plane tickets with my card to maximize points, however sometimes they can be well over my 1K limit. What do you recommend I try to increase my limit to? Also, does my only making 13/hr decrease my chances for getting approved?

Also, I know applying for a new card will be a hard pull which will bring my score down a bit, so is it worth it? 

Also, does applying for a credit increase on my card require a hard or soft pull?

personalfinance,Help me help my parents; WAY behind on retirement.,"Hi PF. 

I am coming to you because my parents are really in need of financial help. I can only preach my limited knowledge of personal finance from my short time here to them, and I think I need more concrete advice to help them further. For a quick summary, my mother and father are 55 and 56 respectively. I am 18, living at home in the summer and attending college during the academic year.  My father works as a foreman union construction worker in a large city in a neighboring state at a guaranteed hourly pay of 40 hours a week (not salary but functionally salary) with substantial overtime, making VERY ROUGHLY ~80-90k per year. My mother is disabled and unable to work as of about 20 years ago, so she receives a monthly disability benefit of about $1500 per month. 

**THE PROBLEM: **

My parents live paycheck to paycheck. They have about $70,000 in savings, from the sale of my grandparents' house, after settling their estate when they passed away 5 years ago. 

My mother has: 

about $32000 in ""premiums"" in an ""individual single premium deferred annuity"" from Genworth Financial with a 2.9% ""base interest rate"" and a 1% guaranteed interest rate. She may withdraw 10% of this money each year with no penalty. I believe her income payments start in 2024. The surrender value is about $29,000; she started with 30,000 in 2014. 

$16247 in ""accumulation value"" in a ""flexible premium deferred annuity - MLN innovator choice"" from Midland National. Current surrender value is $14,435. This thing seems very opaque so I cannot figure much about how much she is earning but it seems to be invested in a combination of a ""fixed"" portion (26% of total), somthing in the nasdaq 100 (35%) and some S&amp;P 500 thing (39%).  I believe it is some sort of thing where you may receive gains based on the market but you never lose principal or earnings. 

She was sold these products because she is VERY afraid of losing her principal and after a bad experience with losing half her money in her old 401(k), think she will lose all of her money, so they got her on ""you do not lose money, only gain"" which is the only thing she knows about these financial products AT ALL. It seems like she is losing A LOT of money in potential returns for ""security"" even though she is about 10 years away from my father's retirement. 

Lastly, my father has about 100k in a union-provided retirement account (an annuity) for which he has been getting about a 5% return (~5000) annually with an $80 fee each year. It seems that he has no choice but to keep this plan. He is ""Vested"" and his earnings and wage contributions still have not been calculated for the past 3 years. This seems to be about a 1% expense ratio which is not bad but not that great I think. 

That is all my parents have. They have about 2 years of payments left on their mortgage after which they will own their house and can probably save that money each month. Please help me determine what my parents need to do, and if I should tell my mom to get rid of those annuities and move the money somewhere else.

Back in 2012 I got a Chase Freedom card with a 23.24% interest rate; not bad for a kid right out of college. Fast forward 5 years and very good credit habits later, that rate just isn't cutting it anymore for me (26 year old guy). I pay my balance on the card off monthly so a rate reduction isn't the most pressing matter for me at the moment, but having seen posts on how to request a rate reduction I figured I'd give it a shot.

I prepared for the call (have offers from other companies in the 13%-16% range, verified credit score on Credit Karma - in the 750-760 range, and even have 3-4 offers from Chase for their Slate card @ 13.24%) to make my case. But when I got the representative on the line, I was told that ""there is no process for requesting an APR reduction,"" that there was no supervisor/person I could talk to that has the authority to do that, and that accounts are reviewed every six months and if I hadn't been offered a lower rate then I have the best available rate (the last part sounded like total BS to me).

Did I miss something? Or is this whole process of getting an APR reduction one of those situations where you need to just stick with it and get the right person on the phone? Any advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated!

I have been lurking around this sub for a few months now but this is my first post.

I recently visited the dentist for a long overdue cleaning and was told that I would need additional work since I neglected my teeth for so long. Long story short I am still covered under my parent's health care (I am 23) and after the contracted pricing leaves me with $900 to pay.  

Current financial situation:  
Recently started a job a couple months ago, net $3,000/month  
Credit Score 751 as of today  
CC Debt: $900  
Monthly mortgage PITI and HOA $568 (in the middle of a refinance)  
Emergency Savings: $2,650  
Flex checking: $250  
Bill pay/large expenses checking: $775

I have the means to pay the bill in one lump some, however I would rather continue to build up my emergency cushion first. The dentist office participates in care credit which is 0% APR for 12 months but then interest is 26.99% after, but I know I can pay it off before then. A third option would be to open either a Chase Freedom or Sapphire card and earn the cash back to save for my Europe trip next year. I asked my lender and he said that getting a credit card should not affect my interest rate.

I wouldn't go into details, unless they're needed, about how it got this bad, but here I am. And I'm trying to make the best of my situation and not drown.
I'm 26 (F) and just graduated in May from an Ivy League school with my MPA in Environmental Science. Over the course of the last 6 years I have been in school, I have accumulated over $180,000 in debt, combining students loans (both graduate and undergraduate) and credit cards. I'm still trying to find a full time job in my field, but am currently working two part time jobs making approximately $2000/month before taxes. I currently live in Jersey City, NJ and pay variable rent based on what I can afford to my BF, but I would like to ideally be able to pay him upwards of $1000/month so as to not take advantage of his current generosity based on my current situation. 

Here is the general breakdown of my debt:

Undergraduate loans (personal student) = $78,888.73 (3 separate loans consolidated)

Graduate loans (federal student) = $92,596.00

Credit cards = $9,529 

 - 1 major credit card = $5,202

 - 1 CareCredit = $2,873

 - Retail credit card = $1,454

Because I just graduated, my graduate federal loans are not in repayment until December. I am also currently enrolled in a 6 month temporary payment reduction plan for my undergraduate loans (currently pay = $300/month). 

Currently, I am paying the minimum balances on the accounts, but I understand that in the long-term this is not ideal. And in 6 months when my temporary undergrad loans go back up to their full repayment min of ~$800 and my federal loans kick in (still figuring out which payment plan is best, advice accepted), I feel like I'm drowning just thinking about it. 
I already live on a student food budget and try to limit my ""going out"" and extra expenses to almost nothing. Right now, I'm barely breaking even with my monthly expenses equalling about $1600 (including paying only the min payments on all accounts).

personalfinance,ELI40: personal finance tips to make best use of your assets (US),"Final(ish) installment of the simple lifestage tips using US examples, this assumes you read [ELI18](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tfc76/eli18_personal_finance_tips_for_young_adults_us/), [ELI22](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tlqsd/eli22_personal_finance_tips_for_older_young/), and [ELI30](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uoycd/eli30_personal_finance_tips_for_thirtysomething/).  

About the ""ELI40"" designation.  While you can use this info before or after 40, employment income growth often starts to taper off then.  If you have ~$50,000 or more in savings outside of retirement / house savings, put it to work for you.  (You can put less to work; it just won't get much done.)   Without trying to replicate /r/financialindependence,  your options include:    

- [Rewritten for clarity] Let's first make sure your retirement funds are adequate.  For example:  to sustainably generate a median ~50k today's-dollars household income just from investments in your mid-60's, you'd need $1M+ in retirement assets.   If at age 30 you (yourself, or household) have close to $100,000 in tax-advantaged retirement assets (401k, IRA, etc), you are on track for that $1M+.  That's a lot for people who might have been in school longer, or had to repay loans.  A checkpoint at age 40 is somewhere near $250,000.  If you want that income but your savings are considerably lower, consider adjusting your retirement contributions  before doing other types of investments.  If you have different goals and assumptions, then your checkpoints would be different, and perhaps lower.

- As you start [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing) for shorter-term goals, you need to understand types of financial assets, types of income, and how they are taxed.   Government and corporate [bonds](http://money.cnn.com/pf/money-essentials-bonds/) are loans that pay you interest and eventually return your principal, much like bank accounts or CDs.  Equities aka [stocks](http://money.cnn.com/pf/money-essentials-stocks/) give you an ownership share in a private company, providing current income from [dividends](http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/investing_stocks.moneymag/index3.htm) as well as potential price appreciation.  Each has its advantages.

- Stocks and bonds pay current income, and have a resale value  based on how the company is perceived for stocks, and what interest rates are doing for bonds; bonds lose value when interest rates rise.  Stock prices changes up or down of 10%  in a week and 50%  in a year are common.  Bonds are more stable; less than 10%/year is more typical.  Stocks are usually valued more for their future price growth, called [capital gains](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-capital-gains-are-taxed.html), whereas bonds are valued for their income and stability.   Stocks historically provide better overall returns than bonds, at higher risk.  Not everybody is happy seeing the value of their stocks go down 20% for a while, but it's part of the deal. 

- You buy and sell shares of stock from people who want to do the opposite transaction.  Who's right?  Statistically, most people are [bad](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/individual-investors-are-destroying-their-wealth-2012-10-19) at buying and selling stocks.    [Professional investors](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/almost-no-one-can-beat-the-market-2013-10-25) are not any better than average, either.  Can you win trading stocks?  Sure.  You could be smart, or you could be lucky.  But you probably won't be both over an extended period of time.  If you want to try your luck, do it with a small percentage (~5%) of your investments.  

- We  reduce our risk of being wrong by investing in [mutual funds](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/mutual-funds/what-are-mutual-funds).  We pay a fee to own shares of a fund that gains or loses value based on the stocks it owns.  (There are also bond funds.)   The funds that statistically offer the best gains at the lowest risk with the lowest cost are know as [index funds](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-things-you-might-not-know-about-index-funds-2015-08-26); these blindly invest in all shares meeting a given criteria, not trying to pick only ""undervalued"" stocks.  It sounds crazy, but  it works better than other alternatives, with [lower fees](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/pricing_services/understanding_fees/portfolio_management), making [John Oliver ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvZSpET11ZY) happy.  Lower fees always helps you.  Investing in a few different index funds provides potential gains at lower risk of steep price drops.  You create a [portfolio](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/portfolio.asp) of investments; the selection of investment types is determined by your [asset allocation](http://money.cnn.com/pf/money-essentials-asset-allocation/).   The so-called [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) uses index funds of US stocks, international stocks, and bonds to provide high expected growth and lowest [volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)).  The target date fund we introduced in ELI22 uses more stocks when you are younger to get better long-term growth, moving to bonds as you  near retirement age to protect against large losses.

- To invest this way, you open an account with Vanguard, Fidelity or Schwab as you would with an IRA, but you designate it as a taxable account.  You give them money to invest it in your choice of index funds.  There's no limit to this; you can invest hundreds of thousands of dollars this way.  You don't try to [time the market](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-market-timing-doesnt-work-2013-10-23) by selling out based on market changes, because you are probably wrong about that.  Your account will pay you dividends on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis, which will be reported as taxable income at a favorable tax rate.  When you do decide you want the money for some other reason, you will sell some of your funds, and pay capital gains tax on the difference between what you paid for the fund and what you sell it for.  This is also at favorable tax rates.  

And that's the basics of how to invest your spare cash in the stock market, where you can expect to make up to ~30% or lose up to ~15% of your money in any given year; the long-term average is usually about 6% after inflation, but it can take a decade to realize that average.  There are many, many more aspects to consider, including how to save taxes with [capital losses](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-losses-can-help-cut-your-tax-bill.aspx), how to be  [tax-efficient](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/The-Importance-of-Tax-Efficient-Investing), and when to use [Exchange-Traded Funds](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/).  But you know enough to be make money (and be dangerous...) now.

Financial assets are not the only thing you can invest in.  Let's do a brief overview of the most popular alternative investment, that being real estate held for rental or resale.

-  Real estate provides current income as well as price appreciation (or loss) potential.  Unlike financial investments, real estate has significant ongoing management and maintenance cost and effort, with some favorable tax treatment and [leverage](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/leverage-what-it-and-how-it-works.asp) potential to counterbalance that.  

- You invest in real estate by buying something that someone wants to sell.  The hope is you choose wisely.  You look for a property with either good rental income potential, or good resale potential.  (Possibly both.)   Note that this may not be the same as a house you might want to live in; it could be a cheaper multifamily building, for example. You provide a down payment and take out a loan as with a residential property, though your [financing](https://www.biggerpockets.com/real-estate-investing/financing) won't usually be as favorable in terms of down payment, credit and rates.  You'll be responsible for the mortgage, taxes, insurance and repairs while you own it.  Now for rental, you find renters who will pay you to live there on an ongoing basis, or for resale, you improve the property to make it more valuable for a quick profit on subsequent sale. 

- If you rent the property, you are a landlord, congratulations!  There are many [legal responsibilities](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/real-estate-series-part-ii-what-is-a-landlord-responsible-for) of being a landlord, in terms of how you decide who to rent to, how you handle maintenance, and what you can do regarding evictions.  Many investors use a [property management](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/landlord-hire-property-management-company-29885.html) company to handle details of finding renters and managing the property, at a fee of perhaps 10% of rent.  You will also have to pay for repairs (sometimes immediately), maintenance and your ongoing financing.  Your rental income is taxable to you as Schedule E income, but you can deduct almost all of your costs, including interest, taxes, maintenance, management fees, etc.  You also deduct [depreciation](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060815/how-rental-property-depreciation-works.asp), which means the tax code thinks your building is losing value, although you hope it is not.  

- When you resell the property, you hope that it has increased in price; you take this as [capital gains](http://homeguides.sfgate.com/capital-gains-rules-investment-property-1966.html) if you own the property for more than a year, or as business income if you are [flipping houses](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/money-guides/tax-consequences-of-flipping-real-estate-1.aspx).    If you kept your down payment small and your rent covered your ongoing costs, it's possible to leverage a small down payment into a good ongoing return at low tax rate.  You may even use your returns to invest in more rental property.   The downside of real estate investment centers around the [tenants](http://www.moneycrashers.com/deal-with-bad-tenants/); they can miss payments, damage the property, or have to be evicted, which reduces your rate of return.

- Note that it is possible to rent just a subset of a building; this is how you handle [renting out rooms](http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2015/04/09/7-things-to-remember-before-renting-out-a-room) in your residence, for example.  Many of the same income, tax and landlord consideration come into play.  You take a deduction on the [expenses](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) of the portion of the house you rent out.  

So, there we have a couple of alternatives for you to invest your hard-earned money.   You could also [start your own business](https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/how-start-business/10-steps-starting-business), invest in [collectibles](https://www.thestreet.com/story/13269749/1/7-collectibles-that-arent-completely-worthless.html), make [peer-to-peer loans](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-income-investors-should-consider-peer-to-peer-lending-2015-12-29); lots of possibilities for self-study!  Let's cover a few other topics that I seem to have promised along the way, or that seem like a good thing to cover in this issue:

- [Selling your primary residence](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/mortgages-real-estate/08/home-seller-mistakes-selling-house.asp) is a complicated process, either taking your time and money, or the costs of real estate broker, who might then claim 5%+ of your sale price.  You want to price the property correctly, negotiate the sales contract carefully, and figure out where you will go after the sale.  You might even be making an offer on a new house [contingent on the sale](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp) of the old one.  The good news is that any gains on the sale of a primary residence are [free of capital gains taxes](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/Home-Ownership/Tax-Aspects-of-Home-Ownership--Selling-a-Home/INF12035.html) up to $250,000 (or $500,00 for a couple).  You could instead hold onto your old house and rent it for investment purposes, which means you lose that tax break.  Since you probably didn't buy your house  thinking it was an attractive [rental property](http://www.moneyunder30.com/why-your-house-is-not-an-investment), it may be too expensive to make this a good use of your money, though; your mortgage may also not allow you to do this legally.  

- Investing for college is another complicated topic.   State-run [529 plans](http://www.savingforcollege.com/intro_to_529s/what-is-a-529-plan.php) allow  college savings to accumulate tax-free as with an IRA, but with no a priori limit on contributions, so you can invest in these at any time.   You can only use 529 plan balances to pay for higher education, so if your child/children don't go to college or don't need all the money because they chose a low-cost school, then you'll owe taxes and be penalized at 10% of any gains not used for education.  529 plans may provide breaks on state income taxes.  There are various ways to optimize how 529 plans are treated in terms of FAFSA/ financial aid; for example, if a [grandparent](http://www.savingforcollege.com/grandparents/) establishes a 529 plan, then this is not counted as parental assets.   529's are not your only option; you could invest generically, perhaps using a [Roth IRA to pay for college expenses](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/3-reasons-to-use-a-roth-ira-to-save-for-college-2015-03-25) without paying taxes or penalties.

Speaking of helping / being helped by family members, here are some general tips to be aware of regarding family transactions:

- There is almost never any ""[gift tax](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-federal-gift-tax.html)"" on any transaction, either to giver or recipient, whether or not they exceed $14K annually.  You just need to do more paperwork as the giver of over $14k gifts, and it may reduce your eventual $5M estate tax exemption.  So, for most people, not an issue.  Give freely, and receive without anxiety.

- Inheritances have some [unique tax treatment](http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/wills-trusts/must-pay-income-tax-inherited-money.html).  You don't owe any federal taxes on inheritances of money or property.  Free money...unless you are in one of the six states with an inheritance tax, but even then, you probably aren't affected.  (Along with gifts, these are separate property even if the recipient is married.)   If you receive a house or stock, the basis of the investment is the fair market value of the property at the time of death, which means you can sell these without owing taxes.  If you [inherit a retirement plan](https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/inherited-ira/learn-about-your-choices) like an IRA, then you will be taxed on distributions, though.  

- Sometimes we advise younger people to get a co-signer for apartments, cars and student loans.  This is good for the person who you are co-signing for.  For you?  Not so much.  Co-signing is actually a [huge risk](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/debt/reasons-not-to-co-sign-loan.aspx).  You could be on the hook for $100,000 of student loans if your ungrateful child decides they don't want to repay them.  Not fun.  You should never co-sign for any amount that you wouldn't be comfortable gifting instead.  

This concludes the planned series;  I hope you have enjoyed it. If there is enough demand for other topics, either more advanced ones (estate planning, establishing a corporation, ""stupid tax tricks"" like mega-back-door IRAs), or ways to deal with adversity (collections, defaults, bankruptcy, divorce, etc), let me know and maybe we can put something together.

ethereum,My problem with ETH and the DEV team. Thoughts?,"Alright... Now I'm going to be very clear, I do not want to see ETH die nor do I think its a scam by any means... But hear me out and I would love your thoughts.

We have been on the forefront of the future with ETH, I understand there will be problems that arise that could not have been predicted, on the other hand the TWO major problems; DAO, ETC ( Ill explain why ETC is a problem later on.) Have been *""insider trading opportunities""* for the devs. 

    :engage tinfoil hat: 

Take the **DAO**, the number one crowdfunded project in history is hugely backed by the ETH team... This to me was one of the huge mistakes from the get go/Conflict of interest *if you will*. The recursive attack is discovered, and blatantly ignored... Attack is carried out, ETH price dumps... Devs shorted and then proceeded to figure out how they could bail out and return the money and also ""fix"" the replay attack.

Devs, KNOW there is going to be two block chains... knew about ETC coming about and told exchanges to tell everyone to move their ETH into a wallet outside to ensure there would be no ""problems"" ... but in all actuality it was to keep the insiders money pumping. Coinbase for instance just got a replay attack, but had a cold wallet of millions ETC... All exchanges knew about this, and to make it even more clear we were given leaks of devs talking about dumping ETC to make profit...

The *hardfork* and the **problem** they haven't addressed.
With the survival of the first block chain, and lets be real the devs were fully aware this would happen... we now are presented with another problem, **another Hardfork** ... Yes you read that right ETH or ETC will indeed need to hardfork again, and my money is on ETH simply because ETC will absolutely stray away from the HF option. When this HF happens we will see another dip, and possibly three separate chains with another money grab for the devs. 

The more and more I look into this the more I feel the dev team is not being as transparent as they promised, I purpose we dig into this deeper and possibly look into finding a better solution to these issues... Or I am certain that ETH with become as corrupt as the federal reserve. 

TLDR: All issues with ETH have been insider trading moves that has made the DEVS alot of money.",cryptocurrency,1469630961

I have a good bit of student loans whereas husband doesn't have much. My student loan payments total $815 a month, my husband's total $36 a month. We recently bought a car with both of us on the loan at $225 a month. We do not have any credit card debt or any other debt--the car loan &amp; student loans are it. We do not currently have a mortgage; we are renting.

Our new mortgage will be between $490-$510 a month (based on the interest rate we get). This does not include taxes &amp; insurance.

No other banks have mentioned this to us, but one guy said that it might be better for me to be left off the loan (but not off the title of the house) when we do a loan. The median score of my three credit scores is 740, whereas the median score for my husband is 792. 

My debt to income ratio is clearly higher than his. How does DTI affect credit score? How does DTI affect mortgage interest rate? What is the benefit if only he is on the mortgage loan, and I am left off? What is the downside to that?",finance,1469637301

personalfinance,Still confused on benefits of Traditional 401k over Roth 401k,"I've read the [Roth or Traditional](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) wiki post and have researched this to an extent, but am still having a hard time understanding how a traditional 401k could be more advantageous over a Roth 401k in the long run.


Super-simple theoretical example and assumptions:


* Paying 25% tax today and expect to pay 15% tax at retirement (I made these up)
* Starting principal: $0
* Contributions: $15,000/year for 40 years = $600k
* Interest rate: 6%
* Principal at retirement: ~$2.5M (via compounded interest)


**Traditional 401k**

* Save $150k ($600k x 25%) on contributions
* Pay $375k in taxes during retirement ($2.5M x 15%)
* Difference: **-$225k**


**Roth 401k**

* Pay $150k ($600k x 25%) on contributions
* Save $375k in taxes during retirement ($2.5M x 15%)
* Difference: **+$225k**


Let me know if the math is oversimplified to the point that I'm missing something obvious.. it seems to me that the power of having all Roth 401k earnings tax-free greatly outweighs any taxes I pay on the contributions ($600k in contributions is less than a quarter of the $2.5M principal in retirement). The guidance I see is that you should contribute to a tax-deferred account if you believe you'll pay less in taxes in retirement - my example seems to prove otherwise.

I waited a year to work and save money for a used car, when i bought my car i used a 1k loan to help pay for it. a week after i got it the head gaskets were leaking. 1500 to fix. that screwed my plan up entirely. Now I have about 2500 in debt and maybe 400 bucks to my name, and lost my job.

For college, My parents cannot really assist me. i already did my Fafsa and got as many grants and scholarships i could. It will only pay for about 5000 towards college a year. yearly tuition is about 17k With room and board.

That leaves 12k that the ""financial adviser"" told me that ill just have to come up with somehow. My parents make too much money to get more aid but not enough to help me pay.

so that's
*no current income

*2500 in debt

*5k in aid

*17k as yearly tuition

*pretty good credit (high 700)

The only bills I currently have to pay is my insurance and credit bill. which total is about 120 a month.

I dont want to blow this huge opportunity.  I have a terrible history of blowing tons of money and ending up with nothing to show for it.  Mostly hobbies that die out after a few years leaving a ton of things that are worth a fraction of their original value.



So I have started using YNAB and i'm actually nerding out at an unbelievable rate on this budget.  It's really taken a solid hold on my finances, and I havent overdrawn my checking account since I started using YNAB.  I want to continue this practice into my new salary.  I'm confident I can continue this way but I'm unsure how to conquer my debt, while still contributing a large amount to my 401k.




The new job is contracted work, so I formed an LLC as S Corp for my business, and found an amazing tax company that gives me access to a team of people to handle all my taxes, form the llc, handle my payroll and everything else associated with bookkeeping.

Now that I've gotten that novel out of the way, here is where I'm asking for help.

I want to kill this debt.  I want to smash it with a gigantic hammer into a billion pieces as fast as I possibly can.

I also want to contribute as much as I can possibly afford into my 401, as I can contribute a huge amount now with an LLC.  Obviously I wont be able to afford to contribute the full ~50k but I would like to put a large chunk away monthly.

How do I balance my investments with my debt.

Should I only invest a small amount initially until I can plow through this debt?  I'm going from a net income of ~2000 a month to somewhere around 6k 

I've already written a novel and I'm unsure how much additional information will be needed.  I dont know what the bills will be like at the new house, but it will be all the above bills plus


$1500 Rent


$175 Accountants

~$600 in monthly utilities I'm guessing



How aggressive should I be with this debt?  The interest is insane and I would like to bring my horrible credit score up to a reasonable amount with in a few years so I can buy a home in the new location.

First time making a huge post like this on reddit and I tried to get the formatting half way decent.

I want part of that loan to maybe put some away incase I really need it, and if I don't use it, just pay it back. Sounds good in theory. However it's been a real hassle getting emergency funds going. 

So I'm asking, would it be a good idea to take part of it or just take the grant and figure the rest out later?

personalfinance,Student loan refi - federal loans and fixed v. variable,"I have a refi offer from Earnest, and am trying to figure out the best course of action moving forward. I am planning to refinance a lot of student loan debt, particularly to wipe out some private loans with HIGH interest rates - I already know I am going to include those in the refi, so I won't discuss them further.

Where I need help is in determining whether or not I should wrap some federal loans into this refi. I have about $30k from a combination of subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans, across a variety of loan groups that are mostly at 6.8% (a couple are 6%). I know that I lose benefits like IBR plans and loan forgiveness (currently work in public sector job that qualifies), but trying to determine if the savings will be worth it.

The offer from Earnest is 6.18% fixed rate or 4.68% variable for the monthly payment that I can afford (need to keep it the same as what I am currently paying across the various loan providers), and I am considering starting with the variable rate. Earnest allows you to switch between the options every 6 months, though the interest rate is reevaluated.

worldpolitics,Why I won't Vote Trump (Opinion Piece),"There are very simple reasons for the average American voter to not want Donald Trump, the GOP’s nominee to be as far away from the White House as possible. While, I do not personally attain to the belief that one must vote the lesser evil, I also do not attain to the belief that his Democratic opponent is remotely evil. It is difficult for someone in this day to find a person that directly represents their beliefs to an absolute, and the leads to personal compromise of political belief and personal integrity. I grew up in deeply conservative states, cities, and social institutions, but I have personally never seen the Republican party to truly represent my desires, not as closely as the Democratic party has been able to at least. However, growing up in such environments has given me perspective to as why Donald Trump was and continues to be seen as someone that represents the beliefs and interests of some of my fellow Americans, but to me he and his policies are of a mere façade meant to pander to a base of the populace that has disdain for their current situations, primarily rooted in economic qualms. 
	Donald Trump has used, and in my opinion and belief abused the issue of economic misfortune. We as a people must remember that this is a man who is not a self-made billionaire, but instead a man that has had an easy path to the elite global class. A man that has taken for granted his fellow American business men and skirted the obligation his corporations have had with small and medium sized businesses through the use of bankruptcy, and in some cases blatant ignorance. Donald Trump, is the antithesis of self-made, patriotic, or a product of the American Dream, and most importantly, a leader. Donald Trump does not know an ounce of similarity to the struggles that I have known in my life, or does he even try to understand the humility that comes with having to wait till the fourth of the month to be able to eat a decent dinner again. Donald Trump does not know what it is like to truly work for something from the bottom rings, but instead only knows how to buy and con his way to supposed achievement and advancement. Donald Trump, does not know what it is like to have true family values, but what it is like to have a nanny raise his children, and only enjoy times of comfort and spending sprees with his “family”. Trump is not, in my eyes, a man rooted in community, built from his interactions and lessons with those that truly power society, but rather a man that is self-indulgent, cruel, and the epitome of those that have the power, but the disregard to positively change society. 
	I will ultimately not be voting for Donald Trump because I do not believe that he represents me, as a person, as a citizen, or as a mere number. I also do not believe that he is a man fit to represent a nation that with its faults, contributes greatly to the stability of our global community. A man who panders for twitter support, is not a man that will secure our national interests, but instead a man that will degrade and dismantle our livelihoods for self-advancement. America has evolved, and god willing, will continue to evolve to be ever more so evident to the world as a class-act government, and will continue to promote not only national advancement, but global advancement as the world’s leading power. 
	With this evolution, I must return to the focal point of how Donald Trump has been able to construct his public support, the issue of the economy. The global economy is integrated and dependent on the American economy, and both are ever-changing and evolving with every passing minute and day. This is something that I have grown to realize, and that my fellow Americans should understand too. We, as a people, must be ready to be able to adapt to change, and change economically is ever more prominent with the advancements consistently being made. Our technology is developing at an outstanding pace, and that alone will affect our economy more than any trade or protectionist policy incorporated. Our quality and standards of life are higher in desire than they were ten, twenty, or fifty years ago. Our country and its society are ever more prominent than at any point in history. Our military adapts to ever expanding and concerning threats, needs, and desires, all while insuring the defense of American allies and American interests. The United States of America is not only great as it is now, but is consistently addressing its flaws to make sure that it not only remains great, but continues to be the most outstanding role model the world has. 
	I ultimately, in good consciousness, cannot vote for a man that oversimplifies overly complicated issues to pander to a base that is stuck living in desires for a past that built a foundation for the present we live in now, that insures a phenomenal future for our great country. I cannot support someone who has mocked those with disabilities, a man that would have devalued and only judged my mother, my close female friends, my girlfriend, or any female for how they look, and not their abilities, intelligence, and their proficiencies, a man that has broadly discriminated against innocent Americans for their religious affiliations, some friends of mine which fall under such designations, a man who disregards the feelings, beliefs, and needs of communities of differing sexual and gender identities that defy a strongly Christian-Conservative cultural norm, a man that seeks to rip families apart with no regard to the contribution that those parents have made to our country, or the fact that they may have had no option due to America’s history of flaws made south of its border, a man that is absolutely unstable, uneducated, and a misrepresentation of the party of Lincoln, a party that used to stand on moral grounds, a party that sought functional government, a prosperous America, a party that fought for people’s religious rights, limited federal intervention, and a party built to be obligated to the American constitution and to represent people of all creeds and beliefs. 
	With Donald Trump, the country has lost a party that used to attract people to America, a party that when called upon by society was able to contribute to governance. With Trump America is no longer taken as serious as before. Ultimately, I cannot vote for Trump due also to his actions in tainting the American image and vehemently destroying a true pillar of American society. 
	I will however, vote for Hillary Clinton, for the reason that she is the antithesis of Donald Trump. For the reason that she has a history of listening, empathizing, and has made positive impacts on communities. I see optimism and promise in her, where in Donald Trump, I see negativity and pessimism. With Hillary Clinton I see an America that furthers itself positively and continues to lead the world in advancement, productivity, and stability, that is something I do not see in Donald Trump. I hope, that come November we elect a person that can bring back the days of functioning government to our capitol. I hope, that the down ticket races prove to rid our congress of disruptive representatives, and that our country will be able to no longer limp to achievement, but rather accelerated to new heights. Hopes that cannot be achieved with a Trump presidency, but instead hopes that may become reality under a Clinton 45 presidency.",finance,1469663898

Right now I have about $5,500 from last year (in my name), and I'm offered $6,500 from the DoE (through FedLoan), no subsidized interest.

personalfinance,How do I handle my inheritance while considering taxes and current debt?,"My dad passed away in May and I just found out I will be receiving somewhere between $15k-40k in two payments over the next 6 months or so. I have 2 brothers who are getting the same and we aren't sure what to set aside for taxes. I also have a few questions on how I should use my share to save vs managing student loan debt.

**Some Background:**
My dad left everything to our aunt(edit: she is the executer of his estate) who paid for his funeral and has taken care of tracking down all his finances as well as appraising and selling his belongings (no house, and his car is being given to one of my brothers.) I just want to throw it out there that my aunt is honest(and very rich) so she is definitely not trying to gain anything from our ignorance on dealing with inheritance. Basically what I believe is happening is she's getting all of the money (which will be taxed as income for her, from my understanding - correct me if i'm wrong) and splitting it equally between us 3 kids. My brother was saying that you can be 'gifted' something like $14k in a year. I'm not sure if this is true, is a 'gift' considered taxable income? If not, how much would I pay on anything over the gift amount? The reason we are being payed in 2 installments is because his pension isn't being paid out until January, i'm not sure if this will affect any taxes.

**Personal Financial Situation:** 
I'm 26 living in Chicago. I make $41k/year. I have a bachelor's degree, but need to take a few more classes to advance to the higher paying position I want. 
I take home about $2370 a month after taxes/insurance/401k(+match.) 
of that, 1k goes to loans, $500 goes to rent, $260 for transportation, $120 in recurring bills, and the remainder goes to food/misc/seemingly endless dr/dentist bills... I put away $50-$100 a month into a savings account that I keep having to dip into so it only has about $200 in it. I have about $95k left in loans total, most of which are private. I keep deferring my federal loans because I don't make enough to pay them right now. I don't have a credit card, so no cc debt. My main question is- is it smart for me to put aside 3-5k for emergency, use about $3000 for classes I need, and use the rest to pay off loans? Or is saving more and paying slightly more than necessary on my loans each month better? Im worried that if I put it all straight into my loans without a safety net, I might hit hard times in the future and get behind on payments. Any help is greatly appreciated.

TL;DR I'm getting inheritance, I don't understand how it will be taxed. I also have a lot of loan debt and I'm not sure how to use this money to benefit me most.",finance,1469676935
personalfinance,At what point would it be acceptable for me to quit my job to focus on my business?,"I spend $12k a year on everything. Rent, bills, fun, etc. ~$1k a month.

I am on track to make $12k profit a year from my business this year (twice what I made last year). My business is selling handmade costume accessories online and at events.

Short term, I actually make more money from running my business and working at fedex, but doing both means I have less time to grow my business.

personalfinance,[RO] Should I be paying off my mortgage sooner?,"So I've only recently stumbled upon /r/personalfinance and after reading some of the posts it got me thinking.  
  
I'm from Romania so the numbers will probably look unusually small to you guys but bear with me.  
  
So I've recently bought an apartment for about the equivalent of 46,5K euros. I had about 15k for for the down payment from family funds + my own savings over the years (I'm 28 btw).  
So I ended up loaning about 33K euros from the bank.  
  
Now the plan that I had put together was the following:  
My brother and I would live together in this apartment for a while and he'd help me pay the mortgage off early and then I'd later pay him back.  
Both our salaries are around 1000 euros/month, and we decided to each contribute about 500 euros/month to paying this thing.  
By our calculations that would mean that the whole thing would be paid in about 3 years if the interest rate doesn't go crazy off the charts or something.  
  
Now I haven't done the math exactly, but I imagine I'm saving a lot of money in the long run by not paying the bank interest for more than 3 years as opposed to paying just the mandatory monthly sum of about 200 euros for 15 years.  
  
The bank's annual interest rate is currently 4%. It's a variable interest rate composed of a fixed 2.5% + something given by some economic indicator that's related to the buying power of the Romanian currency (Simplistically if the RON goes up that thin goes down and vice versa) .  
But from what I understand this number is a record low and it's expected to rise in the following years.  
  
My question is basically this:  
Is it a good idea to live kinda frugally like this, paying of the apartment early or is there something I could be doing with my money that would be even more efficient in the long run?",finance,1469692502

personalfinance,Student loan: repay or milk the credit?,"I'm working on saving money to buy a house, and I know how important it will be to have good credit to establish a good interest rate on the mortgage.  One form of credit I have is my current student loan.  My question is: Is it wise to keep doing monthly payments on my loan in order to keep that ""line of credit"" open as long as possible vs. just paying it off?  


Some details:


The biggest knock on my credit score is that I only have 2 (now 3) accounts open.  I opened a new credit card a month or so ago for the cash back incentive, and to have a 3rd line of credit.


My time line for buying a house is 2-3 years.  I currently have a pair of credit cards and a student loan that work to build my credit (between 750 and 800 currently).  


My loan can be repaid (comfortably) in about 6-8 months, if I really wanted to.  If I do $100 payments, I can milk it out to about 36 months.  The difference in interest between the two options is about $250 total, which seems negligible in terms of the interest I could potentially save on a mortgage by getting a better interest rate, even if its just a couple tenths of a percent. 


I expect (perhaps foolishly) that my credit will go over 800 with a 3rd account open.  Getting it higher than that, even for buying a house, seems unnecessary.  What do you think, reddit?",finance,1469711314
stocks,ELI5: How Your Stocks Get Taxed (an Explanation of Capital Gains Taxes),"Hello all,
A common question I often see pop up on this sub, is ""how do my stocks get taxed?"" In simplest ELI5 terms, I'm going to try to explain. 

**Am I taxed when I purchase the stock?** No, you are not taxed on the *purchase* of a stock. When you buy a stock, the money you use to buy it is from *post-tax income.* You've already paid your dues to Uncle Sam at this point. You'll (possibly) pay a commission to your broker, but no tax. 

So, here's what you need to know, there are two kinds of capital gains taxes to be aware of, and note, they only occur **at the sale of the stock:** 

* **Short Term Capital Gains Tax:** Stock is purchased and sold within one year. *This is treated as ordinary taxable income, equal to your federal income tax rate.* 

* **Long Term Capital Gains Tax:** Stock is purchased and sold after one year and one day. *Depending on your income bracket, the gain will be taxed at 0, 15%, or 19.6%.* 

Confused? Let's go through some scenarios here to see how these taxes are applied: 

On January 1, 2016. Jimmy buys 200 shares of $MTCH at a value of $5 per share. **Jimmy starts with $1,000 in stock value.** Let us assume that Jimmy has a federal income tax rate of 28% and a long-term capital gains rate of 15%. 

Scenario|Date|Shares|Share Price|Total Gain|Tax Rate|**Net Gain (Less Capital Gains)**|
--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
Jimmy purchases the stock|1/1/2016 (Purchase)|200|$5|$0|N/A|**$0**|
Jimmy sells the stock six months in after share price goes up to $15|7/1/2016 (Sale)|200|$15|+$2,000|Short Term (28%)|**$1,440**|
Jimmy sells the stock a year and a day later after share price goes up to $15|1/2/2017 (Sale)|200|$15|+$2,000|Long Term (15%)|**$1,700**|
Jimmy sells the stock a year and a day later after it goes up $20|1/2/2017 (Sale)|200|$20|+$3,000|Long Term (15%)|**$2,550**|

The moral of the story here, is that good things come for those who wait when it comes to Capital Gains taxes. If Jimmy had sold his $MTCH portfolio at $15 a share on 1/2/2017 instead of 7/1/2016, he would have paid $260 less in taxes! 

Hope this helps as a basic explanation.",finance,1469711756

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans,"Within the last couple of years, I've graduated with my four year degree and started working in my career of choice. As I still live with my parents, my bills and the like have been relatively low, and I've been shoving as much as I can into a savings account every paycheck. I'm currently paying $300 a month (which is more than minimum) on my student loans and $400 a month (again, more than the minimum) on my car loan. In addition to this I'm paying about $300-$400 in other various necessary expenses a month (cell phone, car insurance, putting gas in the car, etc). I bring in roughly $3,000 a month after taxes.

I currently have just over $5,000 remaining unpaid on my student loans. I have a little over $13,000 in my savings account. Is it more prudent for me to pay off the remainder of my student loans in one lump sum from my savings account, or continue to make payments on a monthly basis as I have been? I've heard arguments made for either one as the better option: on the one hand I can pay it off and not have to worry about it again, but on the other hand, the interest I pay off is a tax deduction. What is the better option here?

I pull in $1700/month in income, and my monthly expenses (including $200 towards my emergency fund) are roughly $1100. My emergency fund is at $1400 right now, and I have a short term goal of saving $5000 (which at my current rate of saving, will take a couple years, providing there is no emergency). The remaining $600 goes to food, gas, cell phone, and whatever little 'fun' money I have left. 

As I'm losing so much money of my monthly payment towards interest, would it be worth it to only put $100/month towards my emergency fund and throw an extra hundred towards my loans? Or should I stop putting money in my emergency fund for now and pay off $355/month towards my loans? 

The thought of not contributing to my emergency fund makes me uneasy, but I'm getting sick of losing so much money to interest. I already live very frugally - I have a roommate, a modest car in good condition (2009 toyota), cheaper cell phone plan, and I don't eat out a lot.

&gt; If you are either a citizen or legal resident of the United States **and enable your account for margin before September 26, 2016,** margin rates are increasing for Average Daily Debit Balances less than $250,000. The margin rates for Average Daily Debit Balances of $250,000 or more will remain the same. The new margin interest rates will be based on the following:

The key thing here is that depending whether you activated margin on your account before or after Sept 26, your rates are drastically different, with those whose accounts were activated *after* 9/26 having interest rates 2% lower or even more.

This makes zero sense to me, and when I called them the customer service was completely unable to explain it. They had no more insight into the reasoning behind the policy than I did.

Has anyone got any insight into this, or seen this happen before? Can I simply deactivate margin on my account, then reactivate it after 9/26? Why would they institute a policy rewarding new customers and punishing long-time customers?",finance,1469720121
personalfinance,Using credit card for purchases while paying it off?,"I'm working on getting my finances and credit in order, and one of the big steps I'm taking is paying down my credit card balances.

I'm paying them down, and I have enough open credit on them now that I could use them for some recurring expenses my family has.

We spend $300 biweekly on groceries.  We've been doing this straight out of the checking account, but now that I have the room on the credit cards, I'm wondering if it would be useful to use the credit cards for the actual shopping and pay that $300 from the checking account to the card on the same day, to earn the rewards.  In addition to the regular payments I'm working on reducing the balance with.

OK so the actual question then: Normally I would have most of this money invested, like that's the smart thing to do with it. And from what I've been reading you can generally expect about a 5% return on the kind of pretty safe investments that someone like me should be making. So it seems to me that if I have a mortgage with an interest rate of less than 5%, the smarter thing to do is pay as little as possible in a down payment since I would make more having it invested than I would lose in interest on the debt.

personalfinance,Can I lower my AGI with a retirement account?,"The point is to lower my student loan payments.  I'm in repayment on my student loan.  I've got the plan set up already, so don't worry about that.  I'm just wondering if I can lower my payments.  Each year my payments are recalculated.

The recalculation is based off my federal income tax adjusted gross income.  (Yes, I take off my max for student loan interest payments.  That's capped at $2,500 I think.  That's maxed and capped already though.)  Then I read you can lower your AGI on a post on here.  That can be lowered through things like loan interest payments, money spent on classes, charitable contribution, retirement accounts, etc.  Retirement accounts sounded reasonable.

I'm thinking if I make a retirement account that money is locked away but becomes mine when I retire.  That could lower my student loan payments right now though, along with lowering federal income tax and state income tax too.  The money disappears now, so why not throw it into my own future instead of paying it to the government, right?

Questions/additional info....
Is that possible?
I don't have any retirement plan options with my job, so this would be setting up a retirement account on my own.
I have some money saved up, so what I'm thinking is that I'll put money directly into a retirement account myself, from my checking account.  Work doesn't have any kind of retirement options to have it deducted/matched from my paycheck.  Can I just find a bank (any bank ok?) stick some money from my checking account in, deduct that to generate my AGI, and then my student loan payments are lowered a bit (my loan payments are calculated based on my AGI) and federal and state taxes are lower also.

By doing this, I'm thinking $1,000 this year.  Maybe a $1,000 each year.  It' better than nothing.  I'm on the IBR (income base repayment) plan so I suppose it only saves 15% of that, but still... It's 15% saved.  It's just that it's locked away until retirement.  I think I could survive and get by with locking away some amount of money each year though.  Plus, there's the satisfaction of knowing that I'm keeping that money instead of handing it over to the government.  (Yes, I've read some student loan posts and articles.  I'm still on the fence overall.  It does seem like money I'm paying into my student loan is just throwing it into the government void though.  I've been screwed over in previous years on what my loan repayments should have actually been but that's locked in the past now.  Money paid is in gone forever.  I can't get it back even if I am actually right and did what the student loan place told me to do for payments.  So in this case, now, I don't feel so bad sticking money in my own retirement account for sole purpose of lowering my student loan payments).

Don't bother so much with info on student loans.  I'm halfway through now.  I'm not changing that.  The only control I have over my loan situation is my AGI for when they calculate my next 12 months of loan repayments.  So why not keep that money in a retirement account for me instead of throwing it away to the government?  (The government does waste a lot of money.  I'm watching what I spend, and some months are ok, some are less ok.  I'm still on the fence about borrowing and agreeing to what I did for the loan but I have a feeling the price of college classes got super inflated.  I was partway through a degree and decided to stick it out and complete the degree, even though the cost was at least five times higher than what I anticipated.  I've calculated out what I'll pay by the end and it seems fair enough to me.  About a fifth of the entire loan will be repaid but that amount is still a lot.  I'm sick of having this thing over my head, and I'm sick of watching monthly spending be ok some months, less ok other months.  Money, esp. this loans, seems much less real than it used to with the way it's inflated.)

So... Can I lower my AGI if I get some kind of retirement account opened and stick some money in that?  Can I just open a retirement account with a bank, add in some amount, and have that deducted from my AGI?  Is there a limit on how my you can deduct for AGI in terms of retirement accounts?  I hit the max on the student loan interest and found out there's a limit on that.

Again, I don't feel that bad about thinking this way.  My loan payments were a bit miscalculated in the past.  I did everything I was supposed to, but once the money is paid in, they don't give it back.  It doesn't matter who's right or if they gave me the wrong info.  It's done.  It's in the past.

And then, any tips on a retirement account?  I've heard of 401K's but don't really know what they are.  I'm in my 30's.  Squat for retirement.  I'm just recovering from a botched career path I was hoping going back to school would help me recover from.  (It didn't really, but left with this stupid student loan debt.

personalfinance,(CAN) Whole life insurance as a reduced-tax investment option for a non-citizen?,"I'm a permanent resident in Canada, and my TFSA limit is pretty low (maxed). Our new financial advisor suggested we get Whole Life Insurance. I wanted to get a second opinion, since Whole Life seems to be a VERY unpopular option on this sub. (I read a bunch of threads about this and the FAQ)

The advisor suggested putting in 5k/year for my husband (Canadian citizen), and 20k/year for myself. This is the table of guaranteed values projected dividends for a [25k/year premium](http://i.imgur.com/nEFEpDx.png). We'd probably only put 5k and 15k. The guaranteed value basically only breaks after around 20 years, and there's a projected un-guaranteed dividend on that.

Together we make about 145k before taxes. No debts or mortgages. We own our condo. We have little cash savings (80k). We're 25 &amp; 26, healthy, don't have kids, and no plans for future kids, but if  I accidentally end up pregnant we'd keep the baby (we're doing our best to avoid pregnancy). We'd want to cash out the life insurance for our retirement, additional to our RSSPs. We're not really interested in the ""life insurance"" part of it, we just wanted a safe and passive low-tax investment on the side.

We don't have any other investments except 2 TFSA, my husbands RSSP (3% +3match), and 2 non registered mutual funds. Altogether maybe 50k. I'll get an RSSP soon.

I asked about management fees, and he said ""There are no actual fees charged to the client for the investment portion. The cost of investing is built into the yearly premium for the 20 years of payment. Great West Life does not charge additional fees to manage the investments, as they're managed by GLC Asset Management (owned by GWL). Since they own this investment corporation, there are no additional fees for the investment. Check out their [website](http://www.glc-amgroup.com/index.html).""

For taking out a loan, the interest rate is ""normally around 5% compounded annually."" But we'd probably take a loan from my family instead, if ever needed. They're middle class, it is unlikely that I'd need to provide for my parents/sister in the future (only if for some reason they lose all their savings or something unfortunate happens, god forbid).

Another thing the advisor brought up is that the tax laws regarding this are changing at the end of the year, and he suggests signing up asap.

He's a friend of a friend of a friend, he's our age but seems knowledgable because of his family (also investors). Seems like a nice guy.

The university withholds taxes from our salaries automatically when teaching, but doesn't do that for fellowships, so I know I'll need to pay estimated taxes and have calculated the amount.

Unfortunately, I've missed the deadlines for the first two payments, but since I've had taxes withheld for the first half of the year, that would cover the amount I owed if I use the actual withholding method; in fact, the amount of that withholding works out to more than what my first and second quarterly payments would have been. For state taxes, it looks like I should be OK applying the extra withholding to reduce my payments later in the year. But for federal taxes, I'm a bit confused about how much I actually need to pay in the remaining quarters.

So, that essentially ended up happening the beginning of the year of 2015, and we have been doing OK since then.  We knew we would have to tighten our belts and we could make it work.  

My previous employer had a 3% matched 401k, and I switched jobs in November of 2015, and moved to a new position at another company.  The new employer, however, does not have a 401k match program yet, so my previous employer 401k is still stagnant and I need to figure out what to do with it.

Currently we are at 3.9% interest rate on the mortgage, and we got an FHA loan and are locked into PMI.

Some numbers:

Age: 29

Salary $80,000 base + bonus (maximum of 20% annually)

Expenses: $4800 (this includes monthly $200 contribution to emergency fund - basically any remaining dollars) - All credit cards and at least minimum payments contributed are accounted for in the budget.

CC Debt: ~$27k


Since we have purchased our home, it has appreciated nearly $50k.  We owe ~$220k on the mortgage, but other homes in our neighborhood with the same floorplan have recently appraised in the $280k range.

Our predicament:
I could withdraw the 401k which nets me 5760.41 and I would get hit with another $1080 in taxes end of year.

What this will get me will allow me to pay down debts to get my credit score hopefully at least to 740 and we want to refinance the house to get out of PMI, but if my credit score is at 740, we will get a lower interest rate than we have now + lose PMI (~$300/mo.).

If we refinance the home, and it appraises what we are hoping to get, the closing costs would already have been accounted for after about 5 months without PMI and we can use the extra saved money monthly to continue chipping away at this credit card debt, and be completely CC free.  I would need to start a new 401k if my new employer offers it beginning of next year.

Is withdrawing the 401k worth paying down CC debts and getting family in a better situation by saving $300/mo from no PMI and dropping 1/8 or 1/4 of a point on interest of the mortgage?  Is the opportunity cost that high on a 401k @ $7200 to move into an IRA rather than doing this?  I can't seem to crunch the numbers to come to a solid conclusion.",finance,1469772633

personalfinance,Structuring an emergency fund,"I just got a job in the bay area, and I'm trying to set up an emergency fund. My monthly expenses are around $3500, mostly due to outrageous rent prices so I figure I'll need at least $10,000. I currently have $5,000 saved. My problem is that this is a lot of money to be putting in a savings account with abysmal interest rates.

As an alternative to allocating money into my savings account each month, I was considering using my 401k as the second tier of my emergency fund. I understand that the general wisdom is that this is a bad idea due to the 10% penalty for early withdrawal, but let me explain. My employer provides a 50% match up to the 18k maximum. Since I just started this job, I am not going to be able to feasibly put away that much money this year anyway. So given my current income tax, the math about works out such that every $100 I put into a savings account could have been $240 in my 401k including the employer match.

Given that I am currently paying the highest state taxes in the country, have solid 401k benefits, and have a fair amount of money tucked away for immediate use, is it really that crazy to invest my remaining savings and actually be able to make money on it?",finance,1469778321
personalfinance,My experience: Today is the day I consolidate my credit card debt.,"Wanting to tell my story on here so hopefully someone else might take some helpful tips or get scared off from making bad financial choices. If this violates rules et me know, though I have already read them.

Over the past couple of years I have accumulated credit card debt of about $7500. Initially it started as a $2200 interest-free amount of which I paid off $1000 over 6 months. Everything was 'coming up Milhouse' as they say. 

So I ended up having a bit of a breakdown (severe anxiety, mild depression) and had to leave work for a time. I had to go back to a psychologist as I had never had anxiety like that before and had to learn how to manage it. My plan was to put the upfront payment of $160 on the card, then use the rebate of $130+own money to pay it off before it gained too much interest. This worked until I had a LOT of extra expenses/bills come in for one month and literally did not have the extra money to pay it off. This is when I started falling into what I call the 'cycle' where I couldn't even afford food so had to put it on the card. Then I would pay off what I could, then have no money left so had to put things on the card again. As I was making things stretch and with what I was spending on the card I estimated I owed about $5000 which I was worried about but I was looking into reworking my budget and planning on how I could save to make extra repayments off it. 

This was about 1 year ago and around this time I had to leave town for a few days. I had my tickets paid for and where I was staying booked through a discount site with 50% payment (they only accepted full payment at check-in). This now becomes the story of how I found out my credit card was maxed. I get some missed calls on the train. When I check my phone the hotel says my card is rejecting the debit. I check my limit and sure enough: maxed out to $7500. When I get home I decide enough is enough and immediately rework my budget:

-Going shopping late on Fridays and Sundays to get reduced items.

-Planning meals and food around these items and also specials. 

-Switching to healthy eating and getting fresh produce from the local farmers market and fruit markets. Shopping there late on a Friday or first thing Saturday morning they have reductions on stock that needs to be used or they have too much of.

- Only buying extra things we really need, not want. That doesn't mean not buying these items, just not getting them as often and waiting til they are on sale. I'd rather pay more for a quality item on sale than a cheap one I need to keep replacing, I have saved so much doing this too.

-Making op shops and cheap shops my first port of call for anything we need.

Repayments per month at this time and until now have been almost $600, including insurance and fees. Btw this has only covered the interest and a teeny amount of the actual debt. Despite this in the past year I have managed to bring it down to just under $6100. About a month ago I get a call from the company handling my card offering to consolidate my debt at a reduced interest rate as a loyalty for  paying on time and making all repayments. After confirming my annual income at tax time met the prerequisite I have been spending the last week sorting out an application after getting approved for the amount gaining interest. 

Today I find out I have been officially approved for the full amount (yay!). Not including the establishment fee this puts the only fee at $5/month service fee. Repayments are $230/month minimum which includes full insurance. So even with $235+interest I'm saving *so* much per month. 

Important things I have learned from this experience:

- Even when you are swamped with debt, pay off any extra amount that you can. Doing this I managed to pay off that $1400 this past year, which I didn't think was possible. This has ultimately made my overall loan and therefore monthly repayments cheaper.

- Credit cards can be the devil. We learned this in high school commerce and I promised teenage me I would never get one. Well, fast forward to now and teenage me would kick my ass. My problem was I made what was a sensible decision, then got too comfortable and put extra things on there I shouldn't have without thinking properly. What I should have done is lowered my limit to $2500 after the $2200 was on there. This is what I did once I got down to $6400. Once the payment comes through I can now cut it up.

-Budgeting is *so* important I can't even begin to tell you. This past week I've been motivated to penny pinch further and will be perusing this subreddit on more tips to do this. I now want to save as much as I can to pay this loan off early and be debt-free. Then I can save to travel and have more savings put away.

personalfinance,Paying for wedding with 401K loan,"Hello PF,

I (25M) am getting married in few months. I have been freaking out about how to actually pay for the wedding expenses and many of the expenses beyond the wedding as well. I was hoping to get some ideas about my plan and any suggestions for how I can improve it so I don't screw up my financial future.

Here are some current stats:
Salary: $120K 
Cash savings: $28K (saving about 2K/month)
401K: $30K (contributing $550 a month - 12% - no employee match)
Car loan: 9K left (paying $500 monthly at 2.990%)

I'm currently living at home so no rent costs yet, but I plan to move out soon and I expect to pay around 2K/month for rent, which would mean I can't save as much. I don't have any other loans or any credit card debt.

As for wedding costs, I've drawn up a budget and I expect to need about $45K to cover everything. I've tried my best to reduce this as much as I can but this seems to be the best estimate.

Now, my problem is that I won't have $45K in cash at the rate I'm saving, and even if I did, I don't want to spend it all for the wedding. So my plan was to take out a 401K loan for 15K (half) and use my cash savings for the rest. I was advised that taking a private loan would result in higher interest rates and that a 401k loan is preferred. What do you guys think? Would investing the cash I have in something be a good idea? How do you recommend that I close this gap of around $15K?

personalfinance,Re-consolidating/Re-refinancing student loan debt,"Background: About a year and a half ago I refinanced some of my student loans with SoFi. I was a little disappointed with the rate they got me (5.625% after autopay), but I decided to go for it since it was an improvement over some of my federal loans but not all. As a result I currently have two loans:

Sofi ~18,000 left at 5.625% ($279.52 minimum) - 10yr
Federal ~19,000 left at 5.16% ($234.20 minimum) - 10yr

I'm avalanching the SoFi loan and currently paying $765.80 per month, or $1,000/mo total on the loans (compared to a ~$513/mo minimum). 

I recently checked in with Sofi to see if they could reduce my rate again and was actually pre-approved at a higher interest rate (!). Baffling, since my income to debt ratio has improved and my credit score recently topped 800 for the first time. In any case, I started looking into other options and found that Lendkey will tentatively offer a 4.47% interest rate on a 5-yr loan through Aspire Federal Credit Union (edit: or McGraw-Hill Federal Credit Union) with a minimum payment ~$720/mo. I'm still looking to pay $1,000/mo total and go even higher if I get a raise anytime soon. 

So all that said, should I do it? It's potentially a 1.125% improvement on roughly half my outstanding debt, and ~0.7% on the other half. Payoff calculator shows I'd pay off the debt at the same time (Jan 2020) as if I don't consolidate, but I'd save a little under $500 in interest. Seems like I should go for it. Anyone have any experience with Lendkey and/or Aspire Federal Credit Union? Other thoughts? Thanks!",finance,1469815103
personalfinance,Calculating available post-retirement income.,"Curious what others think of this approach to retirement savings calculations:

CS = Current Savings (post-tax dollars)

YR = Years to retirement

AC = Annual Contribution (post-tax dollars)

GR = Growth (%)

IF = Inflation (%)

EI = Effective Interest Rate = [(1+GR)/(1+IF)] - 1

Formula 1: CS x (1+EI)^YR 

This gives the future value (the year you retire) of the money you have already saved, in today's dollars.

The future value (in today's dollars) of the money you have yet to contribute is given by the formula for the future value of an annuity: 

Formula 2: AC x {[(1+EI)^YR - 1]/(GR-IF)}

So the total that you will have saved at the start of retirement is the sum of formulas 1 and 2 above:

After you retire, you start withdrawing 4% from the account, so the account continues to grow with inflation (per the so-called ""4% rule""), and your income in retirement is 0.04 x (Formula 1 + Formula 2).

For example, if you have $100,000 saved and are 20 years from retirement, you contribute $20k/year towards retirement, your investments grow at a rate of 8% and inflation is 2%:

EI = (1.08/1.02) - 1 = 0.0588

Formula 1: 100,000 x 1.0588^20 = 313,530

Formula 2: 20,000 x (1.0588^20 - 1) / 0.0588 = 726,291

0.04 x (313,530 + 726,291) = 41,593

You can have a post-tax income in retirement of just over $40k/year.

---

Does this make sense? What % would you assume for GR and IF? Should GR change to something lower after you reach retirement age and take on less risk? This does not consider capital gains tax if you have some taxable accounts, but I would account for that by lowering the GR value.

Going to this private institution was a bad choice that I now regret, but history can't be changed.

I personally have taken out Stafford Federal Loans (unsubsidized &amp; subsidized) which total $32,456 @ around 5% average. My parents helped and they took out a home credit loan totaling $62,870 @ 3.7% and a parent plus loan totaling $43,633 @ 6.35%. 

**Below is a breakdown for easy reference:**

* Loan1: $32,456 @ 5%
* Loan2: $62,870 @ 3.7%

I've lived with my parents since I was born (I commute to college for all 5 years). My parents are offering for me to stay with them indefinitely, free of charge. Should I stay and focus on paying off my debt? If so, how long should I stay? According to [unbury.us](unbury.us) if I lived with my parents and paid off my loans at a rate of $3000/month, I would be debt free by September 2020. That's over 4 years living with my parents. I'm honestly not sure if I could do that after 23 years of living with them. My social life has suffered; dating has been hard and then of course my mother wants to control my lifestyle to fit hers. Obviously, if I choose to stay with my parents, I can't complain. Anyway, my other option is to stay for 1-2 years and then move out. After 2 years, I would at least have the highest interest loan payed off. The last option is to move out immediately.

personalfinance,At what point do I stop paying excess on my student loans and put the money toward a Roth IRA?,"I am 26 and have about $15,000 left to pay on my student loans, but the interest rates are getting low (3.3%).  Should I consider opening and maxing a Roth IRA before paying more than the minimum on my loans?  Here's what I've been thinking:

* I've heard long-term returns on a Roth IRA have historically been around 6%, which would mean I would come out ahead given the same returns.  I don't know how likely it is that I would come out behind.
* I have a good, stable job now, so I can afford to pay extra on my loans.  I don't plan on it, but if I moved or changed careers in the future, maybe I'd be making less and would wish I didn't still have my monthly payment.
* I've been told student loan interest is tax deductible, so my interest on the loans is effectively lower--is this true?  Is the interest tax deductible only for people under a certain age or below a certain income?
* Some people speculate there will be student debt forgiveness in the future.  It would be unfortunate to pay off my loans only to have everybody's forgiven the next year--it's not like I'd be reimbursed.

* Exercise price is ~$2.50, current stock valuation is ~$6.50 (ie., company is growing, can probably expect some similar rate of growth in the next few years, probably nothing explosive, probably not gonna collapse.)
* There's a vague possibility of an IPO in the next few years, but nothing certain has been said.
* I could put in maybe $1000 a month towards this, after already allocating for rent and savings/investing and other stuff

So from what I know about options, you can either

* Exercise, then hold on to the stock for a year, and sell them, to have the profit be taxed as capital long-term gains (15% or something?)
* Same day cashless exercise, taxed as income (for me it'd be like 33%)

How could I take the best advantage of these options within the next two years?

* Buy $12000 worth of options in a year, then sell that amount as capital gains after another year, then cashless exercise the rest?
* Take out a loan to buy all 50k options once they all vest, then sell after a year? Seems like interest rates are at like 5-10% or something, and so would be worth to get the capital gains rate instead of normal income rate?
* Some involved process where I buy some and cashless exercise some others for capital with which to buy more?

personalfinance,"First real paycheck, which debt should I pay first?","I just received my first paycheck (well, first real career paycheck) and I am looking to bounce my ideas of some of the experts on here.  

Info about me:

Salary: $54,000 gross

Cash on hand: ~$6,000

Debt: ~$65k in student loans (mix of private and govt)
           $2K on a credit card (0% interest until 9/2017)


Now that I have some money, I am trying to figure out what to do.  I know I need to start an emergency fund now, but I also hate to know that I am wasting money paying interest on all of these loans.  

Another important note, I am active duty military so all of my interest rates have been moved to 5-6% interest rate as of last month (before this I had a few that were 8-9%).  

My ideas:

1) Pay off the smallest loan ( ~$2,000) immediately.  My parents cosigned for this one and they are wanting me to pay it off (they are moving soon and are going to be applying for a new mortgage).  It'd be nice to have one paid off fully so soon.

2) Pay off the credit card balance ($2k).  I racked this up during my transition into my military job with the intention of paying it off immediately after getting my first check.  But then I remembered that it's 0% interest for a year, and that maybe it would be better to pay off a loan that is accruing interest (hence, plan #1)

3) Save all the money for my e fund.  My loans are in deferment since I just graduated in May, so my first payments aren't due until november/december.  This would be a good start to my e-fund, but it also wouldn't pay off any of my debt.  

So, which is the best plan here?  Or is there a better option out there?

personalfinance,College student having troubles receiving financial aid. Help me decide a course of action.,"I hope I'm posting this in the right sub. I apologize for the long post, but I'm pretty desperate for advice at this point.

I'm about to enter my senior year of college. Up until this point, I've received enough aid through the FASFA, in the form of federal grants, loans, and scholarships, to afford my classes. 

I applied for the FASFA in late May as I do every year. This year, however, I received an email a few weeks after I applied letting my know that my FASFA had not been processed. The reason being that my parents were in the middle of a divorce while I was applying. So, when I filled out the FASFA this year, my parents were separated, but not yet divorced because there is a six month waiting period in my state. That didn't seem to matter, however, because it only gave me the option of ""married"" or ""separated/divorced"". I chose the latter. However, since they were stilled technically married during tax season, they had to file their taxes together. This caused a processing error of the FASFA. I was told in the email that I needed to have my parents fill out a form saying they were, in fact, divorced. I also needed to attach a copy of their divorce papers. On top of this, I needed to have my parents fill out some forms from the IRS. I forwarded my mom the email so she could fill out the forms. She informed me that she could not download the IRS forms online, so she had to request them through the mail. 

While we awaited the IRS forms in the mail, my mom received a different letter from the IRS letting her know she and my dad were being audited. The reason behind this was that my family was signed up for health care through Market Place this past year. In order to receive this federal health care, you must estimate your income. My mom had to estimate the income of everyone in the family. Unfortunately, when I got a new job and started making more money than she had anticipated, it caused some problems with the IRS. She owed the IRS money when it came time to do her taxes. She paid them back, but apparently the taxes have still yet to be processed. Until the taxes are processed, my FASFA cannot be processed. 

My mom is hoping that the accountant she used to file her taxes can sort this out, but until he does I'm not sure what I should do. I currently owe my school about $8,000. I took a summer class, and the tuition for that was due this month. My grade for the class has still not been uploaded, and I assume that is because I haven't paid for it yet. I'm worried that I won't be able to start classes in the fall since my bill from the summer is still unpaid. I'm just not sure where to turn next. Should I try to get a private loan? Should I take a semester off. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance,1469838388

Loan A is already starting to accrue interest, while Loan B won't start getting interest for another 6 months. I pay $500 or so dollars a month. Is it best to put it toward the loan that is already getting interest to stop it from creating more, or to pay down the higher principle of the loan with the higher rate so once that starts, the interest won't be so high?

personalfinance,Where do I go to set up an IRA?,"No workplace 401k.  That actually sounds laughable now, more like an idea from the 50's.

I thought I'd ask my bank, but someone told me banks are the place to go to.  I should go to a place that specializes in financial investments and retirement planning.

I'm not looking for anything spectacular or fancy.  I'm looking at taking some money, sticking it in a retirement account, and then taking it out far into my future (basically I can forget it about.  It's gone to me in the present).  In the future I can worry about how to draw the money out.  And the money better be there in the future.  This is a set up where I'm assuming it earns squat for interest but that's how it is, like 1%.  2% is a lot apparently from what I looked into several years ago.  Some interest is better than no interest.

And the more immediate present goal is to use an IRA (or something like that.  I don't know anything about retirement accounts really) to lower my adjusted gross income on my federal taxes.

So do I go to a bank?  Or do I find a financial person somewhere?  I haven't heard great things about financial planners so much recently.  I really doubt setting up a cookie cutter (probably Roth) IRA needs anything but the minimum for set up work and zip for maintenance after that.  Is it possible I can just set something up like that on my own online?  Find some giant financial firm, click 'yes' for an IRA, dump some money in, and that's it?

personalfinance,28F looking for budget advice/going back to school,"TL;DR can I optimize my budget or should I look for additional income?

My budget is tight and I live paycheque to paycheque, but I am covering all my needs. I still have student debt, a car loan, and have consolidated my multiple credit card debts onto a line of credit with lower interest rate. I made some bad decisions in the past, uying a new car and racking up credit card debt by buying frivolous material items. About a year ago I tightened up my spending and tried to make some smart investments. 
I currently have $11000 owing on my student loan, $11000 owing on my line of credit, and $11000 (&lt;2 years) owing on my car. I have $9500 in savings and $5000 in shares that I cannot access for another year.

I want to go back to school in the fall and take classes after work and on weekends. These classes are related to my career path, and getting this certification could increase my pay at work. The cost of the program is roughly $7000.

I want to know now if there is anything I can do to optimize my budget and find money to go back to school? Should I be looking for a second source of income?

Monthly Income:
$3500, after contributing $200 to RRSP and $500 to share purchase program monthly

Monthly Expenses:
$1500 Rent (if I can find a decent roommate, it would be $750 monthly)
$100 Savings/investment porfolio
$300 Student loan repayment
$400 Line of credit repayment
$560 Car loan 
$175 Insurance
$95 Cell phone
$50 Electric
$60 Internet

That leaves me with about $260/month for things like food, gas, entertainment, incidentals. Not much. The money almost always runs out before the next paycheque comes in. I have pared down my impulse spending a lot, but it does still happen from time to time, which would go on my line of credit.

personalfinance,What should I do with my excess cash right now?,"Hello PF,

I'm looking for some advice on how best to juggle my debts and investments.

I am two years out of college and earning $90k a year. I graduated with about $35k in federal student loans and have been throwing gobs of money at them while still living at home (not free, but cheap). I am down to about $14k left: $5000 @ 3.6%, $5000 @ 3.15%, and $4000 @ 3.15%. I paid off all the unsubsidized loans already. I also bought a car and have $19k left on that loan (around 2% interest rate). This puts my total debt at $33k.

After loan payments, $450 rent, insurance, and other small expenses, I am still left with a lot of excess money each month. I have done a fair bit of spending, mainly upgrading possessions that I was forced to neglect as a broke college student, but that's tapered off lately. My assets include $13k in the bank and $14k in my employer-matched 401k. A few months ago I also purchased a bit of stock in a tech company I like, mostly just to play around, but my $3.5k investment is now worth about $4.5k. I'm planning to hang on to it until I've had it for at least a year. I'm told this will minimize my tax burden.

I would eventually like to move out, but I'm not in a big hurry. My parents say they like having me here. They are financially stable and I help them out in a lot of other ways. My long term goal is to buy a condo and avoid the rental market if possible. I have no interest in starting a family.

**Some of the specific questions I would like help with:**

Should I continue blitzing the remainder of my student loans, or invest money elsewhere and ride them out? My monthly payment is only about $150.

Obviously my stock market ""playing"" is not a real investment strategy. I hear great things about Vanguard, both from PF and elsewhere. Would this be a good place for me to start investing? How aggressive should I be with my investments?

I am only contributing to my 401k what my employer matches. Is this foolish? Retirement is a *long* way away for me, and I am afraid of losing access to my money in the event that I need a large down payment on a house or condo. If I put my money in Vanguard, can I still access it easily?

Thanks for any advice you can offer. :)",finance,1469843822

Quick background - 

I'm currently at the point where I have to start considering where I want to go for college. I'm seriously considering a career/future in music, and want to attend music school. Another alternative is law - I'd be going to the UK for law school. My parents have said they will try to fund as much of it as possible, and for the rest I can either start saving myself (for things like books, living costs, etc) or take out a student loan. 

I've heard of some of the nightmares you guys have had with student debt so a bit reluctant to go down that path. To build experience + a portfolio I've started giving music lessons to kids in my neighborhood for around $15 an hour (HKD$100). I have four students so far for weekly lessons, which means I bring in around $200 or so a month (HKD$1500-1600). I'll also be starting an internship at a local record label in October/November that pays around $30 (HKD$200) an hour (approx 20 or so hours a week). 

This is probably the first time I've had ""income"" (not including monthly allowance), and seeing as I'm a young adult I'd like to do something wise with it. 

My question is - should I look into opening a bank account (obviously with my parent's approval + registration, etc) with attached debit cards, or simply just stash all the cash somewhere? I'm probably going to be spending at least 20% of my income a month on various things, and while cards are widely accepted here cash is equally convenient. 

As far as I'm aware my parents haven't opened a bank account under my name yet. 

I googled HSBC (one of the bigger HK banks, obviously well known worldwide)'s interest rates, and the interest rate is 0.0010%. Is this amount worth me putting cash into my account regularly? Are there any other benefits to opening an account? My main goal is to keep all my money in one place, to part fund any spending I'd need, and to part save up for college. 

Hope you guys can help me with this - while my parents aren't bad with money and all I'd like to do as much research on my own as possible before I bring this to them. From a brief discussion they don't mind if I just stuff all my cash in an envelope somewhere.

personalfinance,(UK) Should I consolidate my personal debt for a lower rate?,"Hi folks,

I am currently working towards getting my debt paid off and have the opportunity to consolidate most of it to a single personal loan at a significantly lower rate. This seems like a no-brainer however my gf and I will be applying for a mortgage in the next 2-4 months and I am concerned about the impact of doing this on my credit score so I am looking for some general advice or perspective on this.

To give some context, here is a high overview of whats involved. All figures are in GBP.

Existing Debt which would be consolidated:

* CC 1: £2300,  0% apr until Mar 2017 limit: 2500 Payment: £70pm
* CC 2: £1800,  ~20% apr Limit: 4000 payment: £100pm flat payment
* Personal Loan: £4500 (Settlement figure) ~13%, payment: £150 pcm, ~3 years left
* Car Finance: ~£7k, 7.9%, £150pm, ~4.5 years left

New Loan being considered:

*~13.5k balance, 60 month term, 3.3% fixed apr, ~£200-£220pcm.

My current financial overview is:

* Income: £3k pcm
* Non-debt commitments (rent, gas, ins etc): ~£750 pcm
* Debt Commitments: £650 pcm
* Non-bill expenses (Food, petrol, social etc): ~£600 pcm

This currently leaves me with ~£1k pcm which is going towards my debt over and above the minimum payments. Note I have a student loan @ £250pcm finishing in 2 months and a couple of other adjustments coming so really I will be looking at around £1.5k pcm towards the debt in around 2 months time.

So, I have two options:

1- Take the new loan, close my existing loan, car finance and pay off CC 2. I wouldn't close CC 2 at this time as it would likely push my debt usage up but leave it empty. This would leave me with over £1.5 pcm to put in a savings account. Once I hit the settlement figure, i would simply pay off the new loan.

2 - Stick with what I have. Focus CC 2, my existing personal loan and then the car finance.

In either scenario, it makes sense to leave CC 1 on the minimum payment while the 0% offer lasts and I have other debts. The lower rate on the new personal loan is attractive, but, barring any major financial knocks, I will be clearing the debt in either scenario in around a year so it probably isn't a huge amount saved. That said, simplifying my finances down to a single payment for debt is attractive and increases my affordability.

My main concern is the affect on my credit score for doing this. I have rebuilt this over the last year and currently have a rating of around 970 / 999 using experian (I use credit expert to check). I am aware that my credit score can affect the interest rates I will get offered on a mortgage, so could be saving £200 on my personal debt, only to add thousands on to the cost of my mortgage due tot he adverse affect on my credit score. 

As far as i know, doing this will have the following effects on my credit score:

* Negative hit from the credit search
* Negative hit from new line of credit
* Positive hit from closing personal loan and car finance.
* Potential positive hit from lowering usage on credit cards.
* Potential negative hit as average age of accounts will lower.
* Potential positive hit from reduced number of accounts (though total exposure will remain the same).

What I am not sure of is how much each of these items would impact it. What would you guys do in this situation? Am I missing any obvious factors here that swing the decision? At the moment, I feel it would be marginally beneficial to take the new loan however I am still hesitant. 

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated =)

personalfinance,How long until I see an improvement in my credit score?,"I realize that it's actually really early in my paying down debt journey, but I'm excited to be on it at all, and want to know what I have to look forward to!

Basically, shit hit the fan in my life and I didn't make any payments on my various debts (1 credit card and several student loans) for 2014 or 2015. I've been slowly getting it together during 2016. Right now my picture looks like this:

Federal student loans: Making payments since March of this year. I'm in the income-based repayment program, and have a pending application in the PSELF program. Autopay so theyre all on time.

Student loans (through university) gone to collections: Been making payments to collection agency since August of 2013. Autopay so theyre all on time. (I haven't actually talked to them since 2013, I should probably do that.)

Credit card: This is the one that's still delinquent. It's gone to a collection agency but i haven't been sued yet. I saved up enough money and I'm going to make them an offer this month, and hopefully they'll settle for 60% or less of the balance, which will close the account.

I checked yesterday, and my credit score is 588, which is not great. I know that my credit report will show delinquencies for 7 years, but assuming that the collection agency takes my offer and i stay on top of my other debts, when will my credit score start to go up? When might I start to be able to think about the possibility that I might qualify for a car loan, or a credit card? I don't even want either of those things right now, but it'd be nice if I knew that I could get them if I wanted.

Also, anyone out there struggling with debt: I feel way better right now, just at the beginning of being on top of it, then I did six months ago when I was still avoiding everything. Make calls, do what you can. Sure, I've got 10+ years before I'm out from under, but at least I have a deadline, where before I just had interminable suffering and feeling broke and never answering my phone.",finance,1469901383

personalfinance,"(SEEKING ADVICE) 23 yo. finished vocational school, working deadend job, looking to make a change","Hello, I've never been too great at formatting on here so hopefully I can get my point across clearly enough to get the advice I'm seeking.

• I am 23 years old, in Sacramento CA.

• My family was, up until this year, essentially living off of my great grandma. My sister and myself had been living with my great grandma since I was 8 years old due to an abusive household. My mom went through rehab, regained custody, and moved in with us when I was about 12. She hasn't had a job since I was 7. My great grandmother recently passed and struck our whole family with tragedy. I was the only one working in the house, but not paying rent. Everything was paid for by my great grandmother's pension. She was 93, very healthy and happy, even able to drive herself to the store but unexpectedly suffered a stroke early this year. 

The house was left to her daughter who sold it as soon as she could, which left us with only 1 month to find a new place to rent and my sister to get a job to help me pay the rent. 

• I am working at a pet shop, about 30 hours a week, and I'm taking home roughly $500 every two weeks.

• I am just now starting to try learning how to make a budget, and I'm noticing that I am making barely enough to cover my monthly expenses 
 - Rent ($550)
 - Phone ($50)
 - Car Insurance ($100)
 - Gas ($80-140)
 - Grocery ($100)

Which puts me at about $900-+ in expenses for the month, so my $1000 take home isn't cutting it.

• I live with my sister, her boyfriend, and my mom, but my mom refuses to get a job and has not had one for the past 16 years so I pay $550 out of $1300 rent with 4 people capable of paying rent living in the house.

• I went to a 2 year vocational school to get my A+ certificate as a tech support specialist, but goofed around and didn't study diligently enough to pass the exit exam that actually grants me the A+ cert. I have a college diploma but no certificate.

• I've been with my girlfriend now for almost 2 years and she's seeing everything that I'm going through and has been helping me every step of the way, whether it being cleaning my house on our days off since nobody in the house will do it, or helping with rent when I'm short. We have been discussing moving in together, and I would say we are expecting that move within the next 12 months if my situation at the time permits it.

• I've downloaded countless A+ study material, and my girlfriend is going to help me learn to take notes and retain the material that we are going over since I was never any good at that in school. 

My plan is to study for the comptia A+ and get that done by this year and then maybe move into the tech field to secure more of a career and earnings so that my girlfriend and I are able to start our life together. I've put together an excel spreadsheet on everything we need to move in together and I'm estimating that it'll cost $4,000 to move in and $1500 monthly for the household ($1000 rent, $200 groceries, $200 utilities, $80 internet) plus our own expenses. 

Is this realistic? Those numbers are based off of my speculation and research (google), not personal experience.


I am very thankful to have her here by my side, but I am just curious as to what your guys input on what I could do is? I've told my mom that I plan on moving in the next 12 months and that I'm worried about what she will do when I am gone and not here to pay her rent but I don't believe it gets through to her since she hasn't made any moves towards getting a job yet. I plan on crossposting this to /r/selfimprovement /r/getstudying /r/personalfinance, and anywhere else you guys think I may be able to get some insight on what I can possibly do with my life.",finance,1469906189

personalfinance,Student Loans as Life Insurance: squeezing marginal value from accelerated loan retirement,"This realization came about based on a discussion my wife and I had about how to best retire our student loan debt at an accelerated rate. Since PF loves retiring debt, so much, I thought I'd share this thought experiment with you for your consideration when managing your own accelerated retirement schedules.

If you and your spouse carry federal student loans and do not live in one of the 9 community property states, you can improve your optimal debt reduction strategy by taking into consideration the dischareability of student loans upon death. Of course, anyone who feels as though their marriage is at risk of break-up through divorce or is not considered a legal marriage should approach this method cautiously. 

**Using the Strategy**

The following factors need to be present for this scenario to be relevant:

1. Both spouses carry a significant debt burden of federal student loans.

2. The interest rate on the bulk of the loans is identical (it might be okay if they're within a few basis points but after that, the utility of this strategy is likely to lose out to the superiority of paying the higher interest loans first). 

AND one or both of the following two scenarios:

1. There is a sizable difference in the earning capacity of the two spouses

2. There is a sizable difference in the risk of death of the two spouses

**Earning Capacity**

This is my case. One of us earns about 3 times that of the other. As a result, it makes sense to retire the debt of the lower earning spouse before that of the higher earning spouse. The rationale for this being that, post death, the person with the lower income potential also carries a lower burden of debt repayment. Effectively, if the higher earner spouse dies while carrying a loan that is discharged at death, it works as a windfall to the benefit of the surviving spouse better enabling them to live off of their lower income potential. 

**Risk of Death**

This is the case of a friend of mine who is 15 years older than his wife. They both carry substantial debt but because he is A. Male and B. substantially older, he is at a greater risk of death. If you want to compare risk of death, you can simply each get a quote for a whole life policy at the same insurer with the same coverage period and benefit and compare the monthly premiums to figure out who is the riskier party. If one person's premium is much higher than that of the other's, people whose job it is to evaluate the risk of you dying are giving you good, free information on your probability of death in the next X number of years. 

They should retire the wife's debt first, even if they are similarly positioned to earn the same amount of money because of her husband's relative risk of death. 

**Why not both?**

In a scenario where the person who earns more money is at a lower risk of death, a more careful analysis is required. Because the risk of death, in general, is a relatively low number over the likely term of most people's student loan repayment period, I would be inclined to lean more heavily toward retiring the debt of the higher earner more aggressively. However, I can only offer relative tools and this analysis would require concrete analysis. If there's an actuary in the community, perhaps they could offer some insight on this conundrum.",finance,1469907459
personalfinance,Terrible Interest Rate on Car,"Hey, PF.

It was our only vehicle for almost 2 years. Our interest rate on it is 16.9%. We financed for 6 years and still owe $15,000.

personalfinance,I am 20 years old and am convinced not saving any money is the most logical option for me at this point in my life.,"Basically, my argument hinges on the diminish marginal utility of consumption along with my expectations of future earnings. I am interested to see if I am missing anything in my reasoning.

****

*Information About Me*

*20 years old

*graduating college in 2017

*current summer job: $7000 before taxes for 3 months plus $116 unlimited metrocards monthly

*expected income during school year: $300 - $500 per month

*expected starting income after graduation: $60k/year (median starting salary for my college)

*current housing expense: $3500 for summer

*financial aid plus my awesome parents means I will be graduating debt free



*My Argument*


Often (depending on one's preferences of course), borrowing against one's future income will increase the utility they receive, and therefore their total welfare over their lifetime. I think I am at this point where I should be borrowing against my future income, but since that has more additional costs (e.g. credit card interest rate), I will simply spend all of my income.

The major reason is that my income currently is much lower than my future expected income. Because of this my consumption is relatively low compared to what it will be in a couple of years. (I expect to consume about $20k/year in pre-taxed income once I have a full-time job). So, each dollar I am consuming now, is bringing me more utility than an additional dollar in the future would. This difference in marginal utility is solely due to the amount of consumption in each period, not even taking into account time preference.

What it really comes down to is whether the utility I receive from spending money today worth the loss of utility I would receive in future from this amount and its interest. For me, I think it does.

Another thing to consider is the uncertainty of my predictions, which saving guards against. Considering the short duration of my non-saving (2 years at most) and my family which would be able to help, I don't think that will be a problem.

Is there anything I'm missing? I'd love to hear some feedback on this plan.",finance,1469913882

I have finally moved into a new place where I pay $650.00 a month not including utilities. I have a loan payment and a CC payment. 

I had a lot of bad habits but after going through 3 years of torture I decided things needed to change and now I am transforming myself. I did great on my bills last month and I have changed those bad habits into good habits which is saving me money. But it's time for a new job and a plan for my future. 

Finding a job that doesn't keep me struggling near minimum wage is a challenge.. granted, but it's not impossible and this has become my new goal. Part two of my goal, however, has been a roadblock since I was 20 and not just to me...but to more than I'd like to imagine. It will continue to rise and that makes me sick to my stomach.

In the future there will be a lot more posts on this subreddit.

[How I managed to get a Dependency Override.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2we1dz/how_i_managed_to_get_a_dependency_override_the/)

 I am currently in this process but FAFSA Administration (After speaking with the FAFSA Resource representative at the local community college.) told me there was **NO CHANCE** of ever getting a dependency override because I didn't match the criteria and after filing my financial aid form as an independent they still requested that I provide my parents tax/income information so that they can determine the EFC (Estimated Family Contribution).I shouldn't need to do this nor anyone else. By definition and legally according to the Federal Government via my taxes. I'm independent. Apparently that's not sufficient enough a circumstance to qualify for aid independently.

I tethered my phone to a home desktop my friend let me borrow It must be returned now so I will make an edit tomorrow with more follow-up information.

personalfinance,Quick Student Loan Question,"Let me just preface this by saying I have read the sidebar, and it seems I am correct. However, I need to be 100% positive due to the people I am dealing with.


I am a 17 (M) who has started looking into college after my last year of high school. My brother (graduated college), sister (4/5 years in college), and I are dependent on my mother's income, which is roughly 40,000 a year.

My mother has met a nice guy who makes over 100,000 dollars a year and they plan on getting married before I go off to college. He will also have two kids in college. With our two families combined, we would have 7 people in the household, with 5 dependant on parents and 4 in college.


I did the fafsa estimator from the sidebar, and it appears I qualify for a Federal Pell Grant of 5kish with just my mother, but lose that completely when I combine their incomes. The potential stepdad, however, insists that with having 4 kids in college the difference in aid will be minimal. Being pretty young and new to finances, I think that maybe he knows something I don't? Is the estimator missing something? Is there a tricky way around this by just claiming I live off my mother's income, not the stepdads, even though they are married? I can't help but feel a bit overwhelmed by the situation, because that could add up to an extra 20k in debt over four years!

TLDR: Does having a significantly higher income but with more kids in college make up for having a 5k federal pell grant from just my mother's income?",finance,1469944235
personalfinance,"2015 Taxes are late, CPA won't respond, dependency and filing without a CPA question","Hey all,

Sorry about the throwaway, but a few friends know my regular user name.

I'm 21, and had an internship for 7 months last year, and made ~$40,000 in CA with my residence in a state with lighter tax liability. Due to making more than $2100 in unearned income if I were to be claimed as a dependent I would need my unearned income to be taxed at my parents rate (as I understand it). My 2015 taxes haven't been filed because my family's CPA doesn't have all the info for my parents tax returns. I pointed out to his assistant that I paid my own rent and lived not at school or at home for &gt; 6 months of the year, and she said she would pass that on to him and he would get back to me. That was over a week ago, I've emailed his assistant and him once since and have not gotten a response (my family insists on using him for... many reasons I won't get into here). 

My two questions are:

If I file as an independent in 2015, can I go back to dependent for 2016, since I will be in school for more than half the year in 2016?

I am fed up waiting on this CPA and getting ignored. I don't know if I have all my tax documents (unearned income, capital gains, and there might be a 1099 from this one company, I can't remember if I contracted for them in 2015), but I know they exist; All I have is my W-2, 1098-T, and 1099 from a stock portfolio that I don't really manage. Can I file based on these documents, since they are what I have access to? If they don't give the full picture have I done something wrong? I would be providing information to the best of my ability.

personalfinance,"Living and working abroad with student debt. Not much personal finance literature talks about what to do when outside your home country. I would like to know which direction you all would take, given my situation.","**Intro/Purpose:**

I’ve accrued lots of student loan and credit card debt like most students who attended college during the big market crash. But… I live and work abroad and have no immediate plans for returning to the U.S. There’s lots of good material on reddit and in books about personal finance, but when you throw in living and working in foreign countries things get really complex. I’m hoping to get some suggestions from various experienced individuals and professionals on the best course of action I should take now. 

**Background:** 

* U.S. citizen.
* Finished my Bachelor’s degree in 2011 with a combined total of about $60k of debt ($30k fed student loans, $10k private student loan, $20k credit card).
* Used up my grace period for federal loans, and kept up with min payments for credit card for 2 years while I got settled and looked for a job.
* Used up some deferment on federal loans while I transitioned to working as an expat in China for a Hong Kong company.
* Been using IBR on federal loans to get $0 min monthly payments (due to AGI of $0 using Foreign Earned Income Exemption on tax return).
* Paid off all my credit card debt last month - feeling extra special about that!

**Now:**

* I'm now 29 years old, and have a FICO credit score of 792.
* Still got the $9k (8.75% APR) private student loan and now have $40k (6.25% APR) in fed student loans (due to interest and capitalization).
* Minus living expenses, I now have a monthly disposable income of about $1800. I could continue what I’ve been doing and keep throwing that at my debt. It would take me about 2.5-3 years to finish it all off.
* But I have no savings, nothing for emergencies, and no investments. I’m a healthy individual, and I’ve been damn lucky that I’ve not gotten hurt or seriously sick, as I have no healthcare solution. A single injury or illness right now could wipe me out.

**Situation:**

For various reasons I may want to change my employer and location in the near future (0.5 - 1 year). So, given that I live abroad, may or may not return to the U.S., could significantly decrease my disposable income with a change of job/location, etc.:

1. Should I force myself to be miserable and risk the next 2.5-3 years without health care to pay all this debt off and be free of it?
2. Should I continue the IBR for my fed loans, pay off my private loan, then move on?
3. Should I continue the IBR for my fed loans, keep making min payments on my private loan, and start saving and investing now, then come back to my loans later on?

**Specific questions related to my expat situation:**

For options 2 &amp; 3, I’m wondering if at that point would it even be worth it to try to fully pay off the federal loans? I would have accrued so much interest that it would be exponentially much harder to pay them off in full at that point. Maybe at that point I could only realistically expect to just constantly pay the lowest possible minimum payments and wait for the forgiveness deadline to kick in?

I’ve heard of people straight up fleeing the country and never looking back. I would never do this because who knows if I’ll need to return to the U.S. at some point in my life. And if I can just keep renewing the IBR, why not just do that? But, is there a chance this IBR and Foreign Income Exemption option could be nullified in the future? Also, what do these people do about their passports once they default on their loans? Couldn’t/wouldn’t the U.S. cancel/freeze their passports or at least deny them the ability to renew their passports?

**Conclusion:**

I’m leaning towards paying off my private loan now, then starting to gather some savings, and moving on. Then I’ll deal with my federal loans one way or another when the time comes. I also plan on contacting the ASA to see what they recommend and see if there are any special benefits or options for people working in lower tier countries. I know there are special forgiveness programs for teaching and non-profit, but is anyone aware of any other benefits specific to my situation? Thanks in advance for any help.",finance,1469962680
personalfinance,"After purchasing and taking home a vehicle, received a loan rejection letter from finance company.","My wife and I purchased a new Honda at the very end of June. The financing is in both of our names. Got the registration and plate and my wife has even made the first monthly payment (at a very low interest rate).

Yesterday we received a rejection letter from Honda Financial Services claiming that they could not honor the terms of the loan (and thus, rejection our initial loan offer). This letter, however, was addressed to only my wife and not to both of us (recall that the vehicle is in both of our names). After reviewing our vehicle contract (the long letters we signed the day we drove off with the vehicle), the dealership has the right to revoke the vehicle as long as the financial transaction has not been consummated. Additionally, when we signed the documents, the Financial Manager at the dealership had not officially become a notary yet (he was still in the process of becoming a notary, as per his job description), so our documents are *not* notarized. Didn't seem like a huge deal at the time but now I'm highly bothered by this fact.

So, questions regarding this.

1) Can the new vehicle be taken away?

2) Can the initial loan conditions be changed because our original loan documents were not notarized?",finance,1469968968

gaming,Bought a brand new broken Xbox controller and cant' get any help from Microsoft,"I am posting this story seeking guidance from anyone who has ever had a similar issue.

I bought an Xbox One controller at Walmart the other week. When I got home, I opened the box, and the controller was missing back plates, as pictured below:

http://i.imgur.com/F1swWCy.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/9SnxW8z.jpg


So I stuffed the receipt in the box (or at least thought I did), and left it on the coffee table to return after work later, as the Walmart was not close to my house. 

Well here is where I screwed up, of course I lost the receipt. I figured tough luck, I must have thrown it out so I guess I'll just have to use the controller as it is, its problem is mostly aesthetic. But then after using it I discovered that the LT button was finicky which makes the controller basically useless.

I figured I would just have to deal with my issue through Microsoft as it is a brand new controller. I thought I couldn't be the only person who has ever got a controller that came like this. However Microsoft is not willing to help me because I have no proof of purchase, even though I have the serial number of the controller. I tried to get Walmart to find my receipt and re-print it but they were no help either. 

Although it was my own stupidity for losing the receipt that got me here, I can't help but feeling completely ripped off. I have a hard time believing that this isn't a persistent issue with Xbox controllers yet I was basically told sorry for your luck when I called them. Does anyone have any suggestions for me or is this just what I get for being careless and not returning it right away?",technology,1469979307

I have no idea how I plan to consolidate; I was hoping to get some guidance on that as well.

The interest rates I know are around 20-25% (going to figure out how to find all of them then will edit again). Discover ($1800), Chase ($1,000), CareCredit ($800), student loans for me and hubby ($6000 together), medical bills to hospitals ($4,000), and medical bills in collections ($8,000).

personalfinance,Need some help/criticism for financial plan.,"Hello folks of pf, I'm trying to put together a financial plan and need some help. I'm 22 years old, work at a gas station makes about 1600 a month - 12 an hour about 40 or more hours a week - last year taxes show I made 20,360. I will be leaving for the US Navy come this DEC 2016 and am trying to put my financial affairs in order before then in order to cover expense of mine and mother/sister in house while I'm away. Here is my monthly budget/expenses : (be warned this is going to be pretty long, sorry guys  )

Personal Exp - 
-Loan - 144/month (@18% for 36 months, more on later)
-Gym - 30.25
-Cell Phone - about 95/month (lowest I could get baring paying off phone in lump some then drops to about 65 or so)
-Verizon Internet/Phone 120
-Dental Insurance Premium 55
-Tv Streaming (Netflix, Hulu etc) $40
-Food - Max $300
-Misc / CC payment budget  120 (If not all used just goes into savings)

Personal Expense total = 904.25 give or take

Family Exp - 
-Gas for Mom car - 140 per month (35$ per week)
-House Supplies - about 150 - (laundry detergent, cat liter, paper towels, toliet paper etc)
-Car Insurance Premium - 125 a month (sometimes split sometimes pay it outright, variable) 

Family exp - 415 or so

Total Exp = 1319.25 
Total Rev = 1680 after taxes 

Savings of 360.75 per month give or take if there are unplanned shenanigans 

Current money in bank 763.49 

$763.49 + (360.75 x 4 months) = 2206.49 saved by begin of DEC

Current Debt and CC (NFCU = Navy Federal Credit Union)
-$4000 loan at 18% for 36 mon
-$1600 Discover current apr of 0% but apr of 19% come nov - limit 3300 (yea I know over 30% but life happens)
-$100 Capital One cash back card - limit 1500 
-$44 NFCU Reward Visa - limit 1000
-$100 Capital One Plat - limit $1250 
-$ 40 Citi Double Cash back  - limit $1000
-$ 0 NFCU Cash back Premium - limit $12,000 apr 14.9% cash advance apr 16.9% - This card limit and APR's very shocking, and got me started thinking about that loan. 

Total CC debt $1,884 Total credit $20,050 = 9.3% utilization without counting the loan of 4000 with it its 29% currently. 

So how am I doing? So I pay as much as I do at home because #1 I'm an adult who cares about the quality of life of life of mother, #2 Because she is disabled and only source of income is disability - which just got cut because sister just turned 18 and #3 Sister really doesnt pay for anything even though she works her rationale is she has to go to college so she should not have to only thing she pays is the increase on car insurance to pet her car on moms policy which knowing my sister will end badly for my mom I fear. I didnt get a car because I judged couldnt afford it and with going into the navy kind of a waste of money, being 22 driving around with your parent isnt so fun though (mom doesnt let anyone drive her car, or drive her).Mom also has to pay a mortgage. She gets 1372 a month, 372 from alimony and about a 1000 for ssi. Little over 600 goes to mortgage. She has other things she pays for but my budget math comes out funny, she has issues with math/budget and never seems to have anything left over to save idk, dont mean to complain jst a reason I pay for things house needs rather give her ""rent money"" to do it. Technically rent I pay is about 450. 

Why I am here today is because I need to save more money in order to create more breathing room for my exp before I go to bootcamp for 2 months with little contact with outside world. Would Like to have enough money to cover min of 4 months exp which will be adjusted (wont have to budget for food or need a dental policy or gym membership come DEC) just in case boot camp becomes longer than expected. Now here is my main Idea,and you guys might have guessed already, take cash advance from NFCU Cash Back Premium, I know not typically good idea and kind of a pf taboo it seems but then again my loan is at 18% the cash advance is at 16.9% so would be saving on interest and min payment on 2000 would be 2% or about 40$ I would pay close to 60$ though. I would just transfer to loan over but nfcu doesnt do that and you know I can see why. 2000 would cover loan for about a year which I suppose I dont need to do but again it seems it would save money no? Cash advance limit is 3600$ so possibly could pay off the loan before I leave though that might rock the boat at nfcu idk have to talk to them. Im also thinking of doing balance transfer from my discover to the same NFCU before Nov pending approval and trying to pay off the rest on my own. 

My rationale for thinking I can get away with this is im going in as a E-3 so right off the bat making more than newly enlisted and I was given an enlistment bonus of 12,000 - which will be more like 8,000 after taxes and will only get it if I get through bootcamp and the pipeline for the job. As nervous as I am about getting through bootcamp Im pretty sure I can do it as for the NUC pipeline 70/30 its a rough school but the payoff is enormous. As for my loans and debt once I have enough saved to make one lump sum I rather do that than make min + 15% my exp's will be less in the navy and will still be able to save for myself  to pay debts and what not while still being able to send money home. My goal is to buy mother new car her 2006 nissan isnt going to last much longer and might take over the mortgage  thats further down the line but some of my goals. The woman took care of me for 18+ years and wouldnt be alive to be able to join the navy so my way of saying thankyou i guess. Also plan to save in the navy, open retirment accounts (roth ira, TSP etc) and look into more investment options.  Sorry guys I know this has been really long, but If i can get some feedback would be most appreciated. Also is there anyway to improve my mothers position financially , any kind of program or what not? It should be noted the mortgage is in my dads name she pays it, he is in kidney failure so his income also very limited, not a bad guy the two of them just really dont get along over the long term.

gaming,Why are video game developers so out of touch with the players?,"I've played mainly three games extensively: Super Smash Bros 4, Hearthstone, and World of Warcraft.  I love them all to death but it's glaringly obvious with each passing expansion that the developers have no clue what they are doing.

For instance, the balance between casual play and competition is often atrocious.  Nintendo seems to go out of their way to make Sm4sh as casual as possible.  Their ""competitive"" online mode has no MMR system, meaning high level players will get matched with new players.  They failed to institute some kind of reward system for winning (again, rewarding points for MMR would be nice) and stage selection is limited to omega stages.  Iconic battlefields like Smashville and of course Battlefield are omitted.

In Hearthstone, developers let overpowered cards fester in the meta for half a year.  Grim Patron Warrior and Undertaker really dulled the gameplay for about a year combined.  Unlike Flamewreathed Faceless, they were blatantly imbalanced parts of the game that should've been patched in less than half the time they were allowed in the game.

Now Blizzard is screwing with the mechanics of WoW by making it ridiculously easy to play.  I don't know what in the world they were thinking destroying the Paladin class and going on to remove countless abilities from each class in the name of simplicity.  They've killed character customization as well.  Glyphs are gone, talent choices are obvious, and they give you premade stats depending on your item level for PvP.

So why is it that devs seem to have no clue what they are doing in a lot of games (Blizzard specifically... #Bastion)?  I've played browser games to waste time on that have more in touch creators.

Literally.

I posted about the Punch weapon being too strong and promoting bad gameplay in Wings.io and got a direct response from the game designer, who then nerfed it.  Unlike the Greninja and Warsong Commander nerfs, it was well done and the Punch is still a valuable weapon - just not as obscenely stupid as before.

personalfinance,Would buying a house be a good decision for me?,"Looking for some planning advice for my current situation.  I am a 29 y/o, newly married, and living in Long Beach, CA with my wife.  We are currently renting at $1600 a month for a 2 bed duplex.  It is a decent duplex but kind of small and not our ideal situation.  Our lease will end in 3 months.  I am an engineer and currently making around $80k a year.  My wife just immigrated here and is waiting for work authorization.  She is also an engineer.

We have been considering buying a house in the area but we are not from CA and the house prices are tough to get used to here.  The houses we have been looking at are in the $400-450k price range which doesn't buy too much.  The market here is also hot right now so there is a lot of competition.

We have been saving for a house.  Currently I have about $30k in savings and $10k in my checking account.  My wife has her own savings and checking account but doesn't really have much money in it (~$1k).  We have no debt right now.  I had an auto loan but sold the car not long ago and am currently driving a cheap, reliable car as a daily driver.  Our monthly expenses are also pretty low.  We live fairly frugally and have no big monthly expenses other than rent.

My wife's parents are pretty well off and had offered to loan us $60k in order to get a 20% down payment on a house.  We would have to pay them $5k a year to pay back the money if we borrowed this money.

I had made myself a calculator for determining our expenses if we bought a house.  If we were to pay $425k for a house with a 20% down payment our payment would be about $2500 a month for the mortgage payment, taxes, parent payback, and home insurance.  This doesn't include utility expenses.  That also assumed a 3.75% interest rate.  My wife and I have pretty good credit (750-800 range).

Some other information about our current finances.  I have about $50k in my 401k.  I am putting in 10% every paycheck and my work matches about 6% of that.  I also have a small amount in a previous employers 401k (about $9k) that I was looking to rollover into an IRA.  Wife does not have any retirement money.

So the question is, is buying a house something I should consider?  LA home prices seem to continue to rise so I may not be able to afford buying a house in a couple years.  Renting is appealing but rent prices will also rise, especially if we move to a nicer place.  If I shouldn't buy a house what should I consider doing with my money?  Put more away for retirement?  Taking on this big of a debt scares me.  If my wife starts working it would help a lot but I know she would like to start a family before too long so I can't depend on her potential income.

personalfinance,"Recent Grad, 22k Student Loans, Struggling to Find Work","Hello everyone,

I graduated back in May with a BS in Accountancy and a 3.7 GPA. I've had my resume reviewed by pretty much everyone at my school's career center, have been applying diligently and I haven't had any luck when it comes to getting called back for interviews.

The issue is that I'm 21 years old and I've never had a job in my entire life. I didn't do an internship while in college and I wasn't involved on campus at all. I pretty much just studied and played video games for 4 years straight. I screwed up pretty bad and I feel like I just wasted 4 years of my life. 

So now I'm half way through my grace period and I'm looking at pretty bleak job prospects. Part of me wants to just give up and enlist in the US Air Force, but most of the jobs I'm interested in require security clearance which I probably wouldn't get if I'm falling behind on my student loan payments.

As of now I have $35 dollars left in my bank account. I live with my parents who pay for everything, but they're starting to get rightfully annoyed with me and I need to find something to do.

So assuming I enlist in the air force (I don't want to be an officer), would I have any options available for me when it comes to deferring my student loans? Around $4000 of it is private with the rest being government loans. I believe around 10k of the government loans are around 2%~ interest rate. I realize that if I start the enlisting process tomorrow it will probably take around 6 months until I would leave for bootcamp, assuming I don't have any disqualifying medical issues, so should I try to at least find a regular minimum wage job in the mean time? I don't have any references to use and I don't have friends or anything like that so I feel sort of stuck in that regard.

personalfinance,Did I make a huge mistake? --I didn't think student loan interest accrued until I was out of school...,"(throwaway for obvious reasons)

I am in a bit of a panic right now after realizing I've made a terrible rookie mistake after taking a small student loan. I have always been extremely frugal and debt-averse, so this is quite the shock.

Thanks to a childhood college fund and scholarships, I completed my undergraduate without any debt. Four years ago, I began graduate school and took on a $10,000 federal student loan. Though I had a savings account of about $5000 and would receive a monthly stipend, I took the loan as a security measure and to later build some semblance of credit. I believed that--after a $100 fee to finance the loan-- I would basically have a $10,000 emergency fund in the bank during grad school. The plan was to simply pay the principal off upon finishing graduate school, without allowing any interest to accrue after graduating-- I was told that interest does not accrue on student loans until you finish college.

Fast forward four years and I'm finishing up my degree, having lived a very frugal existence and even saving money despite making about $20,0000 per year. With grad school on my mind, I haven't thought of the loan in years until this morning. I went to the Federal Student Aid website &lt;nslds.ed.gov&gt; and created an account. To my dismay, I find that I've accrued about $2350 outstanding interest in addition to my $10,000 outstanding principal. I'm in a panic, because I had originally planned to simply pay off the principal at the end of grad school-- I would have never taken this loan if I thought I would have to pay interest. The address on my loan account was a temporary address from years ago and I have never received any postal mail or email regarding these federal loans. I guess I just assumed they had my current address since I pay taxes and work at a state university. 

It's now a Sunday, so I plan to call tomorrow but I need to know where to begin. Am I misinterpreting this or did I just blow $2500 for an unnecessary safety cushion? I have the money in my savings and can pay off the debt immediately, if necessary. Is there any chance this is just deferred interest that I can avoid by paying the principal back in full? 

I thought I knew what I was doing, but apparently I've made an idiotic rookie mistake. I'm confused because the scheduled start of repayment isn't until the end of this year, yet the interest has accrued even though the loan status indicates I am in a grace period. Please let me know where I should go from here and thank you for any help.

personalfinance,How to plan for marrying into student debt,"Hi PF,

I'm trying to map out a short term (5 year) financial plan centered around the assumption I marry my long term girlfriend somewhere in that period. 
The elephant in the room here is that she is sitting on slightly over 250K of medical school loans. I'd appreciate any advice on how to tackle this if it some day becomes *my* debt. 

Some Details:

I'm in my twenties and live in NYC. My salary is paltry by NYC standards but I like my job and there is room for advancement. I am currently living with my gracious parents rent free. My gf just started a 3 year hospital residency in another state. Our plan is to live in NY once she finishes since both our families live there and we are very close to them.

**My Assets/Debts**

* $82,000 between several savings and checking accounts
* $31,600 in a Vanguard Roth IRA
* $39,000 in company 401K
* $11,000 in a non-tax advantaged brokerage account
* No debts except credit cards that are paid in full each month

**Income and Expenses** 

* $4,582 per month post tax and commute cost deductions
* $3,000 to savings
* $458 to separate savings account to save for 2017 IRA contribution
* 600 towards flights and taxi costs to visit gf
* 525 for food/gas/mobile/entertainment/toiletries/miscellaneous purchases

**Her Assets/Debts**

* ~ 3,000 in cash
* ~ 250K in student loans. There are several loans ranging between 4-7% interest rates. It's a mix of private and federal but I'm not sure how much of each. She is paying back the loans on a IBR plan.


My questions are split between what I can be doing to prepare and what she can be doing to tackle the debt as quickly as possible

* What should I do with the cash? Should I keep saving up so we can put a lump sum dent on the debt after we're married? Should I invest it? Or keep it as a housing fund for the future
* Should I alter my savings rate and put more into retirement? My asset balance was due to putting priority on saving cash. My employer doesn't match contributions so I've only been contributing 4% and then maxing my Roth IRA

For her

* Is PAYE the best option?
* Should she be investing for retirement? Or put any extra cash toward loan repayment (if that's possible on PAYE plans). I took a look at her 403b and the offerings are poor with no match. I was going to recommend a low expense Roth IRA due to her income rate
* Are there other options to deal with the debt? Her residency qualifies for PSLF but I'm not sure if she will find a PS position in New York

Edit*
Thanks all for your insights and advice, particularly those that shared personal stories. My Personal preference is that a married couple should tackle any debt either has together and I'm willing to accept the financial consequences of that. Near term i'm planning to move some of my savings into non-tax advantaged accounts to invest, decrease my savings rate and redistribute to my 401K while continuing to max my Roth IRA. After we get married we'll come back to reevaluate debt payment strategy and what our financial goals are then, its too early to decide that right now.",finance,1470001935
personalfinance,How long before my credit score will rise after receiving my first credit card? Re: refinancing student loans,"Hello,

I currently have 4 separate loans ranging from $20-45,000 at 8-9.25% interest.  I'm looking to refinance these loans, and from what I've read, I'll get a better interest rate with a higher credit score.  Since I don't have any credit cards, I think that applying for a couple would be a good way to increase my credit limit and therefore my credit score, which is currently in the mid-600s.  

**My question is**, if I were to get accepted for these credit cards today, how long would it be before the credit agencies raised my score and I could apply for a loan at a better rate?

As of now, the account has changed status and we are not required to make any monthly payment on the loans...but they are still accruing interest. The account does not allow autopay (which knocks interest down .25%), but we can pay off each loan individually as we please.   

Does anyone have any advice on what the best way forward would be? Should I use the ""avalanche"" method and try to knock the highest interest ones out first or would it be smart to look into getting a personal loan that covers all six loans with a lower interest rate? I've tried to work the numbers out with interest and all that, but just cannot get my head around it and didn't know if anyone had a similar situation. Thanks!",finance,1470005733
btc,"JPMorgan suppresses gold &amp; silver prices to prop up the USDollar - via ""naked short selling"" of GLD &amp; SLV ETFs. Now AXA (which owns $94 million of JPMorgan stock) may be trying to suppress Bitcoin price - via tiny blocks. But AXA will fail - because the market will always ""maximize coinholder value""","**TL;DR**

**As a bitcoin user (miner, hodler, investor) you have all the power - simply due to the nature of markets and open-source software. Core/Blockstream, and their owners at AXA, can try to manipulate the market and the software for a while, by paying off devs who prefer tiny blocks, or censoring the news, or conducting endless meetings - but in the end, you know that they have no real control over you, because endless meetings are bullshit, and code and markets are everything.**

**Bitcoin volume, adoption, blocksize and price have been rising steadily for the past 7 years. And they will continue to do so - with or without the cooperation of Core/Blockstream and the Chinese miners - because just like publicly held corporations always tend to ""maximize shareholder value, publicly held cryptocurrencies always tend to ""maximize _coinholder_ value"".**

**How much of a position does AXA have in JPMorgan?**

AXA currently holds about $94 million in JPMorgan stock. 

http://zolmax.com/investing/axa-has-94718000-position-in-jpmorgan-chase-co-jpm/794122.html

https://archive.is/HExxH

Admittedly this is not a whole lot, when you consider that [the total of JPMorgan's outstanding shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/JPM/holders?ltr=1) is [currently around USD 3.657 billion](https://ycharts.com/companies/JPM/shares_outstanding).

But still it does provide a suggestive indication of how these big financial firms are all in bed with each other. Plus the leaders of these big financial firms also tend to hang out which each other professionally and socially, and are motivated to protect the overall system of ""the legacy ledger of fantasy fiat"" which allows them to rule the world.

**How does JPMorgan use paper GLD and SLV ETFs to suppress the price of physical gold and silver?**

As many people know, whistleblower Andrew Maguire exposed the massive criminal scandal where **JPMorgan has been fraudulently manipulating gold and silver prices for years**.

JPMorgan does this via the SLV and GLD ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds).

The reason they do it is in order to artificially suppress the price of gold and silver using [""naked short-selling""](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22naked+short+selling%22&amp;t=hd&amp;ia=about): 

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=andrew+maguire+gata+jpmorgan+nake+short&amp;t=hd&amp;ia=videos

---

**How exactly does JPMorgan manage to commit this kind of massive fraud?**

It's easy! 

There's actually about 100x more ""phantom"" or fake silver and gold in existence (in the form of ""paper"" certificates - SLV and GLD ETFs) - versus actual ""physical"" gold and silver that you can take delivery on and hold in your hand. 

That means that if *everyone* holding fake/paper SLV &amp; GLD ETF certificates were to suddenly demand ""physical delivery"" at the same moment, then only 1% of those people would receive actual physical silver and gold - and the rest would get the ""equivalent"" in dollars. This is all well-known, and clearly spelled out in the fine print of the GLD and SLV ETF contracts.

(This is similar to ""fractional reserve"" where almost no banks have enough actual *money* to cover all deposits. This means that if everyone showed up at the bank on the same day and demanded their money, the bank would go bankrupt.)

So, in order to fraudulently suppress the price of gold and silver (and, in turn, prevent the USDollar from crashing), **JPMorgan functions as a kind of ""bear whale"", dumping ""phantom"" gold and silver on the market in the form of worthless ""paper"" SLV and GLD ETF certificates, ""whenever the need arises""** - ie, whenever the US Dollar price starts to drop ""too much"", and/or whenever the gold and silver prices start to rise ""too much"".

(This is similar to the [~~""plunge protection team""~~ liquidity providers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=plunge+protection+team&amp;t=hc&amp;ia=web), who are well-known for preventing stock market crashes, by throwing around their endlessly printed supply of ""fantasy fiat"", buying up stocks to artificially prevent their prices from crashing. This endless money-printing and market manipulation actually destroys one of the main purposes of capitalism - which is to facilitate ""price discovery"" in order to reward successful companies and punish unsuccessful ones, to make sure that they actually deliver the goods and services that people need in the real world.)

---

**Is there an ELI5 example of how ""naked short selling"" works in the real world?**

Yes there is! 

The following example was originally developed by Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne - who, as many people know, is very passionate about using Bitcoin not only as cash, but also to settle stock trades - because his company Overstock got burned when Wall Street illegally attacked it using naked short selling:

&gt; Here's how naked short-selling works: Imagine you travel to a small foreign island on vacation. Instead of going to an exchange office in your hotel to turn your dollars into Island Rubles, the country instead gives you a small printing press and makes you a deal: Print as many Island Rubles as you like, then on the way out of the country you can settle your account. So you take your printing press, print out gigantic quantities of Rubles and start buying goods and services. Before long, the cash you’ve churned out floods the market, and the currency's value plummets. Do this long enough and you'll crack the currency entirely; the loaf of bread that cost the equivalent of one American dollar the day you arrived now costs less than a cent.

&gt; With prices completely depressed, you keep printing money and buy everything of value - homes, cars, priceless works of art. You then load it all into a cargo ship and head home. On the way out of the country, you have to settle your account with the currency office. But the Island Rubles you printed are now worthless, so it takes just a handful of U.S. dollars to settle your debt. Arriving home with your cargo ship, you sell all the island riches you bought at a discount and make a fortune.

**Why isn't anybody stopping JPMorgan from using ""naked short selling"" to fraudulently suppress gold and silver prices?**

Because ""certain people"" benefit!

Of course, this ""naked short selling"" (selling a ""phantom"" asset which doesn't actually exist in order to suppress the price of the ""real"" asset) *is* actually illegal - but JPMorgan is allowed to get away with it, because **suppressing the gold and silver price helps prop up the United States and world's major ""fantasy fiat"" financial institutions** - which would be bankrupt without this kind of ""artificial life support.""

---

**How does suppressing the gold and silver price help governments and banks?**

If gold and silver (and Bitcoin!) rose to their actual ""fair market value"", then the US dollar (and most other national ""fiat"" currencies) would crash - and many major financial institutions would be exposed as bankrupt. Also, many ""derivatives contracts"" would default - and only a tiny percentage of defaults would destroy most major financial companies' balance sheets. (For example, see [Deutsche Bank - which is may become ""the next Lehman"", due to having around around $80 *trillion* in dangerous derivatives exposure](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=deutsche+bank+derivatives+exposure&amp;t=hc&amp;ia=web).)

So, major financial firms like JPMorgan are highly motivated to prevent a ""real"" (honest) market from existing for ""counterparty-free"" assets such as physical gold and silver (and Bitcoin!)

So, JPMorgan fraudulently manipulate the precious-metals market, by flooding it with 100x more ""phantom"" ""silver"" and ""gold"" in the form of worthless GLD and SLV ETF certificates.

Basically, JPMorgan is doing the ""dirty work"" to keep the US government and its ""too-big-to-fail"" banks and other financial institutions afloat, on ""artificial life support"".

Otherwise, without this GLD &amp; SLV ETF ""naked short selling"" involving market manipulation and fraud, the US government - and most major US financial institutions, as well as many major overseas financial institutions, and most central banks - would all be exposed as bankrupt, once traders and investors discovered the _real_ price of gold and silver.

---

**So, what does this have to do with AXA and Bitcoin?**

Just like JPMorgan wants to suppress the price of gold and silver to prop up the USDollar, it is reasonable to assume that AXA and other major financial players probably also want to suppress the price of Bitcoin for the same reasons - in order to postpone the inevitable day when the so-called ""assets"" on their balance sheets (denominated in US Dollars and other ""fantasy fiat"" currencies, as well as derivatives) are exposed as being worthless. 

Actually, only the *motives* are the same, while the *means* would be quite different - ie, certain governments or banks might want to suppress the Bitcoin price - but **they wouldn't be able to use ""naked short selling"" to do it.**

As we know, this is because with Bitcoin, people can now simply demand ""cryptographic proof"" of how many bitcoins are really out there - instead of just ""trusting"" some auditor claiming there is so much gold and silver in a vault - or ""trusting"" that a gold bar isn't actually filled with worthless tungsten (which happens to have about the same ""molecular weight"" as gold, so these kinds of counterfeit gold bars have been a serious problem).

(And, by the way: hopefully it should also be impossible to do ""fractional reserve"" using ""level 2"" sidechains such as the Lightning Network - although that still remains to be seen. =)

So, even though it should not be possible to flood the market with ""phantom"" Bitcoins (since people can always demand ""cryptographic proof of reserves""), **AXA could instead use a totally different tactic to suppress the price: by suppressing Bitcoin trading volume** - explained further below.

---

**Does AXA does actually have the _motives_ to be suppressing the Bitcoin price - right now?**

Yes, they do!

As described above, the only thing which gives giant banking and finance companies like JPMorgan and AXA the appearance of solvency is massive accounting fraud and market manipulation.

They use the ""legacy ledger of fantasy fiat"" (ie, debt-backed ""currency"", endlessly printed out of thin air) - and the never-ending carrousel of the worldwide derivatives casino, currently worth around 1.2 *quadrillion* dollars - to ""paper over"" their losses, and to prevent anyone from discovering that **most major insurance firms like AXA - and most major banks - would _already_ be considered bankrupt,** if you counted only their real assets. (This is known as ""mark-to-market"" - which they hate to do. They much prefer to do ""mark-to-model"" which some people call ""mark-to-fantasy"" - ie, fraudulent accounting based on ""phantom"" assets"" and rampant market manipulation.)

So, it is public knowledge that nearly all ""too-big-to-fail"" financial companies like AXA (and [JPMorgan](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-06-29/jpm-just-cornered-commodity-derivative-market-and-time-we-have-proof)) would be considered [bankrupt](http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-entire-fiat-money-system-is-bankrupt-demise-of-the-global-us-fiat-dollar-reserve-currency/5356491) if their fraudulent accounting practices were exposed - which rely on the ""legacy ledger of fantasy fiat"" and the ""never-ending carrousel of the derivatives casino"" to maintain the façade of solvency:

&gt; If Bitcoin becomes a major currency, then tens of trillions of dollars on the ""legacy ledger of fantasy fiat"" will evaporate, destroying AXA, whose CEO is head of the Bilderbergers. This is the real reason why AXA bought Blockstream: to artificially suppress Bitcoin volume and price with 1MB blocks.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4r2pw5/if_bitcoin_becomes_a_major_currency_then_tens_of/

---

**Does AXA actually have the _means_ to to be suppressing the Bitcoin price... right now?**

Yes, they do!

For example, **AXA could decide to support economically ignorant devs like Greg Maxwell (CTO of Blockstream), Adam Back (CEO of Blockstream), and the other Core devs who support Blockstream's ""roadmap"" based on tiny blocks.**

---

**Wait - isn't AXA _already_ doing precisely that?**

Yes, they are!

As we all know, AXA has invested tens of millions of dollars in Blockstream, and Blockstream is indeed fighting tooth and nail against bigger blocks for Bitcoin.

&gt; Blockstream is now controlled by the Bilderberg Group - seriously! AXA Strategic Ventures, co-lead investor for Blockstream's $55 million financing round, is the investment arm of French insurance giant AXA Group - whose CEO Henri de Castries has been *chairman* of the Bilderberg Group since 2012.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/47zfzt/blockstream_is_now_controlled_by_the_bilderberg/

---

**So, how would artificially tiny blocks artificially suppress the Bitcoin price?**

This is pretty much based on common sense - plus it's also been formalized and roughly quantified in concepts involving networking and economics, such as [""Metcalfe's Law""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law).

Metcalfe's Law says pretty much what you'd expect it to say - ie: **the more people that use a system, the more valuable that system is.** 

More precisely: the value of a system is proportional to the *square* of the number of users in that system - which also makes sense, since when there are N users in a system, the number of connections between them is N*(N - 1)^2 which is ""on the order of"" N squared.

In fact, Metcalfe's Law has been shown to hold for various types of networks and markets - including faxes, internet, national currencies, etc.

---

**Does Metcalfe's Law apply to Bitcoin?**

Yes, it does!

The past 7 years of data also indicates - as predicted - that Metcalfe's Law also does indeed apply to Bitcoin as well.

Graphs show that during the 5 years *before* Blockstream got involved with trying to artificially suppress the Bitcoin price via their policy of artificially tiny blocks, **Bitcoin *prices* were roughly in proportion to the square of the (actual) Bitcoin *blocksizes*.**

&gt; Bitcoin has its own E = mc^2 law: Market capitalization is proportional to the square of the number of transactions. But, since the number of transactions is proportional to the (actual) blocksize, then Blockstream's artificial blocksize *limit* is creating an artificial market capitalization limit!

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4dfb3r/bitcoin_has_its_own_e_mc2_law_market/

During all those years, *actual* blocksizes were still low enough to not bump into the artificial ""ceiling"" of the *artificial* 1 MB ""max blocksize"" limit - which, remember, was only there as a temporary anti-spam measure, so it was deliberately set to be much *higher* than any actual blocksize, and everyone knew that this limit would be removed well before *actual* blocksizes started getting close to that 1 MB ""max blocksize"" limit.

But now that Bitcoin volume can't go up due to hitting the artificial ""max blocksize"" 1 MB limit (unless perhaps some people do *bigger-value* transactions), Bitcoin price also can't go up either:

&gt; Bitcoin's market *price* is trying to rally, but it is currently constrained by Core/Blockstream's artificial *blocksize* limit. Chinese miners can only win big by following the market - not by following Core/Blockstream. The market will always win - either with or without the Chinese miners.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ipb4q/bitcoins_market_price_is_trying_to_rally_but_it/

**So what does this all have to do with that meeting in Silicon Valley this weekend, between Core/Blockstream and the Chinese miners?**

This latest episode in the never-ending saga of the ""Bitcoin blocksize debates"" is yet another centralized, non-transparent, invite-only ~~stalling~~ non-scaling, no-industry-invited, no-solutions-allowed, ""friendly"" meeting being held this weekend - at [the very last moment  when Blockstream/Core failed to comply with the expiration date](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vi2yk/ladies_and_gentlemen_the_hong_kong_roundtable/) for their *previous* ~~stalling~~ non-scaling non-agreement:

&gt; The Fed/FOMC holds meetings to decide on money supply. Core/Blockstream &amp; Chinese miners now hold meetings to decide on money velocity. Both are centralized decision-making. Both are the wrong approach.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vfkpr/the_fedfomc_holds_meetings_to_decide_on_money/

&gt; So, on the expiration date of the HK stalling / non-scaling non-agreement, Viacoin scammer u/btcdrak calls a meeting with no customer-facing businesses invited (just Chinese miners &amp; Core/Blockstream), and no solutions/agreements allowed, and no transparency (just a transcript from u/kanzure). WTF!?

---

**What is the purpose of this meeting?**

The ""organizers"" and other people involved - u/btcdrak and u/maaku7 - say that this is just a ""friendly"" meeting - and it is specifically forbidden for any ""agreements"" (or scaling solutions) to come out of this meeting.

---

**What good is a meeting if no agreements or solutions can some out of it?**

Good question!

A meeting where solutions are explicitly prohibited is actually perfect for Blockstream's goals - because currently the status quo ""max blocksize"" is 1 MB, and they want to keep it that way.

So, they want to leverage the ""inertia"" to maintain the status quo - while pretending to do something, and getting friendly with the miners (and possibly making them other ""offers"" or ""inducements"").

So this meeting is just another stalling tactic, like all the previous ones.

Only now, after the community has seen this over and over, Blockstream has finally had to publicly admit that it is specifically forbidden for any ""agreements"" (or scaling solutions) to come out of this meeting - which makes it very obvious to everyone that this whole meeting is just an empty gesture.

---

**So, why is this never-ending shit-show still going on?**

Mainly due to inertia on the part of many users, and dishonesty on the part of Core/Blockstream devs.

Currently there is a vocal group of 57 devs and wannabe devs who are associated with Core/Blockstream - who refuse to remove the obsolete, temporary anti-spam measure (or ""kludge"") which historically restricted Bitcoin throughput to a 1 MB ""max blocksize"".

Somehow (via a combination of media manipulation, domain squatting, censorship, staged international Bitcoin ~~stalling~~ ""scaling"" meetings and congresses, fraudulent non-agreements, and other dishonest pressure tactics) they've managed to convince everyone that they can somehow dictate to everyone else how Bitcoin governance should be done.

&gt; /u/vampireban wants you to believe that ""a lot of people voted"" and ""there is consensus"" for Core's ""roadmap"". But he really means only 57 people voted. And most of them aren't devs and/or don't understand markets. Satoshi designed Bitcoin for *the economic majority* to vote - not just 57 people.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ecx69/uvampireban_wants_you_to_believe_that_a_lot_of/

Meanwhile, pretty much everyone else in Bitcoin - ie, everyone who's not involved with Blockstream - knows that Bitcoin can and should have bigger blocks by now, to enable increased adoption, volume, and price, as shown by the following points:

---

**(1) Most miners, and investors, and Satoshi himself, all expected Bitcoin to have much bigger blocks by now** - but these facts are censored on most of the media controlled by Core/Blockstream-associated devs and their friends:

&gt; Satoshi Nakamoto, October 04, 2010, 07:48:40 PM ""It can be phased in, like: if (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit / It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.""

&gt; The moderators of r\bitcoin have now removed a post which was just quotes by Satoshi Nakamoto.

**(2) Research has repeatedly shown that 4 MB blocks would work fine with people's existing hardware and bandwidth** - such as the Cornell study, plus empirical studies in the field done by /u/jtoomim:

**(3) Even leading Bitcoin figures such as Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell u/nullc and r\bitcoin ~~censor~~ moderator u/theymos have publicly stated that 2 MB blocks would work fine** (in their rare moments of honesty, before they somehow became corrupted):

&gt; /u/theymos 1/31/2013: ""I strongly disagree with the idea that changing the max block size is a violation of the 'Bitcoin currency guarantees'. Satoshi said that the max block size could be increased, and the max block size is never mentioned in any of the standard descriptions of the Bitcoin system""

&gt; ""Even a year ago I said I though we could probably survive 2MB"" - /u/nullc

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/43mond/even_a_year_ago_i_said_i_though_we_could_probably/

&gt; Greg Maxwell used to have intelligent, nuanced opinions about ""max blocksize"", until he started getting paid by AXA, whose CEO is head of the Bilderberg Group - the legacy financial elite which Bitcoin aims to disintermediate. Greg always refuses to address this massive conflict of interest. Why?

---

**So... What can we do now to stop giant financial institutions like AXA from artificially suppressing Bitcoin adoption, volume and price?**

It's not as hard as it might seem - but it might (initially) be a slow process!

First of all, more and more people can simply **avoid using crippled code with an artificially tiny ""max blocksize"" limit of 1 MB produced by teams of dishonest developers like Core/Blockstream who are getting paid off by AXA.**

Other, more powerful Bitcoin code is available - such as Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic:

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4089aj/im_working_on_a_project_called_bitcoin_classic_to/

In addition, proposals for massive on-chain scaling have also been proposed, implemented, and tested - such as Xthin:

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=xthin+author%3Apeter__r&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

---

**Hasn't the market already rejected other solutions like Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic?**

Actually, no!

If you only read r\bitcoin, you might not hear about lots of these promising new innovations - or you might hear people proclaiming that they're ""dead"".

But that forum r\bitcoin is not reliable, because it routinely censors any discussion of on-chain scaling for Bitcoin, eg:

&gt; The most upvoted thread right now on r\bitcoin (part 4 of 5 on Xthin), is default-sorted to show the most downvoted comments first. This shows that r\bitcoin is anti-democratic, anti-Reddit - and anti-Bitcoin.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4mwxn9/the_most_upvoted_thread_right_now_on_rbitcoin/

So, due to the combination of inertia (people tend to be lazy and cautious about upgrading their software, until they absolutely have to) and censorship, some people claim or believe that solutions like Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic have ""already"" been rejected by the community.

But actually, [Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited are already running seamlessly on the Bitcoin network](https://coin.dance/nodes) - and once they reach a certain predefined safe ""activation threshold"", the network will simply switch over to use them, upgrading from the artificially restrictive Bitcoin Core code:

&gt; Be patient about Classic. It's already a ""success"" - in the sense that it has been tested, released, and deployed, with 1/6 nodes already accepting 2MB+ blocks. Now it can quietly wait in the wings, ready to be called into action on a moment's notice. And it probably *will* be - in 2016 (or 2017).

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/44y8ut/be_patient_about_classic_its_already_a_success_in/

&gt; I think the Berlin Wall Principle will end up applying to Blockstream as well: (1) The Berlin Wall took *longer* than everyone expected to come tumbling down. (2) When it did finally come tumbling down, it happened *faster* than anyone expected (ie, in a matter of days) - and everyone was shocked.

**So what is the actual point of this weekend's meeting between Core/Blockstream and the Chinese Miners?**

It's mainly just for show, and ultimately a meaningless distraction - the result of desperation and dishonesty on the part of Core/Blockstream.

As mentioned above, real upgrades to Bitcoin like Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited have already been implemented and tested and [are already running on the Bitcoin network](https://coin.dance/nodes) - and the overall Bitcoin itself can and probably will switch over to them, regardless of any meaningless ""meetings"" and delaying tactics.

---

**Is it inevitable for Bitcoin to move to bigger blocks?**

Yes, for three reasons:

(1) As mentioned above, studies show that the underlying hardware and bandwidth will already easily support actual blocksizes of 2 MB, and probably 4 MB - and everyone actually agrees on this point, including die-hard supporters of tiny blocks such as Blockstream CTO Gregory Maxwell u/nullc, and r\bitcoin ~~censor~~ moderator u/theymos.

(2) The essential thing about a publicly held company is that it always seeks to maximize shareholder value - and, in a similar fashion, a publicly held cryptocurrency also always seeks to maximize ""coinholder"" value. 

(3) Even if Core/Blockstream continues to refuse to budge, the cat is already out of the bag - they can't put the toothpaste of open-source code back into the tube. Some people might sell their bitcoins for other cryptocurrencies which have better scaling - but a better solution would probably be to wait for a ""spinoff"" to happen. A ""spinoff"" is a special kind of ""hard fork"" where the existing ledger is preserved, so your coins remain spendable on both forks, and you can trade your coins on markets, depending on which fork you prefer.  

Further information on ""spinoff technology"" can be found here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563972.0

https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Abitco.in%2Fforum+spinoff&amp;ia=web

An excellent discussion of the *economic* advantages of using a ""spinoff"" to keep the original ledger (and merely upgrade the ledger-appending software), can be found here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=678866.0

And today, based on new information learned from Ethereum's recent successful ""hardfork split"", people are already starting to talk about the specific details involved in implementing a ""spinoff"" or ""hardfork split"" for Bitcoin to support bigger blocks - eg, changing the PoW, getting exchanges to support trading on both sides of the fork, upgrading wallets, preventing replay attacks, etc:

&gt; We now know the miners aren't going to do anything. We now know that a minority fork can survive. Why are we not forking right now? 

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vieve/we_now_know_the_miners_arent_going_to_do_anything/

So - whether it's via a hardfork *upgrade*, or a hardfork *split* or ""spinoff"" - it is probably inevitable that Bitcoin will eventually move to bigger blocks (within the underlying hardware and bandwidth constraints of course - which would currently support 2-4 MB blocksizes).

---

**Why are bigger blocks inevitable for Bitcoin?**

Because that's how markets always have and always will behave - and there's nothing that Blockstream/Core or AXA can do to stop this - no matter how many pointless ~~stalling~~ scaling meetings they conduct, and no matter how many non-agreements they sign and then break.

---

**Conclusion**

**Endless centralized meetings and dishonest agreements are irrelevant. The only thing that matters is decentralized markets and open-source code. Users and markets decide on what code to install, and what size blocks to accept. Bitcoin adoption, volume - and price - will continue to grow, with or without the cooperation of the dishonest devs from Core/Blockstream, or misguided miners - or banksters at ""fantasy fiat"" financial firms like JPMorgan or AXA.**",cryptocurrency,1470007815
