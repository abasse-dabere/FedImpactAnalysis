personalfinance,How much of my savings should I throw at my loans?,"Hello, friends!

I am a recent college graduate with around 23k debt. I am trying to wrap my mind around the best way to go about paying off my college loans. I have done my best at self-educating myself with persona finance and online resources, but I would love your input as well.

I graduated a semester early and saved up 12k from working and living on the frugal side the last 6 months. This coming year I am doing a year of service program, working at a non-profit in my desired field of interest to gain experience while they pay my basic living expenses (in an expensive city, so it ends up being worth it). 
During this time my room &amp; board, food, insurance, etc will be covered, but I will only receive a $275 stipend per month. I expect to spend $50-75 of this on between public transportation, phone, &amp; misc. I religiously follow /frugal, so I feel like that is an adequate amount.

I will be deferring my 0% interest loan for the year, but I would like to continue payments on my other loans (with the remaining $200 of my stipend). 

I am already aware of the the snowball vs. avalanche method and want to pay off my highest interest rates first. I have the following loans with the designated interest rates:

1.) 3,850 (0%)
2.) 4,551 (3.61%)
3.) 1,786  (4.04%)
4.) 5,460 (4.41%)
5.) 2,137 (4.41%)
6.) 4,274 (4.41%)
7) 1,000 (5%)

My grace period ended recently, so repayment began. My repayment plan entails $100 towards the loan #1 (private - but like I said, I can defer) and about $200 towards the remainder federal loans as a 10 year payment plan. I would like to pay them off as soon as possible though in order to avoid interest. 

Questions:

1. Would it be wise to throw some of my savings at my loans? If so, how much? I am paranoid at the accrual of interest. My first thought would be to throw it at the 1k (5%) at the very least.

2. If I do, is it better to throw money at my high interest loans equally, or focus on one specific loan to pay off in full? Thinking about my credit, does it look better to be making payments on a higher number of loans across a longer period of time vs. decreasing the number of loans I have over the years? I am not sure if I am articulating that in the best way...

Other relevant info:

I have two credit cards: one I have had for 4+ years and the other I have had for almost 2. I treat them like debit cards and pay them off in full each month. That has helped me build a credit score of 620+ so far, and I would like to continue to build it up.

After the program ends, my plans are up in the air. I may pursue graduate school (in said expensive city), work for awhile if I am offered a job at my placement, or travel abroad through similar service programs.

I appreciate any feedback you have to offer, thanks!",finance,1470012470

personalfinance,"New Military Officer, $25K in student loan debt, should I use USAA loan (2.99%) to pay it all off?","I have 2 parent plus loans (~$11K at 6.41% and ~$6K at 7.9%) and 2 private loans (totaling ~$8K at 5%), which adds up to right at $25K total.

I am looking into taking out the USAA Career Starter loan.  It is a $25K loan at a fixed interest of 2.99% and repaid over 5 years.  I am thinking that I should take it out, pay off the private and parent loans in full (it's just enough to take care of them completely).  

This would leave me with a $425 payment for the USAA loan, plus ~$145/mo for my federal loans ($38K).  This total monthly payment ($575) is only $80 more than what I was going to be paying, and according to my quick calculations, I'd save ~6K in interest if I pay it off over 5 years.

personalfinance,Landlord has 3 checks 6 mos-1yr old undeposited- what to do?,"Hello Personal Finance, 

Long time lurker first time poster. 

My landlord owns several large homes that have been converted to small apartment units. I have been living in this unit for 3 years and the building has never been in fantastic shape but he is generally responsive. About a year ago his wife left him. He told me and some of the other tenants about it- rough situation, I think they have a few kids. In the year since, he has been extremely late depositing checks and now has a some of mine outstanding. The unit above me has ben empty for a year (though there was a week when I'm pretty sure some pests moved in). While it is annoying from a budgeting perspective, I just always remember the absolute minimum amount that must be in that checking account and deal with it (kind of being nonspecific with the number of months here because of what I am about to ask).

The issue now is that I am moving across the country and at least one of the checks he has is one year old. In the spring I offered to re-write and resend the checks in case he lost them, but there was no response. I have honestly stopped telling him which months in hopes he has forgotten or lost track and that I * might * be able to keep the money. I don't want to short change him at all, but he also alluded to half the units being empty in my building this year because ""I am getting divorced this year so it is ok if my income is lower."" Are we (his tenants, there are others in the same situation) caught in the middle of a family dispute? What is his recourse like if I keep the money? I could put this money to good use!

I have sincerely tried to pay this guy but am also fed up with the inconvenience he has caused me. I am moving out soon and wonder if I should offer to write the checks one final time or just wait for him to say/do something. This has now dragged on, but I wanted to hear what personal finance thinks about this. I suspect he doesn't know who owes him what as the deposits he has made have no rhyme or reason. I am tempted to just give him my forwarding info, hold onto the money for some 'safe' amount of time, then use it if I never hear from him. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this! Please let me know if I've left anything out- I am trying to spare specifics but am in a weird position. Thanks!",finance,1470018546
personalfinance,US Student financing graduate school in Switzerland or Austria?,"Hello PF! I'm exploring options for graduate school, and I'm running into a roadblock for financing foreign schools. 

**Background**

I'm nearing the end of my undergrad at a private college on the East Coast. My parents have funded my education, and they will be doing the same for my sister, who is 2 years younger. Because I know they'll be paying for her, I'd like to fund grad school on my own, as much as possible. 


**Plan**

While I would love the idea of getting a good job right out of college, I can't count on that, so I'm also looking at graduate school. The universities I'm looking at (the University of St. Gallen and the University of Economics and Business in Vienna, for example) are not eligible for the use of U.S. federal aid, but the tuition itself isn't really the problem. The tuition rates at both are below $1,000 per semester, and the masters programs I'm interested in (business and/or economics) take 3-4 semesters. $3,500 - $4,000 total tuition for two years, and that's about the extent of what I could afford if I started paying today. But the cost of living in these countries is higher, so the expenses I'm really concerned about are living and eating for 24 months in Europe, without knowing when I will be employed. 


My parents are doing really well financially, and they have always been happy to help... but I'd rather not pull more money from them. (I guess I would consider *borrowing* the money, with amount and payments set beforehand, from them as a last resort... but I know this sub isn't big on loaning between family members.)


Is there a certain type of loan I should be looking at for this, or is this simply one of those situations where you need to save up before attempting graduate school? Either way, I thought you guys would know best. 

Thanks for your help, and I'll try to edit for formatting and other information as needed.",finance,1470020904

* Target Housing Market = 120K - 150K Home in Fresno, California

I want to buy a house. Zillow estimates that I can get a home with a lower mortgage than my rent with insurance and taxes without any money down. I've never purchased a home before. I've been told that there are programs available to help me. 

I'm paying my debt down at a very slow rate. I only reduce it by about $100 a month. I'm considering reducing my 401K contributions to 6% to get my employer's contribution (just enough to snag the maximum employer contribution). The 4% reduction will be used to pay down my debt. It seems that would help me pay down an additional $100 per month. I lose the 4-5% I'd make off my 401k, but I am gaining traction on my CC debt which has a substantially higher interest rate. 

I should mention that my debt is from school expenses that I no longer incur.

Some questions I have are:

1. Which loan would be better to take? (I know the Stafford is probably better regarding the interest rate, but I don't know anything about the Direct PLUS 1 loans)
1. Should I take out extra money in loans to pay for rent and other expenses or just take out enough to pay for tuition and books?
1. Should I save money to create a savings lump sum? (My current savings are ~$4000)
1. Should I try to make payments now even though it would take money out of my savings?

btc,"Remember when Bitcoin was to be ruled by ""math not men""? Whether you support bigger or smaller blocks, and whether you're ""short"" Bitcoin (you want the price to go down, so you can buy), or ""long"" (you want the price to go up, so you can sell) - you should still support *decentralized* governance.","**Why should you support decentralized governance?**

Because otherwise, the people involved in these centralized ""meetings"" (ie, the miners and the devs jetting around the world, making ""important"" decisions on things like ""max blocksize"" without your input) will become ""insiders"" - who can easily manipulate the price to make profits - behind your back, and at your expense.

**The potential for manipulation**

In the past, I've communicated with several experienced old-time traders and consultants from Wall Street regarding Bitcoin.

And many of them say they won't touch Bitcoin with a ten-foot pole because it's quite obvious to them that (in the absence of regulation), a new asset class like Bitcoin is horribly vulnerable to all sorts of behind-the-scenes manipulation.

They've seen it all before. They know all the ins and outs of how people with ""insider information"" can rig the market - and they can already see plenty of warning signs and alarm bells showing how easy it would be to pull off this kind of market manipulation in Bitcoin.

Now, I'm not in favor of government regulation for Bitcoin. I believe that it should be as self-regulating as possible.

But the only way to do this is if we get the governance and the software right.

Basically, what this probably boils down to is ""baking in"" a bit more governance into the software itself - so that things can be decided by everyone in the market as a whole, rather than by a small group of people at a private meeting.

**Ethereum said ""code is law"", and Bitcoin said it would be governed ""by math, not by men"". But now look where we've ended up.**

In the case of Ethereum, the promise was ""code is law"" - but then they discovered that the DAO code could be hacked, which raised difficult questions about how to interpret what the ""law"" really means.

In the case of Bitcoin (for those of us who remember that far back), the promise was to be ""governed by math, not men"". 

Now flash-forward to the present.

After being stable for weeks, the price abruptly dropped by $30-40 today.

This was apparently due to broken promises from some meeting in Hong Kong in February, followed by another ""friendly"", ""invite-only"" meeting in Silicon Valley today - where [previously promised solutions weren't delivered, and it was explicitly forbidden to offer any new ones](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vfkpr/the_fedfomc_holds_meetings_to_decide_on_money/d5y5co4).

So now, we're getting a vivid reminder that the ""max blocksize"" limit (as it currently stands) is a constant, hard-coded in a program, by a centralized group of programmers and miners - who are all fallible human beings, possessed by normal human drives and foibles and obligations, such as fear and greed, ego and hubris, payments to make and mouths to feed.

This means that a handful of insiders can easily manipulate this ""max blocksize"" number - deciding whether and when and how it will get changed, and how much, and how often - so they could potentially manipulate the price - depending on their own personal preferences.

For example, they could be ""long"" on Bitcoin and want to sell - or they could be ""short"" on Bitcoin and want to buy - or maybe they're just not terribly bright - or maybe they're into bike-shedding - or maybe they're just having a bad day - or a bad life.

Whatever the reason, in the end, they're going to keep on injecting *their* central planning and *their* personal preferences into *your* store of value, *your* medium of exchange. 

And as long as you continue to accept this idea that *they* have the right to jet around the world, dictating how *you* can use your monetary system today - they're going to keep right on doing it.

Now, most of us do accept that certain parameters like a ""max blocksize"" could probably change at some point in the future - depending on the needs of the market, and the capacity of the hardware.

**Our mission right now should be to make sure that the process for changing such a parameter is as decentralized as possible.**

Currently, that's far from being the case. 

But - no matter what you personally think or hope that number should be - you should support the idea that the *process* for determining that number should be as decentralized as possible.

**Today, a bunch of devs and miners flew to an invitation-only meeting to (not) talk about setting this number.**

[*You* weren't invited to this meeting (or the previous one in February) - but the following ""colorful"" cast of characters were](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vgwe7/so_on_the_expiration_date_of_the_hk_stalling/):

- some guy who ""volunteered"" to manually ""transcribe"" the meeting (u/kanzure) - in lieu of providing a transparent, untamperable recording - who has publicly shown [a powerful animosity towards another dev (not invited to the meeting)](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vffk4/kanzure_on_twitter_typed_19490_words_today_short/d5y6rcd) who many think has done a lot of important work involving on-chain scaling (u/Peter__R who has worked on [Bitcoin Unlimited](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=%22bitcoin+unlimited%22&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and [Xthin](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=xthin+author%3Apeter__r&amp;restrict_sr=on)).

Like the title of this posts says, it doesn't actually matter whether you support bigger or smaller blocks, or whether you're ""short"" or ""long"" on Bitcoin. 

It doesn't matter whether you're using Bitcoin to accept payments for your business - or doing ""dollar cost averaging"" to buy a little every week to put away for the future - or using cold storage to save for your retirement or for your kid's college education - or trying your hand at using ""technical analysis"" to do some day trading to see if you can outsmart the market.

It's hard enough trying to deal with day-to-day events and budget for your future and analyze the market and understand the economy - without also having to factor in stuff like: whether u/btcdrak and u/maaku7 and u/luke-jr and u/adam3us and u/kanzure might happen to be ""long"" or ""short"" on Bitcoin - or whether some of them might be simply clueless or out to lunch or got up on the wrong side of the bed today.

**Remember how Bitcoin was supposed to be?**

If you remember back to when you first got into Bitcoin, one thing that we all *did* at least agree on back then was the promise that it was shield us from many human idiosyncracies in our previous monetary systems - all the centralized invitation-only committees run by shady central bankers, with their back-room deals, meeting privately with no transparency, setting monetary policy affecting *your* life, behind your back and without your input.

So... we thought we had forever escaped terrifying economic curses such as [the Keynesian Beauty Contest](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=keynesian+beauty+contest&amp;t=hd&amp;ia=about) and [the Greenspan Put](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=greenspan+put&amp;t=hd&amp;ia=about) and [the Hank Paulson TARP](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=larry+paulson+TARP&amp;t=hd&amp;ia=web) and [the Krugman Liquidity Trap](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=krugman+liquidity+trap&amp;t=hd&amp;ia=web) and [the Cyprus Haircut](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cyprus+haircut&amp;t=hd&amp;ia=images) and [the Brexit Slump](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=brexit+slump&amp;t=hd&amp;ia=news) etc. etc. - only to turn around and find out that we may have jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire, as we are now being haunted by even *more* terrifying curses such as the [u/Btcdrak Scam](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/42depj/whats_the_story_with_the_viacoin_scam_anyone_one/) and [u/Maaku7 Macroeconomics](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/41j818/core_dev_umaaku7_is_on_the_front_page_today_for/) and [the u/Luke-Jr Pedantic Semantics](https://np.reddit.com/r/bitcoin_uncensored/comments/492ztl/lukejr_the_only_religion_people_have_a_right_to/) and the [u/Kanzure Transcript](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vjvgo/75_pages_of_transcript_typed_for_a_social_meeting/) and [the Adam Back Flip](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=adam+signed&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and [the Theymos Dictatorship](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=theymos+censorship&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) and [the van der Laan Paralysis](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/497ug6/the_official_maintainer_of_bitcoin_core_wladimir/) - all under the ever-present dismal shadow of [the Tragedy of Gregonomics](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/46052e/adam_back_greg_maxwell_are_experts_in_mathematics/) - and brought to you and paid for by [the Fantasy Fiat of AXA](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=axa&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).

**Is there a solution?**

As you can see from all of the above, the main problem facing Bitcoin right now is **centralized governance.**

Of course, code inevitably does have to be (centrally) written by *someone.*

But there *are* things we *can* do *right now* to minimize the amount of centralized intervention in Bitcoin's code and governance.

**Whenever possible, we can and should favor code which requires a *minimum* of centralized interference.**

Core/Blockstream have basically spent the past year or two tying themselves up in knots, and disrupting the community and the market - and maybe even suppressing the price - due to [their stubborn, selfish, destructive refusal to provide parameterized code where the market can set certain values on its own](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ttmk3/reminder_previous_posts_showing_that_blockstreams/) - most notably, the ""maximum blocksize"".

Meanwhile, code such as Bitcoin Unlimited (and also Bitcoin Classic, once it adopts BitPay's Adaptive Blocksize Limit) puts the ""governance"" for things like ""max blocksize"" back where it belongs - in the hands of the users, in the marketplace. 

Using more-parameterized code is an obvious technique known by anyone who has taken a ""Programming 101"" course.

Everyone knows that parameterized code is the easiest way to let the market set some parameters - avoiding the dangers of having these parameters set behind closed doors by a centralized cartel of powerful people.

We can and should all work together to make this a reality again - by adopting more-parameterized code such as Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic.

This will allow us to realize the original promise of Bitcoin - where **""The Users and the Market Decide - Not Central Planners.""**",cryptocurrency,1470032755

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt: The Next US Bubble,"Back in September 2008, we all witnessed the Housing Bubble collapse and how it affected our economy. If you watch ""The Big Short"" (actually on Netflix now) it'll give you an idea of how this happened (in layman's terms). I'm actually an accountant so I preferred a little more in depth information on the catalyst for that event; Ryan Gosling even narrates at one point: ""...listen. This is all boring stuff I know. You don't care about the numbers"". I literally said ""excuse me?"" and got a little offended. But I digress. The student loan deficit in this country is just the same skunk as the housing bubble just sprayed with cologne. Students and post-students everywhere are unable to pay their loans (just like the mortgages of the 2000's). It's only a matter of time before this next bubble collapses and we enter another recession. My current struggle:
$54,000 in B.A. Student Loan Debt
$3640-4000 monthly take home (my wife and I)

personalfinance,got into car accident but just got a promotion. what to do with new car payment?,"little background. i had about $5k in credit card debt so i got a loan with a lower interest rate to pay it off. Then i was in an unfortunate car accident and totaled my truck. It was an older truck that my parents had so i didn't owe anything on it. hilariously got a promotion that same week. decided to take the money from the insurance and pay off the loan and small amount of CC debt because they have about 11% and 16% interest rates. Got a used car and financed the whole thing instead of putting anything down from the insurance money i got because i would rather pay off the debt with the higher interest rate. now the only debt i have is this car which after everything came to about 15k at 3% interest. should i just go nuts throwing any and all money at the car payment, or just look at it like rent, you gotta have a place to live? i have been living on about 22-25k a year for god knows how long and am happy but with this promotion i am now making 38k, which is more than i have ever made ever. i live with roommates who are awesome and all my bills are taken care of with about 900$ a month. so, put money into savings or investments, or just throw it all at car?",finance,1470059817
personalfinance,Upcoming student loan debt,"Hello PF!
I am a rising senior and will be graduating next May with a degree in Civil Engineering. Unfortunately my brother and I are the first two in our entire family to go to college and my parents did not really have anything saved up to help us pay for school. Almost all of my education is funded off of private loans (parents consigned). I will have around 90k in debt when I graduate. Currently the interest rates are pretty ridiculous (~8.5%) so I will be looking into refinancing these loans for a lower interest rate when I graduate. I have about $5,000 saved up as an emergency fund. My credit score is right around 700 and hopefully will continue to improve before I graduate. I don't have much knowledge on refinancing so do you think it will be possible to get a lower interest rate fairly easily. Currently through school my parents are just paying the interest each month so I am grateful for that. I have worked at an internship the last two years and will hopefully receive and offer from here which will start at around 50k pre tax. Rent and other expenses shouldn't be more than 2k a month max for everything so I plan on putting any extra money towards loans since I already have an ok emergency fund. Can anyone else share any similar experience advise or if you just have knowledge on this type of thing that will be helpful too. I just am worried about the current interest rates. Thanks for any help you can provide!",finance,1470059875
personalfinance,"I need to pull my finances together, advice needed.","To start off, I'm 21, haven't gone to college, so no major debt, and only making 30k a year.

Bills are 425 for rent, 89 for my phone, $55-65 for a monthly bus pass, and $80 for one of my best friends who I work with that also picks me up in the morning, and whatever my credit card bill is, as of today it's $300... Which is my limit. There is also like an $83 hospital bill that I need to pay as well, and I'm not that guy that just lets it sit and ignores it.

I make 14.50 an hour and it's a secure job, but I'm paid twice a month, not bi-weekly: semi-monthly, so that means i get paid for 80, 88, or 96 hours each pay period. If it helps with math, I think I'm in the &lt;18k tax bracket for now, which I think is 10%

I put 12% of each check into my 401k automagically, employer matches .50 for every $1, up to 6%, so that seems ok for me and it will be 100% vested after four years of service. They offer a Roth 401k, but I don't know if that's the right option for me. I'm bad with finances, obviously.

$20 goes to NY state for extra withholding, and $25 to Federal each pay period, and I had $10 a week going to NY from my part time job.

I have medical, dental, and vision insurance taken automatically pre-tax every pay period. I basically pay around 175 a month for insurance

Now, this is going to make me sound like an idiot but I have no money saved, I seriously need to move out of my apartment to live closer to work,  but I also need a car, and a license on top of that. I just put in my two-weeks notice for my part time job that I worked on weekends because I'm getting even more depressed from lack of me-time. Main job sucks too, or rather, it sucks because I get there two hours early, and get home almost 3 hours after leaving. It sucks, but money... And a static schedule. 

Anyway, I figured that my money spending issue  was caused by me eating at the work cafeteria, and going out to eat... Which has mostly stopped, so that's good, and I made the mistake of thinking that my credit would go up if I would spend all of my credit limit and just pay the entire bill, and I haven't missed a payment yet, I pay that sucker the second I get paid. This week is my first check of the month, so that means cell phone is paid, and I have to pay like... 450-whatever to Verizon from a cancellation fine from earlier this year (Fuck you Sprint for not sending me that $350 gift card for switching over, and telling me it was too late after it went on too long!), and then $80 to my friend, and another bus pass, so that's around 675 tops... And then I presumably starve to death until my next check, which is rent and the credit bill, so 725. And then after that I can start being an adult and not being an idiot with my money.

But it's like... I don't know where to start, or how to budget, and I feel like a loser. I downloaded that Mint app, but that was just depressing and the ATM emails pissed me off. I really need to get away from my family and be on my own for personal and possibly gay reasons, but mostly because my mood goes from 100 to -4,000,667.1337 whenever I'm home. I'm hoping to be out on my own with a roommate before November 15th, since that means unlimited overtime until January 31st, so that's big bucks for me, and that means I can definitely have money saved for a decent first vehicle, which I'm definitely buying because fuck leasing and sneaky snake car salesmen.

personalfinance,How do I determine if I should refinance my mortgage?,"I bought my first house in May/June 2013 through a 203k FHA loan. I only put down like 3% so I am paying MIP of about $200/month.

It's possible that my LTV is at or close to 78% already due to renovations that I completed through the 203k loan and the neighborhood being gentrified (new houses being built around me all the time). However, the MIP is mandatory on my loan for at least 5 years even if the LTV is at 78% before then.

So I have at least another 2 years to pay the MIP before I can have it appraised and potentially cancel the MIP payments if the LTV is at 78%. That's $4800 in MIP payments over the next two years.

My current interest rate is 3.25%.

I am wondering if it would make sense to look into refinancing now, rather than waiting another two years to drop the MIP. My interest rate is pretty low already, and I'm not even sure if my house is worth what I think it is.

How do I go about determining what my best course of action is? If it makes more sense to keep my current mortgage and continue paying the MIP, I will do that, I just don't want to pay $4800 over the next two years if I could actually save money by refinancing now.

Any advice would be appreciated, or even knowing who to call to discuss the specifics of my loan. Should I contact my credit union and tell them I'm interested in refinancing my mortgage through them, and have them look into everything for me? Call banks and do the same thing? Call my current mortgage servicer (would that be the small local mortgage company I used or PHFA which is where I send payments?)",finance,1470061607

politics,Former US Presidents discussion series - Part XIII,"Hi /r/politics!

The 2016 Presidential election is shaping up to be one of the more interesting this country has seen in decades.  While the candidates and their supporters spend the coming months campaigning for the highest office in the land, we thought it would be fun to take a look at the Presidents throughout our history and how events during their administration impacted politics of their time as well as how they affect the politics of today.

Each week we will feature *at least* two presidents for you to discuss (if discussion goes stale we will move on to the next one early). We'll list a few common things about each one ; age, term, political affiliation, etc.  In addition we've chosen 4 things that happened during the presidents campaign or administration as starting points for your discussion.  In some cases we've chosen those things because they are significant events/firsts in US history.  In others we chose them because we thought those things would be of interest to you, the /r/politics subscriber.

We wanted to keep this simple and relatively easy to set up each week so we didn't write out a bunch of text on each president.  Instead we linked to primary sources (where available) or a wikipedia article in a crunch.  You're more than welcome and encouraged to discuss other events that we didn't list.  Please remember our [comment civility rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_comment_rules) are in effect.  Have fun!

For 10 years, we tried to have a baby.  Every shot was 1,000..procedures were close to 25,000 total.  Being depressed, I spent money too.
After giving up, with no fertility treatment, I got pregnant and lost her.  A year to the day later, I got pregnant and she came 9 weeks early.
I occurred a ton of bills during this time.  To be honest, until I sat down and computed them, I had no idea.

personalfinance,Consolidating only some student loans?,"Hello PF,

I've researched around for information on whether I can choose which student loans to consolidate, or if all eligible ones are automatically consolidated if I choose to go that route.

[Here is a list of all loans I have out](http://imgur.com/a/EZ3JY) (including Parent PLUS which I agreed to pay off myself).

What I want to do is consolidate the stafford + Perkins loans, except for the 6.8% interest one, and apply for PAYE repayment plan. I wanted to leave the 6.8% stafford so that I can get it paid off. The others all have low enough interest rates that the weighted interest rate would be low enough that I don't mind losing the sub 4% rates.

The Parents Plus ones would be tackled second after the 6.8% stafford, since the stafford would be easier to pay off. Then redirect all available monies to the consolidated loan.

To conclude, can I select which loans to consolidate? I so, does the plan sound reasonable?

Based in australia 
So my partner and I earn about 85k a year so about 6 to 7 k a month which is good! But we currently have a mix of loans that equal to a little over 80k. 

So our biggest loan is just under 40k at freaking 18%! I pay over $600 a month in interest alone with 6 years remaining on it I've been paying it off doing more then the minimum.
But the question is I have a car that i brought brand new 2 years ago for 36k and now only worth 20k should I sell this car as I've been contemplating it for a while now and honestly put the whole 20k onto my loan and buy a cheap run around for the mean time as my partner has a good car that's worth 25k which I want to keep. 

I've been doing a budget the last few months and we have a disposable income at the end of the month of around 2k to put towards debt so in saying that should I sell my car for the 20k try and pay the extra 20k in 6-8 months make the 40k loan disappear in 6-8 months? Then put what ever else money I have towards our other loans debt which are lower interest rates... I honestly think this is a good idea or should I just keep putting the extra 2k left over towards the debt pay off the loan in 2 years (hopefully) and then work on the others, I just don't know if I should cut my losses with buying the new car or not.

personalfinance,Should I restructure my auto loan,"I recently (6 months ago) purchased a new car.  The Mazda CX-3 to be exact.  FYI - I LOVE the car.  It fits my personal needs perfectly and is most importantly FUN to drive.  

With a decent down payment of $5,000 I took out a loan for the remaining $20,022.24. My credit at the time was good-ish with a score of 708.  After a 1.90% annual interest rate my total amount due at the end of 5 years is $21,195. My loan has monthly payments of $353.26.  The first 4 months (May-August) I made double payments of $706.52.  Technically my next payment due is in December... Go me!

My question is, should I restructure my loan to reduce the duration of the loan, while keeping the monthly payments the same to reduce the amount of compound interest owed.  I am sure my credit score has gone up since taking out and paying the loan in advance on a monthly basis so I would get a better interest rate as well.  Should I wait a few months so the bank sees I made a year's worth of payments in 6 months?  Or should I wait a year to show I made 2 years payments?  Or should I go in now to show 8 months paid off in 4?

My rationale in keeping the monthly payments the same is that fiscally I can afford to pay the $706 a month but should something occur and I couldn't the extra $353 I am paying could be used for other purposes.

personalfinance,Should I get a part time job in addition to my full time salary?,"Hey everyone, I am thinking about getting a another job to work weekends. So basically, I just want to find out if you all think I'm crazy or not. 

So a little about me:

Mid twenties

Currently working full time salary professional office job 58k per year. with bonuses, that creeps up to 60.

Per month after taxes and payroll deductions I net around $2,800. Since I get paid biweekly, 2 months of the year I have 3 paychecks.
Rent:600
Student loans:1000
All other expenses:500

So I'm left with around 700 each month of which I usually will put some into savings and some towards student loan principal. 

Interest rates on my student loans average about 5.2 percent and I have a total remaining balance of about 85k. 

I currently have about 5.5k in a liquid savings and $1,800 in an trading account in equity stocks.

The reason I'd want to take on a part time job is because I really want to be out from under this student debt. Assuming 11 an hour and 16 hrs per week, that's another 8.5k gross per year meaning I could probably get student loans paid off a year earlier or something.

I realize that it would really suck to give up my free time on weekends, especially since I would probably only be able to make 10-11 bucks an hour. I'd really like to hear from some of you who have done this and whether or not you have regrets. Any and all advice is appreciated, thanks.

personalfinance,"21 year old student in loan debt, but making money. Should I invest?","Hello PersonalFinance,

I've been following the sub for quite some time now, and have taken most applicable and good advice thus far.

I'm a fourth year Computer Engineering major at a top university in the California Bay Area. I'm doing alright in school (~3.3 GPA, expecting to finish above 3.5 this coming year). I have been receiving pretty decent financial aid, but have had to take out about a little less than $20,000 in subsidized (luckily) federal loans to cover the rest (including rent [~$800/month], food[$90/month], and school).
I don't really like asking my parents for money, and never have. They need it more than I do frankly. 

Over the summer I received an engineering internship where I'll have over $10,000 saved by the end of the summer in a month or so. I also make money on the side as a freelance white-hat hacker, and it pays well when it happens.

I've always been interested in investing the little money I've had. I never spend too much money on anything except for a new computer if I need it, or my cheap hobbies. I have tried investing in precious metals, but it's not as fast paced as I'd like it to be.

Should I, a student in debt, worry about my loans before investing anything, or would it be safe to put a small investment into something with the little spare cash I have until the end of the school year when I have to pay the loans back. I've figured that I should have about $4,000 spare by the end of the year with my savings and loans.

My job prospects are looking pretty good right now, and I'm not too worried about the loans in the long run what so ever. 

Does anyone also have any advice on how to live frugally after college in the Silicon Valley, and when a good time to buy house, car, etc. would be?

personalfinance,Consolidating/Refinancing my student loans,"Hello, I'm trying to get a lower interest rate and pay off my student loans quicker. Let me start by listing my debt:

 * $3000 student loan under my name over 5 years and 5% interest
 * $24000 student loan under my name over 10 years and ~5% interest
 * $40000 student loan under my parents name over 25 years and ~5% interest
 * $24000 auto loan under my name over 5 years and 0.9% interest

I was wondering if it was possible to consolidate my 2 smaller student loans and auto loan to get a smaller lifetime payment. I was thinking for a 5 year plan for those. If I couldn't manage to get something good with those 3 consolidated, maybe only consolidated the 2 smaller student loan payments and pay them off in 5 years.

Would I be able to just get a personal loan? Or are there student loan refinancing channels i need to go through? Sorry if this is confusing I dont know much about this and would just like to pay this off as fast as I can, while paying as little as possible.",finance,1470076501

Reading through PF, I noticed you guys really take into consideration the whole of a person's financial situation to give the best advice, so I'll share a little beyond just the housing stuff.

I have student debt - $55,000 in private/federal - fixed between 3.25% and 8.125% (blerg)
We have a mortgage - $156,000 - fixed at 3.125%
and a down payment assistance loan - $12,000 - fixed at 3.125%

Outside of this, we have no other debt.  We both hold professional positions and can afford to put $2,000 per month on the mortgages.  Right now I'm also putting ~$600 monthly on my student debt.

Questions:

1.  How should our $2,000 be divided between the mortgage and DAP so that we pay the least amount of interest in the shortest amount of time?
2.  I held off on refinancing my student loans until after the mortgage dust settled, but should I refinance my student debt and risk losing federal benefits?  If so, any recommendations on a company to look at?

personalfinance,Mortgage refinance term,"I am planning on refinancing my 30 year VA mortgage using the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan. My current mortgage has an interest rate of 4.75% and a maturity date of March 2041. The house is currently an investment property with tenants under lease until June 2017. The rent is around $100 more than the mortgage payment.

I am being offered from my current lender 3.5% with no refinance costs, which I understand is a higher rate than I could qualify for but a lower rate there would be out of pocket costs. I don't think I want to extend to length of my current mortgage. For a 25 year loan which extends my term 6 months there is a $110 a month savings or for a 20 year term which takes off 4.5 years it will increase $15.

My question is which is the better option for me at this point. I am on the fence about whether to keep the house beyond this lease as I am no longer in the area and I'm not sure the hassle of finding a new tenant is worth the small profit I currently earn. Or should I extend the loan to 30 and get an even lower payment?

personalfinance,"Resident physician, 215k debt, save or pay?","Long time lurker but thought time to pose a question to the majority. So I am a third year emergency medicine resident physician, who fortunately had a full ride to undergrad but unfortunately had to take loans for med school. Now, my parents helped me significantly so the only loans I required were only for tuition, but that still places me at the ever pretty 215k debt range. These are federal loans, 2 groups, one a 25k total and the other at 190k total.

So to the question...I have approximately 20k in savings in addition to another 35k in an investment portfolio managed by my dad (has his own financial planning company). In his mind, as he has managed money for numerous physicians over the years, I should worry about paying what I can right now based off the payment plan, which is approximately 400 a month, and whatever I can afford, as most EM physicians as attendings, which can easily pull in the high 200k to low 300k salary range, can knock out a debt that high in a few years after residency provided they don't spend like idiots after making serious money.

My thought is whether I should take some of the money I have saved and invested and pay off the 25k loan now and spare some headache down the road. I should add that both of these loans are 6.8% interest, and refinancing is near impossible giving that amount of debt without a cosigner, of which I have no interest.

&gt;(1) The employer is required or empowered to do so by state or federal law; or

&gt;(2) The deductions are for medical, surgical or hospital care or service, without financial benefit to the employer, and are openly, clearly and in due course recorded in the employers' books; or

&gt;(3) The employer has a signed authorization by the employee for deductions for a lawful purpose accruing to the benefit of the employee, except that the Department, upon finding that it is acting in the public interest, may, by regulation, prohibit such withholding or diverting for such purpose. If the Department abuses its discretion and acts arbitrarily and without any reasonable ground, any aggrieved person may institute a civil action in the Superior Court to have such regulation declared null and void.

She said that she would call the department of labor to see how to continue, and that this might constitute as stealing. Also, I never knew training manuals had to be returned?

http://wallstreetonparade.com/2016/08/u-s-economy-was-growing-at-the-slowest-pace-since-ww-ii-now-its-worse/

According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the Great Recession (that was brought on by the implosion of Wall Street) ended in June 2009. What we’ve been in since that time is supposed to be the “recovery” part of the cycle. But for tens of millions of Americans, it has been hard to tell the recovery from the crisis in terms wealth accumulation, wage growth, or ability to earn a decent rate of interest on savings.

On Friday the Commerce Department released second quarter Gross Domestic Product data, showing that the U.S. economy grew at a 1.2 percent annual rate. That tepid number came on the heels of an anemic 0.8 percent rate of GDP growth for the first quarter.

It has now been more than a decade since the U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 3 percent or better – the longest subpar growth stretch since the end of World War II.

Long stretches of anemic performance suggest that a “cyclical” situation may have given way to a “secular” or long-term trend. As a result, we are seeing the words “secular stagnation” used increasingly to describe the U.S. economy.

One of the first individuals to go on television and attempt to knock down the rosy spin on the recovery was Steve Ricchiuto, Chief U.S. Economist at Mizuho Securities USA. In February of 2015, Ricchiuto told a CNBC audience the following:

“…there’s also this wrong concept that I keep hearing over and over again in the financial press about this acceleration in economic growth. That isn’t happening. Last month we had a horrible retail sales number. We had a horrible durable goods number. We’re likely to have a very disappointing retail sales number coming forward. This month we’ve had a strong payroll number – we say everything’s great. It’s not great. It’s running where it’s been. It’s been the same thing for the last five years. There’s no improvement in the economy.”

We’ve had throughout this recovery an approximate two percent rate of growth. Now, averaging together the first and second quarters of 2016, we have half that rate of growth – one percent.

Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, whom President Obama attempted to muscle in as Federal Reserve Chair (thwarted by threats of revolt by Congressional Democrats) has been writing about “secular stagnation.”

In the February issue of Foreign Affairs, Summers had this to say:

“The key to understanding this situation lies in the concept of secular stagnation, first put forward by the economist Alvin Hansen in the 1930s. The economies of the industrial world, in this view, suffer from an imbalance resulting from an increasing propensity to save and a decreasing propensity to invest. The result is that excessive saving acts as a drag on demand, reducing growth and inflation, and the imbalance between savings and investment pulls down real interest rates. When significant growth is achieved, meanwhile—as in the United States between 2003 and 2007—it comes from dangerous levels of borrowing that translate excess savings into unsustainable levels of investment (which in this case emerged as a housing bubble).”

Summers was part of the financial deregulation swat team in the Bill Clinton administration that took an ax to the Glass-Steagall Act that had successfully separated insured bank deposits from the greedy hands of Wall Street speculators for 66 years. He was also part of the bullying crowd that protected derivatives from regulation. Both of these actions would lay the groundwork for the biggest Wall Street crash since the Great Depression in 2008.

At the November 12, 1999 signing ceremony for the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the legislation that repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, Summers stated:

“Let me welcome you all here today for the signing of this historic legislation. With this bill, the American financial system takes a major step forward towards the 21st century, one that will benefit American consumers, business, and the national economy for many years to come…I believe we have all found the right framework for America’s future financial system.”

Summers is correct that the U.S. has entered a period of secular stagnation, but he is as wrong on his assumptions about what is causing it as he was wrong on his financial deregulation lunacy in the Clinton administration.

The late Lester Thurow, the prominent MIT economist, explained today’s problem almost 30 years ago. In a foreward Thurow wrote in Ravi Batra’s book, “The Great Depression of 1990,” Thurow explained the economic dilemma of a society in which vast wealth is concentrated in too few hands. Thurow wrote:

“Depression is seen as a product of systematic tendencies for the distribution of wealth to become concentrated among a few. When this happens, demand eventually sags relative to supply and long cyclical downturns commence. Unlike some cyclical analysts, Batra believes that such cycles are not inevitable and can be controlled with social policies essentially designed to stop undue concentration of wealth from developing.

“Essentially, the economic problem is like that of the wolf and the caribou. If the wolves eat all the caribou, the wolves also vanish. Conversely, if the wolves vanish, the caribou for a time multiply but eventually their numbers become too great and they die for lack of food. Producers need consumers, and if producers deprive workers of their fair share of production income they essentially deprive themselves of the affluent consumers they need to make their facilities profitable. One could think of Batra’s argument as a kind of economic ecology where there is a ‘right’ environmental balance.”

The depression that Batra wrongly had in mind for 1990 has become the secular stagnation of today. Its roots, beyond question, stem from concentrated wealth. Equally problematic, you are not likely to be reading about this in front-page newspaper headlines because the billionaires now own the major news outlets.

In the United States, almost 70 percent of GDP stems from consumption by the consumer. When workers are stripped of an adequate share of the nation’s income and wealth, they are crippled as consumers. This leads to corporate downsizing, plant closures, layoffs – which leads to even less consumer spending and a repetitive downward spiral.

This downward spiral has been slowed by three rounds of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve and a more than doubling of the national debt. Had this massive flow of money not cushioned the fall, we would likely be staring in the face of raging deflation rather than secular stagnation. But the money spigot cannot remain open forever.

The staggering amount of money that the Federal government has thrown at a financial crisis manufactured by Wall Street speculators is unprecedented in the history of the country. When Bill Clinton took office in January 1993, the U.S. national debt stood at $4 trillion. The country was then more than two centuries old; had paid for the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and financed a multitude of FDR programs to climb out of the Great Depression – caused by the 1929 stock market crash and the Wall Street speculators the prior time they had gotten their hands on bank deposits. The nation had also paid for World Wars I and II and the Vietnam War. Today, the national debt stands at $19 trillion. It has more than doubled since President Obama took office.

Reforming Wall Street and its institutionalized wealth transfer system that operates unabated as a result of the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act needs to happen very soon before secular stagnation gives way to something far worse.",finance,1470099405

I'm 25 and have about 30k in student debt at an average interest rate of about 6% and have around $1000 saved. I make about 40k. I'm able to save between 300-400 a month in my current living situation after my minimum student loan payment and all bills are paid. 

My girlfriend, mother of my child, and soon to be wife makes around 30k. She's 25, currently has around 6k personally saved, has around $1000 saved for our son, and is able to save between $100-250 a month. She currently has a retirement savings with her company that she has maxed out, matching her savings at 5%. She also owes around 4k on a car loan with &lt;1% interest. 

We plan on having one more child in the near future. We both have good credit and no debts other than those mentioned.  And although we intend to be together forever, we also realize the risk of combining finances at an early age and prefer to manage our incomes and savings separately for now. 

I'm split between between wanting to start making a dent in my student loans but also want to have a significant security fund to fall back on if anything were to happen.

Realizing she has enough for a security fund, she's split between starting to put the bulk of her savings  towards our son's college fund, paying off her car loan, or retirement. 

My questions are:

Should I continue to put money towards a security fund until my security fund minimum is met? And afterwords start making dents in my student debt, or is there a better way to approach this situation?

And when should she start transitioning her savings from security fund to our child's college fund/car debt/or retirement? And in what order?

personalfinance,First time buying car (Warning: Kind of a medium-long post),"A car rear ends me, and ends up in a total-loss scenario. I get $14000 from settlement, and plan to use $13000-$14000 for down payment for a new car.

In the market to buy a 2016.5 Mazda CX-5 w/ sports trim. Nothing additional. Went to the Mazda dealership after attempting to pit dealers against each other via email. First dealer offers well below the invoice (MSRP: $24,495, Invoice: $23,830, Offer: $23,130). I show this to other dealers, and they only match, without offering anything lower. 

-Is this something I should settle on? 

You should note that I didn't actually see the real invoice in person; I just blindly trusted that what the dealer emailed me was the actual invoice (it was close to the one given to me by KBB and Edmunds.com). 

My dad (old Asian man) is telling me I can squeeze them for more. I don't want to push my luck, to be honest...I've read any price under the invoice is pretty damn good. 

-I mean, what else more could I bargain for, right? 

-What do you guys think?

Also, I range in the low high 700s - low 800s for a credit score. I live at home with my parents. I've been working at my current job for barely a year; my last job was 2 years, but a totally different occupation. My current job is in IT, and it's my first IT job. I make $17.00/hour, and the job I held for 2 years was paid under the table. These are the answers to some of the questions my dealer asked me to see if I qualify for the 0.0% for 36 months / .09% for 60 months. Apparently, while my credit is 'good', it was not 'thick' enough. He was implying that I didn't gain this credit from any high-payment purchases, I believe. So, the best they could offer me was 2.34% for 60 months. 
- Is this a good interest rate for me? 
-Should I try and haggle for less? 

I was thinking about going to a credit union / Bank of America to see if they can get me lower, but not sure they can.

personalfinance,My partner has been contractually employed for his father's business since January and we're now worried we realised his responsibility with taxes too late,"Hi. I'm a UK resident but asking about a situation regarding my long distance partner, a US resident. I'm 22 and he's 20 turning 21.


My partner has been employed before but never on a basis where he made enough to have to file for taxes, he hasn't earned enough (or anything!) before at any point in his life to have any yearly taxable income to be responsible for. He's had short lived work at a kennel that he had to quit and that's it.


In the past year he and his dad moved out to California and he began to work for his business, probably on January 1st. He was hired on a contractual basis, $20/h and averages about 25hrs per week but can do more during busier work periods, possibly looking to do more hours. Since he's then not hired as an employee taxes aren't deduced from his payroll. This wasn't really something we thought about since we had no prior knowledge about taxes.


Because we didn't know any better his expenses planned for each month hasn't involved putting aside savings for taxes. General savings have been put aside, but not with taxes in mind so we aren't really prepared for the full costs.


It's now August and I have just now been reading into his responsibilities with taxes on a contractual basis and have been panicking to say the least. It feels so stupid now that I never really thought about it before but for all the times he's discussed his earnings, savings and expenses (rent and living costs) with his father any advice on paying taxes never came up. I can't really blame his dad or anything, but it is kind of frustrating to only find out much later down the line.


I think I have an understanding of what the taxes will make up for him (single unmarried standard deduction of $10,300 brings your gross income down to what is your taxable income, 15% bracket federal tax plus ""self employment tax"" social security and medicaid tax plus cali state tax) (let me know if I'm wrong or missing anything!!) so I'll put out my other questions.


Firstly, would any of the tax for the current year be based on his income from January onwards or only from April? As I understand it, January to March is the final quarter of a tax year and the tax year starts in April. I don't know if he would have earned enough through January and March when he started work to have counted as having tax liability or any taxable income for the previous year.


Also, from what I can tell my partner would be exempt from having to had filed quarterly estimated taxes this year despite being contracted as he had no tax liability for the previous year (not employed, no income at all). I just wanted to confirm this for certain and that I'm not incorrect or misunderstanding. The IRS states you don't have to pay quarterly estimated tax for the current year if:


""You had no tax liability for the prior year

You were a U.S. citizen or resident for the whole year

Your prior tax year covered a 12-month period""


So am I correct to think he just has to file all required tax payments for the current year come next April? There won't be any penalties for missing quarterly payments?? If so, that can be off our mind and we'll just have to prepare for paying quarterly next whenever we have to do that.


Assuming we don't have to pay quarterly right now for this tax year or try to catch up, when we do have to begin paying quarterly would it begin from April onwards or is it January? I thought I read something about how you have to start doing it in January even if it's technically the final quarter but I'm not sure now, read too many different things in the span of a many hour panic.


We don't really have a plan on how to cope with this right now and it's looking like he might be having to fall back on to his dad for help since we just don't have enough money or resources prepared for it. We're lucky in that his father has a personal accountant who he'll forward our situation to who can maybe help us. Ideally we'd want to have any of my partner's future taxes sorted through her as well, it just never really got discussed before so I assume his dad wanted to just give him the full responsibility.

If it does come to us having to file quarterly ourselves and we can't share the accountant with his dad to help file taxes, I guess we'll have to be better prepared for it. That, or figure out why he's contracted instead of employed and if employment would be a better option.


It really sucks to not have been ready for any of this! It's not a hopeless situation and we're going to figure it out, but it still really sucks. Any advice or anything else we should know would be great.",finance,1470112817

personalfinance,"Healthcare worker who is 62k in debt, 27 y/o, 1 year in workforce","Hi all, so brief background is I graduated from graduate school in 2014, started working in March 2015. I currently work in the health care field (physical therapy) in Silicon Valley and take home pay is around $3.8k/month. I also live at home and have paid off my car in its entirety. I have around $24k in savings spread across 4 different accounts, with 2 being high yield online savings accounts and the other 2 in normal brick and motor banks. 

Break down of monthly costs is as follows:

* Rent (request of parents to help out financially): $500
* Food (groceries/eating out): $500
* Gas/insurance: $210 (insurance is $110, I budgedeted $100 for gas/month)
* Loan repayment: $800 *scroll down for more explanation* 
* Entertainment/miscellaneous: $250
* Donations/tithe: $450
* Haircut: $40
* Total: ~$2900

401K contributions: $350 (employer does not match for first 2 years but allows pension contribution at 5 years) 
Emergency fund: contributing $700/month from take-home pay

Whatever excess I have left over from monthly expenses is put aside into the high yield savings account. Sometimes, it's an extra $100, other times it can be higher or lower. 


STUDENT LOAN section
Now, I have 2 loans under Nelnet. The first loan is comprised of 3 loans, broken down like this:

* Loan 1a: $20,500 at 6.8% - currently with interest is at $21,554
* Loan 1b: $10,250 at 6.8% - currently with interest is at $10,456
* Loan 1c: $10,250 at 5.4% - currently with interest is at $10,062 

The second loan is a single loan: $19,719 at 5.4%. 

Minimum payment due: $780 (per standard, 10 year repayment plan) 


Now, I understand, in terms of paying off the loans quickly, I should go with the Avalanche method and target the highest interest one first. So my question is, how much should I be putting down each month toward the loans based on my monthly expenses and take-home pay? Should I put $10-12k down right now toward my highest loan and keep paying the minimum balance needed for the lesser loan and then refinance when I'm done paying off the highest interest rate loan? Or should I spread it out, like $5k one month, another $5k the next? 

I have looked in loan forgiveness programs but they are mainly for MD's and people who work at county hospitals...both of which do not apply to me. And unless I quit my current job (and lose the time I've put toward obtaining a pension plan) it seems that the loan forgiveness plan isn't really feasible for me. 


And on a different note, I'm also wanting to own my own place one day but with this loan repayment and being in Silicon Valley, it seems pretty impossible since housing here is crazy. Should I change my loan type from standard repayment to income-based repayment in order to be better qualified for a loan? I am not planning on buying a place for the next 4 years, but I feel like it's crazy and almost impossible to save up enough to put a down payment on anything around here.  

Sorry for all the questions, but any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1470122527
worldpolitics,If there would be another Civil War in Nigeria? Here are the Immediate Reasons why it would be:,"If there would be another Civil War in Nigeria?

Here are the Immediate Reasons why it would be:

I Actions of President Buhari since he took office May 2015

a)	Even though Ex-President Jonathan (Extract from South) executed and was executing more projects in the North than the South and much less in South South and South East, on assumption of office, President Buhari(Northern Extraction) had suspended or stopped more than 80% of all Projects being executed by Ex-President Jonathan in the south and on the other hand even though more projects were being executed in the North he has not suspended any being executed in the North. Namely he had suspended or stopped the following: i) Second Niger Bridge even though it was not to cost the government one extra dime apart from what had already been paid by Ex-President Jonathan, since it would have been a BOT (Build Operate and Transfer) project by Julius Berger. With this action which could have only been triggered by some intrinsic malice, what had been paid out by Ex-President Jonathan and amount committed by Julius Berger are wasted. b) East-West Road a strategic road in Niger Delta c) Maritime University, even though a special police college and extra 11 universities were built or being executed in the North by Ex-President Jonathan, President Buhari did not suspend nor stop any of them but the only one being executed in the Niger Delta was promptly suspended by President Buhari and same with number of other projects  being executed by Ex-President Jonathan in SE, SW and SS. d) The amnesty program delicately put in place by Ex-President Yaradua and maintained by President-Jonathan was grossly starved of fund that perhaps less than 40% of what was required to run the program is being released. E) The Niger Delta Ministry apart from over 500billion it was owed was further starved of funds that less than 40% of money it required is being released to it yet President Buhari substantially increased allocation to his North East.

b)	With assumption of office by President Buhari, his kinsmen notoriously known as Fulani Herdsmen extended the grazing-land grabbing they had been doing in other Northern states for the last 15year that had the herdsmen kill over 5000 people and property damage approaching $500 million to South West, South South and South East! Several people had been kidnapped in the South West, South South and South East and scores of people killed and properties worth millions of Naira destroyed by Fulani Herdsmen in several South Western states; in South South the story is the same. In south East it is fresh in our mind how the Fulani Herdsmen ransacked a village in Enugu state with over 50 lives wasted and property damage running into several millions of Naira despite the fact that the Police commissioner in that state was appropriately and timely briefed by the Governor of the state  before the attack, he completely turned his eye to elsewhere while the arson was going on, it was clear that somebody else more powerful than the Governor of the state ordered him to stay action on the arsonist, your guess is as good as mine. On all this major insecurity and potentially explosive national security breached the President never condemned his kinsmen and its instructive he was the patron of the cattle herdsmen before he became Nigeria President; rather what the President allegedly did was to push for a national grazing bill that would perhaps force largely unwilling states to map out grazing lands for the Fulani Herdsmen note it is for the private business of the Fulani cattle herders! It is probably in Nigeria and other crude and backward African countries that cattle is still being grazed in the bush and peoples farm land and instead of the President to do a holistic reform of cattle rearing to improve productivity, he is sticking to a wasteful grazing method that has seen thousands of farmers first ravaged by Fulani cattle and then killed by the Fulani herders!

c)	Since assumption of office, despite the Federal Character status in appointments, the President had from time to time skewed his appointment to the North and in particular to his North East to the extent nearly 80% of his appointments are from the North and even till now he has not deemed it necessary, for the sake of national security to reverse his approach to appointment even though he has seen the tension building up.

d)	With glowing tension and many people being provoked beyond limits particularly in the South, many people even from his North have called for urgent restructuring and true federalism but he and the vice-president had openly rejected restructuring! Furthermore the Conference that President Jonathan midwifed which would have reasonably doused the rising tension in the nation, the President was allegedly quoted that he had not read it or something like that. What this meant is that the President is not willing to make use of that document for any reason and yet tension kept rising amongst ethnic nationalities; the other day a Muslim slit the throat of a woman preacher right in Abuja the nation’s capital and host of other issues.

II Action of the Nigeria Cabals

The Nigeria cabals comprising of serving and retired Generals, Top Nigeria politicians, top civil servants and some top captains of industry from all geo-polities but in particular those from Hausa/Fulani extraction and some selected from South West who believed that they own the war against Igbos and therefore owners of Nigeria and resources in it would never want a federal Nigeria nor a restructured Nigeria but rather a unitary Nigeria that suits their purpose namely extracting from everyone and in particular Niger Delta and dispensing it to themselves as they deem fit. A truly federal Nigeria would see the cabalas s it is constituted out of business of looting as is evident in the past 50 years that monies in the accounts of each of these cabalas can feed a state for years even if it had no other source of income. So despite the expedience of restructuring and enshrining true federalism thecabals would rather opt for military re-conquest so that they may further strengthen their position to lord it over all and sundry. Otherwise a properly negotiated Nigeria had reasonably been reached at the last national conference that would have ensured reasonable equity for the federating units but even though you can’t lay hands on evidence but it couldn’t have been any other group that made sure that the conference decisions were not implemented. The question is who is afraid of a just Federal Nigeria; the answer is simple the cabals! So while it may seem as if it is the President’s urge for show of fire power that made him to do what he did apparently the cabals hand twisted him to ensure the cabals position. The question any right thinking person on earth should ask is what really is wrong with leadership after leadership to the extent that despite the huge resources Nigeria is endowed with Nigeria was and is navigating to a failed state. The cabals are the problems of the nation, period. Even if the entire Niger Delta is to be incinerated with Bombs as it is becoming obvious, it is not for the resources to be acquired militarily to be used by rest of Nigerians but for the cabals to continue their accustomed looting till the end of time! Having dwelt on this matter for a length of time I am convinced that even after the destruction of lives and properties in Niger Delta to secure resources to be looted by the cabalas, the Niger Delta people would recover and will once again ask question about their enslavement and who knows the children children of the cabals who would mix them in morass now would be in charge of all instruments of coercion and once more; freshdynamite and bombs and probably once more defeated and looting continues! The question is when the enslavement of Nigerians and in particular Niger delta stop would. The answer is simple it is either Nigeria Dies or the cabals die! Why we are talking about Niger Delta now is because that is where the resources the cabals are looting is domicile the cabals would no doubt decimate the people of any geo-polity who dares them as regard taking resources they would loot! After all the ordinary Hausa/Fulani man or Yoruba man is as marginalized as the rest of Igbos and Niger Delta.

III Poor Calculations by the various Militants

Finally the militants should have understand the mindset of the Nigeria cabals and know that the only thing they want is to get resources from whoever have it and gather in their caucus and share it and such should have concentrated in tactical deprivation of use of the resources against the cabals until such a time the cabals are tired and consent to a re-structured Nigeria where true federalism is practiced instead of declaring a republic which is open license for the Cabals to use their last drop of blood and all the military power to ensure availability of resources to be looted. Whichever way this confrontation would go I hope that future militants should learn and deal with the cabals to a standstill and perhaps help to save the country from the death grip of the Nigeria cabals.",finance,1470132270

CryptoCurrency,How to design an efficient cryptocurrency using this equation for gambling between 2 colors? (with video of game based on that equation),"money(T) = M * e^integral(C*dY), dY=green(T)-blue(T), explained below

This simple equation could balance an economy, like it does in this 2d version of it in an experimental game (because I wanted to feel the equation in the bouncing and sizes of balls): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sudFdN8PPI

Bitcoin has been criticized for lacking a built-in way to Short (to gamble its value will fall), which causes instability. This equation should solve that symmetricly between 2 colors.

A money object is either blue or green. Its owner can choose to change its color instantly as many times as they want. In a perfect system, this would have no transaction fee, but like Bitcoin something must motivate others to accept your data. The equation does not include transaction fee.

The total amount of blue always equals the total amount of green.

Each object changes its amount continuously like waves in a stock price. Its amount depends on an integral of a shared 1d curve over time, so there is an objective measure of change in amount over time if users agree which objects were blue vs green at what times.

At each time step, some amount of green changes to blue, and some amount of blue changes to green, usually different amounts. Then all blue amounts are scaled to be the same total blue there was before, and the same for greens.

If the total blue decreases (investors get scared and go to green) when you have blue, your amount of blue increases. Same for green. Whenever you are in the minority, your money gets bigger. Whenever you follow the crowd, your money shrinks. As they say in stocks, buy low and sell high. Blue is low when those who have blue are changing to green (more than greens change to blues), so your blue money gets bigger and green smaller.

At each time step, dY (derivative of Y) total money moves from blue to green. dY is negative when more moves from green to blue.

Y sums the flow of money between blue and green, forming a 1d curve over time like a stock price.

    dY(T) = green(T)-blue(T)

C is color of your money over time, 1 for green and -1 for blue.

M is how much money you have at time T=0.

    money(T) = M * e^integral(C*dY)

In theory theres no need to track the specific money amount of each object if we instead track the value of Y over time and the specific times each object changes color. Using that equation, the Y curve, which is the same for everyone, can derive the interest rate between any 2 times if you know when the specific object was green vs blue.

Its challenging to design efficiently because all the money amounts are changing all the time, and disagreements on blockchain timing affect those amounts.",cryptocurrency,1470143122

With professional experience in hand, I've made the decision to pursue my Masters in Public Administration.

I've been accepted to two online programs and would like some help in choosing.  At this point, you might be asking yourself why I chose to post this here.  To me, graduate school is as much a **financial** undertaking as it is an academic one.  A brief summary of the programs follows:

**Program A**

- Ranking: 20's in Public Affairs, top 5 in Local Government
- Cost of program: $42,000 (after $10,000 fellowship)
- Program Length: 45 credit hours
- This program is also extremely interactive.  They simulate the on-campus experience exceptionally well.

**Program B**

- Ranking: 90's in Public Affairs
- Cost of program: $24,000
- Program Length: 36 credit hours
- Correspondence with the program has been minimal since receiving the acceptance letter, which has been somewhat disheartening.  The program also seems to use Blackboard for a majority of its coursework.

I'm torn between these two programs for several reasons.  First, I feel that I'd be much more successful in Program A's format, as there is a certain amount of accountability that comes with seeing and interacting with classmates and an instructor on a weekly basis.  I also think that a lot can be said of the name recognition and alumni network of Program A.  The main thing holding me back from choosing this program, however, is the cost.  I've been constantly mulling whether the above two factors are worth an additional $18,000 in debt.  

Public service is my passion, and I'd like to continue work at the local or federal level long-term, so I've also looked into Public Service Loan Forgiveness and Federal Employee Loan Forgiveness.

I am a college student entering my second year at the University of Pittsburgh (but living in Philadelphia atm) and have been tirelessly looking for a job for the past two months.

personalfinance,About to inherit $200k ~ $250k. Want to run my thoughts by you (US),"I started reading the *Windfalls $$$* section, so first of all, I'm not telling anyone about it. Secondly, I am trying to study up on the subject. 
In the meantime, I just wanted to ask you about a couple of specific thoughts. 

My situation is like this:

- I am a 39 year old single father of couple kids of whom I have 50% custody
- I do not have a significant amount saved or in 401k 
- I do not have a big debt other than the car (13k left with 2% interest) 
- I am currently renting and have been wanting to go back to owning a house
- A reasonable property that will accommodate my family in this area would cost around $250k
- My current salary - child support = about $65k a year

With that said, I want to use this small windfall to buy a house in cash (or mostly in cash). Is this a good idea, or should I only put down 20% and invest the rest else where?

Reason behind that is because I don't have the confidence that I can get much more in return on investment than the interest rate of the mortgage I would otherwise have. I would rather not have to worry about the troubles of managing the investments while my life is already very hectic. 

That is of course unless you could direct me to some investment options that are relatively easy to manage and have a good chance of getting a return higher than the typical mortgage rate. 

Any advice is highly appreciated.

personalfinance,Could someone tell me if I'm calculating my retirement right? I'm a Federal Employee on FERS.,"I believe under FERS, we get 3 income streams after retirement.  One is Social Security, another is an Annuity, and the third is from our Thrift Savings Plan.

My current salary is about $105,000 a year and will probably end at $120k-$140K a year.

Going on the SS website, based on my current salary, it said I would get 

At full retirement age (67):	$2,638 a month
At early retirement age (62):	$1,763 a month

My annuity will be 1.1% * number of years of service * avg of top 3 annual salary.  So assuming my top is $120,00 and 32 years of service, that's another $42,240 a year.

Lastly, I have about $175,000 is my TSP with another 20 years left of service.  Using the TSP calculator on the website, if I put in 15%, and assume a 2% growth in pay and 6% return, that puts me with about $1.5 million from my TSP.

Now we've filed our father's taxes for 2015 so that isn't a concern. Now as I understand it since our estate falls under the exemption we won't be taxed on anything but that which see's gains. So if we should sell his house for more than the estimate (which ASAP) we'll be taxed for the amount we earned above that estimate. If we make less it'll be considered a loss and we won't sweat it. There is also some stuff with the IRA my pops had that I think will get nailed on because the HR guy at the company my dad worked for fucked us and dumped it all into our executors IRA and not the Estate IRA. Either he's too incompetent to fix it, which I like to think is the case, or Fidelity simply won't let us fix it for some reason. Anyways that's not my problem.

My problem is with the what taxes I, personally, will have to deal with. For any cash I see from his personal account do I have to file that on my 2016 income taxes? Or should I put into a trust? Which, honestly, to be more expensive than it's worth given at the end of all this I'm probably only going to inherit 40-70K. (My dad paid off some of my student loans that were credited against my inheritance should I not pay them off in time. Considering this agreement was made maybe three years before his death, that didn't happen.) 

Now I've likewise set up both an IRA and a Roth IRA so I have to take it out at the required minimum which I will be taxed, but at a considerably lower rate than if I was to take the lump sum. So this will be taxed at a certain bracket which I have no clue about. (I'm researching the mega backdoor roth but honestly I've only ever dealt with the 1040ez so I'm doing a lot of research as it is.) 

Honestly I just want to figure out how much needs to go to the federal government (my state doesn't have an inheritance tax), so I can pay off my debts. 7K in medical bills put on a credit card seems like a terrible idea, but I'm desperate. Finding your dad suddenly dead has a way to causing PTSD, throw in some Bipolar Disorder, and you may just drive yourself into a wall! Sometimes literally...

Beware long post and complicated situation

I am trying to figure what path would be best to follow. 27M Canada

Here's what I would like the know before you guys start reading:

Is going back in school feasible considering all the jobs available

Should I get rid of the lease through something like leasebuster.com and get a under 3-4k car to keep doing what I do

Should I close the business since the workload is about 60%-80% more than just doing sales for not much more $$ and way more headaches.

&amp;nbsp;

**Business and budget/actual debt**

&amp;nbsp;

I currently started a business in a field that I was fed up with but was having some success as a sales rep. I know great idea... Me and my partner are finding some kind of success (no recurring clients so if the effort is stopped everything stops) but I feel that the partnership is not even close of being equal in workloads and his drive way lower than mine. It a seasonal business also (april through november). I sale-recruit-manage-order-do paperwork. He installs. No sales means he doesn't work. Means I work all the time.

So I decided that I would like to go back to school and be done with this field (construction mainly door to door sales for driveway 9 years doing this) Problem is I have debts from failed ventures and bad financial decision (traveling when not having the budget, not working in the winter, car, etc).

Last year I cleared I would say between 13k to 15k of that said debt and decided to start the company by taking a loan with a cosigner (most of it is equipment we can resale). Doing maths and thinking I would make more $ or same $ with less stress since I would control everything. Foolish idea.

&amp;nbsp;

Current expenses are mainly avg but for august I will be tracking:

-House stuff is shared with SO so this would be my 50% share-

Take home pay is at the moment: 2228.68 net /month

- Rent : 440$
- Hydro : avg 40$ month
- Groceries : 125$
- Restaurant/bar : 150$
- Cellphone: 82.78$  Just had to switch. Best value for $ plan I found for my usage (work on the road)
- Home internet : 27.04 
- Renters insurance: 13.58/month
- Car lease payment: 185/every two weeks 0% interest (400.83/month) (agreement to get half paid by the -business)
- Car insurance: 100.49/month
- Gas: Agreement to get it paid by the business  (150$-200$ if not since on the road sales)
- Donation to Doctors without borders: 20$/month
- Netflix: 5.75/month
- $$ owe for taxes: 45.23$/month
- Student loan goverment : 50$/month
- Student line of credit : Min. Payment 100$/month
- Visa RBC: bit more than min. Payment 200$/month
- Bank fees: 4$/month

Total estimated expenses are: 1588.87

Without the part paid by business $ : 1973.87

Activities with friends and SO are not accounted for and will be monitored this month.

&amp;nbsp;
Debts (not counting business one since it can be clear by the business and is shared)
&amp;nbsp;

- RBC Visa balance: 17210.38 @11.99%  Limit : 19500$
- BMO Mastercard: always paid in full since I emptied it. Used for monthly expenses. Limit 3500$
- BMO Student line of credit: 19789.20 @ 4.7%  Limit 20K Interest only to be paid as long as in school.
- SCOTIABANK Visa: Has a balance related to startup cost will be paid by business soon. I consider it empty. Limit 6000$
- Government student loan: 4441.98$ @ 3% I think. Can't find the paper. On a payment plan that stops if I return to school.

Last year I was able to bring the Scotia and Bmo one from full to empty. I had a very good year in sales thus started the business even tho I wanted out of the field. Now regret it. Will make significantly less this year from somewhere around 48k net to 37 440$ gross. But only  half a year of salary since we started salaries in July. We have tiny bonuses once in a while but not significant.

I am not expecting to be able to pay for any of the debts other than the minimum payment for this year. As my savings are nothing since a lot went into living expenses while trying to build the company up. Trying to get maybe 1k to 2k in savings are a bare minimum cushion.

I am contemplating closing the company now and selling equipment while we are in the season and break even (partner will be furious most likely) I would keep doing sales only for the rest of the summer but would pocket money for me only. Mathematically I make about the same money (should be just a bit more 5-8%) having the company versus just the sales. But I hate everything about it still (being doing this for 9 year and thought a company would make me more driven towards it. Very foolish) And being paid salary versus commission only means I don't get to see the $ that I need to pay debts since it is reinvested in the business / paying the loans we took to start. Did not think of this aspect at when figuring out if it was worth it.

I could also keep the company open (financial year finishes end of february. 2 months before the season starts back). Get enough sales and pay us a salary until we run out of money and have a part-time job over the winter that would bring a second salary and get enough sales next season to break even and resale equipment next season and be done.

&amp;nbsp;

**School**

&amp;nbsp;

I was on and off with school didn't finish anything. Wasn't sure of the fields. Now I feel pretty confident on the choice.

I want to go back in school to pursue computer science degree and go into programming. I always liked computers and hated pressure sales etc. Not sure why I hit my head against something I hate for so long.

I am registered in a certificate last year, but I had a messed-up idea of dropping my classes and putting effort in starting this shit show.

So I can take classes in coming fall. I was thinking of taking two classes out of the certificate since they are prerequisite of all the other classes. That would leave me time for more sales until season finishes than a part-time job in sales or something else or another small business without partner in order to not get in further debt.

School is very cheap where I am so tuition is not scary. About 300$ per class.

Should I jump right in or focus on clearing more debts while getting older etc and starting later ?

Car lease at the beginning was because of self employment. It made sense since it was going in expenses and I would pay taxes anyway if not so I decided to treat my self a bit. Completely stupid now that I think of it since I had a lot of CC debts and not a lot of liquid cash. 

What I'm thinking is get rid of it by transferring the lease (a bit more than 3 years out of 4 left) even If I need to give a little cash incentive like 1k and pay transfer fees etc. 

Buy a 3-4k car, I know a reliable model that work great, looks great (still in sales you know), not to old. 

Insure it to the minimum I think it would come out to like 20$ per month.

I don't care of having a new car. It was stupid and even knew all about depreciation on cars etc but still went with it. 

So get rid of it or keep it to finish the season. SO can help me with some liquid cash to buy something else. I plan on doing intense session of sales next summer on top of the job I will find this winter. So I can pay some debts and get a better cushion. So I will need a car anyway.

&amp;nbsp;

**So what do you guys think.**

&amp;nbsp;

Keep car or change asap.

Return to school and accept paying some interest on debts or wait more. I think it is manageable. Maybe I am not right haha

Keep business or peace out breaking even right now and sale equipment in the high season.

I need opinions or people to bounce of question on me.

Sincerely thank you !!!

personalfinance,student loan repayment,"looking for some advice here...  i'm an eye doctor practicing for a few years now, making some progress paying off some of my smaller education loans.  i'm considering refinancing one loan in particular due to it's outrageous interest rate (8.5%, the goddamn crooks).  the loan in question is for roughly 37k.  I would refinance to another private company like sofi, and from what i've seen i could reduce that interest by possibly 2 points.  hopefully more once they actually run a report and see my pretty good credit score (780ish).  what i'm wondering is, i also have 2 smaller accounts, roughly 13-15k each, at a pretty decent rate (3.87%).  my question is...  should i consolidate those two along with the larger ridiculous rate loan, or just keep them separate.  is there an advantage one way or the other?  i'm currently using the ""avalanche"" method of repayment, doing what i can with smaller loans then shifting that money elsewhere once they're paid.  those two decently low rate loans would be next on the chopping block.  

anyway, not sure what i want my next step to be...  hoping to find some different perspectives.  thanks for any response, i really appreciate it!",finance,1470179786

Here are my student loans:

&gt;  - 40k Federal @ ~5%

We have a refinance offer for the 165k loan @ 6.5% over 20 years

My father has:  
&gt;  - IRA worth 85k (which he has said isn't performing well) 
&gt;  - 401k worth over 1.5m  
&gt;  - A house that will be paid off in full in 6 months, valued at ~240k  
&gt; 

He is currently 56 years old with excellent credit and has a household income of around 100k before tax, so he will incur a 10% penalty + whatever tax bracket he is bumped into if he withdraws within the next 3.5 years. He is located in NY and I am located in PA.

I have graduated and make 70k/year and could eventually pay these off but obviously the interest paid would be astronomical. He is interested in paying the loans off, to avoid paying as much interest as possible and having me pay him back in monthly installments without interest.

  
  
We have looked into:
&gt; - early withdrawal from IRA/401k
&gt; - home equity loan when the house when it is paid in full (with us both making payments on a lower interest rate)
&gt; - refinance and both contribute to the new loan


Are there any other options that might be available to us? Is there a best choice in this scenario?

personalfinance,College student with $2500 in debt... with just credit cards. What's the best attack plan?,"Hi r/personalfinance!

I am a 19 year old college sophomore. I currently have about $2500 in debt from just my credit cards. I let it get out of hand, and it's my own fault, but I am really tired of living even less than paycheck to paycheck. I know that if I buckle down I can get out of it, I'm just wondering the best way to do that. Here's a breakdown of my situation:

Monthly Income: $1000 USD
Current Credit Card Debt: $1,475
Current Debt to Best Buy for New Laptop: $977.38
Minimum Monthly Expenses: $400-$500
Scholarship Overage Check (due 8.15.16): $3,052
Savings: $3.23
401K: ~$300
Credit score: 645

My credit card starts accruing interest in October (it's a college card, the interest rate is TBD). The Best Buy account is interest-free for 11 more months, but there's a minimum monthly payment of $75. If I buckle down I can live pretty modestly; my job is fairly close to my campus, I don't need to spend too much on other things. The situation I'm entering later this month is new to me, so my budget will adjust once I figure out what I'm really doing. I have a budgeting app on my phone that is connected to my bank account, but again, it's difficult to set one up when I don't really know what to expect. 

So far, I've been saving 10% of my paycheck, keeping $200-$300 on my debit card, and the rest on my credit card. I haven't been very disciplined lately; every time I pay off some of my credit card I just buy something else. I'm tired of that. I want to be debt-free.

My scholarship overage check from my university is what I've been planning on just using for rent. It should give me about 5 months (up until January). If I use it all at once, I would have almost all of September's rent. Or, I could use it to pay off just my credit card from my bank.

I just cleared out my savings (almost $900) to put down my first month's rent and my deposits and everything, so that's why it's so low.

My question is this: should I continue to do what I've been doing, should I be more aggressive, or should I use my scholarship overage money to just pay it off now and then save up for the rest of my rent for the semester? 

I've figured out that if I just keep $400 a month to myself, not save anything for a while, and use the rest on the debt, I can do it in about 5 months (maybe less as work hours change and I get more each paycheck). Is there an advantage/disadvantage to each option?

Any help from the older/wiser would be extremely appreciated, and, as always, I hope everyone has a great day :)",finance,1470186910
personalfinance,I have a car payment that has gotten too expensive. How do I go about fixing this?,"A little over a year ago I did a dumb 20 year old thing. I bought a car for $6,000, found out it was a junker, and sold it within a month to minimize the financial damages. I didn't want another used car so I did what I shouldn't have done and bought a brand new 2015 Honda Accord. The payments and loan were higher than I wanted but affordable. Thinking I would be ok I took the car and now I am paying the price. I've had bills slowly increase and now I can barely afford my car. 

The upside to this is that I have a car that I can drive absolutely for free, as in no car payment and insurance is paid by the owner, it's just a POS. It can be fixed reasonably with a little TLC though. The reason I have this car is because my buddy is deployed and wants me to drive it while he is gone. He told me that he has no problem making it my daily driver until he gets back. I will be leaving in March for about 9 months so I won't need a car.

My question here is that I owe more on the car than it is worth. I've been trying to sell it privately but it has taken quite some time. If I sell it to a dealership I'm looking at about a $4-5k difference between what I owe and what they will take the car for. The is with bank Y. I do not use bank Y for anything other than the car loan as they were able to give me the best interest rate. If I sell it to a dealer how do I go about the gap in the loan. Would I need to get a personal loan for the difference?

personalfinance,"Trying to understand my loan burn-down, amortization calculators don't quite do it.","I have ~$32k in student loan debt. I have been in repayment for about 3.5 years now. I am enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, and on an income-based repayment plan. 

I am assuming now that I will remain with my employer at least through the end of the PSLF period, which means my remaining balance will be forgiven in about 6.5 years. 

I have been trying to use amortization calculators to determine my debt burn-down over the next 6.5 years and to determine how much will be forgiven at that time. The problem is, those calculators allow you only to input the loan amount, loan period, and interest rate. 

If I plug in my current loan balance, interest rate, and 6.5 years as the loan term, it  outputs a table based on a high monthly payment derived from the basic math, but that's not reflective of my actual situation because my payment is lower than that because of income-based repayment plan. I also tried plugging in the original amount and start date 3.5 years ago, but that is wrong for the same reason.

I understand what is going on - these calculators are doing the simple math and they don't account for the variables like artificially reduced payments which changes the burn-down calculation. 

So my question is, is there anything out there that can help me to get a view of my next 6.5 years of debt, given current balance, current payment, and interest rate? I've tried a few crude calculations myself but I am not confident in the accuracy. 

UPDATE: Thanks to help from /u/Mrme487 and /u/IfWishezWereFishez, I have a better a pretty decent answer to my question. Now, the follow-up question, if I may:

By continuing to pay the minimum payment that the income-based repayment plan allows, I am of course accruing more interest than if I paid higher. There is some risk involved (say the PSLF program is cancelled, or I have to leave public service for some reason). Currently, I can assume I will continue to have my public service job for another 6.5 years (I have a permanent, career position). Because my entire balance will (theoretically) be forgiven after 80 more payments, I am staying the course and paying the minimum. Is that what you would do, dear redditor reading this?",finance,1470234346

personalfinance,20F Should I start a Roth IRA with student loan debt?,"Hi, first-time poster but longtime reader here. I need some advice about starting a Roth IRA.

Right now, I am a college student with 20k in student loan debt. At the time I graduate I will have around 35k total. All my loans are Federal Direct, with interest rates between 4.3%-4.7% and the upcoming ones will have lower interest rates. They are a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized.

I will graduate with a management degree and I have two Fortune 100 internships under my belt already, so I anticipate decent job offers at the time of my graduation. My mom plans to pay off my loans in full in a few years when she sells her house (will get around 250-300k from the sale) however she only earns around 40k a year and has other debts and no retirement savings, so I don't feel totally comfortable with this and will likely try to convince her to let me pay for 50% of my loans or something. But she is very adamant about wanting to pay them off for me.

With all this in mind, is it a good idea to start a Roth IRA now? I was thinking of a Vanguard Target Date Retirement account, because it seems like people here recommend them. It seems like the gains on the money in the account would be higher than the current interest rate on my loans. Does this make any sense or am I totally off base?

Right now I have 6k in savings... 3k I will be setting aside at the end of the summer and don't plan on touching... Maybe it can be the start of an emergency fund for when I graduate. I was thinking I could start a Roth IRA with $1,000 of that. Then during the school year, I will earn about $400 a month and can contribute to the savings account and the IRA. From my two semesters interning I have made $6k each time and can expect to earn that again next summer to continue saving and investing for retirement.

Does this sound like a good plan? Or should I wait to start saving for retirement and start paying down my loans now? The thing is, I currently have a full tuition scholarship, so I use the loans for living costs and then use my own money for ""fun"" things such as my hobbies: traveling (done a loooottt of this), shopping, going out to eat, etc. 

I know realistically I could cut back on the personal spending and use my own money for living costs (what I currently use loans for) but I also value enjoying my life and hobbies and have had many amazing experiences such as studying abroad I couldn't have done otherwise. Additionally, I worry a lot about retirement even though it's so far away and I think starting a retirement account now would give me some peace of mind. I know I will also be helping my mom in her retirement, but that I can't sacrifice my own retirement planning for that, so I think it would be good to get a head-start now so I can provide for the both of us later on.

Sorry for how long this post ended up, but I would really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and offer me some advice. Thanks!

**UPDATE**: Thanks for the advice and comments everyone. This has helped me put things in perspective. It sounds like I need to explain to my mom it's important that she saves as much as possible for her own retirement, instead of putting money towards my student loans. I will be working on reducing the amount of loans I need for my next two years of college, continuing to build savings, and I think that I will start a Roth IRA with $1,000 but limit my contributions (like maybe put in just a few hundred every year) until after I graduate and get a job.",finance,1470237590

There are a few others but these are my biggest considerations.

Another factor is that high credit card utilization is really hurting my credit according to mint and credit karma.

So, should i go satisfaction (snowballish) or should i attack those high interest rates? Or some combination? 

Thanks guys! Ive lurked here for years. Please excuse my typos. On my cell.

financialindependence,"Long time reader, first time poster: hoping you can help! Classic question on my Rental House - pay off early (also should I refinance?) or continue to rent (30 year lease)? Details in text","First off - love you guys! This subreddit has been extremely helpful to me over the last year, and has given me tremendous encouragement. Good to know there are people out there working hard using time-tested fundamentals to achieve financial independence. 

Background on me: I'm 26, live in NYC. Originally from Ohio, moved to Nashville for school (bought the house we'll discuss there), and then moved to NYC for a great job. 

Income: 100k base, 20-30k bonus

Took this job so that I could pay off my student loans (SUCCESS!) and so that I could advance my career since there were unquestionably more opportunities here in the city. Took me one year of working to pay it off to get it done, but ultimately pulled it off and it feels amazing to be debt free! This isn't about that however. On to the meat of my question:

I bought a house in Nashville for 131k with 5% down. 4br 2ba in a decent part of town, but not one of the rich neighborhoods or locations. I still owe 117k and have not worked at paying extra on the minimum payments of 860 per month. So yes - paying PMI, and getting CRUSHED by interest (3.4% interest rate, which isn't awful but as you FIRE people know that loan is front-loaded with interest). Currently the place is rented, so that is great. 

Rent: $1650 a month
Monthly Payment (includes all taxes, insurance, interest, PMI, Mortgage): $860
Property Manger: $100 a month
Repair fund (just in case): $150 a month
SUM: $540 profit per month

The $540 is nice and ultimately goes into investments. 

27 years left on loan (shoot me). 

Something I see constantly on here: SELL IT. For the purposes of this thread, I'd like to avoid that theme. But if you can't help yourself, I totally get it :) 

***Question Time***

- Should I refinance and get a 10 or 15 year loan? That would be a nice income stream at 36 or 41 even if it doesn't appreciate at all.
 
- Should I just begin paying more per month and not refinance? i.e. pay $400-$540 each month extra? 

- Is there a breakeven analysis spread sheet on paying the $400-$540 extra, or even refinancing? I'd like to give myself the ability to say -&gt; I'm paying $5000 additional on this house for the next 10 years ($60,000), but after paying it off I will make that $60,000 back in four years, and ultimately begin making more money than I would have if I DIDNT refinance or paying more at year 15. 

This question is probably the most intriguing to me. I was about to start trying some excel calculations, but really felt this is likely something one of you has either 
A. Actually done themselves
B. Wondered about
C. Already completed a worksheet that they wouldn't mind sharing? 

- last question: by paying more off, is there any CONCERNS that jump out? Or is it fair to count this as immediate net worth growth? $500 off mortgage = $500 increase in net worth? 

I know there are lots of unknowns with any house and nothing is guaranteed - the same goes with any investment. 

Anything advice helps! Let me know if you need additional details from me that could help.",finance,1470241277
personalfinance,Saving for my daughter's future,"So I'm on disability thanks to 2 strokes and my 3yo daughter was awarded a portion of my disability to the tune of $546/month until she reaches 18. My husband and I want to save this money for her future (college, car, future, et.al.) We don't want her to lose any of this money on investment-based saving... its seems like those college based savings accounts are all based on stock markets and it makes us weary of using them (like the 529 plan). Would it be more prudent to keep throwing her money in a savings account with a low interest rate? Or are those 529 plans really that great and her money won't disappear? By the time she hits 18 she'll have nearly 100k saved and we want her to have it all - whether I'm still around or not.",finance,1470241836
personalfinance,How to get private lenders to offer the best interest rate on a student loan?,"As a grad student I'm $10K away from reaching the Stafford Unsubsidized Loan (5.8%) threshold before being relegated to Grad+ (6.3%) only. So, I submitted an application for the remaining $19K I need for the upcoming year to SallieMae to see what they had to offer. I was shocked at how low the interest rates were -- between LIBOR+2% and LIBOR+3%. Well shit, I'll just apply for the full $29K I need to take advantage of these sweet, sweet rates. Alas -- the offers were between +4 and +5%, not much better than the fixed federal rates.

I'm wondering if any of you have advice on what the best tactic would be for applying for the $35K I'll need next year. If they up the interest rates with quantity, maybe applying for half of it at one bank and half at another? Applying for Fall tuition separately from Spring? Avoid institutions you've already borrowed from because they'll take the previous debt you have into consideration? I've seen some banks offer fairly unexciting discounts to medical-industry students (Wells Fargo allegedly offered a fellow student a 0.5% discount, still higher than SallieMae)-- I'm a PA student if anyone is aware of some more-exciting options.

personalfinance,"I'm 27, in 400K student debt, 4K+ of credit card debt, and have 1.5-2K in collections, considering bankruptcy. What are my options?","Hey everyone! Lurked this sub quite a few times and it's time I ask about my own situation. This is a long one.

So here's what it is. I went to a prestigious art school in California for my Bachelors and Masters degrees. Unfortunately I did not get too much scholarship, and ended up saddling myself with loans every year. For the first two or three I took on private loans, but after the laws changed I was able to get most of my tuition in either subsidized or unsubsidized federal loans. This left me with, after leaving school, just under $400,000 in debt. During my 7 years in school, I worked different jobs, which really only afforded me enough to pay for my personal expenses, incl. rent, food, gas, etc. As in, not enough to help pay for school as well. As it stands, after graduating, I have on my private loans a monthly $1800 payment I cannot afford.

Now, I was studying film, so I needed money to pay for my thesis film, which cost around $4000 to produce, ended up putting a lot of that on two credit cards, one of which I stopped paying over a year ago and the other I just recently couldn't afford to keep paying. So now about $5000 in credit card debt.

I haven't even talked about the debt I have in collections, I'm not going to go into detail but suffice it to say that while I was in school, once I only had time to take on one job rather than two, I could no longer to afford my bills, medical, phone bill, etc., so now that's about $1000 to 2000 in collections total.

Now I am working, but it is under the table. I make about $23K and I decided to stay under the table so I could actually get health benefits and stave off my federal student loans. I know, I know, this is not just wrong, it is illegal. I realize that. I wouldn't do it if I could afford a plan on the healthcare exchange and I just cannot.

Where I'm at now is figuring out my options. I am looking for a better job, one that actually pays well and has benefits, but right now I'm worried that that will force me to pay for loans I cannot afford.

I'm strongly considering bankruptcy. What are my options? Do you need more information? I will edit if required. Thank you. 

EDIT: not sure why my story got downvoted so many times, but regardless thank you guys for the insight and perspective. I really appreciate this, and I'll do my best to update if things go well. If not, well then I guess you'll see me sleeping on the Venice Boardwalk with a dancing pet monkey.",finance,1470243378
personalfinance,"26, unsure of when I can drastically uproot my life while making sure I can afford to do it, full details in text","Hi. I feel in-over-my-head and overwhelmed by financial stuff, but I know I'm not that bad off. I think. I need a little guidance, please.     
**Profile**   

- 26
- College degree in a field I'm not in and not sure I want to get into  
- Currently work in IT, content enough with doing that, not sure I want it as a permanent career but I don't know what I want to do?   
- I want to move to the Orlando, FL area (currently do not live in Florida)  
- I'm going to list all of my financial stuff, but I don't know shit about anything and it's borderline embarrassing  

**Current Job**    

- I make $41,500 per year before taxes
- I have a local government job, so I have great health benefits and I pay into a pension.   
- My bi-weekly take-home is roughly $1,000 (a little more) before any overtime is factored in   

**Money**   

- My checking and savings account at my local bank total about $750    
- I have a Mutual Funds account with MorganStanley worth $8,500 (I don't even know what this means)    
- I have a 457 deferred compensation account with a balance of $4,600 and a bi-weekly contribution of $150 (next paycheck will be the first paycheck at this rate instead of the previous $100) (I don't know if I can touch this account or how I could or what the penalty would be, etc. and would rather not anyway)  


**Debts**  

- Three active student loans with fed. gov't totaling $10,800 ($200/mo. in payments, 112 month term expiring 10/28/2022, although I am about 4 months ahead in payments) 
    - $1,000 balance at 3.15% fixed rate   
    - $4,200 balance at 6.55% fixed rate   
    - $5,600 balance at 6.55% fixed rate    

- I currently have six credit cards.   
    - 2 are brand-specific that I pay off immediately when I use at their stores   
    - 1 is from a bank that I no longer am a customer of and I never use ($6,000 line available, unknown interest rate)      
    - 1 is from my current bank that I never use ($3,000 line available, 15.49% variable)   
    - 1 is a gas credit card that I pay off in full every two to three weeks  
    - 1 is an Amazon.com/Chase card that I use as my primary CC    
        -  This is currently the only one with a balance -- $700 even at 14.49% (variable) and an $11,000 line       


**Expenses**   

- I currently live at home with my parents (moved back two months ago solely to save money for this desired move) and do not have to pay rent or utilities   
- I spend $60/mo. on a gym membership, but I've considered canceling this as I've mostly been cycling and running outside, and I paid $4 for a yoga app that I use daily for at-home yoga. I used to use the gym for spin and yoga classes, but I've lost a little bit of that work ethic / desire to commit time.  
- I spend $20/mo. in recurring fees for entertainment purposes -- one for a music service, one for a streaming video service. I'm willing to dump one of them for the move, but the video service isn't negotiable in dropping.   
- My cell phone bill is $100/mo.  
- I spend roughly $90/mo. on gasoline (rounded up), and mostly avoid toll roads (sometimes I'm lazy and will take a toll road for time efficiency, but it's been $5-10 per month maximum)  
- I spend, this time a rougher estimate, about $250 to $300 per month on food; although I do live with my family, our dietary lives do not match up at all and I have my own groceries, etc. Admittedly, I've been a little more lax lately in spending by eating out twice a week for lunch instead of bringing it, but I'm going to tighten that back up.
- My car insurance is (rounded up) $1,000 per year on my existing car. See upcoming expenses next.       

**Upcoming Expenses**   

- The big one: I'll need to replace my car once I'm in Florida or before I leave. Maybe, maybe I could get $1,000 for my current car as-is if it doesn't breakdown first. I don't even know if I could sell this to someone else in good faith.  
    - I don't want to spend a lot of money on a car, but I don't want to get something that I'm going to have to dump a lot of money into; nor do I want a brand new car with long-term monthly payments, etc. But any guidance would be appreciated here.   
    - Insurance costs will be a factor too.        
- I'm about to go to Canada for the weekend for a bachelor's party; I'm expecting to spend about $400 to $500 max on this.   
- This also means I'll be going to a wedding in October; expecting to spend about $300 to $400 on that between tux rental, travel/hotel, and gift.  
- I need at least one suit as I currently do not own one. Price unknown. Never owned one before, believe it or not.   
- I have a networking opportunity located in Orlando at the end of this month that I haven't booked yet; the trip will cost about $600 total. I don't have to go, and I'd say it's 60% networking, 20% side-project related, 20% leisure. I mean I want to go, but if it's better financially to not go, skipping out may be the choice I have to make.   


**Job and Housing Situation in Florida**   

I keep getting rejected from every job I apply to due to being out of state; in addition, I've worked with three different recruiters (phone and Skype interviews) who liked me, but had my resume turned away repeatedly because the places were not interested in viewing out-of-market candidates. I've put my immediate job search on hold since then, with the intention of moving down there without a job.  

So yeah, as of right now, I plan on quitting my job that has great job security and health benefits to move over a thousand miles away without a job. It's scary, it's terrifying, but I don't have: a mortgage, kids, a girlfriend. Now is the time to do it, right?  

I have the ability to stay with family in Tampa, FL for relatively free (electricity, water, Internet is what I'd have to pay for, and the Internet will be split with family) 

**Questions**  

- How should I handle my currents debts? ($10,800 in student loans with payments of $200/mo. and $700 in credit card [with expenses coming] at 14.49% variable interest)  
- What kind of money should I have available to do this move? What is the best way to prepare?   
- In the same vein, my Mutual Funds money has been a ""safety net"" in the back of my mind that I want to avoid touching unless absolutely necessary, but it is there; how should I approach this?  
- Any other kind of advice/guidance/direction would be appreciated. I'll answer any follow-up questions that you have.",finance,1470243911

investing,India passes landmark tax reform: the GST amendment is expected to make the country one unified common market,"The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is being hailed as a very big structural reform in India, aimed at supporting organized market growth in India. [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-03/india-passes-landmark-sales-tax-reform-in-modi-s-biggest-win-yet) is calling it ""Modi’s Biggest Win Yet"", and to quote [The Financial Express](http://www.financialexpress.com/fe-columnist/gst-bill-passed-by-rajya-sabha-india-is-finally-one-country-with-one-tax/337546/): ""_India is finally one country with one tax!_"".

A short summary for the market watchers:

* Currently, a good is taxed multiple times at different rates in different states. The GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, which will replace at least 17 state and federal levies.

* GST would make doing business easier and tax neutral, irrespective of which state the business is being done. It will dismantle the inter-state barriers, and make the movement of goods faster and cheaper across a market of 1.3 billion consumers.

* GST implementation will not be a single event: the full roll-out will take a couple of years.

* The Government has not announced the final GST rate, but analysts are predicting a standard rate of 17-18%.

* Some analysts are saying that the short-term impact on the stock markets is already priced-in; others are predicting a short spike.

* In the long-term, the GST is expected to have a highly positive impact on the country's stock markets (and economy in general).

* Many companies are expecting cost savings from lower inter-state transfer octroi, lower transit times, warehouse rationalization, lower inventory-carrying costs, easier compliance, online payments, less paperwork and reduction in overall tax rates.

* Industries expecting substantial benefits include Automobiles, Cement, FMCG, Logistics, Manufacturing, Multiplexes, exporters and companies competing with the unorganized sector.",finance,1470247905

I am freaking out because I see my principle balance and interest just climbing and climbing!! I now owe $65,774.80 and I don't know what to do!!!!

We have an option to refinance our home and lump the loans and my mortgage together and get an interest rate of 3.625% - which is what the current interest rate is on my mortgage.  Calculations have us saving anywhere from $350-$450 dollars / a month, which I would plan to put right into the mortgage to pay it down quicker.

To me, it looks like a no brainer--it's basically like I'm refinancing the student loans to get a 3.625% interest rate, since my mortgage interest rate would stay the same.  I also would give a better deduction for tax purposes.  But I have two concerns:
1. The danger of swapping out an unsecured loan (student) for a secured loan (wrapping it into my mortgage)
2. The possibility of some sort of loan forgiveness being offered by the Govt in the future.  (We make too much to qualify for income-driven repayment, so the current forgiveness program doesn't apply to us.)

personalfinance,Why Whole life Insurance is a very bad investment/retirement vehicle,"I have been seeing a lot of people here using Whole Life Insurance as an investment/retirement vehicle to justify getting the policy.  This is a very bad idea.  Why?  Because the cash value accumulation in whole life is not really cash value.  ""cash value"" is an industry buzz word for line of credit.  What does this mean?  Say,  you have a Whole Life Insurance with 250K death benefit.  Premium is $2500 per year.  Say after 10 years,  the guaranteed ""cash value"" accumulation is 20k.  After 20 years,  you decided to take out the cash value due to an emergency and would like to keep the policy in-force.  When you take the cash value out,  it automatically becomes a loan with a variable interest rate.  Right now,  interest rate is 5% for cash value loans for a major mutual company.  Which means,  if you take out 20k from your cash value,  you now have a compound loan at 5%.  This loan has extreme detrimental effects on your policy if you fail to repay just the interest:

1) You now have to make yearly payments on your loan interest,  in this case $1000 a year,  or this interest will be added to the principle and becomes a compound interest loan.  This means,  next year,  your interest payment will be 5% of $21,000. What happens if you don't pay interest for 10 years?  You now owe $12,500 in interest to the insurance company!

2) The interest is variable!  Right now,  the interest on cash value is around 5%.  The scary part is,  5% interest is very high considering many institutions nowadays have negative interest rate!  What happens to your cash value loan say if the interest is at 10%?  You now have interest payments equivalent to your yearly premium! 

3) Lets look at at a realistic scenario where after 30 years, you want to withdraw your cash value and move it to another investment vehicle.  You are looking at around 100k in guaranteed cash value accumulation.  At 5% interest,  your yearly interest payment is double your premium!  Now,  your yearly payment to maintain 250k death benefit is $7500!  What happens if you skip out on the interest payments?  The interest is compounded annually and when you die,  the payoff will be death benefit minus loan + interest.  

4)  Cash value accumulation is not payed out at the time of death.  The insurance company keeps the cash value and only pay out the death benefit.   What happens if you have a cash value loan?  The loan + interest gets deducted from the death benefit!

* NY Tax Withheld $15,420 
* **Take-Home $131,529** 
* Bank Savings $48,000 
* ***Spendable	 $83,529*** 

Based on the above, I'm saving 31% of gross income between 401k/IRA/HSA/Bank Savings.  I've only been saving at this high of a rate for about five years - prior to that, I was putting all excess money into paying down my mortgage.

I don't have myself on a budget - I basically spend all of my take-home income and nothing beyond that.  Average monthly budget over the past year or so has been as follows (careful readers will notice that there's no entry for cell phone - this is paid-for by my employer):

* Property Tax $600 
* HO Insurance $117 
* Electric/Gas $247 
* Water $21 
* Phone/Cable/Internet $168 
* Car Lease $946 
* Truck Lease $322

* Dining Out/Entertainment $1,000 
* Travel (Airfare/Hotel) $1,500 
* Miscellaneous $1,000 
* **Total $7,064** 

Applying some self-critique to the above budget, I definitely overspend on cars.  Not only that, but I lease cars, which seems to generally be regarded as financially disadvantageous compared to purchasing outright.  I've gotten spoiled, though - with a lease, it's so easy to deal with, and I actually don't mind that it probably is costing me extra compared to purchasing.  I also spend a lot of money on dining out and travel.  ""Miscellaneous"" is things like minor home projects/repairs, clothing and footwear, alcohol/wine purchases for home, gifts, etc.

My assets are as follows:

* Checking Account Balance $9,200 
* Savings Account Balance $82,000 
* Vanguard Taxable Account $122,000 
* Vanguard Roth IRA $53,000 
* Vanguard IRA $2,750 
* 401k $422,000 
* House $275,000 
* **Total $965,950** 

This is the part that seems disappointing to me - my career earnings have been approximately $2.6 million over 22 years, and my net worth is less than 40% of that.  It's a little discouraging to look at it this way, especially because I feel like I've been a very diligent saver, and have always avoided debt except for a low-interest mortgage that I paid off as soon as possible.  While I do overspend on cars, I dramatically underspend on real estate compared to others in my income range.  I know I live a good life, but I don't really feel like I am ostentacious.  It makes me wonder how people who have more average household income (say, $75K) and kids manage to save enough for retirement and pay for kids and college and all that.  

With my total retirement savings (401k/IRA/Roth IRA/Taxable Account) of $599,750, and assuming I save $71,500K per year in today's dollars (current contributions to 401k/IRA/Savings, not including HSA because that could be easily consumed on health care costs), I'll have total retirement assets of ~$2.7 million (in today's dollars) in 18 years (age 62) assuming a real (inflation-adjusted) rate of return of 3%.  At a conservative 3% withdrawal rate, that gives me ~$81K per year of income, much of which would be taxable.  That's kind of crummy, because it doesn't come close to replacing my current spendable income, which is only 35% of my current gross income!  Social security may help bridge the gap a bit, but not all the way.

I know that in reality there are only 4 ways to address this retirement gap:

1. Save more between now and retirement.
2. Work longer.
3. Live on less money in retirement.
4. Earn a higher investment rate of return.

I don't have much control over (4), and I don't really want to save more now, because I feel like I'm already saving way higher than the typical recommended rates of 10-15%.  I know I'm sounding whiny, but this whole retirement projection has me feeling discouraged.

I greatly welcome any thoughts or feedback (or criticisms!) of my situation.",finance,1470255089

personalfinance,High credit card bills due to losing a job and new minimum wage job isn't enough,"Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on this subreddit, so I apologize if I don't format this correctly.

A little back story: I lost a well paying job back in March. I was making about $38,000 a year after taxes. I am relatively young (27 years old) so I had a single credit card that I was using to build my credit. I would use the credit card throughout the month for various purchases and use 1 paycheck to cover the bill. I would always pay it in full when it was due. I was earning miles and rewards, so it only made sense. I always made sure my monthly bill would be less than my paycheck so I would be able to cover other emergency expenses if they happened.

When I lost that job, I had just moved into a new apartment. I only had about $500 in savings left due to the account draining because of a security deposit/1st month's rent.

Now here's where I messed up. I was able to borrow a couple hundred from my parents to cover my rent and I was able to find another job within a month...but it was a HUGE pay cut. I went from making $38,000 to just around $19,000 after taxes. I had forgotten that I had my cell phone bill, cable bill, insurance bill, and my gas bill on auto-pay through that credit card.

So, the credit card bill was about $1,400 when I lost my job. I had a few other expenses here and there...but on top of forgetting the auto pay...that $1,400 has turned into around $4,000. I've been paying the minimum, which is about $100, but at 24% interest, I'm barely scratching the surface.

I was thinking about taking out a personal loan to pay the credit card bill in full and pay the bank directly at a lower interest rate...but I don't know if that is the best option for me as I really can't afford anything more than $100-125 a month for a payment. I have a good credit score (around 730) so I think I would be able to get a good rate on a loan.

I would really appreciate any advice you guys can offer me. I already cancelled the auto-pays and have them coming directly out of my bank account now. I have $7.49 in my savings account and I don't really know where to go from here.

personalfinance,Is a car loan a bad idea in my situation?,"I am 19. I just took a new job making $9.25/hour + commissions to grow my employment history. My monthly income should be around $1,300. If I lose my job I can work for the family landscape contracting business 3 days a week and make around the same amount. Almost all of my income (80%) can comfortably go towards a car loan.

I have literally $0 in expenses each month. I have a Discover It Student card but I pay it off each week. I am just using it for the rewards and to grow my credit. Gas and insurance is paid for by my gracious parents, and will be until I graduate in spring 2019. My college tuition is paid for with scholarships and I get around $1,300 back each semester for expenses. I have and will have no student loans when I graduate.  

My current car is paid for but it costs at least $1,000/year in repairs and is going to get worse. It has 200,000 miles on it. I predict the engine has about 20,000 miles left in its life. So far I have put about $4,000 in it, most in the last 2 years.  

I would like to take out a car loan for $12,000 on a 48 month term, putting at least $4,000 down. My reasoning is that I can still get about $800 out of my current car so I might as well sell before it goes kaput and is worth nothing. I will still have about a thousand in savings if I go through with it. My goal is to have the car completely paid off by the time I graduate. I have no plans on moving out. A loan that allows me to pay off early is a must.  

Would a student loan give me a lower interest rate than a car loan cosigned by one of my parents with great credit? Is it a bad idea? My parents aren't very good at buying used cars so I'm kind of on my own here.

My finances are relativity in limbo at the moment. My wife isn't working considering sending the kids to child care would be 2k extra a month and the jobs she's been offered don't help that nor her loans either.

The co many I work for is for profit. Id like to work for a non profit or government job full time in addition to my current job to be eligible for the 10 year public service loan forgiveness or be able to actually pay it off with the second job. 

Is this feasible? Has it been done. What are the risk factors I might be missing here?

personalfinance,ETF Indexes for Housing Funds - How Bad Could It Go?,"Edit: Sorry, title should have read BOND Indexes

Cut to the chase: how bad of a risk are bond indexes for short term house savings?  

Context:
We're currently saving for a home in the Bay Area, where family home prices are typically 700k-1M+. With that in mind we're targeting a downpayment of $200k which should give us some flexibility, and we're currently at about $130k (I don't count rainy day fund in this as I want to keep that liquid). We're saving roughly $40k/yr. 

We're only going to buy once we're confident in a location that fits well with work &amp; family life, (and pricing) and we aren't sure where that will be yet. That being said we think the time would be as short as 1 year if a great deal pops up, but as far as 6 years away if the market stays like this and we wait until we're really sure. That seems like a lot of money to have just sitting in cash, hence the bonds come into the discussion. The gains aren't huge but they're something and at least pay a dividend. However I know interest rates can really only go up, so these ETFs have to fall at some point (although stocks also seem over priced right now which just adds to the confusion).

Right now our allocations are 40% cash; 20% total bond mkt; 20% intermediate term bond mkt; 20% short term bond mkt. This is because I know short term is less volatile so I was trying to weight the portfolio towards short. 

My real question: Is getting 2-3% returns worth the potential drop? I think it comes down to whether that potential drop is 10% but I'm not confident in that floor. If the real risk is more like 20-30% then I know it's not worth it. 

How would you allocate a housing fund of that size? In the short term we're renting.

personalfinance,Attend a public college(20M). Debating on student loans/quality of life while in school.,"Hi PF. Long time lurker here,

Since I started reading this forum, I've gained a vast amount of knowledge on Personal Finance and know the dangers of student loans and how much it is preached to avoid them at all costs. However, I'm having a debate over whether or not they could be worth it for a better quality of life while attending school.

Background Info:
Currently, I attend a public university. I have a maximum Pell Grant, a small scholarship from the university itself, and I also receive a state-funded tuition program. However, that state tuition program is in serious jeopardy of becoming insolvent over the next year if action is not taken by the state legislature. I currently get about a $2,000 refund each semester for attending school when adding up all the items above (Before paying income taxes at the end of the year on it). I've only gotten it for two semesters as I lived in a dorm my first year. I used it on buying furniture for my first apartment, paying the deposit, and filling an income gap when I was underemployed.

I currently work in the service industry where income slightly fluctuates month to month. I tend to pull in about $1,300-$1,600/mo. Working 25 hours a week. I currently have $4,000 in an emergency fund that is fully liquid.

 My budget is as follows:
Rent/Utilities- $680
Car Insurance- $75
Health Insurance- $70
Gas- $110
Phone- $80
Food- $200
Discretionary- $200
Total: ~$1,400

I usually tend to break even every month, but sometimes I do not. I’ll have some major one-time expenses coming up, such as a new deposit on a house I plan to rent with roommates, books for class in the fall, and overdue maintenance on my Accord with 195k miles. My rent should drop to about $500 in a month and living at home is not an option. I anticipate to get some money back this fall, but do not expect to get any money back ever again due to the state tuition program being cut completely, which would leave me owing between $500-$1,000 a semester.


The main question I would love to get feedback on is whether or not taking out a few small student loans is worth keeping my quality of life intact. There is not much room to cut in my budget without me living like a recluse and I cannot work much more than I already do due to going to school full time. Is it worth it to take out a few small Federally subsidized loans in order to keep my emergency fund at more than $3,000? I know this is ultimately a decision I will have to make, but any feedback on my situation would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1470262728
stocks,"Wash Sale question. Example provided, looking for further explanation.","If for example you purchased on July 20th 10 shares for 10 dollars. Then on July 27th you purchase 10 shares for 11 dollars. Then on August 2nd you decide to sell Last In First Out at 10.50 dollars market price, how and why does this create a wash sale?

Wash sales are defined as selling a security at a loss when you buy shares before or after of that same security. (If I am wrong, please correct me).

If I keep the original shares (FIFO) and sell the second lot of shares (Highest/LIFO) how and why is this defined as a wash sale?



I thought original shares would be the first lot, thus selling the first lot (out of the two) would create a wash sale?

Why does selling the second lot out, the higher one create a wash adjusted price (higher), on my first lot. My first lot was 10 dollars for 10 shares. After wash adjustment, my first lot on July 20th of 10 dollars a share is now 10.5 dollars.

- 1 AmEx @ %13 APR
- 1 Citi card @ %12 APR
- 1 dental credit line @ %0 for 6 months, then %26 APR 

To reiterate, my windfall will pay all of this off. I plan on using the rest as my emergency fund and as the start of a savings account for a down payment on a house. 

My question is whether or not I should close some of my credit cards once I have zeroed out my balance. 
My store cards, though atrocious and a bad decision in college, are my oldest cards by far on my credit history.

Since the student loans are some of the older accounts on my credit report, would paying them off reduce my credit score by a lot? I know that having the debt paid off is more important than the credit score as it will recover, but it was something I thought of.

Do you still get any kind of tax credit for the interest paid on the loan like you do with the other student loans?

Is it smarter to get a fixed or variable interest rate loan? It seems like if you're going to pay it off relatively quickly, variable can be smarter.

Finally, if it gives any indication in to what kind of rates I might get, my credit score is between 740 and 750. The only other debt I have is 4,000 left on a 2.4% interest car loan.

My wife and I have 4 (young) kids and our house while adequate, really isn't working for us, it's a bit on the small side, in a relatively rough area with bad schools but the house is nice and I can rent it out for $200 net profit per month after mortgage and agent fees. The market for renters is terrible (great for landlords) in our location so I have no worries about renting it out quickly


We have been pre-approved for a $250,000.00 FHA mortgage on a brand new build, 3100 sq ft, 5 bed 3 bath. You name it, the house has it, beautiful subdivision, craftsman, side entry garage, granite, hardwood floors, better schools, we have friends in the neighborhood. It's our dream house and we would likely live in it for at least 20 years.


Long story short my absolute max budget is $1400 per month. 250k with FHA 3.5%, is roughly $1576 per month. When searching and working on the numbers I forgot to factor in the mortgage insurance when and that adds $176 per month. So what I thought I could get for $1400.00 will in fact cost us $1576 per month. This takes me out of my comfort zone.


Current Budget 

Net pay every 4 weeks 5200.00


Mortgage 700


Utilities+internet + tv + phone = 500


daycare 1284 (*****however I only pay 642 every 4 weeks***** as I keep half a years worth of daycare costs from refund/bonuses in savings so i only pay half of this amount)


Car pmt 361


personal Loan pmt 400


Food 1000


Gas 250


Car ins 80


no credit card debt


no student loans


Total 3933


All this leaves me with $1267 in discretionary spending for other stuff every 4 weeks


If I bump my Mortgage from $700 to $1576 this reduces my discretionary spending to $567.00 every 4 weeks


That is why I am so scared to plunge in that number seems so low when you have kids and shit goes wrong all the time with kids, cars, pets, wife's hair etc etc


However,
Every February we get a tax refund of around 9k as we pay a high amount to daycare AND we both get bonuses which are taxed up the wazoo.
So in Feb 2017 we will get a refund of 9k and we will get combined annual bonus of 9k net in February.


18,000
Put $8346 on the side which is half my day care costs for the year (321 per week X 52 / 2 = $8346), so i can continue paying $642 every 4 weeks out of my actual paycheck.


This leaves me with $9654 from refunds+annual bonus


I like to pay my personal ahead 6 months so i can get that shit paid off asap so 6X400 = 2400


Leaves me with 5946


The mortgage is $176.00 above my comfort zone so 12*176 = 2112.00 put that in my own personal mortgage escrow checking account to offset the higher mortgage payment.


Leaves me with 3834 to put away, replace tires on my truck, save for a rainy day, vacation etc etc


None of this includes any income from our current house that will be rented out.
Also beginning September 2019  we will have much lower (maybe ZERO) day care costs, bonuses will be a bit lower but income will be a bit higher so same difference. 


There are only a few lots left and our floor plan is being built right now ready to close at the end of September so the builder's agent is putting the pressure on us. He knows our situation and is not being an ass about it but he knows how badly we want the house and time is running out. Also he mentioned elections, rising house prices and rising interest rates ha!

personalfinance,Should I change cards?,"(Sorry for the wall of text)

First time poster here and I've got a (probably stupid) question. I moved to North Carolina just over a year ago, when I first moved here and got a temporary labor job to get myself on my feet I was given a prepaid Visa card that they loaded my daily pay on. The card is a Global Cash Card issued by Visa. As of the past few months the card has been a pain. I had to fight with their terrible customer service to have my Federal tax refund loaded onto it. Also later I've realized it's been limiting my online purchases and declining them, thus incurring a fee, even though I had a more than sufficient balance. Now it's just been incompatible with most of my ""creature comforts"" like Samsung Pay PayPal, and Acorn. Now to the actual question, would moving to a more ""actual"" bank or credit union like BBC, Wells Fargo, or  Carolina Credit Union be in my best interest to start saving money and to have a debit card that has actual support and a half decent name behind it?

Tl;dr should I move from Global Cash Card to a bigger bank",finance,1470288204

I got about half way through and then decided it was not for me. I had received a Federal Pell Grant, which I mistakenly understood to be a grant and not a loan.

Because I did not finish the semester, the University is holding me liable for $1,500 which the loan would have covered. I'm not in the position to pay this back right now. With some reading online, I had read that I should wait until they shift that debt to a debt collector so I can settle for half (which I hope by the time that happens I could afford.)

However, I read today in a post on Reddit that a state university can seize funds from your bank account directly. If they did that tomorrow, I would literally be on the street so I'm looking for some or any guidance on what I should expect or do.

I took out a secured loan just under a year ago from my bank and put down the amount I took out to automatically pay off the loan every month so it reports an on-time payment to the credit bureaus. Finally 9 months later I have a decent enough credit score to apply for a credit card which I will co time to use after the secured loan time period is done to continue building credit. I applied for a capital one credit card just under a month ago, was approved, and 3 days later my card was supposedly shipped out. Capital One says that it normally takes between 7-10 business days for a card to reach a customer. Now, I live on campus at a university, so I normally give them an extra day or so to process my mail, over 14 business days go by and my card never shows up, multiple calls later they claim they don't ship to P.O. Boxes, I confirm whether they add the box number or not, the street address is fine and that's where the card will end up. They claim they've updated and corrected the address but the card has already been shipped and should have reached, another week goes by, Nada, still no card. I Call again, the service rep says the box doesn't make a difference unless it's a replacement card from a fraud situation or something that's being overnighted to a customer via FedEx. Mine is not that and she said it should have reached a while ago, reviews my situation, verifies that the address the card was first shipped to wasn't the box but the street address, which I verify is correct and I always receive mail at it (or the box) all the time from everywhere (internationally as well). She apologises and says she's issuing me a new card, she says it *will* be here in 4-6 business days. I really need this card now to retrieve my IRS documents as well because they don't take a debut card as address verification for what I'm trying to achieve, today is the 4th business day after the rep sent out the second card and it still hasn't shown up.

personalfinance,Paying off debt: question about my options,"Hello!

I've posted here once before and I'm in need of a little advice again.

I recently gotten way over my head in debt, (about 14k) $5000 on one card, and $9000 on the other card. I work part time directing an after school program, and made about $1200 monthly last semester. I'll be teaching a class this semester that will bump me up to $1500 monthly. I'll be returning to work on August 29th. I don't pay rent, which is great, but all my money is going to my debt and I don't see my debt going down. Every time I pay my credit cards the interest literally kicks it back up. I don't have any savings, and my minimums for my credit cards are a little high. (ranging $120 - $220) I also pay my phone bill which is $125 and two other credit cards. They're minimums are manageable and I can always pay a little higher, they're in the $25 - $50 range.

I wasn't able to find work this summer, which led to me having to file for unemployment ($220 weekly, i'll be getting my first check next week) and nagoiate with one credit card company about paying my bill. With my card with $9000, I was able to get $120 off of my June bill (they took off the interest) and July's bill they took off $80. My card with $4000 wasn't so helpful, I just had to pay the minimum which was $111. While speaking to the managers of both companies they both mentioned their hardship program. The card with $9k stated that missing a payment or two would qualify me for their hardship programs. They had two option, one involved canceling my card and paying a lower interest at 5.9%. The other was missing 3 payments on my credit card and opting in for their program that keeps my card open. It would also not have a lower interest rate, it would stay at it's current rate at 15.24%.

My questions are:
 
Do I consider missing a payment on my credit cards and opt-in to their hardship programs?

How will my credit score be effected?

Is bankruptcy an option?

Any advice is appreciated, I'm seriously all ears! If you need anymore information please let me know.

Also, my credit score is 608 and my fico score is 690.

personalfinance,Questions about rolling over a 403b to a Roth IRA,"I have about $2000 in a 403b with TransAmerica Retirement Services. About a month ago I quit, now I'm in medical school. I expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement, so it seems like a Roth IRA is the way to go. Planning to use Schwab.

Here's what the TRS direct rollover form says:

""If you have chosen to make a direct rollover to a Roth IRA from a non-Roth account, and you want to voluntarily have federal and/or state tax withheld on the taxable portion of such rollover, indicate the applicable percentages below. Please note that a qualified distribution of Roth money and earnings is a non-taxable distribution.

Federal __%   State __%

In the event that a portion of your account is paid to you in cash and has not previously been taxed, or if you default on your outstanding loan, the following tax withholding may apply:

Federal Income Tax Withholding - 20% mandatory tax withholding applies.""

The TRS account rep said they'd withhold 20% of the total because they'd classify this rollover as a ""cash distribution."" Why would it be a cash distribution rather than a rollover?

Last year I grossed $25k, $19k taxable, and paid $850 in federal taxes. My current tax rate is way lower than 20%, so I don't understand why they'd be withholding so much money.

personalfinance,I can set the terms of my land contract (buyer)! Should I opt for a high interest rate?,"Long time lurker, first time poster!

As the title suggest, I am buying a piece of property (a small motel) from my father in law for $200,000. So, for the next ten years, I am going to make payments to him via land contract.

I've read that the IRS wants land contracts have an interest rate of at least 3%. He doesn't care how he gets the money so long as in ten years, he has collected $200,000. He is alright with modifying the principle so that after ten years he gets the full $200,000 ($172,700 principle paid over 10 years at 3% interest). 

I've heard that interest rate on a land contract is tax deductible. So, I was thinking of modifying the terms of the contract so that we pay significantly higher interest, but start with a lower principle. This way, my father in law still gets his $200,000 at the end of the day, but it becomes more advantageous on paper for me. According to this https://www.michigan.gov/documents/cis_ofis_ceilings_24956_7.pdf the maximum interest rate for ""unregulated lenders"" is 11% per annun.

My Question: Is 11% the max interest for this land contract? Is that interest tax deductible? Would the IRS frown on a particularly high interest rate?

personalfinance,Leasing New Car vs Buying Old Car - Needed Three Years,"Hi /r/personalfinance!

After moving to a city for graduate school that absolutely demands a car, I'm looking into buying my first car and I need some advice.

Before I continue, I must stress that I am considering leasing as I will be in this area for three years--coincidentally the length of most lease terms--and will have to leave the country for around a year or so for fieldwork. Due to this time frame, leasing is an attractive option for me, as I get to drive a new car for these three years and then be done with it, and then buy a car when I return. Also, I plan on using this primarily to drive back and forth to school, which will put me under the 12k mile/year limit.

Also, I'd prefer to pay as little down payment as possible, as I'm currently putting all this into paying down credit cards, student loans, and saving for a wedding with my current summer job(s).

My budget for a vehicle is under $250/month in any case, and I'm basically down to two options:

1) Lease a 2016 Mazda3 with their current no-money down event, which is roughly $219/month should my (excellent) credit qualify. Highly rated car that I've been researching about for a while, and honestly it'd be nice to have something new.

2) Buy partner's old 2006 Honda Civic for $5,500, which is at 98k miles at the moment, but never has had a problem and is well maintained. Plus, I won't need to haggle or visit car dealerships. It will need some work--timing belt, new upholstered ceiling, new radio (I need Bluetooth and there's no AUX port of any kind)--but she'll use this as a down payment for a new vehicle of some kind for herself.

My hesitation is that for a car this old, aside from potential repairs, is that my interest rates for this car would be at 4.19% at my local CU, and should I pay this car off in my desired three year time slot, it wouldn't be much cheaper per month than leasing. I say three years, as I'd rather not pay for a vehicle while doing fieldwork, and if I purchase this vehicle, I'd like to keep it post-fieldwork.

So this is kind of where I'm at for the moment. If anyone has a particular direction on what may be the smarter investment (for what it's worth with cars) in the long run, I'd be appreciative, as I honestly have little experience dealing with these matters!

Thanks! :)",finance,1470331350

personalfinance,AC went out and wife was rear ended. Need to replace both and will need to finance part. Possible dumb question.,"Ok, so we're pretty well off and the only debt we have is the house we bought 4 months ago. The house had an old AC unit which we knew wouldn't last long (it's 14 years old) and it desperately needs to be replaced (we live in FL) as it barely keeps the house below 80 now. We had enough in our savings to pay it off completely.

However, 2 days ago my wife was rear ended. The car was a 2008 and while there wasn't much damage, it was enough for the insurance to deem it a total loss. The car was worth about $4800 according to KBB and after our deductible we will be getting $7,938.66. We debated back and forth if it would be better to find a cheap used older vehicle that the 8k would completely cover or get a newer vehicle that would be more fuel efficient, probably have features older cars are lacking, and probably be more safe as well. We finally decided on the latter.

So we've decided on a car we like (a 2015 Honda Fit). Going to test drive it tonight. The cost after all fees and everything will be about $16k - $17k. The cost for the AC will be about $9k. We don't have $25k even with the insurance money, so we are planning on financing part of this and paying it off probably over a year or two. We will have (including the insurance money) about $13,500 that we can allocate towards these two things and I am trying to figure out the best way to do this.

1. Evenly split it between the AC and the car.

2. Entirely pay off the AC. Make roughly a $4k down payment on the car and finance the rest.

3. Put the $8k from the insurance towards the car. Pay off about half of the AC. Finance the rest of both.

I am leaning towards option 2 because an auto loan will have a much lower interest rate than a personal loan I believe. However, the car will take longer to pay off and I won't be the owner until it is (which I don't like) so I'm also leaning towards option 3.

Technically, we also have another $6k we could allocate to this, but we are saving up for a trip to Iceland and Norway next year and that's what it is currently budgeted for.

Just wondering what everyone's thoughts are. Thanks!",finance,1470331832

Private Loan (variable rate):

-$69657.69 @ 6.99% (currently) for 24 yrs

This comes out to $94,870.56 total at a weighted average interest rate of 6.67%.

I've plugged in both options of refinancing into SoFi and basically got the same interest rates for doing the private loan alone or including the federal ones as well.  They are as follows:

-10 yr @ 5.615% (Fixed)

-15 yr @ 6.125% (Fixed)

These two timeframes are the only ones that save me money as well as staying in my monthly payment limit.  However I should add that SoFi says my lifetime savings will be about $50,000 if I refinance just the private loans, and about $70,000 in saving if I do ALL of my loans.  

Right now I'm leaning towards consolidating/refinancing both federal and private loans purely based off of SoFi's prediction of how much I'll save in my lifetime.

My leftover money for gas, food, hygiene products, and entertainment is about $641/month. This always seems like such a big number to me, but with birthday gifts, medical expenses/doctor visits, oil changes, etc...it seems to go by fast.

Then I get my net pay. Not to mention the company doesn't take out federal or state taxes ( I live in CA). Tell me what the deal is here, am I being miss classified here? Or is it more than that?

personalfinance,The tax return got sent back to be for signature,"I forgot to sign my tax return.  I always mail it in.  Don't ask me why.  I just prefer it.

But anyway.  I used TurboTax to print it out.  I know federal online filing is free, but I owed money ($300), so I just mailed the whole thing in.  I prefer to owe under $200 every year rather than get a refund.

As you may or may not know, Turbotax does not let you enter cents into your W2 information but always rounds to the nearest dollar.

When my tax return got sent back to me for signing, there were two issues:

1. I didn't sign it (Doh!)
2. The total income, because of the rounding was around $1.00 higher than what the combined W2s show for my wife and myself.

So, if you round my W2 and round my wife's and add it together, it's a dollar higher than if you add the two together and then round it.

The IRS wanted a W2 or a 1099 for that extra dollar.  The actually letter said they wanted documentation on the income discrepancy between what was on my tax form and what was on my W2s.

So, I signed the forms, wrote a note explaining the discrepancy as being a rounding error, and send it all back.

Is there anything I need to be concerned about here?  Is this dollar going to come back and haunt me in some way?

My taxes are simple.  I own a home and deduct my mortgage interest, my taxes, and my church donations and that's it.  Wife and I file jointly with 2 kids.  I don't deduct any business expenses.

*As a side note, if you use the desktop version of TurboTax to file your taxes, I would suggest you not file until April 15th.  You'll notice that TurboTax updates itself all the time.  A number of years ago Turbotax told me I owed the government $900+ dollars, which is more than I typically owe.  I obviously delayed paying till the 15th and a software update I got at the end of March suddenly changed from me owing $900+ dollars to getting a $300 refund.  It freaked me out enough that I ran out and bought TaxCut and redid my taxes, and TaxCut confirmed that I was going to get a $300 refund.*",finance,1470334260
personalfinance,should I increase my home loan?,"My finance goals are all on hold at the moment because first I need to save up to complete my masters next year. And second I need to save so I can transfer my home loan out of the company one and to a bank so I can move out and rent it.

But. Have just discovered termites in my house and need to get that treated as well as some repairs to the floors. 

If I use my savings I will need to take a loan to do my masters. House loan is the best interest rate I will get but it will add a year or two on to the time I have to wait before transferring home loan to a bank.

personalfinance,"$77K income, $70K in personal loan debt, $31K federal loan debt, $6,300 student loan debt","I've fallen into a personal loan debt hole. I took out personal loans to pay off my credit cards (I had approximately $35K in credit card debt), used $10K towards our paying for our wedding, pay off my mom (~$5K), and the rest was used towards paying higher interest personal loans.

I went from a job where I made approximately $36K/annually -- however, my boss was a 1099 employee and never paid me on time, which caused me to borrow from my mom and end up taking out personal loans. Enough was enough so I found a job that paid $50K and slowly chipped away from the debt. I started my current job in 2015 at a $70K income, but I was dumb and started spending more instead of spending as if I made $50K. I recently obtained a promotion and a raise so now I'm at $77K.

I make about $4,400 in take home pay on a monthly basis. I pay $1,000 in rent and utilities (split with my husband) and I have 0 credit card debt. My personal loan debt amounts to about 60% of my take home pay, and after everything else, it doesn't seem like I have anything else left for the month. I have $1,000 in my savings account. I feel like I don't have any room to make any other cuts. I bring lunch to work 4x a week (and I go out to eat once a week, but it's a max of $10). My husband usually pays for dinners when we go out to eat. I take public transportation to work which is taken out from my paycheck as a pre-tax contribution, but after adding it up -- it's actually cheaper for me to drive into work (I have a Mini Cooper that's paid off, and it's pretty gas efficient since it's 37hwy/29 city) so I may start doing that next month.

Current budget:
$1,000 - Rent &amp; Utilities
$2,680 - Personal loan payments
$240 - Federal loan payments
$250 - Private loan payments
$200 - Roth IRA contributions

It'll increase roughly 1k per year (every April) due to my union negotiated wage increases, and if I take on a higher paying position which may become available, I could be making 45k within five years, at age 30.

My fed student loan balance is about 24k, (rates range from 3.4% to 7%, ~8k is in the 7% range) not crippling or insurmountable, but I figured it would still be worth it to take advantage of PSLF. I have no foreseeable plans to leave the public sector. For the last couple years I have been paying $156 on my graduated payment plan. Not a lot, but more than enough to cover interest and take a chunk of principal, without causing me much stress. As I am now wanting to ride the PSLF train, I have to switch to a qualifying payment plan. My application for PAYE is submitted, but not confirmed yet. Based on my 2015 taxes (17k income), my PAYE payment will be $0! At first I thought, ""great! Even $0 payments qualify under PSLF, and I'll save a thousand bucks by the time I'm reporting my income next year (30k, if not less) and adjusting my PAYE plan accordingly. Which will still raise my (estimated) payments to only ~$100""

In the last day however, I have started to stress about the fact that my interest will go untouched during the time that I am qualified for my $0 payments. Am I needlessly worrying because all will be forgiven after 10 years, regardless of how much interest accrues? Or do I not have as good a grasp on my PAYE approach as I thought? In the next couple years my payments will not exceed the $156 which I have been paying, but by the end of my PSLF run (6-10 years from now), I'll be making payments of $255, equal to my standard payment plan amount, but it will never go higher than that. My thought was that by the time I've made my 120 qualifying payments I'll have 5-10k to be forgiven under PSLF.

economy,REMODELING OUR F***ED ECONOMY,[deleted],finance,1470357650
economy,REMODELING OUR F***ED ECONOMY,"How does a f---ed economy happen. Well, people may be either emotional or rational about economic issues. Unfortunately, those people who are primarily emotional about economic issues view the people who are primarily rational about economic issues as narrow minded and uncaring. Similarly, those people who are primarily rational about economic issues view the people who are primarily emotional about economic issues as narrow minded and whiney. So to quote the captain from the movie Cool Hand Luke, “What we've got here is...failure to communicate”. And that failure to communicate on an emotional and rational level is how a f---ed economy happens. 

Before moving on a simple explanation of an economy may be helpful. Basically economies operate on three levels. The emotional level, it's about an individuals need to feel good about participating in their societies economy. The rational level, an individual decides how best to use their resources—or their money, in the economy to purchase the goods and services they need or want. And the together level, economies are how societies organize themselves from the bottom up, using markets—or consumers and businesses—as a way of trading goods and services with one another. So however you choose to view it, emotionally or rationally, we're all in the economy together—God helps us. 

Now, how does a f---ed economy get remodeled? Well, there are two ways, both will be put-forth below.  

First, stop being jerks to one another—that's easier said than done. But all the emotional people need to remember is that a rational persons view of the economy is helpful; it provides a sense of direction for the economy. And all the rational people need to remember is that an emotional persons view of the economy is helpful; it reminds us all that our economy is made up entirely of people. Simply stated, people that are primarily emotional or rational about the economy are not narrow minded, uncaring, or whiney, each just has a different view of the economy—and both views are vital for a healthy  economy.

Second, introduce a new economic model into society. Traditionally, people have equated economic models with their national economy and more complex issues such as GDP, inflation, and national debt. But the best way to understand an economic model is as a tool, it helps explain—and helps direct, an individuals and businesses behavior in an economy. When an economic model is utilized as a tool to look at things from the bottom up—at the together level, you can get an understanding of how consumers and businesses make decisions and then build upon that to investigate the more complex issues that will arise as a result of those interactions—such as how that economy is structured. And the best way to structure a complex—or emotional/rational, societies economy is through the introduction of a new emotional/rational economic model, humanatapilism is that new economic model. I can hear you now,  “What the heck is humanatapilism?” Don't worry a brief explination is provided below—for a more in-depth explanation read, Unscrew Humanity &amp; Improve Capitalism: Humanatapilism, Part Deux. 

Humanatapilism is a new free-market based economic model that approaches economics at the together level—the level of individual consumers and businesses—and builds up to an understanding of how those individual consumers and businesses work together to create an emotional/rational economy. And  working together to create an emotional/rational economic model improves the quality of life of consumers, of businesses, and of our fellow human beings—and that’s how you successfully remodel a f---ed economy.

So a quick recap on how to remodel a FAILED—what were you thinking, economy, stop being jerks to one another—easier said than done, introduce a new emotional/rational economic model into society—humanatapilism, and for a more in-depth explanation of humanatapilism a new emotional/rational economic model read, Unscrew Humanity &amp; Improve Capitalism: Humanatapilism, Part Deux. And try to remember—we're all in the economy together!

personalfinance,Wife has student loan debt she doesn't know what to do with. Am I looking at this correctly?,"I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I'm currently a med student and accruing debt.  Meanwhile, my wife, who is out of school and working (not as a physician), is starting to pay her student loan debt.  I have literally zero experience with paying loans off but I have always read to pay the highest interest rate off first so I want to make sure I am leading her in the right direction. 

Her student loans are separated into two ""Groups."" 

Group A- 
Balance: $25,643.02
Accrued interest this month: $364.64
Interest rate: 6.410%

Group B-
Balance: $21,317.05
Accrued interest this month: $213.94
Interest rate: 5.410%

Her payment is $215/mo. 

I told her that she should be paying off the interest of both loans every month, then putting the $215 payment plus whatever else she can spare towards Group A.  The way I'm thinking about it is that if she does this, she will keep the Group B balance the same while slowly knocking down the Group A balance until it is gone.  She really cannot afford to pay much more than that, with only about $1000 total to devote to paying off loans each month.

personalfinance,Torn between which loans to payoff first... 4.99% auto loan or 4.9% student loan,"Well the title speaks for itself. I am definitely going with the  avalanche method for loan payoff, but am curious about which loan would be more beneficial to avalanche first:

Auto Loan- ~$27.1k remaining @ 4.9% with no prepay penalty
-OR-
Student Loan (private variable) ~$13.3k @ 4.99% with no prepay penalty

Now the avalanche method tells me that I should be paying minimums on all others and aggressively pay down the highest interest rate loan. My dilema though comes from a recent development where I am now making $95k/yr + OT. 

Realistically, is it now more advantageous for me to pay down the auto loan, even though it is at a marginally lower rate, simply because the student loans are tax deductible and I'm in a higher tax bracket?

personalfinance,Not being paid for the right amount of hours or the right amount per hour,"First time reddit poster so please bear with me. This summer I was hired part time to work in a restaurant as a server. I was told that I would receive 7 dollars an hour for training time, without collecting tips, and that when I became a server I would earn 2.83 an hour plus tips. When the first paycheck comes around, my manager came to me and offered to pay me under the table at 2 dollars an hour. It saved him from paying a payroll fee and I would have lost it all to taxes. Naively I listened, forgetting about my federal tax return. Another issue was how small the amount came out to be. I never kept track of my hours besides ""clocking in"" on a sheet of paper at the restaurant so I couldn't backtrack and confirm I wasn't getting paid for all the hours I was owed. After later pointing out the issue with the tax money I should be receiving, my boss switched me to payroll but not for my tax returns sake, it seemed to be more of a cover on his own behalf. With this first paycheck, I was never paid for the training hours. I pointed this out and was told it would be in the next paycheck. Most recently I received my first and last check (as I quit due to a number of other issues). I was clearly not paid for all of my hours ( I was credited for less than the literal working time the restaurant is open when I have to stay a half hour everyday to clean. The shifts I work run from 9-3 and I work 5 days a week. I also never leave anytime before 3:30. I was credited for 29 hours. More importantly, I was given a cash payment for my training hours which did not even cover half of the training time I was owed. I refused the payment and demanded the full amount. I was told that I will be paid the full amount after a brief argument. This restaurant has cheated me on my hours, my time and has not paid me in full for work completed over a month ago. What can I do to ensure that I get properly paid for ALL the hours I worked, and how can they be fined appropriately. I am not the only worker with these issues and they are looking to take similar steps in getting the money they earned whilst holding the owners accountable for stealing from teenagers. On a side note, I am only 19 and I am working 2 jobs, without the restaurant, in order to pay for college so I need every dime I can get.

So I am starting a new business with a few of my associates, and we would love to get some feedback in regards to the website!

Basically it is a movie review website similar to Rotten Tomatoes and such, only dedicated and run by stoners!

Here are just some of the features that we offer

1. Get honest reviews from people who are high. This allows an amazing perspective about the movie, such as if it is funny, sad, hard to follow, requires pausing, and so on. Not some stuck up review from a guy who doesn't relate to you.

2. Personalized detail about the movie environment. We all love moves, and the atmosphere of the movie can certain have an impact on the viewer, but did you know that it also works the other way around? How much would you really enjoy a movie if you had to keep pausing it every few minutes because your friend is asking a question, needs another drink, and so on? You lose a lot of the detail and experience. With our reviewing system, you can pick the best movie for the best experience possible.

Bitcoin,"My suggestion to Bitfinex on what to do next (Part 2, BFXcoin)","While there is still plenty of unknowns at this point, it does seem that Bitfinex is leaning towards socializing BTC losses and issuing BFXcoin (I'm using BXC for short). While the haircut % has not been made public yet, most reports range from 45% to 30%... I realize any haircut is too much, but in the context of historical BTC hacks this is actually a fairly good turn out and (personally) I would consider anything above 50% a win. However this post is not about the haircut, it's about BXC, which I think is a very interesting concept and opens many different options I think worthy of discussion. Here are some basic questions and my suggestions to make BXC compelling, but I'd like to hear yours too.

What is BXC? Is it an interest bearing debt instrument (IOU) with a defined maturity period or a dividend paying equity token? Each of these options have their own set of advantages/disadvantages but personally I find the dividend approach more interesting and it appears this is the direction BFX is leaning.

* If it is an IOU, then I'm guessing it would work like a traditional bond. The debt would be sold (in exchange for the depositor liability) at a predetermined rate below BXC's nominal face value at some maturity period, say 1 BXC = 1 BTC upon maturity Dec 25th 2018 and the rate BFX offers depositors is 1 BXC = .9 BTC implying a 10% interest rate over the entire maturity period. For a variety of reasons (liquidity preferences, solvency risks, etc) people would sell BXC initially and it would trade at a discount to this face value and likely the initial offering price too.. say 1BXC = .3 BTC a few days after initial trading for example. Speculators would provide some floor to the value, or BFX could buy BXC off the market themselves to reduce their long-term liabilities, potentially at a significant discount. In many ways this would be similar to the DAO token in which speculators bought the tokens at a discount in anticipation of the ethereum hark fork (a solvency event for the DAO). This approach is likely ideal for BFX as they have capped their long-term liability, but less interesting for initial holders as their upside is capped at the face value of the bond which would impact its expected value today. 

* If BXC is an equity token, things get more interesting. Implementations we could look at in the crypto would range from ASIC Miner (voting equity) to JustDice (sort of a round about dividend paying token with no rights). This option also brings more financial complexity as we now need to know a lot more about BFX's financials. What % equity stake does BXC represent in BFX or is it only a claim to dividends? If it is an equity stake, what is BFX valued at and what voting rights would BXC come with? What regulatory risks would this bring? Will the dividend yield be determined by revenue (so come directly from fees for example) or from profits (which is norm for dividend calculations as paying out of revenue would create its own set of solvency risks)? What should the yield be, 25% of trading fees? 50% of profits? What do BFX's historical cashflows look like? What makes this option more compelling for depositors is that the upside potential is uncapped, if BFX maintained its role as the global liquidity leader for crypto, the dividend over a long enough time horizon could far exceed depositor losses.. which would drive speculative demand in the short-term. If BFX values their company too low, hypothetically depositors could walk away with BXC being worth more than their initial BTC losses in the short term. The clear downside here for BFX is BXC represents an unlimited expense for the company's profitability and impact their desirability for acquisition. BFX could always perform buybacks to try and redeem all the BXC tokens over time, but likely there would always be some holders that did not want to sell though perhaps there could be a reasonable clause to solve this. 

My suggestions:

1. Go with equity based BXC. It'll cost you more in the long term if you're successful, but It'll be better to your customers in the short-term and I (personally) think you owe that to depositors for sticking with you. I also think it would create a virtuous cycle of BXC holders evangelizing your products.

2. Allow BXC holders to vote regularly on a predefined set of issues so that they have at least *some* influence over BFX direction (listing new tokens, fee structures, etc). This will increase demand for BXC.

3. Value BFX very conservatively when issuing BXC, remember that BFX equity would be worthless if your customers force you into bankruptcy. My guess is fair market value would be north of $200m (for comparison, Coinbase is valued at over $500m atm), but I think $100-150m valuation would be more than fair and demonstrate good faith in making customers whole. I don't know how you would structure this legally, except maybe an LLC that represents BXC holders pro rata and owns equity in BFX legal entity. 

4. Make BXC dividend a mixture of both fees generated (revenue) and profitability. Too much revenue and you're threatening your long-term viability, too much profit and you're inviting everyone to criticize every single expense... very few things I could imagine more annoying than 1000 redditors engaging in financial monday-morning quarterbacking.

5. Engage in radical transparency. The existence of a freely traded equity token means speculators will benefit from both movements up and down in the price... this means there will be financial incentive to spread FUD. The only way to dispel this is to open up your books and remove any questions of impropriety. Also, I realize the BitGo topic is sensitive right now, but the feature of letting users audit their holdings in realtime was a big value add... you need to keep that feature.

6. Pick a dividend yield that has a realistic chance of paying depositors back in less than five years without risking your solvency. I'd much rather a 5 year plan that works, than a 2 year plan that drives you out of business.

7. I think this is the most important point: the success of this plan requires your business to keep operating over a long time horizon which means customers need to be confident in your ability to protect their funds! You need to invest massively into security. This needs to be taken as a branding opportunity to far surpass any security standard set today in our industry... I'm talking FORT KNOX grade security. If you survive this, only you will have had the experience of losing 120k btc and knowing what it takes to pay back depositors... wear this as a badge of honor and integrate it into your DNA ""You can't take security serious enough until you've felt what it's like to lose everything"". If this means it takes 24 hrs to execute a withdrawal, so be it. I can not understate the importance of this issue towards regaining the trust of customers (like me).

If BFX executed this well, not only would I be ok with the haircut but I would actually be a buyer of BXC. 

This is a long post, and I'm sure it's filled full of errors... apologies in advance. What do you think? What type of BXC would you like to see and what terms would you like to see involved?",cryptocurrency,1470374841

personalfinance,Cancelling credit card and worried about the impact of age of credit history.,"Hello!

I have done a lot of work in the past year to finally fix the fuckups of my early-20s. I'm finally at a point to where I'm not completely embarrassed by my credit score, and have gotten it up over 75 points in the last year. Woo!

Because I had such poor credit, I didn't have many options for opening credit accounts without a high interest rate and few benefits. I did what I could, I used them to build where I am at now, and I no longer really have a need for a particular card that I feel is pretty predatory (they offer very small credit increases and charge $14.99 to increase your credit, on top of the annual fee), on top of a ridiculous interest rate.

I would really just like to get rid of this card. It has a very small balance I can pay off immediately, but I'm concerned because it's my second oldest card and I already have a very young credit history due to never being able to be accepted for anything after I monumentally trashed my credit in my early 20s.

I currently have four credit cards which are 3 years 2 months, 2 years, 10 months, and 6 months old. The card in question is the 2 year old card. My average age of accounts is 1 year 8 months.

Should I cancel the card and take the probable hit to my score, or should I just hold onto it and let it keep aging my credit history? Am I over-thinking this and it's not going to affect my score all that much?

As an aside, I see Credit Karma considers 0-5 accounts being as ""very poor"" and 11-20 is recommended. Is this really right? I have four. What sorts of things should I look for as far as kinds of accounts I should seek out to add to my total and increase my credit worthiness? I am not in a large amount of credit card debt and I pay off total balances every 2-3 months (like, I use my card to purchase a large item like new appliances or a TV, then pay it off over a few months), so I'm just wondering what else I could do to increase my credit worthiness at this point.",finance,1470387343

Hello Redditors! I’m Dr. Mark Pimentel and I’m here to talk about the bugs in your body! More specifically, I’ll focus on my research on the association between food poisoning (gastroenteritis) and disruption of gut flora, impairment of GI tract motility, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome – something I’ve been fascinated by and dedicated to studying over the last 20 years. Did you know that around 40 million people suffer from IBS? Despite low federal funding for motility research, there have still been many scientific advancements in this field. My research team has established the concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a potential cause of irritable bowel syndrome and discovered that methane-producing bacteria in the gut can cause constipation.

stocks,Understand The Jobs Report Tomorrow So You Can Profit,"The markets are flat again today as all eyes turn to the Non Farm Payrolls Report tomorrow. Expectations are for a gain of approximately 175,000 jobs in the month of July. So what happens if the number comes in sharply above or below estimates? Anything too high or too low will shock the markets and cause selling. Below I reveal the ranges, along with the likely stock market reaction.

 

1. Neutral Number

Any number between 150,000 and 200,000 will be looked at as a goldilocks report. In other words, the job gains are not too strong to force the Federal Reserve's hand to raise interest rates but not too weak to show the economy is sliding towards recession.

 

2. Slightly Warm Number

A number between 201,000 and 250,000 will be looked at as a slightly strong number. This will cause the markets to think there is a very slight chance of an interest rate hike later in 2016. The Dollar may strengthen slightly and interest would likely bounce. This could cause some minor selling in the stock market, but nothing major.

 

3. Slightly Weak Number

A number between 100,000 and 149,000 would be viewed as slightly weak. The markets would likely believe the Federal Reserve will not hike rates at any point in 2016. Yields may slip a little and the Dollar likely would weaken. Markets would react in a flat to slightly lower manner with the ever so slight hint of a potential economic slowdown drifting through its mind.

 

4. Extremely Strong Number

A number over 250,000 would be very negative for the stock market. It would potentially put two rate hikes on the table and suggest the Federal Reserve is behind the curve on raising interest rates. It would also cause the Dollar to spike dramatically higher and yields jump sharply. Yields jumping would cause money flow to exit stocks and enter the bond market, thus creating a stock market sell off.

 

6. Extremely Weak Number

A jobs number below 100,000 would freak the market out worst of all. Why? Because it would send a panic of recession through the stock market. This would be two extremely poor jobs reports in the last three. In addition, it would suggest to investors that all the Federal Reserve easing over the past seven years has not worked in a sustainable way. Investors and the stock market would likely start to lose confidence in the Federal Reserves ability to stem a recession and a huge stock market sell off would follow.

personalfinance,Saving - 22 in the UK. Am I making the most of my savings?,"I have always been fairly good with money, never really overspending and I've usually been able to put some amount away into a savings account, however it's now building up and I'm not sure I'm making the most of what I have.
I'm trying to set myself up for the future and do the best thing possible with my funds as I get them.


I recently opened a Help to Buy ISA, in which I have made the initial £1200 deposit as well as set up a £200 standing order every month. This has an interested rate of ~2.4%.

I have another Everyday Savings Account in which I pay £300 monthly, which has a tiny interest rate of ~0.25% or so.

I then have my normal bank account which I use every day, with any left-overs going towards my Everyday Savings Account.


I have a bank loan with £9000 remaining with payments of ~£240 going out every month. I have approx 3 years remaining until this will be paid off. The idea behind this was to get myself a decent car, as well as build up the beginnings of a good credit rating.
At the end of the loan I am aiming to have saved enough for a deposit on a house.
I believe the interest was added onto the loan at the time that I took it out, meaning that there is no monthly interest added to the total sum. £10,000 when I took it out meant there was approx £11,500 payable.


I am also aware that I am not paying into any kind of pension plan. My current workplace does not have any plan that I am aware of, although I believe there is some sort of Government plan that I could pay into?
Would you recommend I start paying into a pension plan ASAP or are savings good enough for now?

I also pay my student loan fees monthly which equate to £150 - £200.

I have no experience with investments either, but I'd heard this may be a better route to go down rather than a basic savings account. Any more information on this subject would be great!

So given the above, would you say I am making the most of what I have? Or do you have any ideas or suggestions on what I could do in order to get on a better footing?

I appreciate there is not really any ""direct question"" to answer here, but I'd like some feedback on what I am doing just to make sure I can't be doing anything better.

personalfinance,Help with settling student loan debt with creditor,"About four years ago, I had to move back home from where I was living due to a family emergency. During this time, I knew I wasn't going to be able to make my payments with the ever-loving Sallie Mae, since I was more focused on helping my family keep their house. 

Of course, Sallie Mae was absolutely not willing to help me at all, ironically enough because I had been making my payments on time up to that point. Cut to around six months later and I ended up defaulting on three loans and I figured it was the end of the world when I was being faced with litigation. 

After talking to the representative at the collections agency I was working with, they were able to work out a deal with me, effectively lowering the interest rate on my student loan to 0%, while making the payments actually affordable to me. I had been making the payments on time and everything was going great until I got a letter yesterday. 

Apparently my debt must have been sold to Northstar Location Services, because they sent me a letter claiming that Sallie Mae (now Navient) has authorized them to collect on the student loans I have defaulted on. Now, this doesn't really surprise me, since loans are bundled and sold for pennies on the dollar all the time. 

I have now realized my first mistake which was when I made the deal with the previous creditor, I never had anything written in place (Yes, I know I'm stupid. But, I was 22 years old at the time and couldn't believe that I was able to get myself out of that first pickle). So, Northstar has no reason to honor that obligation. 

In the letter, it says I still owe Navient ~$21K, which if I  go look at my Navient account, is accurate. 

Further on in the letter, Northstar says they have been authorized by Navient to settle my account for ~$4000, so for about 20% of what I owe Sallie Mae.  

This is where I'm hoping to get help. I currently have a credit card with a $20,000 limit and I have 12 months of 0% interest on it. With myself have two loans cleared in the next three months, I could have the credit card paid off in the next six months easily. 
But, I'm not sure if I should try negotiating with them any more on it, as I'm not sure how much lower they would be willing to go on the debt, and my pessimistic self is afraid I will piss them off and they will renege on the deal that I have in front of me right now (however, I do have it in writing).

If anyone has any advice on what I could do to make sure I could get this taken care of (if anyone thinks it is possible), I would really appreciate it. I know if I am able to get this paid off, I will absolutely ask to get in writing that the debt has been paid has been paid in full, so I will have recourse if any other place tries to come after the debt.  

TL;DR - My defaulted loan was sold to another creditor. Creditor has offered in writing to settle my debt for ~20% of what I owe. Need help navigating this as smartly as possible.",finance,1470400076

personalfinance,"bought a house, is paying of the house worth it?","TL;DR; Bought a house at $350k/year (0.45acres, 2.4sqft, 4bd, 3bt), have about $220k left on mortgage, is it worthwhile paying it off early considering we have relatively high income ($250k/year)?

So I've been lurking around here for a while.
The backstory: When my wife(30) and I(33) decided to buy a house I turned to you guys and as always you guys gave great advice, we bought a nice house (Austin, TX) well within our means for ~$350k and we put a solid down payment of about $100k.

We decided to do a 30y mortgage at a higher interest rate 4.125%, but paying extra towards the principal to give us breathing room if something goes awry (job loss for instance).

 My wife(30) and I(33) have great jobs, I tend to forget how lucky we are, but our combined income is easily in the $250k/year (It can vary between $200-$300k; I know pretty crazy). Our debt, apart from our mortgage is her car (&lt;$18k). We have a very solid savings too ~$150k, and according to my estimation we should be at about $200k by the end of the year.

So now, as planned, we've been putting an extra $1000/month towards our mortgage. At this rate we'll have it paid off in 10 years (not bad, we'll be in our 40s with a house to our name). But, I would like to pay it off much sooner - within a few years if I can. It's really a personal choice, I hate having debt, I like saving/investing, and recently I started thinking about maximizing our investments (thanks to r/investing, and r/financialindependence) to become truly financially independent.

At anyrate, My plan is to sink my annual bonuses and company's stock (the company offers really nice ESPPs) into the house and have the house paid off in probably less than 5 years while still maintaining high savings. The question is - is this smart??

My plan all along was to just pay it off, and then either rent it, or live in it for a while until I figure out what to do next and save. At the time of purchase it seemed pretty insane to pay $180k in interest alone for something that costs $240k. The way I'm thinking about it, I'm really just parking our money by paying it off early. And we're buying ourselves the freedom to take on less stressful jobs if we want to.

Well, what are your thoughts?

 P.S. We have 401k but I need to take a closer look at those because I'm very uneducated on this topic and having watched Oliver's 401k show I'm a bit freaked out now. Also, considering our high income and having read ""Millionaire next door"", I definitely realized that we are well below where we should be. And finally, yes, we'll start a family with our first being just around the corner - but considering our savings/income I'm not really worried about it.",finance,1470411233

I was seeing if I could gather any other insights. Within the past few months my mind has weighed heavily with the thoughts of student loans, eventually mortgages, and in general the financial system.

personalfinance,Need help with Contract Negotiations!,"Throw away just incase. I'll give you a little bit of background information about myself. I am a 20 year old part-time college student. I've been working for the same company since I was 13 years old, starting out as an referee/umpire, and working my way up throughout the company. I was actually one of the first employees, and haven't left since. Our pay scale then was a little different than most. Let's say you reffed a game with another person, you'd make $15/hr. If you worked a game by yourself, you made $30/hr. 

Eventually, when I turned 17, they went to a set hourly rate, depending on how long you've been working for the company. They gave me $17.50/hr, which, at my age, was awesome. I'd be getting more hours with this, but not as much as I was hoping. During the seasons, it would be only 8 hours a week, and over the summer, I would get thrown hours here and there, doing little misc. jobs. Also, I'd work summer camps and those would be 20 hour weeks. Over the summer, I'd probably add up to 100 hours tops. 

Now, at 20 years old, I currently make $20/hr, which is insane. I get paid $20/hr for everything, including reffing, summer camps, and now, marketing events. Some days I'll end up going to a Chickfila and setting up a booth and gathering emails for the company to send out via blast emails. 

Things were going great until a few weeks ago, when they were going to talk to me about a contract. Since I'm only taking 6 hours of class during the week, they wanted to give me 40 hours a week.  Sounds great, right? Well, I'd keep my $20/hr, but I'd only make that for 8 hours a week, on saturdays, for my reffing job. Then, the company decides they want to make me the leader of marketing. This is where things got fishy. They wanted to pay me $15/hr for the remaining 32 hours of the rest of the week for marketing only.

I'm kind of at a loss. $15/hr is what I was making 7 years ago when I was 13. Sure, it's more hours, but it's also more work and less money per hour. I can negotiate with them, but I'm not trying to leave what I've help build up.",finance,1470426256

I will be entering first year college in two weeks (community college), all will be distance learning so I have obtained a full time job as well.

My job consists of me driving... a lot as I deliver, setup, and tech for events and such (computers, A/V equipment, networking, etc).  I do not currently have a car and am using my mother's but putting the amount of miles on her car isn't going to work.

My current bills are minimal.  

I have one credit card with a balance I used to pay for school (my community college is one of those that doesn't participate in federal loans and I wanted to save from using private loans until 4 year) for the amount of $2,000 now.  Card has 0% interest for 12 (more) months. I've been putting close to $400/month toward this card but could reduce it to $100/month.

personalfinance,Drowning in interest rates and negative equity on a car loan,"Hey all.

Back in November I bought a new 2015 Dodge Dart Rallye. I'm not at all familiar with loans and finances (which the salesman picked up on), so I ended up with a $521 monthly payment at 16.52% interest. I had good, but not enough credit, and I was told that this was the only way that I could get a loan. I took the bait and now have a $23,826 loan on this car.

To date I've paid $3,652 to Chrysler. Only $1,376 has gone into the loan itself, with $2,276 going into the interest. [Chart of payments](http://imgur.com/ii0Czhu).

I spoke to my bank about refinancing the loan and they can only refinance up to what the value of the car is, approximately $14,000. That leaves me with a gap of about $8,500, and there's no way I have the cash to cover that gap. I have very good credit now (750 credit score), but I still can't get any kind of refinancing option. 

To add insult to injury, I've had numerous problems with the car that they've had to fix. The entertainment system and gauge cluster lose power intermittently, and recently the engine has started suddenly dying while I'm driving it (has happened four times this week). I only have 17,000 miles on it, but that is more than the Massachusetts lemon law covers me for (15,000).

personalfinance,Inherited an Inherited IRA. Not sure what to do.,"My grandmother passed about two months ago. I was one of the beneficiaries on one of her accounts. The share I received was approximately $50,000. I guess I did not totally understand the situation as I was under the impression that I would be able to stretch the IRA using my life expectancy. I have come to realize that because I inherited an IRA that was already inherited by her (she inherited the IRA from my Uncle) I have to use her life expectancy. She already took out her RMD for 2016, at a divisor of 9.7. As I understand it this means I will need to take out a RMD in 2017 with a divisor of 8.7.
Before realizing that I would have to use her life expectancy, I planned to invest it heavily into stocks. I transferred the assets to Vanguard and was going to place most of it into the Total Stock Market Index Admiral Shares (VTSAX) fund. My thinking was that, due to my age (33 years old) and where I fall on the Single Life Expectancy Table, I would be able to leave this money invested for a few decades and ride out any dips in the stock market while taking out my RMDs along the way.


Now that I realize I must remove this money within the next 9 years (with much larger chunks coming out per year than if the RMD was being calculated with my life expectancy) I am more hesitant to place all of this money into VTSAX due to the inherent risk of investing in stocks. In my mind, with respect to this money, it is as if I am currently in retirement already.


I have about $26,000 of debt from student loans (loan details at bottom of post). My original plan (prior to realizing I cannot use my own life expectancy for calculating my RMD) was to pay this down more aggressively with income from my job (I make about $55,000 annually) knowing that I have a large cushion (in the form of this inheritance) in the case of a true emergency. In addition to income from my job, I was going to throw my RMD money at the student loans and perhaps even take a bit out of my existing emergency fund (about $20,000, a mix of emergency fund and future down payment for a home which I would like to be able to purchase in the next  two to five years).


Here are the options I am currently considering.


1) Stick with the original plan, invest this $50,000 into a fund like VTSAX (or maybe 500 index) and receive yearly RMDs based off my grandmother's life expectancy. I am concerned that a turn for the worst in the stock market could cause me to have to sell these funds at an inopportune time, losing out on the full potential of this money.


2) Alter the above plan slightly and invest some of the money (not really sure what percentage) into bonds as a way to hedge my bets against a downturn in the stock market while I am taking out RMDs. Maybe half in bonds and half in stocks?


3) Take out some of the money now to pay down student loans that are of a higher interest rate. I don't feel like I need to pay off all of the student loans now, but perhaps all of the loans that are above 5% (maybe even all of the ones that are above 4%). Then leave the remaining funds invested using one of the two plans listed above (all stocks or a mix of stocks and bonds).


4) Just take out all of this money and get this over with. My income is at a level where it seems I will pay income taxes at a rate of 25% no matter what on this money (please let me know if I am mistaken here). If I did this I would end up with about $37,500 after paying taxes at 25% bracket. I would probably use $11,000 of it for contributions to a Roth IRA for the 2016 and 2017 year, pay off my student loan debts with a higher interest rate (according to plan number three) and keep the rest in a savings account that goes towards a down payment on a house in the future.


I am leaning towards plan three or four. I would love to hear some opinions from others on this matter. Is there anything I am way off base with here? If I do go with plan three or four, should I just have them withhold 25% of the distribution to avoid an underpayment penalty?


TLDR: 33 years old, inherited an inherited IRA of $50,000. Make $55,000 per year and have $26,000 in student loans at various interest rates. Cash out? Leave in Stocks? Mix of stocks and bonds? How much should I have withheld if I take a distribution?


Thanks!

personalfinance,Tax Brackets and 401(k)'s,"*Edit* For new individuals, see comments below, already addressed where I had a misunderstanding.

So a little background about me, I'm single, have a degree in Mechanical Engineering and currently am a Special Education Teacher. Long story short, entry level engineering is rather hard to get into right now. You really need some sort of in with the company. I come from a family of teachers and becoming a teacher once you have a degree is rather easy. It's not a career move, but something to provide my needs with and I'm good at it. Where I live, new teachers make $34,000 a year. Within Special Education where I live, if the school is short Special Ed Teachers they can convert unfilled positions into a 0.2, meaning a 20% bump in pay for picking up the slack when it comes to case loads. So if you took a 0.2 as a level 1 teacher, that puts you at $40,800.

$40,800 a year puts you into a new tax bracket, 25%. The 15% cutoff is at $37,450. I've seen quite a lot of discussions on the web about $40k salaries and living on it. Well, in the future I am considering taking a 0.2 while still being a level 1 teacher (it takes 3 years BTW to go for a level 2 license, which increases your pay $10k). The tax bracket issue becomes a real problem at $40k.

At $37,450 you'll see $31832.50, before other things have to be deducted from your paychecks. At $40,800, I'd see $30,600 before other things have to be deducted from my paychecks. But, if you work for a company that offers traditional 401(k) plans, 401(k)'s are deducted before taxes, decreasing your adjusted gross income. So if you're near the tax bracket, like at $40k, it seems to me that the best thing you can do is dump enough money into a 401(k) plan to bring you below $37,450. 

Using myself as an example, if I do end up taking a 0.2, I think the best option would be to put $3600 into a 401(k). That would bring $40,800 down to $37,200. The difference in taxes? $10,200 vs $5,580. $34,000 would be $5,100 in taxes BTW. So by putting $3,600 of the $6,800 pay increase into a 401(k), I only end up paying $500 more in fed taxes a year and end up seeing $1000 more in income, before other things are deducted. If anyone finds any fault, in terms of Fed income taxes, with this please point it out. I know that Soc. Sec, State, Work Comp, etc also have to come out but they don't have such a massive change when compared to Fed. income tax brackets. 

I wanted to bring this up because I think anyone making ~$40k a year should think about dumping money into a 401(k) if you can, you'll actually end up seeing more of your money while making it easier to have a retirement fund. You're literally putting money towards retirement instead of paying it to the Gov't, by using a 401(k) when just edging into a new tax bracket.

At least this is how it all makes sense to me and while I'm not an idiot, I don't pretend to be an expert on taxes either.",finance,1470481274

personalfinance,Seeking advice on paying off debts and financing home improvements with secured home loan,"My family has a lot of debt that resulted from unemployment/underemployment over the past five years. In that time, home improvement needs have also risen up. We have gone from multiple cars, to a single car when one failed and couldn't be replaced, to engine issues that will soon leave us in a position where we will have to acquire another vehicle.

My wife's mother is part of our family, and contributes to both bill paying and the existing debts I referred to above. Recently, as she is starting to get older and concerned that in the long term a health issue could force her into giving up the house that we all live in, she transferred the deed to my wife.

So, we now have a mortgage-free home with a value of &gt;$350k, but combined debts, home improvement projects, and quality of life improvements that would require $200-250k to get us in the clear. 

Household income is over $4k/month. Monthly non-credit card bills are ~$1.7k, and credit minimums are just below that. Throw in the normal things like groceries, and trying to pay down credit cards, and no money is going into savings outside of 401k contributions. 

So, we need to leverage our home in order to wipe the slate clean, and get to a point where we have a monthly loan payment with low interest at a fixed amount, can manage our monthly expenditures, and begin to save towards long term goals that right now aren't even on the map.

My confusion is around the multiple loan options available. It seems like everyone jumps to HELOC, and this may be the appropriate loan, but this isn't about using existing equity while continuing to pay off a mortgage since our home is mortgage-free. That would also seem to eliminate the option of refinancing, which is about taking your existing mortgage, rolling in other debts, and moving forward at a lower interest rate than before.

What I believe is the best option, but confuses anyone I discuss it with, is to re-mortgage the property. Everyone thinks of a mortgage as a loan between you and the lender to pay an outside party for their property, so they get confused when we already own it, but the rates are almost a full percent lower than HELOC rates, and the term and amount of money seem to be preferable. I know people who consider a paid off mortgage a waste of an asset, because they'd rather have some cash in hand for other ventures and pay their bill each month to the bank, but my circle of friends can't seem to wrap their heads around this.

Is there more to this than I am seeing? Are there alternatives which I haven't considered? Any and all advice would be appreciated, and I will do my best to answer whatever follow-up questions arise from this post. Thank you so much in advance, /r/personalfinance redditors.",finance,1470491035

I have approx 200k in equity in the home (Southern California) and thought that getting a cash-out refi would be the way to go.  It's all going back into the house, and HELOC have higher rates that are adjustable.  Not to mention the fact that they seem like a baited trap:  Long period of only needing to pay interest, lower rates the higher you allow the credit line to be...   Makes me uneasy.

But then I found out that a refinanced mortgage that has cash out has significantly higher interest rates than one that does not, even if the amount borrowed and LTV are the same.  

In other words, let's say you have a home worth 200k if you owe 100k and refinance for 120k (dropping your equity on a 200k asset to 80k) the interest is higher than if you owed 120k and tried to refinance that... even though you have the same amount of equity on the same asset.

**Greg Maxwell has now publicly admitted that he is attempting to artificially suppress Bitcoin adoption and price, in the short term.**

Maybe he is doing this so that he and his associates can continue to accumulate while the price is still low (1 BTC = $570, ie 1 USD can buy 1750 ""bits"" - where 1 BTC = 1'000'000 ""bits""). 
 
Or maybe Greg - and his buddy Adam Back, President of Blockstream - could simply be doing this for any number of reasons related to their ignorance of how [economics](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/46052e/adam_back_greg_maxwell_are_experts_in_mathematics/) and [politics](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4w8hgn/remember_this_tripe_from_adam_back_now_thoroughly/) actually work with open-source currencies.

Either way, this kind of centralized market manipulation is outrageous.

It should not be tolerated in any market in a publicly traded asset - whether regulated or unregulated.

---

By the way, as we all know, the total supply of Bitcoin is 21 million BTC, or 21 trillion ""bits"" - which is similar to total money supply for many other measures of currency or wealth (ie, in the tens of trillions of units). 

And as we also know, many measures of total world currency or wealth are *also* in this same range: around 10s of trillions of units (ie: dollars, etc.). 

This suggests that (for people who, in Greg's words, already *""know in their heart of hearts that bitcoin would be the true reserve currency of the world""*), the current price of 1 USD = 1750 ""bits"" (market-manipulated by Greg Maxwell) is ridiculously low - ie, it's a ""steal"".

So, people who are currently ""short"" on bitcoin (ie, they want to buy more), might be thankful for Greg Maxwell's market manipulation - where he is exploiting his position as ~~self-appointed dictator of Bitcoin~~ Blockstream CTO, to engage in central planning in order to manipulate the market, by artificially suppressing Bitcoin adoption and price a while longer (by forcing his ""tiny-blocks"" approach on everyone: the notorious 1 MB ""max blocksize"") - simply because he can and he wants to.

Meanwhile, in a regulated market, **this sort of blatant centralized ""insider influence"" on a publicly traded asset class or currency would be illegal**.

The only reason Blockstream is able to get away with this kind of ~~crime~~ bullshit is because Bitcoin is unregulated - and the only people who can stop them at this point is us: the Bitcoin community.

For the record, I believe the following:

- Government interference with Bitcoin *would be wrong.*

- Market manipulation of Bitcoin, by artificially suppressing adoption and price, as practiced by Greg Maxwell, *is also wrong.*

- The Bitcoin community can and should *regulate itself* - by letting the free market determine things like what code to run, what ""max blocksize"" (if any) to adopt - which will in turn *naturally determine Bitcoin adoption and price.*

So, this public admission of market manipulation by Greg Maxwell constitutes yet another reason why the *community* should reject his attempt to become some kind of self-appointed dictator for Bitcoin. 

Specifically, we can and should use *other* code (not developed by Greg Maxwell and his minions at Core/Blockstream) which does *not* impose an artificial 1 MB ""max blocksize"" - which repeated studies have shown is far below the blocksize supported by our current technology (which would be up to [up to 4 MB according to the Cornell study](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=cornell+study&amp;restrict_sr=on) - or even [20 MB, using u/Peter__R's proposed ""Xthin"" approach](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc+bitcoin/search?q=xthin+author%3Apeter__r&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all)).

For additional background, below are 3 previous posts from last week, regarding Core/Blockstream's centralized, behind-the-scenes manipulation of Bitcoin adoption and price:

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vfkpr/the_fedfomc_holds_meetings_to_decide_on_money/

&gt; **The Fed/FOMC holds meetings to decide on money supply. Core/Blockstream &amp; Chinese miners now hold meetings to decide on money velocity. Both are centralized decision-making. Both are the wrong approach.**

&gt; Having a ""max blocksize"" effectively imposes a ""maximum money velocity"" for Bitcoin - needless central economic planning at its worst.

https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4vl65n/remember_when_bitcoin_was_to_be_ruled_by_math_not/

&gt; **Remember when Bitcoin was to be ruled by ""math not men""? Whether you support bigger or smaller blocks, and whether you're ""short"" Bitcoin (you want the price to go down, so you can buy), or ""long"" (you want the price to go up, so you can sell) - you should still support *decentralized* governance.**

&gt; ...

&gt; **The potential for manipulation**

&gt; In the past, I've communicated with several experienced old-time traders and consultants from Wall Street regarding Bitcoin.

&gt; And many of them say they won't touch Bitcoin with a ten-foot pole because it's quite obvious to them that (in the absence of regulation), a new asset class like Bitcoin is horribly vulnerable to all sorts of behind-the-scenes manipulation.

&gt; They've seen it all before. They know all the ins and outs of how people with ""insider information"" can rig the market - and they can already see plenty of warning signs and alarm bells showing how easy it would be to pull off this kind of market manipulation in Bitcoin.

&gt; ...

&gt; A handful of insiders can easily manipulate this ""max blocksize"" number - deciding whether and when and how it will get changed, and how much, and how often - so they could potentially manipulate the price - depending on their own personal preferences.

&gt; ...

&gt; **Is there a solution?**

&gt; As you can see from all of the above, the main problem facing Bitcoin right now is **centralized governance.**

&gt; Of course, code inevitably does have to be (centrally) written by *someone.*

&gt; But there *are* things we *can* do *right now* to minimize the amount of centralized intervention in Bitcoin's code and governance.

&gt; **Whenever possible, we can and should favor code which requires a *minimum* of centralized interference.**

&gt; Core/Blockstream have basically spent the past year or two tying themselves up in knots, and disrupting the community and the market - and ~~maybe even~~ suppressing the price - due to [their stubborn, selfish, destructive refusal to provide parameterized code where the market can set certain values on its own](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4ttmk3/reminder_previous_posts_showing_that_blockstreams/) - most notably, the ""maximum blocksize"".

&gt; Meanwhile, code such as Bitcoin Unlimited (and also Bitcoin Classic, once it adopts BitPay's Adaptive Blocksize Limit) puts the ""governance"" for things like ""max blocksize"" back where it belongs - in the hands of the users, in the marketplace. 

&gt; Using more-parameterized code is an obvious technique known by anyone who has taken a ""Programming 101"" course.

&gt; Everyone knows that parameterized code is the easiest way to let the market set some parameters - avoiding the dangers of having these parameters set behind closed doors by a centralized cartel of powerful people.

&gt; We can and should all work together to make this a reality again - by adopting more-parameterized code such as Bitcoin Unlimited or Bitcoin Classic.

&gt; This will allow us to realize the original promise of Bitcoin - where **""The Users and the Market Decide - Not Central Planners.""**",cryptocurrency,1470503379

I don't understand what category the other part will be taxed as?  Will this be considered an inheritance? (there was no will, I was part of the estate).  

Also, I understand I'll need several accounts with different banks to put the funds into when I receive them.  I was just wondering if you guys had good suggestions for banks with decent interest rates.  I've done online research, but oneof the banks with decent-ish interest rates  had a waiting list (??) and that sounded fishy to me.  So now, I'm suspicious.

personalfinance,Refinancing home when there are no closing costs?,"Hi all,

My current mortgage provider is offering me an ""opportunity"" to refinance my mortgage.  This is an offer that seems way to good to be true, so I submit it to you fine folks to tear it to pieces and tell me why it would be a dumb idea. ;c)

Background:  Bought our first home approximately 2 years ago, in Ohio, for 170k.  Fixed interest rate: 3.75%.  As a Veteran, I used the VA Home Loan.  No money down, which I understand is not recommended here, but that boat has sailed.  

Even after our property taxes were raised last year, we've been able to comfortably continue making our monthly mortgage payments, which currently comes to $1,323.93 per month - principle (278.40), interest (525.83), and escrow/impound for taxes and insurance (519.70).

Our outstanding principal right now is $168,265.56.  We have no prepayment penalty.  

Now our mortgage company is offering to let us refinance to a new fixed rate of 3.5%, ""no strings attached.""  

Of course, banks don't usually call me to ask me for less money than I'm currently paying them, so I've attempted to do my homework, looking online and reading the small print of their offer.  As best as I can tell, the ""catch"" is usually that you have to pay thousands in closing costs.  However, the mortgage company is claiming that because I'm a Veteran who used the VA Home Loan, the government pays the closing costs at no cost to me under the ""VA Streamline refinance program"".   So the bank makes money from the government, and I make money by paying less for my mortgage, and it's win/win.

Again, I'm a skeptic.  So I'm looking this gift horse straight in the mouth, but I'm not seeing the catch.  Maybe you guys can help find it...or maybe you'll say it really is a deal to jump on.  Let me know!

THE NUMBERS

*Current Deal*

Outstanding principal:  $168,265.56
Interest Rate: 3.75%
Prepayment Penalty: None

Principal: $278.40
Interest: $525.83
Escrow/Impound for taxes/insurance: $519.70
Total Monthly Mortgage payment: $1,323.93

*The Offered New Deal*

Outstanding Principal: $168,265.56 (same as current deal)
Interest Rate: 3.5% (.25% less than current deal)
Prepayment Penalty: None 

New Monthly Payment: $782.21 (""does not include taxes or insurance"")  (Assuming I understand this correctly, I would be saving 22 dollars per month).

New remaining term: 28 years, 3 months (same as current deal)

""Estimated Life of Loan Payment Savings"" $7,465.75

Closing costs:  Zero. (also ""no minimum credit score"" and ""no appraisal is required"".)

So...what's the verdict?  22 dollars per month isn't going to life changing to us one way or the other, so I'm not going to do it if there's any ""catch"".  That said - there doesn't seem to be one.

TL;DR Current mortgage company offering to refinance at a slightly lower interest rate, saving us $22 per month.  No closing costs or other fees.  What say you?",finance,1470532189

personalfinance,Smartest way to take out a personal loan,"I have the opportunity to join my profession's union.  However, the initiation fee is more than three times my current liquid assets.  New members have the option of an interest-free payment plan, but I would still need to put 1/4 of the total fee down, in addition to my first dues and the processing fee.

I intend to advertise that I am union-eligible, and postpone activating my membership until I get a long-term union-only job offer that I would otherwise be unable to accept. Union work will offer double my current income, as well as a large step up in terms of work quality and professional experience and skill sets that will be invaluable.

As I am completely debt-free with a 720 credit score, I intend to take out a loan to cover the initiation fee down-payment and other costs of joining.  I intend to get this loan within the next few weeks and keep the money on hand, so when I do receive the appropriate job offer that justifies the expenses associated with membership, I can walk into the union office and join that day (jobs offers are often given with 24-48 hours notice).

What is the best way to take out a small personal loan, less than $3k? Credit union?  Open a second credit card with a 0% APR period?  See if my current credit card (which I pay off each month and has a $14k limit) will give me a lower interest rate or a 0% APR period?",finance,1470536261

personalfinance,21.5k student debt &amp; no 401k match for first year,"Just last week I paid off one of my (federal) student loans, which was about 2.5k at 4.5% interest.  That leaves me with ~21.5k left and $2300 per month to potentially use towards them.  These are the rest of the loans with their principal balances:

Direct Sub Stafford (4.66%) in grace until Nov: 5500
Direct Sub Stafford (4.29%) in grace until Nov: 5500
Direct UnSub Stafford (4.29%) in grace until Nov: 3050
Direct UnSub Stafford (4.29%) in grace until Nov: 2200
Direct Sub Stafford (3.4%) in forbearance until Nov: 5122.74

My strategy going forward is to just focus on the $2200 4.29% loan since it's the lowest balance and currently accruing interest.  At the same time, I can save up 3-4 grand to pay down the subsidized 4.66% 5500 loan just before the grace period ends.  Since I don't have to pay it down before Nov (because it's not accruing interest until then), I can just toss that into savings and decide how much to allocate in Nov, based on my housing situation.

Common wisdom says to contribute to the 401k up to the company match, pay off debt and then focus on something like a Roth.  However, in my circumstances, I have no company match until June '17.  That said, I can still afford to contribute 20% while I'm paying off debt given I'm in free housing until December.  Is there any reason not to do this?  I work for an investment bank and so have great options for my 401k, which they manage for free and allocate it in a bunch of mutual funds based on my chosen strategy (which I have as 'most aggressive' at age 26).

Also, I should note I was recently paid an after-tax bonus and put that straight into a Roth.  My justification for this is that if I don't stay at this company a year for some reason, I have to pay it back.  So, I just put it into index funds, though it might be wiser to have it in savings.  In any case, I'd like to keep it at least semi-liquid until I've been at the company a year.

Basically, I'm asking if my strategies make sense.  If it matters, my gross income for the year will be about 35000, since I started in June.  I suspect that means there's less reason to aggressively invest in the 401k.  But, after this year, I'll have much more reason to, since I'll have the match and more gross income.",finance,1470579769
personalfinance,Auto loan help,"This is my vehicle info:

* 2014 Toyota Corolla (bought new in 2014)
* Loan balance: $18,500
* $4000 negative equity
* Interest rate: 4.5%
* Payment: $375 (4 years remaining)

This is my wife's vehicle info:

* 2012 Toyota Corolla (bought certified used in 2014)
* Loan balance: $11,500
* No negative equity
* Interest rate: 5.5%
* Payment: $220 (4~ years remaining)


I have $22,000 saved up. I was planning to pay off my car, but that would only leave me with $3500 left after the loan is paid. However, it would eliminate an almost $400/mo car payment. Based on my current budget with the car loans, I don't really have much money left over to contribute to savings or pay extra on my car loan. However, with my car loan gone, I could put that money back in savings.

Alternatively, I could pay off my wife's car and have a decent amount of cash left in savings. I could use the $220 saved on her car to pay on my car. It would have the loan paid off much quicker. However, I would still be stuck with the almost $400 payment.

Lastly, if I paid off my car, we could easily double my wife's car payment and have it paid off in half the time.

Either way, I will have to start repaying my student loans in June 2017. I have no idea what to do as both interest rates are so similar. Any thoughts?",finance,1470582739
personalfinance,Income not subject to tax (US),"Everybody hates paying taxes, right?  Well, perhaps not, but even if you smile when doing your patriotic duty, maybe you feel you've done enough, especially if you have a lot of taxed income.  Here are some ways you might generate or otherwise receive income (i.e. money) [without owing any federal taxes](https://www.irs.gov/uac/taxable-or-non-taxable-income-1) on the money.   You usually won't owe state or local taxes either, as most follow federal guidelines, but a few cases differ in a few states, so keep an eye out for these.  Comments below refer only to federal taxes, and in some cases may not address very unusual situations that apply to very few people who would be reading this.  (For example, you might owe more taxes on social security benefits if you have a lot of tax-free bond income.)  [Here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p525.pdf) is the full gory detail for those who like such things.  

This list does not include deductions from your taxable income; it also does not include  refundable tax credits, which are another form of untaxed money.  We can do those in another post if people like.  

1. [Gifts.](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/frequently-asked-questions-on-gift-taxes)  A gift is something you receive that is not compensation for goods or services.  You don't need to report gifts on your taxes.  Usually the giver won't owe any taxes, either, though there's more paperwork if they exceed $14k to one person in one year.  On a gift of property such as real estate or stock, you could owe taxes when you sell it, since you also receive the giver's basis.  

2.  [Inheritance.](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tools/tax-tips/General-Tax-Tips/Video--Is-Inheritance-Money-Counted-as-Income-by-the-IRS-/INF19544.html)  Inheritances of money or property are not taxed.  Furthermore, you do not inherit their cost basis, but rather the fair market value at the time of death, so you can sell without paying taxes if you sell at that same value.  (Inherited retirement accounts are subject to tax, though.)

3.  [Insurance payouts.](https://www.ameriprise.com/research-market-insights/tax-center/tax-planning/taxation-of-life-insurance/)  If you receive a death benefit from a life insurance policy paid out as a lump sum, this is not taxable income.  You also do not owe taxes on claims paid from your health, car or homeowner's insurance.    

4.  [Injury awards.](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4345.pdf)  If you receive a lawsuit settlement for injury claims, the compensatory damages are not taxable income (unless you previously deducted medical costs related to this.)  Workman's compensation is also not considered taxable income.  Punitive damages would be taxable, though, as are employer-paid disability insurance payouts.

5.  [Tax-free bonds.](https://www.irs.gov/tax-exempt-bonds)  Municipal bond interest is exempt from income taxes, and these bonds pay lower interest rates accordingly.  If you wanted to make $10M in a year and pay no taxes on it, you could do that pretty easily if you had $300M to put into municipal bonds.  You can buy tax-exempt bond mutual funds, as well.  You do report this income, but it's not taxed.  Usually the income is exempt from state tax only when it's in your state; there are funds for single-state municipal bonds in many cases.  Note that private activity bonds are sometimes tax-free, but can be included as income for Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) purposes.  

6.  [Sale of a principal residence.](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p523/ar02.html)  You can usually exempt $250,000 from capital gains taxes on sale of your  principal residence; a couple gets $500,000.  You had to have used the property as a principal residence for two years, though they could be at various times in the last five years.  If you rented the house during that time, you get a lesser exclusion.  You report this but don't pay taxes on it.  

7. [Long-term capital gains up to the 15% tax bracket.](https://www.kitces.com/blog/understanding-the-mechanics-of-the-0-long-term-capital-gains-tax-rate-how-to-harvest-capital-gains-for-a-free-step-up-in-basis/)  If your income is otherwise below the top of the 15% bracket, you can take long-term capital gains up to the top of the 15% bracket without paying any taxes on them.  You do report this income, and you could in some cases lose some credits or deductions that are tied to income level, but you are not taxed on the gains themselves.  

8.  [Rebates that reduce selling price.](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p525/ar02.html#en_US_2015_publink1000229502)  If you receive a rebate directly from a seller as part of a purchase transaction, e.g. a car dealer giving a rebate when you buy a car, this is not considered income to you, at least not at the federal level.  Rebates from utilities for installing conservation measures are treated the same way.  You do not report these.

9.  [Credit card cash-back benefits.](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/irs-taxable-income-credit-card-rewards-points-gift-1277.php)  Cash and points you receive as  a result of making certain kinds of spending is not taxable income.  You do not report these.  However, benefits you receive only as a result of opening an account, such as a checking account, are subject to tax.

10.  [Scholarships.](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc421.html)  Scholarships for tuition, books and fees as part of a degree program are not included in taxable income.  This does not apply to room and board payments, or to income received in return for teaching or other work.  These are typically reported by the institution.  

11.  [Gains on Roth retirement plans.](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-on-designated-roth-accounts)  If you take qualified distributions from a Roth retirement plan, generally after age 59.5 but also if you are e.g. disabled, these are not taxable income, though you do report them.  You can also withdraw prior contributions at any time without any tax impact. 

12. [Certain fringe benefits.](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p15b/ar02.html#en_US_2016_publink1000193627)  You exclude from taxable income some employer-provided benefits, including educational assistance, HSA contributions, commuting/parking benefits, dependent care benefits, meals and lodging for employer's convenience, achievement awards (e.g. 10 year service), cell phones, group term life up to $50K, etc.  You do not report these.  These can make some jobs considerably more valuable than the salary alone.  

13.  [Rental income up to 14 days.](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2585177-how-to-report-income-of-personal-home-under-14-days)  If you rent your primary or vacation house for less than 14 days during a calendar year, you do not need to report this income or pay taxes on it.

14.  [Sale of personal items.](https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2410290-do-i-have-to-report-personal-items-that-i-sold)  If you sell personal property for less than you paid for it, then this money is not taxable income.  If you sold it for more, then this would be a capital gain.  You do not report these.  You can't take a capital loss on personal property, but you can on investment property, e.g. collectible coins. 

15.  [Child support payments.](https://www.irs.gov/help-resources/tools-faqs/faqs-for-individuals/frequently-asked-tax-questions-answers/interest-dividends-other-types-of-income/alimony-child-support-court-awards-damages/alimony-child-support-court-awards-damages-1)  Child support payments are not taxable income.  Alimony is taxable income, though.

16.  [Welfare benefits.](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p525/ar02.html#en_US_2015_publink1000229477)  You do not include in your taxable income the value of welfare benefits, including e.g. Medicaid, SNAP, CHIP,  etc.",finance,1470583701

personalfinance,Paying for college without financial aid,"I'm making a 6-figure salary, but I've reached the point where I can't get paid more or work on more interesting problems without finishing my undergraduate degree. Toward that end, I've decided to go back to college. I went to college before, but only finished 2 years of a bachelor's degree (at a school that didn't offer associate's degrees, so I have no degree).

The problem is, my current job is pretty stressful (45 hours per week minimum), and I doubt I can go to school while working; even one class is going to be really hard. But if I take time off my job, then I have no income. I can survive easily for 6 months on my savings, but that's only without the added cost of school. And since I'm making 6 figures, I am not eligible for any financial aid, and won't be eligible until I have a tax return that's not 6 figures (a year without my current job). I'm basically going to be paying for this all out of pocket.

The college I'm going to is a CUNY college, so I can't really go any cheaper.

I'm also ineligible for all but the smallest loans. The reason I didn't finish college in the first place was my parents wouldn't cosign, so I couldn't get loans, and when I stopped going to school I was unemployed for 3 years, which screwed my credit. I've spent the last 8 years digging myself out of that financial hole, but my credit is still shit. I applied for loans and was only able to get federal loans ($2400/year total--less than the cost of one semester taking two classes).

In short, it's going to be really hard to go to school while I'm working, and it's going to be really hard (probably impossible) to pay for school while I'm not working.

I feel like I'm basically screwed here. I'm thinking of just trying to take one class per semester, but I just can't see myself working that much on school AND work for the 5ish years it will take to finish my degree that way.

To be honest, I'm a smart guy and I've talked to a lot of smart people and I'm not sure there's actually a solution here. I might be just trapped where I am for the rest of my life, but it's pretty hard to accept that.",finance,1470589284

I'm a new resident here in the US living in the city of Chicago working at home as an independent contractor since the 7th of July. My income varies but I estimate to earn $21000/year ($13.5/hr, I work my own hours).  However for 2016 I'll make only ~$9400 total. I have zero debt and I basically have no expenses since I live in my father's apartment. Also he pays my expenses, bills, etc. for now, until I'm more economically stable. My father also has residency but he lives outside the US.

What I know: Not much, really. I read some of the info here in the sub and from external sources. I understand I have to use form 1099, that I have to pay around February(?), that I have to file as single w/ no dependents, my deductibles are ~$6500 and I have to pay a flat state tax of 3.75% and a federal tax.

Questions:

* First and foremost, do I have to pay taxes at all for this year? If so, how much? 

* Do I calculate my taxes based on $21000 or $9400?

* Is Form 1099 the only one I have to file?

* Let's say, as an example, that I do have to pay taxes, and I put aside $500 each month. Do I just leave it in my checking account doing nothing? Or is there a more productive use for this money that won't compromise my ability to pay my taxes when I have to?

* Again, let's say I do have to pay taxes, what can I take advantage of to reduce my taxes given my situation (working at home/self-employed,  etc.)?

* Also, not related to taxes but I have no health insurance or any of that non-sense, should I get one?

* What other things do I have to know? What can I take advantage of? Remember, I'm a new resident here in the US (2 months) and I have no idea about anything! :D

I currently have a part time job and I have a student checking account with TDBank. But I I have a few complications with it. When I set it up, it was with my mother who made me believe I had to sign up with her because a bank account requires two people (I believed her but have found out that was bullshit). The problem is she keeps taking money out of my account without telling me and hopes I don't notice. Whenever I confront her about it, she just gets defensive and says she'll pay me back (which she doesn't). I'm looking to get a new account In a new bank without telling her to avoid further conflict. I guess I'm looking for a good beginners bank. One that has a lot of branches, has good student checking/savings (that can work with my gap year), good interest rate, and would in general would be a good bank to grow with. Any suggestions?
Thank you so much.

investing,An idea about jobless claims trends and an upcoming recession,"After getting slightly saved from my gold bagholding during last week's jobless claims report I decided to look into the history of these reports. The website I used to look at the data chart is this: http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/jobless-claims Looking at the chart I decided to figure out the trends, the mean values, the average length between spikes, the causes of the spikes, etc. What I found is that the average time period between spikes in these claims is ~8 years. Also they clearly happen due to an economic crisis here in the US or in the rest of the world. Looking at the max chart of the data the 1971 spike was due to the 1970's energy crisis, the one in the mid 1970's was due to the secondary banking crisis in the UK (this links to what is happening in UK right now btw), the early 1980's spike was due to the early 80's recession, early 90's due to the recession then, same with the dot com bubble and the most recent financial crisis of 2007-2008. From this it is clear that we are clearly due for a recession and a spike in these claims. The average being 8 years we are at this point. Also looking at the variance averages in these numbers it is seen that the low average is around 250,000 and the average high is around 430,000. Ever since 2008 which topped at around 650,000 these claims have been on a steady decrease. At one point they reached the 250,000 level but are now starting to rise again. Personally I feel that the main companies are trying to say this isn't a big deal to help their investments, but in reality I feel it is the start of something big. With the European economy sitting on a time bomb, China weakening, and the US in a deadlock between saving consumers or banks with the rates, to me the economy is on the tip of a huge recession. This week's jobless claims report will show low to mid 270k. The news will say that it isn't a big deal until it reaches 300k, but slowly those numbers will continue to rise. 280k by September is nearly guaranteed and there is nothing the US can do to change this. I know you are going to tell me that I am crazy and I know that the news and fed will continue to hide this issue with random fluff, but trust me a recession is imminent in the near future. If not this coming year, in the next 3 is guaranteed. To sum it up a clear trend is showing that a downtrend in the performance of the economy is historically bound to happen, and current events provide obvious evidence to back this claim up. I highly recommend establishing a position in gold while it is this cheap, or you can establish long term puts on spy that terminate in a year or two. Lmk what you all think.",finance,1470599936

However, when I look at the interest rate environment and stock market bubble, I suspect that as soon as rates start to rise, the value of all of the above will tank.

3) Federal Students Loans: ~$40,000, but I qualify for IBR and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (I pay a small payment now, and the balance gets forgiven after 10 years)

I make enough money that I can pay extra on the principle each and every month. I also have a few thousand in the back and $1500 in investments. Each month my extra income, after bills and such, gets put into my regular savings account.

personalfinance,Debt Repayment Plan Review?,"Hello,

I've been following this sub for awhile and would love some feedback on my debt repayment plan.  I just accepted a new job that pays $15k more than my last job and I'd like to allot the income increase to paying off my current debt. Here's a breakdown of what I owe

**The Debt**

*$1,500 credit card (19% APR).  Currently paying $200/month.
*$8,000 tax bill (IC didn't make estimated tax payments because I needed all my savings for covering moving/unemployment (July-Nov 2015) costs.  Had I made the estimated payments, I would have run out of money prior to Nov. 2015).   Currently paying $300/month.
*$130k student loans. ($20k undergrad + $110k law school) All federal, with interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 7%.  Currently on IBR and paying $200/month.  

**What I have in the bank**
Current savings: $1,312
Current checking: $1,600

**The Plan**

I don't know the new job's payment schedule but once I can be sure that any break in between paychecks won't leave me unable to pay the rest of my bills, I'll pay off the credit card in full.  

After the credit card is paid, I'll snowball the credit card payments (currently paying $200/month) with the tax payment for a total of $500/month. 

I have chosen a snowball/avalanche combo method for the student loans and am currently applying any extra payments (not much right now) to a smaller loan (2k) with a higher interest rate.  Once the tax bill is paid off, I'll obviously start putting that money towards the student loan repayment.  I'm keeping in mind that my payments on IBR will increase with the salary increase, but I'm not quite sure what that looks like.  

One other thing to note: My fiance is currently a medical resident.  He plans on fellowship, so he won't be making an attending salary for another 4-5 years or so.  Once he is earning an attending salary, the goal is to put my entire salary towards the remaining student loan balance while he covers the rest of the living expenses.  He is fortunate enough to have zero student debt, so this should be a manageable plan for us in the future.  We live in a high COLA (MA) now, so this plan isn't feasible on his resident salary.  

**Where I need help**

So, I'm looking for feedback on the following: 

My debt repayment plan in general.  Am I missing something ? Is there a better way to do this?  I am aware that this sub almost always recommends the avalanche method to avoid paying more in interest, but I feel the little bit of extra I'm paying isn't going to do anything on my largest loan and that getting rid of the smaller loans via snowball will help a little more.  Perhaps this is purely psychological, but I feel pretty comfortable with this part of the plan.  I welcome all feedback though. 

(2) Emergency fund:  When do I start rebuilding and how much?  I know the sidebar recommends 3-6 months, but with such high debt, does 6 months make sense?  The linked article in the wiki recommends 1 month for those that have debt.  I'm looking for a few more opinions.  

(3) Retirement Savings:  I'm 29 years old and only have what I've been contributing since Nov. 2015.  I'm not positive my new job has 401k matching (they do have 401k), but how much should I be contributing given the large amount of debt I have?  

(4) Where to apply the salary increase?  All towards the tax bill?  Split between student loans/emergency fund?  

I appreciate any and all feedback this sub wants to offer!  Thanks so much!",finance,1470611511

I am trying to decide if this is the time to buy, or if I should be waiting? The LA housing market is up ~7-10% over the last 12 months. I think everyone expects more modest growth over the next 12 months, more like ~4%. So is LA in a bubble that is going to pop, or are things just going to level off here for awhile?

We expect the fed to raise interests rates a little over the next year. But is it going to raise enough to warrant getting a mortgage before things tighten up? Or is the increased interest rate going to out price enough new buyers that demand will subdue and housing prices will fall?

While I'm not asking anyone to predict the future, I am looking for recommendations for trustworthy analysis that isn't biased. Thoughts? Thanks!

I live in a very low cost of living city and currently make about $25,000/year. My monthly bills are about $500. I have $28,000 in debt from my undergrad degree and the tuition for the new program will be $48,000 for two years, excluding housing and living expenses. The program is well-regarded, and it looks like entry salaries after graduation are about $80,000 (though in city's with higher cost of living) but overall, it seems like it would be a good investment for the future and could be paid off in a reasonable amount of time, I'm guessing around 10 years. 


I will need to finance this without the help from my parents, and I believe that the maximum federal loans for graduate school fall just under how much the yearly tuition costs. (I could be misunderstanding what I've read on this part.) I read that receiving a private loan for a higher amount might be a better option. 


I made some poor choices with credit cards when I was 18-20 which has left me with a very low credit score of 600. I think I will need to significantly raise my score if I plan to ask for a loan for such a large amount to attend. Luckily though I was very reckless, my actual debt from this is quite low since I wasn't in a position to receive large lines of credit at that age. 


From what I can see on Credit Karma: I currently have one credit card that is about a year old with a very low credit limit. It's at about 60% utilization. There are 2 accounts in collection, one for $600 and one for $550. I've never had a late payment for my current student loans or credit card and payment history is at 100%. 



I'm wondering, do you have advice to raise my credit score in order to secure a large loan for grad school?

Some form of 'helicopter money' could help in theory, by monetizing deficits or cancelling debts held by central banks. However, concerns about the unexpected consequences this could have on the public broader confidence into the system — and, thus, the effectiveness in practice of such radical policies — have kept even Japan's more adventurous policy makers away from it.

I've just been able to bump up my TSP contribution to the point that I'm now maxing it out annually. I have $30k in TSP (40/60 split between C and S funds), $15k in a savings acct with USAA earning basically zero interest, and about $2k in a checking acct to pay monthly bills. On top of my TSP contribution I'm putting about $1k a month into that savings acct.

My only debt is federal student loans and I'm using IBR for 10 years until I get public service forgiveness. I own my car outright and it's in good condition. I expect to have it for several more years at a minimum.

My question is: What should I be doing with that money I'm currently just piling into my savings account?

personalfinance,"Work is undervaluing me, and I need help with contract negotiations!","Throw away just incase. I'll give you a little bit of background information about myself. I am a 20 year old part-time college student. I've been working for the same company since I was 13 years old, starting out as an referee/umpire, and working my way up throughout the company. I was actually one of the first employees, and haven't left since. Our pay scale then was a little different than most. Let's say you reffed a game with another person, you'd make $15/hr. If you worked a game by yourself, you made $30/hr.

Eventually, when I turned 17, they went to a set hourly rate, depending on how long you've been working for the company. They gave me $17.50/hr, which, at my age, was awesome. I'd be getting more hours with this, but not as much as I was hoping. During the seasons, it would be only 8 hours a week, and over the summer, I would get thrown hours here and there, doing little misc. jobs. Also, I'd work summer camps and those would be 20 hour weeks. Over the summer, I'd probably add up to 100 hours tops.

Now, at 20 years old, I currently make $20/hr, which is insane. I get paid $20/hr for everything, including reffing, summer camps, and now, marketing events. Some days I'll end up going to a Chickfila and setting up a booth and gathering emails for the company to send out via blast emails.

Things were going great until a few weeks ago, when they were going to talk to me about a contract. Since I'm only taking 6 hours of class during the week, they wanted to give me 40 hours a week. Sounds great, right? Well, I'd keep my $20/hr, but I'd only make that for 8 hours a week, on saturdays, for my reffing job. Then, the company decides they want to make me the leader of marketing. This is where things got fishy. They wanted to pay me $15/hr for the remaining 32 hours of the rest of the week for marketing only.

I'm kind of at a loss. $15/hr is what I was making 7 years ago when I was 13. Sure, it's more hours, but it's also more work and less money per hour. I can negotiate with them, but I'm not trying to leave what I've help build up.",finance,1470676083

personalfinance,To Buy or not to Buy: FTB Buying a Townhouse as an Investment / Residence - Advice Needed (UK/IRL),"I'm looking for a bit of advice regarding a potential property ‘investment’. It is a 2-bed townhouse in a city-centre location (non-US, but I’ve given figures in US$ at very close approximations using current Exchange rates. Important fact is the figures and ratios rather than the currency though). I have outlined simplified figures below for major income/expenditure on the property. I am curious to get others opinions on real-estate, as I am personally not convinced of the long term returns. However, this is probably more of a property to satisfy family needs rather than pure investment. At the same time, I’d like to figure out how much potential income/capital growth I am forgoing by making such a move (i.e. buying instead of renting indefinitely). 
I’ve currently got family and friends on both sides of the fence on this one. Personally, I have my own opinion and have done some long-term calculations which always brings me to the same conclusion. Therefore, this post is more to get an independent assessment from knowledgeable folk such as yourselves :). 

**Background Information** 

* Type: 2-bed townhouse 
* Current Cost: $195,000
* Deposit Required (10%): $19,500
* Stamp Duty: $1,950
* Legal Fees: $2,000
* Annual Management Fees: $1,000
* Rental Income Potential: $12,000 ($1,000 pm) – assuming residential occupiers only

Assuming a 90% LTV mortgage of ~$175,000, my annual repayments are $8,700 ($725 pm). 

So, monthly cost breakdown:

* Mortgage: ($725)
* Management Fees: ($74)
* Property Tax: ($30)
* Insurance: ($30)
* Repairs and Maintenance: ($37)
** TOTAL EXPENDITURE: ~$882 **

**Monthly income (assuming no vacancy / tax): $1,000**

* Assuming 10% Vacancy: $900
* Assuming 40% Tax (Less allowable expenditure of monthly expenses + 0.75*Mortgage Interest): (Less $176p/m tax): $724
* Cash Flow (with Tax and Vacancy): ($158 p/m)

*NOTE: I have also not included for initial legal fees and refurbishment above, which will amount to approximately $10,000 in Year 1. I am also not allowing for the potential office revenue as this is not guaranteed, and would require some material alterations to the property in the first instance.*

**Remarks**
So this may seem like a cut and dry ‘bad investment’. However, I guess I am trying to see if there is any case where it may be justifiable given a number of pro/con factors:

**Pros:**

* The property is in a prime city centre location, and has the potential for office rental on the ground floor subject to conversion. Therefore, my rental yield estimates may be on the low side in this scenario;
* Family situation means we are currently seeking a property like this in city centre for relocation, and this is one of very few suitable properties to come on the market in the last few years (very limited supply in location at present due to recent economic downturn and lack of construction). This is probably the biggest decision factor for me – the purchase would provide a place for my mum to live as she can no longer live in her current home. Moving isn’t urgent, but it seems property prices are only going one direction and we are ultimately getting priced out of the market (I know how much that sounds like bubble-talk, but it’s just a reality at present);
* There are a number of attractive incentives for first-time buyers including interest relief on mortgage payments, renovation incentive schemes etc., but I have factored these in for the most part in the above simplified figures.* 
* While I don't live in the area right now, I have family that would use the place in my absence and would pay rent. I would also happily live in the place myself, and have a high possibility of returning to workplace nearby in a few years;
* Rents are rising quickly in the area and it's difficult to secure any long term accommodation;
* Few attractive safe investments at present – I have about 50% of my savings invested in the stock market (Mostly index funds and ~10% Bonds). The other 50% would essentially be either going into paying down the deposit on this property, or I will be seeking a suitable long-term alternative, probably in line with above distribution – however, I don’t feel confident putting a large amount in stocks/bonds at present due to market uncertainty/volatility. 
* Dubious pro is that market direction indicates continued property price rises ~5-6% over the next few years due to a combination of the lack of existing supply, increasing demand, low interest rates and government incentives {Obviously not guaranteed, and this I think is a huge gamble, which is why I’ve listed as a dubious pro]

**Cons**

* Personally I feel the local property market has been artificially inflated for the last few years due to a combination of a number of things including: (1) government incentives and capital gains allowances for investors, (2) lack of new supply due to complete collapse of construction industry, (3) cash buyers and overseas investors dominating the market, (4) lack of repossessions of homes in mortgage arrears; Since the property crash here, prices have risen ~40% and seem to be increasing at an unsustainable rate [~15% 2014, 20% in 2015 and 8% YTD 2016]
* I am a young professional (28 years old), and am currently not based in the country and feel that this may begin to limit my options by physically tying me to a significant fixed asset / liability;
* Interest rates (at 3.5%) are at an all-time low, and will likely rise in the coming years, thus increasing mortgage repayments and sending the property into deeper negative yield;
* Biggest con is that I feel this is ultimately a poor investment which will cost me time and money in the long-term with zero to negative yield long term (even allowing for capital appreciation);.

So reddit, what advice can you give a first-time buyer in this situation. Is it reasonable to forego common sense valuation metrics in a family situation, where rising property prices seem to dictate a need for more immediate action. If so, to what extent (if at all) am I potentially harming my own long-term nestegg. Am I missing anything above?

I'm pretty confused right now. All indicators tell me this would be a bad investment, even if I factor in that I may ultimately live in the area in the future. On the flip-side I feel bad that this may be a lost opportunity to secure something suitable for a close family member, particularly if it is ultimately a win-win for both of us in a continued rising-prices low-interest scenario.

I really appreciate anyone who has taken time to read the above, and look forward to hearing your opinions. 

**TL/DR: 28yo First-time buyer living abroad looking to buy as investment and principal residence / temporary accommodation for family member, but concerned about implications for long-term financial future. Do I go with the market consensus of continued rising prices and low interest rates and buy now while property is hot, or hold firm and wait for potential future opportunities.**",finance,1470678247

personalfinance,A collection of little lessons about finance I learned the hard way during my first few years of adulthood.,"My girlfriend and I joke about these lessons all the time, and I realized that someone else might ~~get a kick out of laughing at my mistakes~~ want to avoid learning these lessons themselves, so I decided to write some of them down. Feel free to add your own!

**1. The Windex lesson.**

This one was all on my girlfriend. First day in her new apartment, we went shopping. She bought literally everything store-brand, the absolute cheapest she could find. Most of it worked...okay, until we got to the ""Glass Cleaner.""

It was the worst. It streaked, didn't clean a damn thing, and we ended up going back to the store to buy the real thing. 

**Lesson:** Sometimes, it costs *more* to buy the cheap things, because you either have to use more of it, or you need to go back and buy better versions.

**2. The ""Organic"" lesson.**

This one was mine, unfortunately. You know those awesome giant bag cereals that are all off-brand and delicious? I had eaten those all my life, and decided: ""Hey, the super fancy organic cereal must taste amazing! It costs like twice as much!""

It was awful. It tasted bad. It smelled bad. It didn't soak up the milk, so it was like eating rocks. After the first half-bowl, that box sat in my pantry for about 6 months before I finally admitted my mistake and threw it out. The worst part? When I actually compared the nutrition facts, it wasn't even much better for you than my cheapo Fruity Dino-Bites. 

**Lesson:** A high price tag doesn't necessarily mean it's better.

**3. The ""Convenience"" lesson.**

Also me. Dammit. This one is me forgetting to properly plan for our vacation. We went to Hawaii. I didn't pack sunblock.

Sunblock at our local Wal-Mart? Like $3. Sunblock anywhere within a 20 mile radius of our hotel? $17. 

**Lesson:** be prepared. It costs way more to buy things you need where you need them, because, chances are, demand is super high there.

**4. The ""Travel Site"" lesson**

...Also me. A theme is starting to develop. No one mention this to my girlfriend. This one was also from our vacation. I booked on one of those travel websites that gets you awesome deals on hotels. We booked this awesome undersea tour for about $80 a person. When we got there, we saw the pricing sign. It was $69 a person. That rate was also available on *their* website.

It was still an awesome activity, but I could have saved $22 just by paying for that separately. 

**Lesson:** Do your damn research. Don't immediately buy something just because you think it's neat. 

**5. The ""Landlord"" lesson**

This one was my girlfriend's fuck-up! Ha! Our landlord has you pay with checks or money orders. Well, she didn't have a checkbook, so she would go and paid $3 for a money order from the local convenience store. She threw away the bottom copy, because she'd never had any trouble paying her rent before. She always just wrote her name on the envelope, and the landlord knew where it went. 

Well, the landlord threw the envelope away without looking at it this time. She got a notice of non-payment on her door the next day, and we had zero evidence that she'd actually paid. Turns out, a bunch of people use that same place for money orders, and a few of them also hadn't paid. Her saving grace was the fact no one else came to claim the unlabeled money order. 

**Lesson:** Keep your pertinent documents regarding any major transaction, or even minor transactions. Your landlord has no duty to keep your records for you, and other people make mistakes sometimes. Also, make your signature recognizable. A squiggly line does not a signature make.

**6. The ""Terrible Car"" lesson.**

This one is my fuckup. I decided that I would empty my savings, including my e-fund, to pay for my last semester of community college, because fuck student loans, amirite?

Then my car broke down. The timing belt snapped and bent every valve stem when it did. Total cost was $1600 to fix it. I had no way to pay, and I was looking at using my credit card to pay for it. That's a 22% interest rate. Basically, instead of taking a ~4% loan, I left myself with no way to pay in an emergency and was almost forced to take out a 22% ""loan"" so that I'd have something to drive. My grandfather stepped in and saved me with a 0% loan, but that could have been really, really bad.

**Lesson:** This sub harps on an emergency fund for a very, very good reason. You have no idea what will happen to you next month, tomorrow, or even in the next 6 hours. Not everyone has an awesome grandpa to step in and save them from drowning financially. 


A lot of these, in retrospect, seem like common sense. When I was 20, just starting out into the world on my own, though... not so much. No one had bothered to teach me, and honestly, I thought I was way better prepared than I was, so I never sought out help. I'm 26 now and in a decent financial position, with an excellent credit score and a good job, but some of these fuck-ups could have done a lot of damage. 

Hopefully this does more than give a lot of the /r/personalfinance old-timers ammunition to make fun of me.

personalfinance,saving for a house with secret CC debt,"My SO and I have been together for about 8 years and we've lived together for about 6, however we have always kept money separate (for some context - I am 28 years old and my SO is 32). We each pay our portion of the bills each month and the rest is left to spend however we want. This has created a problem for me, since I have little self control. I've managed to rack up about 12k in credit card debt (2 cards - one at 4k with 23% APR and one at 8k with 16% APR). Right now I make about 45k/year in a major city with a 700 FICO credit score. I also have no student loans or any car payments - these credit cards are my only debt.

I have greatly reduced my shopping habits lately, but I am worried that It's too little, too late.

In 2005 I foolishly and on impulse went back to school after a divorce (I needed an outlet for energy and this presented itself to me quickly). The school loan was for $45,000 originally. After school (a trade school in San Francisco) work was scarce and then when I got a job it was not enough pay rent, bills and loans back. 
After some unemployment, some drug issues, homelessness, jail and rehab I got back on my feet and in 2010 I was able to get cleaned up and back on track. Honestly the last thing on my mind unfortunately was cleaning up my past. I got a job managing a store in 2011 and then doing some freelance work from 2013-2015. In 2015 I landed a great job that pays very well and provides benefits/options etc. I started tackling my past debt in June 2015 and finally took a look and called my school loan debt collectors. Needless to say 10 years of ignoring them was a mistake and one I will pay for it seems for the rest of my life.

Below is the amount I owe on the private loan. This one wants a minimum of $2300 a month. I can’t afford that so I’m giving them $250 a month knowing it’s not making a dent. Interest is .001%

All of it seems very criminal but whatever that’s not the issue or maybe it is.
I’ve been paying what I can on them just to keep them from going delinquent again.

I’ve moved in with my girlfriend and her two kids. We’re ok as far as rent and food goes. But there is no savings to be had at the moment.

I have a solid GPA at 3.5 and a job lined up making around $70k with a $5k signing bonus, a solid start. 

But, I financed my entire college with debt, my parents didn't believe in saving (my parents both have decent pension income once they retire, so they will be ok (hopefully)). This debt is roughly $105k with an interest rate of % 3.7 APR.

personalfinance,"My student loan amount and interest rate are both low, but so is my income. Which is better: saving what I can, or eliminating the debt?","My only debt is a $25,000 federal student loan with a 3.5% interest rate. I've been on the income based repayment plan and due to unemployment, have not yet had to make any payments. This year, however, I got a job making $40K a year gross income. I live at home and intend to have at least $10K in savings (I am already halfway there) before I find a place of my own to rent. I am not required to make any payments toward my student loans until I file my 2016 taxes next year.

Around here, rent will be around $1000/month, utilities included. According to the federal repayment calculator, and based on my current income, my student load payments would be around $200 monthly for the next 12 or 13 years. My total monthly expenses (rent, student loan payment, food, phone, gas, gym, and entertainment) would be about $1700, and my total net income is $2200 monthly. I hope to be able to put at least $4000 into savings yearly (six percent of my income already goes into my 401K and was not included in my previously mentioned net income.)

My question is, considering the amount I can save each year is so low, would it be better to pay the minimum amount towards my student loans each month until it's paid off in a decade, or should I keep my emergency fund stable and throw everything I can spare toward paying off the debt? I'd like to be a homeowner in my forties, but it's not a necessity, as I don't intend to start a family.

So begins the story... I quit my job in April. I was a restaurant manager making $10/hr. I was flip/flopping medications with my psychiatrist, so I was in a constant state of stress. Different antipsychotic medications were rattling my brain and I was going night after night with little to no sleep. My supervisor knew of my disorder, yet seemed to not care when I had issues that interfered with my work. Long story short, she pushed my last button, and I walked out. Bad. Mistake.

Since I had no money, I applied for a credit card to help me through until I could find another job. I thought finding another job would be easy, because I've never had trouble getting hired. I'm a great worker, and generally a really great person to be around. To my surprise, I applied everywhere in my city and no place would hire me. As the trial medications kept pouring in, my condition was worsening. I ended up attempting suicide in the beginning of June. Luckily, I survived, and even more luckily the hospital actually put me on a decent medication that has been working well for me ever since. Which brings me to the point where I tell you guys relevant background info on myself:

Currently seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist regularly, and both have suggested I don't go back to work until further notice. With that in mind and my savings account draining quickly, I finally applied for disability... today. I wish I would have done it sooner, because I am absolutely f***ed financially, and I don't even know if they'll accept my case (because BPII is ""nbd,"" right?). 

After filling out the disability application, I decided to go ahead and submit an IDR to the company I borrowed my student loans from. Which brought me to finally choke up the courage to do what I (so stupidly) avoided doing for the past couple of months: see how much debt I'm actually in.

My current bank account balance (all I have left of my savings) is just under $100. Heh. My total debt (student loans + credit cards) is $13,258.07.

So, I guess I don't really know what advice I'm looking for. I've done what I can, and what I could have done in the past is irrelevant now, so I'm really just not sure where to go from here.

Any help would be appreciated... Thanks an absolute ton!!!",finance,1470694096
personalfinance,Auto Loan Questions,"I have a 2003 Toyota Matrix which I still owe $4,331 on. I got it in August of last year and since then I have had to put $2,300 worth of work into it.

gaming,Why does almost every modern game try to have RPG elements in them?,"Almost ALL modern video games try to include the following in their games...

- Equipment that you can give your character, like different swords, guns, shields, armor, etc.
- Stats that you can try to increase to make your character stronger
- GIGANTIC hub worlds and towns and cities with like hundreds of NPCs to talk to and complete side missions
- Side missions that quantify possibly in the hundreds
- Gigantic open worlds that are filled to the brim with practically nothing
- Currency in the game in which you can buy equipment and other items
- Characters that you talk to as you simply WALK in the game
- Enormous fleshed-out story with long cutscenes and mythology
- etc.

I mean, SERIOUSLY. HOW many games do we need that have RPG elements in them? Sure, we had games that were simplistic back then because of technical limitations, but that doesn't necessarily mean that games should be stuffed to the max with things that are seen in RPG games.

There's a lot of stuff that you can cut out of a lot of games, and the game will probably be a lot more fun. A great example would be Sonic Unleashed. The game works fine as just stages, but it's NOT just stages. There's items to collect in the stages, side missions to play, a currency to buy stuff, NPCs to talk to, stats to upgrade... it's a great Sonic game turned into an RPG. Cut out the majority of that stuff, and the game works fine on its own. In fact, I would've preferred it that way.

Come to think of it, games aren't necessarily in stages anymore. You know how older games, you go from one stage to the next? Now the majority of games have it all interconnected into what visually comes off as one gigantic stage.

Anyways, the point is, do you feel that all of this extra RPG-style content pads out game development to the max and just makes games way more complicated than it should be? (Skyrim, for example).

EDIT : Another RPG element that almost all modern games are doing... multiple characters to choose from. It's fine in Super Mario Bros. 2 and Sonic 3 and Knuckles, but it sucks in almost every other game because of how little difference the characters usually make.",technology,1470706981
personalfinance,Invest in stocks and bonds or save for real estate?,"My girlfriend (likely fiance) and I are in what I think is a fairly solid financial situation. To give a breakdown, we are both 26, have emergency funds with that cover six months' worth of expenses, and participate in our employers' 401k-matching program, each contributing the maximum amount they will match. Beyond that, however, we really have no investments.

We've often talked about buying a multi-family property as our first ""home,"" living in it for a couple of years, and then moving elsewhere and holding onto that property for the rental income.

personalfinance,Refinancing to cash out?,"We bought our house about 5 years ago with an FHA loan in an up and coming neighborhood for $228k.  We now owe $203k on our mortgage, but house prices have increased tremendously around us. Smaller houses in worse shape than ours have been going for $350k. 

Sounds great! But, we are paying $200 per month in PMI, which sucks. We also have about $25k in credit card debts. Together, we make about $95k per year, but with two kids in need of daycare and the debts, we are struggling to keep our heads above water.  Kids are expensive. 

We've been looking into refinancing in order to get rid of the PMI, but does it make sense to take some cash out as well to pay off the credit cards?  We hate to lose out on some of the equity in the house, but paying off the credit cards without an influx of cash will take forever. We are hoping to break the cycle of not having an emergency fund because of the credit cards and having emergencies go on the credit cards because we have no emergency fund. 

We are able to get a better interest rate (3.625% from 3.75%) on a refinance. Obviously there are closing costs. But in the end, our total loan will be a little more than we started with, except now the credit cards will be paid off, and we will have a starter emergency fund.  We would only have student loans and the mortgage remaining in terms of debt. 

It seems like a no brainer to us, but we are hesitant to reduce the equity in our house.  Is there something else we are missing?  We don't see the house prices going down below what we originally paid for the house.

personalfinance,Converting annual interest rate to monthly. Are we all getting bilked?,"Back when I studied economics in school, I was taught that given an annual interest rate, to calculate the monthly (or quarterly, or whatever) rate, we would find the number that, when compounded over 12 periods (or 4 for quarterly), would give the annual interest rate. 

As an example, if my interest rate is 4%, this translates to roughly 0.327% monthly. We check this by seeing that (1.00327)^12 is 1.04

What you should *not* do is divide 4% by 12, which gives 0.333%. If you are compounded monthly, then 0.333% will give you 4.07% annually.

The formula is [here](http://www.experiglot.com/2006/06/07/how-to-convert-from-an-annual-rate-to-an-effective-periodic-rate-javascript-calculator/). You can find it on many sites.

So I sat down and calculated my payment schedule on my own mortgage: How much was interest, how much towards the principal, etc. Curiously enough, I found out I was paying it off almost 7 months early. I must have made a mistake.

So I went to an online calculator, and got the payment schedule. Then I looked at my mortgage statements. The two matched. Neither matched my calculation.

On a whim, I recalculated by assuming the monthly rate is simply 1/12 of the annual rate. My numbers suddenly matched.

If this is how all banks calculate the payment schedule, we are all overpaying. Our annual rate is *not* what they are quoting. In my case, I'm paying close to 0.1% more than the rate I should be paying. Over the life of the loan, this will cost me over $6000 extra.

That venture stopped making money late last year, but I based the loans on salary income I receive from another source, so I've been able to keep my head above water. Now the large monthly payments @ almost 30% APR are putting a strain on my finances and I want to refinance them. I still owe +/- 35k.

We've paid down the loans significantly and are actually paying more in principal than interest on the larger one now.

I'm trying to apply for a personal loan which would cut this interest rate in half and save me about 50% on my monthly payments. I keep getting automatic declinations that don't seem to consider that this is a debt consolidation loan, always saying that my ratio of debts to income is too high for a new 40K loan (as well as listing every other thing that they don't like about my credit report, like number of inquiries).

You'd think my demonstrated history of paying not only on time, but lowering principal well ahead of schedule, for the last 18-24 months would be sufficient to illustrate that I can pay the debts, and that it'll be even easier to pay the debts if they make the payment amount decrease by hundreds of dollars.

Does anyone have tips on institutions that will approach this somewhat rationally? I know people often recommend Prosper or LendingClub but they won't work in this case (for obvious reasons). I've tried a local credit union (who said they don't give personal loans to anyone with a score below 750), SoFi, Avant, LightStream, and Wells Fargo (my bank) so far. I don't need a credit counseling or debt consolidation service, I just need to refinance these high interest loans and turn them into reasonable-interest loans.

personalfinance,[Debt] Is rage paying off my student loans a good financial decision? Have I missed anything?,"Every experience I have with Navient (nee Sallie Mae) is rage inducing. Now I'm trying to decide if paying off my student loans super fast makes good financial success.

To the best I can figure, here are the numbers that matter in this conversation:

* I currently owe $15,805 on my student loans at 4.25% (subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans from undergrad from the late 90's, consolidated to a fixed rate). I pay $300 a month for an estimated pay off of July 2021. This is above the minimum, and I have been paying above since I finished my PhD (no additional debt) Aug 2013.   
* My husband and I also have a little over $10,000 in savings for an eventual house. The account earns 0.75% interest and we've been putting $1000 aside each month.
* Last year, if I've done my math right, on the roughly $800 we paid in interest for my student loans, we paid $120 less on our joint federal taxes.
* We will not be having kids and both of us are definitely done with school.
* Our house savings account is separate from our emergency savings (and other targeted savings for things like pet expenses, travel, and paying for insurance in lump sums rather than monthly). I use YNAB to budget every dollar and we live well within our means.

Here's my question: does it make sense to wipe out the house savings, put $1300 towards my student loans for 3 months, pay the remaining roughly $700, and just be done with them by Jan 2017? I could probably even eek it out by Dec by shifting more of our budget around.

That would leave us paying off my husband's car ($15k left, 0.9%) and his student loans (no idea, but likelihood of [forgiveness](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service). My car is 15 years old and we're hoping it will last until his car is paid off in 2019. I too work for a public university, and have looked into loan forgiveness, but I'm not 100% convinced I'll always work for a qualifying employer and don't want to rely on thinking I might eventually qualify for forgiveness. 

If my spreadsheets are correct, I'll pay about $1625 less in interest to Navient. And if nothing changes in our salaries, we'd end up with maybe $1300 less saved for the house over the same time period.

My job is very stable, and my husband's is for at least another year. End of 2017 is maybe the earliest we *might* start looking to buy a house, but 2018 is much more likely. A lot will hopefully change before then, including my husband getting a faculty job (he's currently a post doc and all signs point to him being on the right track to land a faculty job). Which also means we have no idea where in the country we'll really be at that time. And as always, who knows what will actually change between now and then.

Am I thinking about this right to just wipe this debt out? I don't see keeping it and any related tax benefits to really be worth it. But I want to make sure I'm not missing something I haven't thought of.

EDIT: I also want to add, my husband and I have already talked this over. He says go for it. I tend to be the more conservative for risks and is why I'm trying to double check that I haven't missed anything we might not have thought about on our own.",finance,1470757297

2. Although graduated and extended graduated plans seem to be a good option to stay in the safe zone since we can change the plan whenever we want depending on the financial situation.

investing,Lets talk single family homes.,"The median US income has barely moved from 28,561 in 2000 to 30,376 (a 6% increase).

Over the same period, median home price in the US has increased from 166k to 303k (an 83% increase).

Interest rates are at an all time low, causing real estate to be cheap on a monthly level.  In 2000 the 30 year fixed rate was some 8.5%.  Now it's some 3.5%.

On a monthly level, that 166k house costs ~$1,276 in 2000 and the 303k house costs ~$1,361 today (a 6.5% increase, which matches wages nicely).

Of course, all those 166k homes have long since been refinanced at 3.5% to the tune of ~745/mo (or they are paid off entirely).  In this environment, the boomers are holding onto their starter properties which are generating cash flow positive rental income.

I've heard that the property areas that are doing well (Denver, Dallas) are primarily driven by supply shortages.  Houses are on the market for less than a day and are being sold above list price.  These areas are growing for sure, but the primary complaint is limited supply.  Why is the supply so limited?  One hypothesis of mine is the prevalence of rental properties.

I've heard more and more commercials on the radio from rental management companies to ""rent your home, don't sell"".  So is there a rental herd mentality out there?

If interest rates rise, will property values drop proportionally?  When boomers start selling their rental properties int he next few years, will there be an oversupply?",finance,1470761218
personalfinance,Should I invest my savings?,"I'm going into my senior year of college. I have had two good summer internships and by the end of my current one I will have $25k in savings.

My dad has informed me that I will owe the bank about $20k in loans once I graduate (I am not sure what the interest rates are but he said some have higher interest rates and are already accruing interest even though I haven't graduated).

personalfinance,Sell house and invest profit or rent.,"I'm 31 and single. I bought my first home in 2011 for $165,000 when the prices were at rock bottom. I refinanced 2 years later to a 15 year loan at 2.65%. My mortgage is $998 including insurance and taxes. I owe $102,000 right now. I'm renting my basement for $1050 per month, and a room upstairs for $475 for a total of $1525 which includes utils, internet and tv. So I would say real profit is probably around $1200. Also I put $50k into remodeling and such so far.

On top of the money I owe on the house I have debts that add up to around $70,000 with the highest interest rate being 3% on a 3 year remodel loan that was $10k. 

I was approached recently by someone that really wants the house because his dad built it. My question is this, from a financial point of view if I can sell the house for 300k-325k now, pay off all my debts, then invest $50k-100k in stocks/mutual funds/whatever else, and rent a room in a friends house for a max of $400 a month until I get married or something else changes, would it be wise to do so, or should I keep it like it is, and take advantage of the rent to get more equity in the house? Having a motivated buyer is a big push because I don't think I could get as much later for the house, so the equity might be a wash.

To throw in another factor, I don't make much money right now because I left my job 6 months ago to start a software company. We have a client now, and it looks like we will be doing relatively well in around a year. By well I mean I could actually be pulling in a minimal salary from it. So right now, everything I make goes toward just living. Selling the house would guarantee me some freedom financially but I wouldn't want to just sit on the money and lose investment opportunity. I've been really stumped on what to do. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I'm fortunate in that my parents are covering my cost of living, but I am responsible for tuition. A piece of background regarding this: my father used his retirement money to make a company or something to buy a house, which I'll be living in throughout school. I'm not sure if this is illegal or something, I'm not that well versed in this.

Tuition this semester will be $20k. I found out that I'm eligible for $30k of unsubsidized Stafford Loans this semester. Interest rate is 5.31%. My father, who owns my housing and pays for food to keep me alive and such, is asking that I take out $30k to help him cover expenses. He basically wants me to take out the extra $10k for him - he says he will pay the interest and principle as much as he can every month.

Is there anything I need to be wary about here? Is anything illegal?

My father and I have a very very good relationship, and I want to help him out as much as possible. If he ends up not being able to pay ""his part"" of my loan then I'm okay paying the whole thing, because that's what I'd be paying anyway if he wasn't paying for my housing.

personalfinance,Buy or Wait for Foreclosure to Fall Off,"I'm a PF regular but this is a throwaway account.

TLDR: Should I wait for the foreclosure to fall off my record in 2 years, or should I look into buying now knowing that there will be increased cost in the short term until I can refinance in two years.

I have a foreclosure on my record caused by a divorce. My financial situation has changed substantially since then and my foreclosure will fall off in 2 years. 

My current situation:

* household income 170K+
* no debt
* apx 300K in cash savings
* low 700 credit score for me, wife hovers around 800
*wife has sporadic income and is mostly a SAHM, I have been at my current job about 6 months, but have had continuous employment for over a decade

My plan has always been to save and wait to buy another home when the foreclosure falls off my record. My wife would like to buy something now. I admit that our living situation is mediocre at best (it's not a single family home so there are noise and other issues which is difficult with small children), but it is very inexpensive compared to other housing options (about 17% of monthly income spent on rent and utilities in a very HCOL area) and it meets our basic needs space-wise. To move to a place that we'd both be happy with we'd have to almost double our housing costs. 

I have not spoken to a mortgage broker, but from what I've read, I'd probably need to get an FHA loan, even though I would have 20% down, and I know that would include PMI and I would have a higher interest rate because of the foreclosure. I'm thinking it's best to stick to the original plan of just waiting until the foreclosure falls off, but I'm wondering if there is something I'm missing in weighing the options. The houses we'd be looking for would be in the 700-800K range and we'd be putting up to 200K down.",finance,1470764918

personalfinance,Moving up from Intern level,"Hello r/personalfinance!
I'm 23 and I live in California. I've been working at a manufacturing plant for the past 3 months as an engineering intern while I finish up my degree. The company wanted a full time entry level engineer but I guess I sold myself well enough in my interview.

I gambled on myself and told them to hire me as an intern part time, 3 days a week, until I finish my degree, then have a performance review when I graduate to decide whether they should bump me up to a full time engineer or cut me loose. This way, they could pay me at an intern rate for 3 months instead of committing to a graduated engineer's salary immediately. Win for everybody right?

Anyway, the time has come and my manager told me they're getting an offer together for me! This is where you guys (hopefully) come in!

I've never had salary, benefits, vacation, 401k, etc. How do I negotiate these things? 

When I was applying to jobs, I told myself I would be happy with $65k, since that seems to be the going rate for most entry level Mechanical engineers. I looked on Glassdoor and saw that my position has 3 reviews with salaries of $90k, $95k, and $105k. However, these are probably engineers with the same job title but those crucial 3-5 years of experience. Anyway, in my first interview I told them I'd like a salary of $75k-95k, and they said that's in their range. So as far as salary goes, I'll probably be happy with whatever they offer.

I believe they match some percentage of 401k contributions, so I'll start by contributing enough to hit that maximum matching. I've heard about the ""John Oliver retirement plan scam"" thing but haven't done much research. What kind of fees or interest rate should I expect?

I'm still on my parents' health insurance plan for the next 3 years, but I'm still interested in seeing what my company offers, since I will have to switch over eventually.

Am I forgetting anything?

personalfinance,Took out a private student loan for my first year of college last year. The ridiculous interest rate has been eating away at me ever since. Is there anything I can do? [Debt],"Last summer, I took out a loan from Sallie Mae with my mother as the cosigner*. The loan is for $25,800 and has a fixed interest rate of 12.125%. Yes, I know the amount is high and the interest rate is high. My mother and I didn't really know much about borrowing at the time. Now, we know about parent plus loans, but the damage has already been done. Luckily, this year my cost of attendance is $12,000 - still high, but much more doable.


Some information: My mother has had a stable job for years and makes $60-$63k every year.

Basically, I'm just wondering if there is anything I can do to refinance the loan or to lower the interest rate while I'm in school. Every time I've tried to call Sallie Mae, they've told me variations of ""It goes through a system that looks at (all of the information I listed above).

personalfinance,I would appreciate some advice on how to improve my finances.,"First off, I apologize if this is the wrong sub. I'm not a frequent redditor. Also, throwaway for privacy.

We (my husband and myself) are not in terrible financial shape, but I know we could be doing better. Just not sure where to start (or what to do). I make sure everything gets paid, and paid (mostly) on time. Other than that...I'm pretty clueless.

Here's the overview:

My husband makes 55k/yr before taxes. I am self-employed... last year I made about 25k? (my income comes from many different clients, so it can be hard to judge.) It looks like I can reasonably expect 30k this year (up to 37k if things go really well).

My credit score is 820. Husband's is about 760.

*We have 4 bank accounts between us*.

**Savings 1**: .1% interest rate. The balance never goes over $3000. I use this to pay rent/bills/etc. out of.

**Savings 2**: slightly higher interest rate (I think .12%). Anything over the $3000 in the savings goes into this account. It currently has $5500.
There is also a checking account that I keep at $1000.

My husband has his own checking account that he pays his student loans from. Whenever it gets over $1000, we put that into the 2nd savings account.


*Debt*:

**Student loan 1**: 2.32% interest, $2000 balance.

**Student loan 2**: 6.8% interest, $3500 balance. This is held by the same company as Student loan 1, we send them a check for $125 each month.

**Student loan 3**: 6.8% interest, $5500 balance, $100/month payment.

**Personal Loan**: 7% interest, $2805 balance, $125/month payment.

**Car loan**: 1.99% interest, $6600 balance, $145/month payment.

I have 3 credit cards (one is joint with my husband). I don't know the interest rates exactly, they vary between 9-16%. I never carry a balance on them. The one we actually use we put everything on, and pay off 1-2 times each month, because it has a cash back rewards system (which I set so that it automatically applies the 'cash' towards the card balance).

*Expenses*:
**Rent**: $1795/month. I know a lot of people are going to raise an eyebrow at this, so I'm just gonna say: We live in SoCal with an 80lb dog...so our options are kind of limited.
**Utilities**: Between internet, cell phone, etc...I guess around $400? It's a little difficult to judge between the tiered electricity rates and the water bill being on a 28-day cycle.

*Other concerns*

We are looking into trading in my husband's car for something newer (we would have to take out a loan, it would be 2.24% interest, and the car would have to be 2008 or newer), as his needs a lot of expensive repairs which might cost more than the down payment on something else. The trade-in value will be between 2-4k. Opinions on this are welcome.

I have an offer for a 0% interest for x number of months which I am considering taking and paying off before the 0% interest window closes (I have done this before with success - I understand the common pitfalls associated with this. Keep the money to pay it off in the bank earning interest). Would this be advisable, considering my past success, if we were to purchase a newer (but still used) car?

* Federal Stafford Loan, 5.31% Fixed (1% orig fees), $20,500
* Federal Plus Loan, 6.31% Fixed (4% orig fees), $29,000
* Private Loan (Commonbond, Discover, etc.), 3.74% Var [3.5% Fed Prime + .24% margin] + .25% autopay discount during repayment, $90,000
* Private Loan (Commonbond, Discover, etc.) 6.49% Fixed + .25% autopay discount during repayment, $90,000


I'm very much interested in refinancing after I graduate, as it appears as though I would likely get better rates than I am seeing here (right?). I did a mock refinance with SoFi estimating my annual salary and total loans, and received an estimate for 6% Fixed and 4.375% Var.

Post-graduation, I'm hoping to pay off my loans in 10 years. My estimated salary w/ bonuses is $140K (might be low, or if I go start-up route, might be high).


So my question is...what would you do/what should I do? My thought process for both years is to take the Federal Loan at 5.31%, go Variable for the rest. It doesn't look like the interest rate will skyrocket between the next two years. After graduation in two years I'll refinance, hopefully to a fixed rate lower than 6.5%. The downside is that, if interest rates do go up, I could find myself refinancing on a rate higher than the 6.5%.

Nuclear's response to 'future energy crisis'

Imagining a future energy policy in the event of ""blackouts that occurred across Europe in 2018"", Jonathan Hart and Brett Longstaffe propose a pan-European nuclear fuel cycle that emerged ""out of the necessity for secure, low carbon electricity supplies"". In their Spark! Contest winning essay, the two young engineers write that this new system ""stood on three pillars"" - a coordinated European strategy , technological developments and a new nuclear message.

The solution was to extend the scope of the Euratom Treaty in several areas, with the aim of fulfilling the lofty ambitions set out in the original 1957 treaty. This aimed to strengthen the European nuclear market by reducing barriers to entry, and increasing strategic cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.

Nuclear research and development was targeted in three ways - funding nuclear innovation aimed at cost reductions; developing revolutionary technologies, including molten salt reactors; and creating national centres of excellence for research, with areas of expertise identified and prioritised in each nuclear nation, and research budgets 'pooled' across European states.

Before learning this, my plan was to pay off my USAA Career Starter loan which I used to pay off some private loans (2.99%, $25,000) in the fixed, 5 year time period, while utilizing income based repayment to pay off the $38,000 I have in federal loans (starting at ~$140/mo and paying off extra whatever I can afford).  

Now that I am in deferment, should I change my approach at all to paying these off?  Since only part of my loans are subsidized, there's only $5k that will NOT accrue interest during this deferment.  The remaining amount (~$33k) will continue to accrue interest at ~$120/mo.

personalfinance,"$85,000 in student loan debt. Best methods to dig out?","Hey everyone,
So, here's my situation. 85,000 dollars in student loan debt. I have my undergraduate degree and have a fairly decent job that pays me 59,000 per year salary. I get to keep about 65% of that pay, so my bi-weekly pay amounts to around 1,350. I am contributing to a pension plan, but have not yet started contributing to a 401k plan because right now my thoughts are on putting as much into my debt as possible. 

70,000 of these dollars are with a private loan agency while the other 15,000 is federal. 

Currently am renting an apartment with my fiancée and splitting everything down the middle. We live in a population dense area, so rent is pretty consistent and moving wouldn't save us much cash. 
Current expenses:

Rent= $935 per month split @ 450 cost to me 
Utilities = 200 per month - includes all associated living costs. Split @ 100 cost to me. 
Car payment and insurance  = 344.64 per month- I pay 100%
Loan payments- 1,000 monthly 
Groceries and basic need items (gas, toiletries, supplies, etc) - 250 per month.

Total monthly spending = 2,144.64
About 550 per month left over. 

Should I start contributing this to a 401k or split it in half and do 275 extra to loans and 275 into 401k?

Also, we are looking at getting into a house because it will allow us to build up equity into something instead of dumping it into rent. 
Would only purchase home if total mortgage/insurance/utility/property tax expense would be identical to what we pay for rent now. 

Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",finance,1470787288
personalfinance,Credit dropped 100pts! Looking for advice for a situation.,"Hello, 

   Within this year my Fiancée needed to have weekly medical visits/treatments that weren't cheap. Her insurance covered 90% of it but it was still a large penny. I just recently landed a financial stable career(graduated college 2 years ago, and was looking for a while). I didn't have a whole lot, her medical expensive/rent and just living leaving my account exhausted. 

Recently, I found out that my credit scored dropped into the high 600s. I couldn't afford the cable bill so I canceled it, but I still owed $1200ish. It was either pay for TV or have a roof and her improving.. kind of a no brainer. It was a balancing act, and I just couldn't cough up the cash to pay the bill. 

Now it has gone into collection and put a mark on my credit report.  I'm in the market for a new vehicle, and I don't want my interest rate to be out the ass. I've done some research on the collection agency (IC Systems) and they're shake down artist, I don't want to pay them a dime. 

I'm not sure if at  this point I can, but is it possible to arrange for a payment system with the cable provider, or if I can just pay them directly.  Would paying this off boost my credit score to what it was originally? If not, what will paying this off do to my credit score. Can i have the mark removed from my credit score, and how long will it stay on my report?

I have about $226000 and my wife has $102000 in student loans. All from undergrad and medical school and all federal. The loans average out to 6.4% interest.

I am in the last year of residency and I'm likely taking a current job offer that starts at $228000 base salary in July 2017 (It will be minimum 15 shifts each month, but potentially I can earn about $1500 on any extra shifts I take). 
On the other hand, my wife plans on pursuing a 3 year fellowship and is in her second to last year of residency, so she will be capped at earning roughly $65000 (before tax income) for the next 4 years.

We calculated our current expenses are about $88000 (of which $30000 are student loan payments) on an annual basis. Therefore we spend about $58000 on expenses that aren't including loans.  We expect this to remain relatively unchanged for the next few years. We have savings of $20000 emergency fund. No investments or 401K (been paying loans off instead). We dont' plan on children for at least another 3 years.

financialindependence,I'm new to FI/RE and need some help from the elders...,"Hey y'all, I have been lurking on this sub for the last few weeks since I discovered it and have been obsessed with changing my family's life in order to get FI.  In fact, in these last few weeks, I've started the process to refinance my home to get rid of PMI and lower my interest rate. I have posted my stats below and I have a couple of questions and am just looking for general advice or a push in the right direction.  I've searched the sub and read the FAQ several times but I still have some questions relating to my specific finances. 

**Life Situation:** 

I'm 28 and married with an infant.  My wife and I have very stable jobs (nurse and engineer). 

**FIRE Progress:** 

I've been saving 10% towards a roth 401k for the last 5 years but I am new to FIRE.  We've been following Dave Ramsey's principals to pay down debt and have so far paid off around $20k in the last 5 years. We keep a detailed budget using YNAB and have been doing so for the last 2 years. 

**Gross Salary/Wages:** 

$170,000

**Yearly Savings Amounts:** 

$26k/year (10% contribution and employer 12% match) in roth 401k 

$7100/year (wife's 403b)

$2200 HSA

**Current expenses:** 

Here are our average monthly expenses for the last two years. 

Restaurants - $800

Groceries - $360

Spending money - $735

Clothing - $313

Fun - $250

Personal Care - $100

Dog - $85

Baby - $300

Mortgage P&amp;I - $1300 (before refi)

Mortgage T&amp;I - $900

HOA - $125

Utilities/Internet/Auto Insurance - $710

Fuel - $432

Lawn/Home Maintenance - $320

Car note 1 - $523 (Will be paid off in a couple months)

Car note 2 - $604

Student loan 1 - $143

Student loan 2 - $225

Medical - $122

Gifts - $225

All in all, we spend about $9000/month in expenses (I know, out of control! We need help!)

**Expected ER expenses:** 

I expect that in retirement we would have no mortgage, no student loans and no car notes.  If we curb our spending we could bring our monthly expenses down to around $4500/month in retirement. 

**Assets:** 

Home Equity - $85k

401k (mine) - $105k

Pension (mine) - $116k

403b (hers) - $45k

Pension (hers) - $5k

Car (almost paid) - $20k

**Liabilities:** 

Mortgage - Owe $230k at 3.75, refinancing to $235k at 3.25 (30yr) to drop $237/month PMI. 

Car 1 - $3000 owed at 1.9%.  Will pay off in 2 months

Car 2 - $30k owed at 1.7%.  60 month loan with 52 months left

Student Loan 1 - $8000 at ~6% (5 years remaining)

Student Loan 2 - $30k at ~6% (15 years remaining....ouch)

**Specific Question(s):** 

I know that my expenses are way too high and that we really need to wake up and fix this if we are to engage in the FI/RE lifestyle.  My wife and I have talked it over, and while we don't necessarily want to retire super early (would like to in our 40s), we want to have that independence so that we don't NEED to work.  I would like to stay with my company until I'm 47 when I can collect my full pension (which is really good!). We both enjoy what we do and we find our work fulfilling (even though frustrating at times). I have a few questions regarding the optimal way to achieve FI with the above data:

* The obvious: excessive spending.  How can my wife and I really buckle down and minimize our spending based on the above expenses?
* What is the best way to attack the debt above?  We have been using the snowball method and have paid off about $14k in cc debt so far.  Would it be optimal to put a ton of savings in an index fund every month and wait until we have a balance large enough to pay each debt, one at a time?
* What is my FI number from the above data?  If I plan on retiring at 47, would I include my home equity and retirement in my FI number since I can't access that money until 60?
* How do I calculate my savings rate?  Again, do I consider 401k savings in that since I can't access it in ER?
* One alternative I've thought about instead of ER is to keep working and take extended unpaid leave at work every year (ex: go to live in another country for 3 months during summer), if my employer would let me.  Has anyone here tried this and what was your experience?
* Lastly, based on what you see above, what are some obvious things that we can fix or try differently?  Is there something you can recommend to set us on the path to FI that was extremely successful for you?

I know it is a lot but I appreciate any feedback and advice that I can get.  I am new to this endeavor but I don't think I'm far off track, I just need to get up to speed with some things and optimize for the best results.  Thanks!",finance,1470796594

Here's the issue: A few days ago about 10 people from the back end quit without giving a 2 week. To make matters worse, we've also lost a few experienced folk from the floor (again without a 2 wk notice). Management recently **approved all overtime until this Sunday**, so I've been pulling 6am - 9pm shifts every day this week. I'm used to really long hours so it's not a huge deal in a physical sense, but will this screw me over financially?


I worked 13hrs OT at the start of the pay period and expect to end with about 40 hours OT total (on top of back to back 40hr work weeks). I didn't realize that taxes maximize for that period, so I think I'm only going to earn around $1,000 despite the $1,400 total revenue. Will working those overtime shifts potentially bump me into a weird place for tax purposes? 

I'm starting to realize that OT comes with diminishing returns so far as extra $/hr is concerned. Would it be wiser to back off on overtime and cap myself at something like 10 OT per week to maximize this? I feel thats more a personal question related to the value of free time.

personalfinance,"Girlfriend's parents took out loan in her name, didn't tell her, used it, never made a payment. Where should she go from here?","Posting from a throwaway account for personal reasons.

I'm a longtime lurker of /r/pf and have read tons of horror stories involving people's finances and their families. I never thought it would happen to me or someone so close to me.

Today my girlfriend found out that her parents took out a federal student loan with her name on it a few years ago. That loan was used towards paying her tuition at a university. There has never been any sort of payment made. She found this out after checking her credit score and seeing that it was 417. She doesn't have any credit cards, no overdue medical bills, and no sort of (other) debt. The only thing on her report is a delinquent account for a federal loan that is past due. It seems like her parents aren't accepting responsibility for this at all. They're claiming that since she dropped out of the university to go to a community college they thought they wouldn't have to pay the loan, I call bs on this. They're successful small business owners who own a house, have car payments, etc. I'm sure they know exactly how a loan works.

Where should she go from here? Is this fraud? Identity theft? She called some credit bureaus today and it was suggested to her that she file a police report, what are the pros/cons of this? (besides the obvious damage to family relations) Does she start paying off this loan asap? If she does, should it be payed as aggressively as possible?

I should mention the following things:
We're currently trying to find out whether or not her parents cosigned for this loan, we should be finding this out tomorrow morning. The loan is under 10k. Also, she'll be reading your comments so feel free to speak directly to her, we'll both be responding via this account.

gaming,Franchising eSports as a whole,"Hey all! First post on this subreddit, so I apologize in advance if I miss one of the rules.

###The Problem

So eSports is a thing. We know this, investors are starting to see this, and it's all beginning to grow pretty big. A particularly large eSport is League of Legends, by Riot Games, which is currently running the LCS where teams compete for a chance to go to Worlds, or to avoid relegation into the Challenger Scene which is currently similar to LCS lite. The league is owned by Riot, the teams are owned by people outside the developer company. When eSports was in it's baby phase, still very new, this was okay, because no one was willing to put enough money in to make the broadcast worth watching. We can all agree that the production value Riot has put in has dwarfed every other eSport industry so far (Yeah, there have been some contenders here and there, but Riot has outlasted everyone so far in this regard). 

Now, when we look at League of Legends, not only are the games fun to watch, but the production value makes everything look much more professional, and the viewership shows it. Investors are seeing that there is money to be had here. But when they look to invest, all they are seeing is that the team they can invest in only gets money through sponsorships, which are almost negligible in other sports, and the team they are putting together has a chance to be knocked out. Neither of those things are something an investor wants to hear.

While investing in League seems a bit shaky, the LCS is still experiencing this weird bubble, where people are still dropping large dollars into creating teams, with the hope that the team will last, and they can get some good sponsorships rolling and they can make a profit. Some of these teams have begun to get relegated, scaring off other potential investors, as well as scaring sponsors from being willing to sponsor a team, as the team they sponsor might just get relegated, and then they are out of a sponsorship.

The next step WOULD be to just franchise the LCS, and allow the owners of the teams to create the league and operate it for themselves. It would increase revenue for the teams by quite a bit, and would allow anyone who wants to dump money into the scene to have financial security. However, the problem with the current situation is that the teams cannot own the league. If they wanted to broadcast their league, they would need Riot to give the go-ahead, which isn't going to happen in the current state of eSports.

###The Solution

So you can't franchise a game league that revolves around everyone playing one game. The game devs would much rather be the ones in charge of the league, so they could get as much of the revenue from the league as possible. Perhaps a better solution would be to franchise a league in which teams would play more than one game. 

Take a moment through imagination land with me. We have in front of us a franchised league, we shall call it Esports Champions League (ECL) in which teams own the franchise or at least the vast majority of it (We will get back to this). In order to create the ""eSport"", the matches become best of 3, with the teams banning out the games they don't want to play, with the home team (could be random, could be geographic, there are many ways to decide this) getting the final pick. They load up the game, and play a match of it. Alternatively, best of 3, with alternating picks rather than bans, starting with home team. The pick/ban phase could occur arbitrarily on Friday, and the games would be aired on Saturday to give teams time to set up, or it could all occur on one day, with the downtime being commercials, bringing in more revenue.

Initially, this still has the problem the LCS has in that the teams still cannot broadcast the game they are playing. Well, there are 2 possible solutions now, either the ECL can buy the rights to broadcast the game, or, and this is what I imagine what the devs would want/do, the ECL could sell shares to the devs. The devs could own a portion of the league. This would allow the league to broadcast the games (no game dev would make a game, allow people to play it competitively, and refuse to broadcast that). 

Now, with team security, we get bigger investors and sponsorships, since the teams they are backing are not going to get immediately relegated. We can move teams away from the game dev headquarters, since the teams are not reliant on a particular dev to be able to make money. With teams moving away, we get regional teams, creating regional fanbases and regional stadiums (possibly), and that solves the whole home/away quandry pretty neatly. 

The only issue left to take care of would be production quality; the ECL would need to have a strong financial start in order to create high production value from the get-go. I can't imagine creating a broadcast at the level Riot has set would be terribly cheap, which means there needs to be a large amount of money in this from the start, to help jump-start the process.

###Other Thoughts

Beware; this section may be a little helter-skelter, since this is basically all the thoughts I had related to the topic that did not necessarily fit into other sections.

First off, when I say ""production"", what I see happening is for the pick/ban phase, perhaps some analysts/experts before hand talking about what each team might decide to go with, as well as strengths/weaknesses of each of the teams. The pick/ban would be made aesthetically pleasing by some designer somewhere in the world, and then a post pick/ban analysis. For the games themselves, I can't decide whether specialized casters would be better or if more general casters would fit the bill here (think Jatt from the LCS versus Joe Miller, who has casted multiple titles). Perhaps a mix. Then some post-game analysis.

As I know someone will bring up the comparison, this is not the ESL. ESL simply hosts events/tournaments with teams competing in the individually. It is a media company, not a franchise. However, I think the success of the ESL shows that there is a large market of gamers who want to see a wide array of games. Additionally, the ESL could probably make the franchise themselves. Just sell various team companies shares of their stock, begin hosting the league, profit. This could also solve the problem of not enough startup money, since they are bound to have a small profit by now. My only worries would be if they couldn't put together a high-enough quality, or if they couldn't get big titles like League of Legends, Counter-strike, Street Fighter, etc. to buy some stock so they could broadcast the games. But even if there's only 4 big titles, that's enough for this to work.

Just to clarify, the NFL, NBA, and the NHL are all franchises as well, in case anyone was not aware. In fact, just about all traditional sports are franchised, so moving eSports in that direction only brings us closer to traditional sports, a goal I think is very much in line with the moves currently being made in eSports.


###Conclusion

The only problem I see this model running into would be lack of interest in a particular game, but if it's left to the teams to decide, I'm sure big-name teams aren't big names for nothing; surely the games they are playing have a fan-base. And perhaps the fan-base of all the individual games will start to morph into fans of esports in general. I personally watch League of Legends, but I've watched some SMITE eSports with my brother, and the more I watch, the more I understand what is happening. And many of the fighting games run on a very similar principle of ""who runs out of health first"", 

So what do you all think? Is this a scenario anyone would want to see implemented? Perhaps it is time for eSports to unify, rather than being a hodgepodge of competitive video-gaming. I think that rather than have a collection of eSports leagues with only a few being high quality, and even those destined to fade, since no one would invest, it would be better to have one high-quality series with competitive teams, and to see the scene begin to move in a similar direction to traditional sports.

EDIT: TL;DR I want to see all of eSports get franchised, so I can watch top teams compete at multiple games rather than one. I think this would solve the problem of volatility, which would bring more money into the scene, and let eSports get recognized a bit more.",technology,1470807819

personalfinance,5th year senior wondering about loan repayment.,"Hey, I'm graduating in 2 semesters with a degree in Criminal Justice and I was wondering about loan repayment. I'm aware of the program where, after 120 consecutive payments and community service, my debt is forgiven, but during my time in college, I also had to use Federal Direct PLUS loans, which go through my parents. I was wondering if those loans are eligible for forgiveness or, because they're in my parents name, they are not because they're not technically my loans. 

Also, if they aren't eligible, would it be smart to try and pay those off quickly after I find employment and pay less on my loans because mine will be forgiven, or should I just try to pay both off at roughly the same pace.

Eating out costs 8x what it costs to make the same exact meal better at home with better ingredients and more care (no spit in the soup). 
You can get a dozen of your friends drunk and fed for what it costs for two of you to go to a bar for a night and get creeped on.  Nobody gets assaulted or pulled over is a bonus.
If your destination is less than 10 hours away, drive. You won’t have to pay for a rental car, and you won’t ever get stranded without your shit.  
While you live at home, pay 2x or more what you owe every month on student loans.  
Money sitting in a bank account is useless.  Use it to pay off loans, however, first build up around $5,000 for emergencies, and DON’T TOUCH IT.  
Put a few hundred bucks here and there. Keep some $20s in your car.  Open up a second savings account online and keep $500 in it.  If you ever need it, you’ll remember its there.

They’re full of shit.  If they say you owe them money tell them to mail you a bill, then hang up.  If they ask for your address because they don’t know it, hang up.  If they’re scammers they’ll fuck off at this point.  If they’re legit, they’ll probably reach back out to you.  

NEVER use a debit card for gas.  The information will be stolen, probably once a year (in my experience).  Better still, never use a debit card for anything.  Leave it at home in a safe.  Use a credit card.  If someone steals your debit information, you’re boned.  If someone steals your credit card information, you have zillions of ways to fight it.  Find a good card with good mile rewards, sign up for it, and use that.  Pay it off once a week.  Rack up the miles and use them to travel for free.  I recommend the BankAmericard Travel Rewards.  

Find a savvy coworker who knows what they’re talking about.  They’ve got the same healthcare, 401k, and benefits and likely know what the best plans are.  

Most importantly, if you ever have any trouble, ask for help.",finance,1470833532

personalfinance,Some questions about paying off credit cards,"Hi, Kinda new to this sub, so I apologize if this has been asked before. 

I have accumulated a little bit of credit card debt. I have finally got my finances pretty stable and I want to focus on paying them off. I have about 2300 on one card that has a terrible, terrible interest rate of 23% and another $900 on an amazon store credit card at around 13% interest. 

I was looking at applying for a balance transfer card, like slate chase or an Amex 'pre-qualified' offer I received. This would give me a period (12-15 months) to pay off the cards with 0% interest. Seems like an obvious chose, but I'm sure there's some downsides I'm not realizing.

My questions are basically: 

- Is this actually a good idea

- Should I close my other credit cards once the balances are transferred to the new card?

- How will this affect my credit: I would like to buy a house in the next couple years, will opening new lines of credit or closing old ones adversely affect what mortgage I qualify for? my goal is to have my credit cards totally paid off before I apply. I don't know what looks better/worse. Open lines of credit with no balance or closed accounts 

My other option would be to cut back on savings contributions and try to double down on paying off the credit cards.  but like I said I'm trying to save towards buying a house.

personalfinance,How to divvy up my credit card payments?,"Hello! I'd really like help figuring out which credit card to prioritize when it comes to paying them off. All of my cards are virtually maxed out due to some emergencies. I have re-worked a budget and gotten a part-time job, so now I want to pay my debt while paying as little interest as possible. I don't want to do the snowball method. I prefer avalanche, however, my highest rate card is not the card with the highest balance and I believe the difference in the two cards' balances is too significant for me to follow the avalanche method. Here's my debt:

Wells Fargo Rewards - **$4620.49** @ **19.99%**

Capital One Quicksilver One - **$1470.00** @ **23.15%**

Chase Slate - **$1399.95** @ **0%** until end of November

Citi Double Cash - **$999.99** @ **0%** until November 19th

I can afford to put **$250** a month toward my credit cards from my full-time job. Starting September I will have a part-time job where I can put **$600** a month (guaranteed, I'm not guessing) toward my debt. 

How should I make these payments? I'm inclined to toss the $600 at my Wells Fargo card and just pay the $25 minimum each on the Chase Slate and Citi Double Cash, and then that leaves $200 for my Capital One. Then once the interest rates hit in December, I can transfer my balances from the Chase Slate and Citi Double Cash onto the Wells Fargo...I realize I'm then back to where I started with the Wells Fargo card, however, that interest rate would be cheaper at the point. I think I should pay more to the Wells Fargo now instead of the Chase Slate and Citi Double Cash because then I'd be saving on interest for the the Wells Fargo card up through November. BTW I would not be paying the $600 once a month, I would be paying $150 a week.

Right now the Capital One is the highest interest but considering that the balance on my Wells Fargo is 3X as much, I don't think it's worth it to consider the Capital One my number one priority. Is there another way I should structure my payments? Should I go with my thoughts here and throw all the extra cash at one card or should I maybe alternate between some? All together I would have **$850** a month to put toward my debt.

I would greatly appreciate any and all help!! Thank you!",finance,1470847169
personalfinance,Upside down on a car - do I have any options?,"I financed a 2010 Ford Focus for $220/month.

I tried to re-finance the loan to lower the interest rate but was told by several companies that they couldn't help me.

I paid it off about three weeks ago. Will it change from ""filed"" after a period of time to another status such as ""discharged""?

She is looking to sell her condo for around $200k--she's also updating the chimney, roof, and exterior paint before selling. 
We've estimated the price per month at $550 (+$100 for the PMI), condo fees are $200 per month; grand total would be $850 per month.
We've also come across a few homes in the $280k range that we feel okay about, but nothing that has us saying, ""This is it, this is home"". A home in the $280k range would equal out to be $780 a month (+$100 PMI fee). All in all $880.

My fiance is concerned with the condo HOA fees; but the place jives well with us. We're essentially paying the same amount, regardless of which route we go (especially since we do not plan on staying in our first home more than 5 years).

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1559630.msg15880736#msg15880736

Thinking further to his thought. How to instead disrupt an exchange. Here we have a dilution and scattering of seeming dubious originated coins across a broad spectrum, where no one knows who owns what or why.

An ""attack"" vector could be what could it be called 'exchange social DoS' ' exchange legal DoS' or something?

Where these tokens ETC with no provenance, or do they have that? In a DAO before a split, therefor, those thereafter are not theirs or are theirs, or what? ., are spread wide amongst assorted custodians who in turn have to utilize their own expensive resources to determine whether to trade them or not.

This is fascinating. It can go on for ever. We have a batch of orphan tokens from some virtual fork, which hold value but no legal process ever encountered to say who owns them. In order to sell the since they seem to hold value, all exchanges need to expend time and effort and finance, to determine if that can be done.

What lovely anarchy has been borne?

Quick checking around this has not been discussed, rather ' the man' will get us our free immutable fungible code is law ETC tokens, run to him and report it to the SEC and FTC we demand our cryptocurrency be returned to us.

Does that make sense?

Stick it to the man, we got immutable blockchains, fungible anonymous currency. But when the shit hits the fun, were do we run to?

The man?

Worse is that out of the whole cauldron of shitcoins, BTC continues to draw the attention of the man at every step of the way. Now we got the Finex hack, 60 million dollars worth. All eyes are watching, the cacophony if sue them is ear drum breaking.

And who is there in the background receiving back slaps and well done's?

Ethereum.

Market makers, law makers, pundits left right and center. ""gee look at ethereum it solved its own problems no need to step in...""

Thanks BTC for drawing even more attention to regulation.

Reality is on the street two headlines exist today:

Bitcoin hacked, lost 60 million dollars. So sorry so sad best of luck next time.

Ethereum got hacked lost 60 million dollars. WOW. Check it out they cancelled and threw out the thief and got all their money back.

No one out there knows or cares about ""immutability"" ""code is law"" "" the block chain never lies"". you could not even explain what an exchange is versus a DAO.  All anyone who matters now knows that bitcoin = loss of mega monies tough luck, ethereum resolves its losses itself and makes everyone whole.

No need for .gov intervention and regulation against Ethereum.

Which comes back to the dirty child ETC. Impure dubious provenanced 'someone else's token' not Ethereum's. Scattered far and wide, filtering in and out of exchanges that are duty bound to report all of its movements.

Blockchain wise. Forever.

Dirty coins always on the move. Will exchanges eventually get fed up, and say hey, everytime we receive a notification or a tip, or a troll report that 'those funds are stolen' we need to freeze the funds,  spend our resources dispelling that.

personalfinance,(US) 23 y/o seeking advice on available 401(k) options,"Hi /r/personalfinance. I'd like some advice on choosing a 401(k) policy offered by my workplace. 

To start, I've already saved up a sizable emergency fund from part-time work I did while attending college. Now I'm looking to plan for retirement and hopefully invest soon afterwards. 

The company I work for contracts with John Hancock Retirement Plan Services. I will list their available investment options below.

**Traditional 401(k) or Roth 401(k)?**

But before that, I am wondering how the community feels about a Roth 401(k) as opposed to a traditional 401(k). I know the answer to this is guided by one's current income tax rate and one's perceived income tax rate at retirement. I'm not quite sure of the latter, but I can definitely answer the former. I currently make 52,000 USD annually and therefore I believe my tax breakdown should be as follows:

Tax Type | Marginal Tax Rate | Effective Tax Rate | Tax Amount
:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
Federal | 25.00% | 11.89% | $6,184 
FICA | 5.75% | 4.82% | $2,507
State | 5.75% | 4.82 | $2,507 
Local | 0.00% | 0.00% | $0

Total Income Taxes: $12,669
Income After Taxes: $39,331

I'm not quite sure what to make of this, and from what I've read there are a lot of ""ifs"" that need to be fulfilled for a Roth 401(k) to really work well. As a result, I've been leaning towards the traditional 401(k) with a 15% pre-tax contribution (max that is allowed). Is that a sound decision?

**Investment Options**

John Hancock allows you to either select your own investment options or simple use their **EZCHOICE** in which 100% of your contributions are put into a specific Active Strategies Target Date Portfolio sub-advised by John Hancock Asset Management. That sounds okay, but I'd like to take this opportunity to learn and hopefully use this information to invest in an IRA in the future. Therefore, I am inclined to choose my own investment options. *Note: Below I list examples of certain funds with links to their stats. I don't expect anyone to read these, but I included them in case anybody was interested.*

The available options are mix of equity funds, bond funds, and ""other"" funds. Within the equity funds, there are three different categories of funds: Aggressive Growth (AG), Growth (G), and Growth &amp; Income (G&amp;I).

**Actual Request for Advice**

Anyway, those are the examples of the various choices I have available to me. For starters, I'd like to know if anyone has a good rule for splitting between bonds and equity funds (and other funds). I've seen the ""take 100 or 120 minus your age and invest that percentage in bonds rule,"" but I don't know if investing roughly 77-97% of my 401(k) in bonds is a good idea. Beyond simple rules like that, I am not too sure what to invest in when it comes to a 401(k). I am actually a bit confused by the whole process as it seems more like I'm choosing an IRA, instead of applying for a company 401(k) to get the matching funds. Thoughts?

**Gratitude**

Thank you for your time and patience. I really appreciate it!",finance,1470874958
personalfinance,"Does it make more sense to pay off a mortgage quickly, or to take advantage of the low interest rates and use that money to invest more heavily towards retirement instead?","I'm looking at buying a house next year and this question has been bothering me for a while now. I've been debt free my entire life and the thought of being in debt for the next 30 years really bothers me, but with a 30 year mortgage going for around 3.7% right now, would it make more sense to make the minimum payments and use the extra spending money to invest towards retirement instead, hoping that the gains outpace the money lost to mortgage interest? My gut tells me to get out of debt as quickly as possible by making extra payments or going for a 15 year mortgage, but I think the math would say that at these mortgage rates it'd make more sense to invest that money instead, but I'm just not sure and I seem to find a lot of conflicting opinions on it.

If investing is the better option, should I also go for a smaller than 20% down payment (In Massachusetts there's a first time home owners program where you can get a mortgage at a lower down-payment without the insurance)

I'm 32 and on track to retire at 60 so a 30 year mortgage would put me on track to be debt free by the time I retire assuming I make a few extra payments.

I'd love to hear what Reddit thinks about this, thanks for any info y'all can provide.",finance,1470876283

financialindependence,An Argument For Semi-Retirement,"TLDR: Semi-retirement offers most of the benefits of FI, while seriously reducing your time spent in the rat race. It’s arguably more risky than traditional FIRE, but for many the pros will seriously outweigh the cons.

Let’s me start with a quick questionnaire, because I don’t want you to waste your time reading this entire post if semi-ER isn’t right for you (or maybe you’re bored and have nothing better to do in which case - enjoy!)

Do any of the following apply to you?

* You are stuck in a well paying job that you don’t necessarily hate, but you wouldn’t be there if you were already FI

*You’re willing to take calculated risks, perhaps more so than some of our more conservative friends with 2% SWRs and target numbers 75x their CoL

* You struggle to balance your ideals of wanting to be FI and wanting to enjoy your younger years

* You love your job/industry, you just wish you could find a better work-life balance

If you fit ANY of the above categories, read on. This could be for you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Say you make 80k/year, spend 40k a year, and based on the typical 4% SWR your number is 1 Million Dollars.  

So the typical FIRE goal would be to save up one million dollars, which should take ~15 years at 7% inflation-adjusted returns. 

Well, that kinda sucks.

And that’s assuming that a lot of things go well. I’ll talk about this more later (yay more of my shitty writing for you to wade through!) but what if we get caught in another recession? After all, we’re voting in either Trump or Hillary. Things are about to get weird.

Anyway I digress. The other option is semi-retirement. Of course there’s a ton of ways to divide up your FT working years and your PT working years, but ley’s say you work full time for 2/3 of the time it would take you to FIRE. In this case, 10 years. Using the same interest rate, you now have 590k as your nest egg. Not bad!

Now, if you semi-retire and just work enough to cover your expenses, it would take 8 more years of not being FI until you reach your $1m goal. 

To compare the two options:

Full-time: 15 years @ 80k/year

Part-time: 18 years. 10 years @80k/year, 8 years @40k/year

Oh and surprising fun fact, you actually end up working less hours, assuming that your PT hourly wage is the same as what your FT wage was. The ratio is 14:15 PT hours to FT hours. Since we have 3 more years for our money to grow in the semi-ER scenario, we don’t have to spend as many hours at work. Sounds counter-intuitive but makes sense once you think about it.

Anyway, now we’ve seen the two options. How do you decide which one is better for you? Both definitely have their pros and cons, so let’s go into that for a second!

I think the big protection that semi-ER gives you is the freedom to have the work-life balance most of us dream of. Say for example that at the 10 year mark in our example, we hit another recession, a 6 year downturn in the market. Nothing huge, but maybe after inflation you're down 4% for 6 straight years. I think this is something none of us like to think about, but that basically means that those 6 years brought you no closer to your FI goal. Instead of it taking 15 years, maybe it'll take you 21 to reach FI now. That really sucks. What is you FIRE date right now? How would you handle knowing that it was going to actually take an additional SIX YEARS?? If you’re like me you don’t want to imagine it. But it’s a realistic scenario that we have no choice but to deal with.

However...

Going to semi-retirement could mean that you get to do the job you actually want to do, instead of the corporate soul-sucking job you're planning on sticking with for another 5 years (11 after that shitty 6-year recession!). Most of us here want to do SOMETHING with our time after FI, and for many of us that includes one or more jobs that we would actually enjoy, at least in brief spurts. 

Maybe you've wanted to be a snowboard instructor in Colorado, but it doesn't pay enough to help you reach FI. Now you could do that job, and as long as it's paying your expenses you can let letting passive income do the rest.

Or, a managerial role at your favorite non-profit just opened up. You love and believe in this organization, and you hate your middle-management job. Unfortunately, the non-profit job only pays 40k, and you can't give up the 80k job you're taking right now. Otherwise you'll never make it to FI.

I can go on and on with examples like this, but the point is clear. **Semi-ER can offer similar benefits as full FIRE, but way quicker**

*So what are the downsides to Semi-Retirement?*

The biggest risk, put simply, is the fact that you’re taking way longer to reach FI. If the economy is bad, you don’t have that extra 40k going into your investments. You may feel trapped and forced to work, and you’ll still be affected if you get laid off or are unable to work. That is, of course, the worst case scenario.

Of course, in the classic ER route a LTR (long-term recession :p) isn't doing you so hot either. You're gonna be stuck with your net worth going slightly up at best, and down a lot at-worst. 

So what situation would you rather be in? Working your dream job while your net worth stagnates, or having it slowly rise while you slave away at your higher paying job?

(That’s non-rhetorical by the way, some people will actually say they’d rather take the soul-sucking job. But hey, more power to ya!)

So what do you think? Have you ever thought about semi-ER? Any of you currently following a path like this? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

P.S. I'm not saying Semi-ER is for everyone, obviously. Some of you will dislike what I wrote because you have a job you love and you WANT to be working 40+ hours a week. That's great, and that just means Semi-ER isn't for you. But there are a lot of us who feel that working FT just isn't right for us, and this is an option that can get you out of that rat race in 2/3 the time.",finance,1470877066
personalfinance,[Housing] Need help checking my budget,"I'll start by including my [BUDGET](http://imgur.com/a/Tgxww) here!

**Background:** Both me and my gf (of 7 years) are 24, and we are looking at getting buying a house. We wanted to rent a place together, but we have a German Shepard and all the apartments in our area that claim to be dog friendly have a breed restriction against German Shepherds, so renting is out. Even if we could convince a place to rent to us, the cheapest option is $1,350, plus a 100 dollar a month dog fee, so thats $1,450 a month for the cheapest apartment(700sqft. and pretty dumppy looking). But I guess thats what you get for living in one of the most expensive states to rent, although at least this isn't CA.

**Savings:** Both me and my girlfriend have no student debt, and both our cars are paid off. Mine is an 03 manual Jetta, and a 12 Impreza for her. I have enough money specifically set aside for a car so that if mine kicks the bucket I could go out and buy one without any payments (I also am adding $400 a month to this as I would like to get a better car then what I currently saved for). In terms of an emergency fund I have 2K in my checking and 4K in my savings and I add 200 every month, which you can see in my budget. My gf has a decent amount of money in the bank left to her from a relative that she will be drawing from for the downpayment and any emergencies. 

**Downpayment:** Right now we figured that our max for a new house is 225K, with 20% down. we will split this amount as we both have enough saved up to do so, and then we can avoid pmi.

**Income:** In the Budget you really only see my income as my gf has had trouble finding a job. She finally found one the pays her per session with a client. she will take home about 100 for every hour session she gets. she will pay for our dog, and help out with the mortgage with what she can. For my income right now I make 60K before other benefits (mileage reimbursement, fitness subsidy, etc...). I ended up with about 62K this year. Next year in addition to a better salary I will start to get a performance bonus (starts at 3K and goes up based on how you do) along with the other benefits I normally get. I put a section in there because I am not sure what my new compensation will be. Last year the salary for 90% of the people in my position I am going into was 66K, with the remaining 10% being higher as they were the top performers and got better compensation. The common belief is that this year raises should be a bit better than before meaning that if I was rated average I would get between 66K and 67K. Fortunately I was ranked one of the highest performers at my firm. So I am hoping that my compensation will be fairly good this year.

**Misc:** I contribute 17% to my 401K, and my firm provided 1.5% into it as well (I know how crappy it is), but at least they also have a retirement account that they contribute 4.5% to and guarantee a return of 4% (there contribution goes up the longer you are at the firm). So all together I have 23% of my salary being put away to my retirement.  I do not actually pay health insurance right now, as I am still on my father's plan which is really good and doesn't cost me anything.  My credit score as provided to me by my bank is 799, which I am pretty happy about so I should be able to get a good interest rate. My company also has deals with banks to provide mortgages to us so I would look into those rates as well.   A large portion of my meals are paid for by the company. Lunch and Dinner for about 4 months out of the year, plus free snacks all year round.

**Purpose:** buying a house is a huge life event and I want to make sure that I am not missing anything before I make a decision. Please let me know what you think of my budget as well as how realistic my desire to buy a house is.

personalfinance,Can I use my girlfriend's stock discount?,"My girlfriend (of ~3 years) just started work at a company that lets her buy stock 2x a year at a 15% discount. As far as we know there aren't any restrictions on the quantity: the advice she got was to pour as much cash into it as she has to spare and either sell it immediately or wait a year for tax benefits to kick in. It's a publicly traded, fairly large company that's doing pretty well --- I don't think there's much risk of it crashing any time soon. 

Is there any reason I can't give her all my post-tax, non-savings cash to flip through the 15% gain and immediately stick it back into the index fund where it lives now? I'm guessing no, since that seems too good to be true, but I'm not sure why. If it is possible, how would it be taxed?

I got out of high school and didn't go to school, I worked retail and got lucky when my Aunt's office had a file clerk job opening.

I worked that job for a few months until I had done everything they needed, and then used the fact I had worked federally before to apply for other federal jobs.

I work seasonally for the government now, so realistically I'm making 35k a year but I could become full-time if I wanted.

I'm going to be blunt - I want to make a lot of money, and I feel like a government job isn't the way to do that. I'm planning on going to school for something, but I really don't know what to go to school for. As of right now I've considered business management, accounting, or computer systems networking, but I'm unsure if any of those will give me the opportunities I'll need to move up and secure a fairly good income.

I'm really not sure where to start, and I don't want to come across as someone who wants to just ""fall into"" the right thing. I just want to go down the right path - work extremely hard - and I want to make a lot of money preferably before 30. I'm worried about picking the wrong path, working hard at nothing, and setting myself back a few years.

What should I be doing, where should I be aiming? What are the good careers to go for? I feel like I'm good at networking and have always had good relationships with managers and supervisors.

As of now my gameplan is something like, go to school for something that interests me (CSN, accounting) and use my federal work experience as a stepping stone to make at least 55k. I think that's my biggest advantage vs. people my age who just went right into school. Once working full-time I can use my skills that I learn from each job to apply at higher-earning positions, and use those job offers to discuss salary and other potential job opportunities.",finance,1470885092

personalfinance,Pay cash or finance,"Hello most wise redditors, need some advice...

Without getting into too many details, I'm 25, I have a large amount of money saved up and my parents are willing to loan me about $15k in order for me to be able to pay cash on a studio condo rather than have to finance it. If I took their loan and paid cash, I would go from having a pretty substantial amount of savings to having about $5-8k in savings. 

Monthly housing expenses including P&amp;I, utilities, taxes, insurance, and HOA if financed would be about $800, if I paid cash they would go down to about $400. 

I'd save $2-3k in closing costs and assuming I sold after roughly 5 years, I would save roughly an extra $12k in interest having paid cash. Are these savings and reductions in monthly payments worth me putting down all my savings? I'm self employed (already paid Q1 and Q2 estimated taxes and have factored in Q3 and Q4 dues to my estimates), own my car, have no debts. 

EDIT- income wise, some months I don't make anything due to the nature of my job, some months I may make 10-20k. Could estimate on the LOW end I should be able to make around 35k annually, high end 60-80k. 

I'm torn between paying cash and saving all that money in the long run and keeping my savings in tact. Interest rates are low, I'm of the opinion that the stock market has to correct somewhat sometime in the next year so that might present an opportunity to make more than the roughly 3.5% interest I would be charged on a loan. Money is cheap right now so maybe it's worth financing, I just love the idea of remaining debt free and having such low monthly expenses. Thoughts?",finance,1470918116

I keep my expenses low with roommates and cheap food, so I estimate my monthly rent+ other costs to be around $500-$600. My current loans are a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized with an interest rate of about 6%.

The main problem I see with the down payment option is that since I am not on a salary or anything, I don’t get paid around holidays, school breaks, etc. so I am hesitant to be completely reliant on that money.

I’m sure the savings would not be very significant either way, but does anyone have experience or insight as to what would be the better option? I don’t regret going to this grad program, but I worry about the loan amount and would love to get started on them ASAP.

Thank you!",finance,1470927531

finance,Portfolio Optimization with Multiple Asset Classes,"Can I use the usual mean-variance Markowitz optimization when I'm trying to figure out asset allocation across multiple asset classes (bonds, stocks, REITs, etc)?

Minimizing the variance for a target expected return makes sense to me if you're considering a portfolio of equities. However, including bonds for example complicates things - they have systematic differences from equities such as fixed maturities, periodic coupon payments/reinvestment, depend on interest rate expectations etc. Bonds with a maturity shorter than the investment horizon wouldn't exist at the terminal time in the model. These considerations would naturally be amplified if you're including even more heterogenous asset classes into your portfolio and your optimization problem. The return dynamics would obviously be very different from equities and this seems to be glossed over by the model. 

However, I frequently see the standard MVO techniques used to determine asset allocations across equities, fixed income and other classes. Is this theoretically valid? Are there superior techniques for optimizing mixed portfolios?",finance,1470933294

personalfinance,Looking for Feedback/Advice (Long),"Hello everyone – I’m new to this whole personal finance thing and have been reading as much about it as I can, but I wanted to post all of my details and my whole plan here to get feedback.  My overview ended up being much larger than anticipated, so I’ve broken it down into sub-categories below.  Thanks!

**OVERALL SITUATION**

I’m 24 and have been working (post-graduation) for a little over a year.  I just got a promotion and a big raise (18%!).  My new salary is $56,000.  I am extremely fortunate and have no debt whatsoever to speak of.

**SAVINGS SO FAR (401K AND EMERGENCY FUND)**

I have been contributing to my employer’s 401k plan up to the match (they match 50% up to 6% of your salary) since I was first eligible for it (almost one year ago; I have about $3,700 in it right now).  All of my savings outside of that have been to fund my emergency fund, which I am keeping in a savings account, but am considering moving somewhere that has a higher interest rate, but is still 100% liquid.  Once full, this will contain 6 months’ worth of necessary living expenses ($9600).

**BUDGET**

Over the past twelve months I have tracked all of my expenses in great detail and have created a budget sheet that breaks down my take-home pay – on average I spend 50% on necessary living expenses, 20% on non-necessary expenses, and the remaining 30% goes to savings.  I am very happy with my lifestyle right now and with this breakdown.  It meets my personal spending and savings goals perfectly.

**FINANCIAL GOALS GOING FORWARD**

However, my emergency fund will be full in the next couple of months, so I am naturally looking to adjust my savings plans.  That’s why I’m here!  I’ve been reading all of the r/personalfinance wikis and FAQs, as well as doing a lot of research elsewhere online, and speaking to family, friends, and coworkers.

The vast majority of what I have read suggests that every single penny of savings goes towards retirement until all possible retirement accounts are maxed out.  Even if I were to do that, I couldn’t max out my retirement accounts.  Regardless, I am not interested in putting every single penny I save towards retirement – my most important financial goal (past having an emergency fund) is to balance being adequately prepared for retirement with being able to enjoy the present and all of the years in between.  

**RETIREMENT SAVINGS**

Therefore, after all of my research here and elsewhere, I have decided to contribute 20% of my gross salary towards retirement savings each year (this figure includes my employer’s 401k match).  Following the recommended order of retirement savings (401k to match, max Roth IRA, max 401k), I will be contributing 7% of my gross towards my 401k while maxing my Roth IRA each year.  As my 401k is in a Target Date fund through my employer, I was going to put my Roth IRA into a Target Retirement fund through Vanguard.  I’ve noticed that I need a $1,000 initial investment, so I was planning on saving this up in my savings account.  

**NON-RETIREMENT SAVINGS**

I would like to continue saving 30% of my take-home.  After accounting for the regular Roth IRA contributions, that leaves me with ~16% of my take-home for non-retirement savings, which equates to ~11% of my gross salary (note: coincidentally, not only will I end up saving 30% of my take-home, but I will also end up saving ~30% of my gross salary!).

With these non-retirement savings, I am interested in a similar split between long-term and short-term savings as I employed for my overall savings.  I don’t currently have any concrete short-term financial targets to meet, so for a lack of a better division plan I followed a similar long-term/short-term savings split as for my overall savings (~66% retirement, ~34% non-retirement).  Therefore, my plan is to put ~66% of my non-retirement savings into investments, and ~34% into an account similar to the one I’ll keep my emergency fund in.

**INVESTMENTS**

In terms of my investments, I was going to put them into Vanguard, just like my Roth IRA.  I’m not interested in becoming a day trader or anything like that, but I’ve read on this sub-reddit that you cannot transfer from a LifeStrategy fund to equivalent Admiral Shares (for the lower expense ratios) without being taxed on your gains.  Therefore, I would like to create a four-fund portfolio (following Vanguard’s asset allocation tool’s recommendations).  As I don’t have a lump sum ready for investing, these will need to start in ETFs, eventually moving them to Investor Class and finally Admiral Class once I meet the minimum investment thresholds.

As I’m 24, I was going to split my ETFs up as 76% stocks, 24% bonds, and increase the bond % by 1% each year.  Inside the stocks I was going to put 60% towards domestic stocks and 40% towards international stocks, and inside the bonds I was going to put 70% towards domestic bonds and 30% towards international bonds.  


**CONCLUSION AND QUESTIONS**

* Well!  That write-up was a lot longer than I expected, but it also seemed best to go ahead and get all of my information out there up-front.  Other than feedback on my plan (both overall and every detail), I have some specific questions: 

* What is the best way to handle transferring my ETFs to Investor Class and eventually Admiral Class equivalent index funds once I meet the minimum investment thresholds?  

* Should I open my four ETFs according to the breakdown detailed above and simply move each one up into Investor and then Admiral as they qualify?  

* Should I wait until I can move them all up from ETFs at once?  

* Would it be better to save up the $3,000 I need for each index fund in a savings account, and skip the ETFs and move straight to Investor Class (like I’m doing with my Roth IRA)?  

Like I said above, I’m not interested in micro-managing my stocks, and the drawbacks of ETFs (having to manage them yourself, only being able to buy whole shares instead of just auto-drafting a % of your paycheck) outweigh their low expense ratio.  However, I am willing to deal with them in the short term in order to eventually get to Admiral Class without having to be taxed on the moves to Investor Class and Admiral Class, as I would by opening a LifeStrategy fund.  

As with my general question of “What do you think of all of this?,” any and all feedback is welcome and greatly appreciated.

Thank you all so much!",finance,1470940035

I make on average 2200 a month, but can range from 1700 - 3000.  

Its not hard to live on at all, but I have child support payments which eat up over $600 each month, then I have a $700 rent, so right off the top im out 1300 every month.  

Thats without food, cigarettes, electric, anything.  That only leaves me with 1000 if im lucky.  I know the money is there to save, i'm not allocating it appropriately.

I havent driven in over 3 years because of the choices I made in the past, and im now suffering the effects of that.  Driving is important but not vital, but kind of is.   

My driving record had two tickets I have to take care of, one I did already and it was $400.  Another one is for no insurance and when I went in may he told me I have until the end of september to have insurance.

I dont even have a working car! how in the world can I have insurance? I havent driven for 3 years and even without those tickets I still owe the DMW 1400, not including registration and other things to make the car I have now work.  Were looking at an easy 3 to 4k just to drive again! 

Not only that, all this over a 2 day lapses in insurance.... Not even kidding, 3 years without driving and $4000 for not having insurance.  

Just how am I supposed to pay this? ive contacted every state local and federal departments like dotd and state police trying to get it lowered.  I even contacted my congressmen.  

It seems I wont be driving for at least 10 years if I dont get some kind of budget plan together.

or if all paid the same day, the max is 850, plus $25 per cancellation.

The only help ive received was the dmv telling me I could pay it one at a time..... oh thanks......

I live in a very shitty neighborhood, I cant even see my son cause I cant drive and the baby momma wont bring him.  I cant live any cheaper, this is as bad as it gets.  I cant sleep in my car cause I dont think work would be cool with that.

I was homeless when all this started, no car, in freezing temperatures.  Im not afraid to sleep in the car at all, infact, I would have loved that before.  I just cant right now.

So what options do I have?

I dont smoke a pack a day, probably a pack every 3 days, so if I bought cartons I could spend a little less, other than that though, I dont drink or go out, I pay a phone bill sometimes and internet sometimes... literally thats it.

I've lived in my house for approximately 1 year.  I have a 30 year conventional loan with Freedom Mortgage at 4.25%.  Today, I received a letter (from Freedom) claiming I was eligible for a free (no closing costs...no fees..no appraisal fee etc) refinance to 3.99% or current market rate.  All other terms would remain the same, including length of mortgage.

While I'm aware of HAARP, my situation doesn't qualify for HAARP.  My BS meter is, of course, very high.  What's in it for the mortgage company?

...I did a quick google search and did find others (not necessarily Freedom mortgages) who claimed this was legit, and was part of a government plan that rewards mortgage companies for reducing interest rates (maybe a part of HAARP I was unaware of).

At the end of the day, this will only save me approximately $85 a month...but...hey...$85 a month.

...any thoughts on this being legit?  Fine print I'm not noticing?  Scam (to be clear, though, this letter is definitely from Freedom with Freedom phone numbers/addresses)?

personalfinance,"Insight wanted on house purchase, savings rate, and city vs suburbs","Hi there! I'm hoping to get some insights on a big life decision. :) 

Some background about us: 
My wife and I are 30 and 27, live in Seattle, and are planning to have our first child in about a year. We will definitely have two children and would consider a third, depending on finances and how crazy it is. We rent in the city now, and are looking at buying our first house in a residential neighborhood of the city. More details:

* Combined gross income is about $186k. We are planning to put 20% down: about half currently in cash, the rest in taxable accounts. Total assets are about $580k (cash, taxable investments, and retirement accounts). We have been looking at spending $800~850k, although I'm not excited about it since it's not as comfortable as our current rent (nearly twice as much, including PITI and 1% for maintenance).

* We have been looking in residential, family-friendly neighborhoods of the city near my wife's work, and these all have good public schools.
* Wife's job is secure and will receive COL increases, but that's about it. She loves it, although we have considered her staying home to watch the kids in the future. Not currently the plan, and not really an option with a mortgage like that.
 * Wife's job would be a 20 minute bike ride or bus ride away, and she can ride the bus for free.
* My job is secure and should expect another ~$30k increase in salary over the next 3-5 years, depending on promotion rate. Not sure after that.
 * I currently like my job a lot and see a good future there. 
 * It's a 40~45 minute bus ride (also free for me) to the suburbs + 15~20 minutes of walking. I do a similar commute now, which is fine now and pretty consistent, but I recognize that it takes up a lot of free time that will be precious when we have kids.
 * An alternative to the bus is to bike to work on bike paths for 14~20 miles. With an electric bike, I think this distance would be reasonable to do at least one way on a regular basis. 
* The houses we are looking at are big enough that we shouldn't need to move for lack of space. Although cheaper townhouses are tempting, I know the transaction costs of selling a house and moving are very high, so I think it is best to just buy once and not need to move. 
* For those not familiar with the Seattle market, it is extremely hot. Houses regularly sell for 10-15% over asking. The market has also been appreciating at ~11% per year for the past several years. I've done a lot of research and don't think this is a bubble. I am of the mindset that this will continue to be hot due to Bay Area companies expanding their presence here.
* We also currently have a bad landlord situation, so we are ready to own instead. The wife is definitely ready to live in a place that is ""ours"", especially with impending children.
* We love Seattle and want to be here for the foreseeable future, even though it's a HCOL area. So please don't tell us to move to the Midwest. :)
 
**Things I could use some insight into:**

* I don't have a lot of aspiration to retire early right now, but I do value the flexibility and freedom of financial independence, and I have been working toward that. We had been putting my wife's entire paycheck into savings for a down payment, as well as maxing out my 401k, both Roth IRAs, and HSA. I guess I am concerned that once we add childcare to the mix along with all the costs associated with a owning house, that our savings rate will be much lower (currently ~50%, or ~28% not including saving for our down payment). **Am I worrying too much about saving?** I guess I have this thought that I should be able to retire way early, even though I don't have a strong desire to so far. We could also put more money down to reduce our monthly cost, but it feels like a step backwards for financial independence (not sure that's the best way to think about it, but it does feel that way).

* We've struggled a lot with knowing our ""limit"" for how much we want to spend. Originally it was 750k, then it creeped up to 800k once we saw what the Seattle market is like, currently is 825k, and now we're wondering if we need to go beyond that to get a place we'll be happy with for the foreseeable future. **Where do you draw the line?** Obviously budgeting is a big part of this, but I struggle with that because I have always lived far below my means that I don't know if my budgets are realistic.

* The suburbs are an option, but we don't feel ready to live there yet. Our friends all live in the city, and we enjoy the energy of it all. I'm not sure if we will feel differently in a few years once kiddos exist, and it would suck to want to sell after a few years. **How did you decide about city vs suburbs? Am I going to regret living in (a surburb-y area of) the city in a few years?** Once our first kid is born, could our values drastically change where we feel like we want to live in the stereotypical suburbs?

* What are the thoughts on getting a townhouse for less money (perhaps $700k) with the knowledge that we may very well want to move to a bigger place or different location in &lt;5 years? We could in theory rent it out for a while to spread the transaction costs across a longer period of time. But interest rates may also be significantly higher by then, deterring us from moving...

personalfinance,"Fedloan $8,499 debt really stressing me out thinking forward, what can I do?","For all that are here reading this let me start off by saying thank you. I appreciate what you are doing.
Alright where do I even begin? Let me give you guys a backround,  so I am 21 years old and I recently have been the happiest I have even been in my entire life.  So it all started in Fall of 2013, you know I did good, A's and B's had a solid 3.X GPA. But even then I was deteriorating, you know, I kept on smoking weed, hanging out with the wrong kind of people and I didn't have a job. It was... A bad point in my life. Spring 2014 I ****ed up bad. Four F's, I didn't even drop my classes. I just... kinda... stopped attending them... I really messed up big time. My GPA dropped to a 1.5X and my credits attempted where to much for me to have financial aid. So here I was, stuck. No job, no education and some debt from this failure at a community college.  
  
That's when I applied to a retail position, to try and get some money to pay for my classes my self and try to get my financial aid back. Working at this retail position I actually fell in love with this girl who is now the love of my life.  Like seriously dating this girl has changed the person who I am today. I have, you know, I don't do drugs anymore, I have cut off all the negitive people from my life that I used to smoke and party with. And for once in my life I can say I'm happy. I then quit and found a decent job which I worked for a year which landed me this position I am in now working in the financial industry. I am grinding my ass off trying to work my way up the chain and even now I'm trying so hard to land a specific job that will really get my foot in the door with good pay. Meanwhile I was going back to school but I was honestly not work it, my GPA and credits attempted where so bad that I just recently decided not to go back.  
  
So guys I need some advice because I'm stuck in a pickle. I want to marry this girl, I want to spend the rest of my life with her and I know she wants this just as much as I do. I bought a ring, a beautiful diamond infact. Shout out to my local jeweller, gave me a deal of a life time $3,500 USD with tax and everything included for a 1 carat tiffany diamond. I think our marriage will be sometime next year, my parents will help me with that. So I currently paid $1,500 USD down and I talked with him and they have a 6 month period for me to pay for it off. So that left me with $1,400 in my bank account. I planned a trip with her in October so I need around $700 for that. So for the ring I was thinking doing $500 a month just so I can pay it off quicker. I also have braces on for which I'm paying $170 a month and should have them off by next year this time and be done paying for them.  
  
My concern is this $8,499 worth of debt from school, is there anyway I can lower this amount? I do not want to pay back this money. This has really set me back, thinking about how I have to set nearly 10K aside just to pay for this? You know after we get married she wants to move out and buy a house and thinking about resource allocation for everything that I could do with nearly 10k for the next 5 years I really don't want to pay back this money, is there anyway I can come to an agreement and payback maybe half of the amount I owe or maybe even less?",finance,1470970951
personalfinance,Assistance with budgeting and leftover money.,"Good evening PF, 

I recently graduated college and will begin my career at the end of august. I going to be receiving $4,115.38 per payday and I will be contributing $692.31 each paycheck to my 401k to max out the yearly contributions. After taxes and 401k I believe my paychecks to come out to around $2,600. I have budgeted most of my expenses including rent, car payment, food, and other bills. I will be investing about $500 per month into low risk investments to help my leftover money grow.  

My question is with the extra money that I have left over should I be keeping it in my savings account so that I can keep it in a liquid state or dump the rest into my existing investment accounts or choose another retirement account to contribute to?

In the upcoming future (3-4 years) I would like to purchase a new sports car and I am assuming my salary will continue to rise each year as long as I can reach my performance goals and my division does well enough to get the year end bonuses. So how should I go about purchasing it? Should I save as much as I can to pay it down in cash or should I finance the car if I can get it at a lower interest rate than my investments are making?

personalfinance,Going through my worst financial nightmare - need surgery AND a new car,"So literally an absolute nightmare is happening in my life right now. Just found out yesterday that I need surgery (gallbladder removed) and on my way home from work my car started doing the notorious death knock. It's a 2001 Hyundai Elantra, paid for. The problem is, I have hardly any cash. I've been aggressively paying down my credit card debt, and I have sacrificed a proper emergency fund as a result. I was planning to buy a car in about 6 months, but of course fate had to fuck that up. 

Currently, I have about $300 in savings. I can pay about $300/month for a car payment if I go back to minimum payments on my 2 cards. I am getting $1700 in 3 weeks, but I don't have that long to buy a car. I'll be lucky if it runs tomorrow. 

Public transportation is not an option. My job is 30 miles away in a rural area. Luckily, my SO and I can kind of make carpooling work, but at a huge inconvenience to him, so I have some time. 

Here's my question: do I try to scrape up $1000 and buy a beater, and risk ending up in the same situation again soon,

OR

Do I finance $6k-$7k on a somewhat newer car, deal with the probably shitty interest rate for a while, and then refinance when my credit score improves (as it has been)?",finance,1470974470

Sunday's are set apart for god and my family. Period. But I messed up.... we were short staffed and I needed extra hours so I pitched in on Sunday's before the store opened 4-8am and left just on-time to make it to church at 9. After we hired a few people, I said no more and haven't worked Sunday's since June. It's the principle of the thing you know?

If you can't, we need to reconsider your job here. We won't need you to work Sunday's until next month, so think about it. We need you.""

I have a fairly reliable car right now but with 330,000 miles it's starting to show its wear.

I'm fairly handy when it comes to basic automotive and might be able to find a car which may need some work that someone is selling extremely cheaply for.
Also I feel that having cash in hand will garner more negotiating power than someone who is looking to finance or needs to run to the back for their loan.
Additionally, financing a car will require comprehensive insurance rather than the minimum liability coverage my state requires.

2) All four solar panels together to one battery charger and one battery bank, both inverters fed from same bank.

3) something third?

Six years ago, my father and a mutual friend of ours, a successful real estate agent, came to me with an idea to buy a duplex in the town we all live in. The house is a side by side duplex on a subdivided lot a block from the ocean. They wanted me to be the main name on the mortgage, with the two of them as co-signers,  as well as live in one of the units so it would lower our interest rate as well as allow me to keep an eye on the property. We put enough $ down so the mortgage would be covered by the combined rent income. While Hurricane Sandy did force down prices of the homes in our town, the house is still paid for itself through rent. Eventually, the goal is to knock down and build two homes on the land to be sold as an investment. 

Since I work in a cash industry, I have rarely ever needed credit cards. I have never had more than one at a time I haven't needed it. Currently, I have an American express card that requires me to pay it off in total every month in order to get the reward points. Usually this isn't much of a problem since I have no debt other than what I contribute to the mortgage as well as a car loan (under 4.5k as of now). Recently, with the spending towards our wedding, I decided that another card that I didn't have to pay off every month could be helpful, especially in the lean winter times when tips go down. However, every time I applied for a credit card, I would get denied. Even my bank, whom I have over 40k in cash with, denies me saying my credit to debt ratio is too high. 

I ran my credit recently and it says that I have a credit to debt ratio of 88%, which I understand to be entirety too high. How do I fix this? How do I show that I have income from the house that pays for more than 50% of the monthly mortgage payments?

My plan was to lease it knowing that I'll be way over the yearly mileage limits and at the end of the lease, finance the rest of the car.

In my case, I made a large payment and only later realized the majority of the payment went towards the 3.8% loan.

personalfinance,Should I take out unsubsidized federal student loans if I don't HAVE to?,"Hello pf, I start college soon and from the estimates I've made so far my scholarships and grants pay for enough my tuition, housing, and insurance for this semester to leave ~2000 dollars left to loans and cash. 

My financial package for this semester offers:

$1750 federal subsidized loan 

$1000 federal unsubsidized loan

both with interest rates of 3.76% according to [this link](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#interest-rates) at least 

I currently have 3000 in the bank, and if everything goes smoothly over the next week I will have 4000 saved up. 

Currently I was thinking that I would take out the full subsidized loan because the interest is paid while I'm in school and the amount is relatively little and pay for the rest in my cash. I will also have to pay for books this semester, however I estimate my book cost will only be about 150-200 dollars at most if I can't find any free options online. This leaves me with about 300-500 dollars of expenses to pay for out of pocket for this semester out of my 3000-4000 I have in the bank. 

I was wondering, however, what pf would think of also taking out the 1000 unsub loan as well since it is a very low interest rate and would help keep me flexible in case shit hits the fan throughout the semester, as I will have money in the bank if I need it. My dad has agreed to pay for my food costs, as I will be doing my own cooking, but that could change and I like knowing that I have a cushion in the bank. Also this is my first semester in college, so I have no idea what other unforeseen expenses I may have to pay for. 

tl;dr should I take out unsubsidized federal loans at 3.76% interest and keep my cash in the bank, or should I just dip into my savings and pay for it out of pocket?

personalfinance,"Debt - Pay off Car Loan, Put Towards Student Loans Or Only Take What I Need (US)","I am aware that it is typical to pay off the higher interest loans first however I'm curious about my exactly situation if anyone is willing to chime in with their two cents!  
&amp;nbsp;  
I am still in school and graduating May of 2017 with the possibility of continuing on to pursue a PhD. Currently my loans are in deferral as an active student however they are accruing interest. I still make monthly payments and have one other source of debt which is a fairly new car loan. I have been awarded more loans than I need for the upcoming school year and I am wondering what my best course of option is. Below is a layout of my debt followed by specific options I have thought of and some questions. I have not included any income information as I feel that I have everything set up as it should be and am doing my best to save every extra cent and put it towards my debit.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Car Loan**  
* Current Amount Due $~21,000  
* Interest is 1.4%  
* 4 Year Loan  
* Bill is $350 a month  
* Paying $375 a month  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Student Loans**  
* $20,000 Private Student Loan (4.74%)  
* $3,703.86 Direct Unsub Stafford Loan (6.8%)  
* $7,786.35 Direct Unsub Stafford Loan (6.8%)  
* $8,253.30 Direct Unsub Stafford Loan (6.8%)  
* $2,855.61 Federal Unsub Stafford Loan (6.8%)  
* $933.21 Federal Unsub Stafford Loan (6.8%)  
&amp;nbsp;  
I have been paying roughly $150 a month towards these loans and have recently been able to reorganize things to bring this up to $300 a month. I kind of tend towards the avalanche method of debt payment. Progress feels rewarding to me. I will also be working at my University this year which will yield about $3,500 extra income by the end of the year, all of which will go towards my debit.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Tuition for the full year is going to cost me about $15,500**  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Here are my loan options for the upcoming school year:**  
* $20,500 Ford Federal Unsubsidized Loan (Full Year)  
* $13,626 Ford Federal Grad Plus Loan (Full Year)  
* As an extra bonus, in the 2017 calendar year I will get another $6,000 check from work to put towards tuition which will also go towards my debt.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Here are some options that I've got floating around in my head and I guess they are kind of my questions at the same time.**  
* I obviously don't need to take out more than I need for my school loans. Would it be beneficial to take out more than I need to pay off loans that I already have?  
* Would it possibly be a good idea to pay off my car loan super quick to free up that extra outgoing cash every month to put towards my college debt? Between the extra money from my school loans and the money I will get from work I could pay off my car loan by the end of the 2017 Spring semester (May).  
* I love these smaller loans and have really been able to hack away at them. At any point in time should I consider debt consolidation? Perhaps once I am able to get anything under $8K paid off?  
* I'm nervous about finishing school and having my loan payments jump up to $1,000 a month.  
* Is there anything else I'm missing/should consider? I work full-time and I'm living at home and spending as little as possible and looking for every opportunity to try and pay off my college debt. Hopefully once I have my Masters I will be able to ask for another raise in May 2017.",finance,1471032148
personalfinance,Want to ask for rent reduction due to disruptive but necessary repairs. How much is appropriate?,"***NOTE: I am not asking about the legal aspect of reductions in rent. I have reason to believe my property management company would be receptive to this agreement, and I don't want to ask too high (or too low).***

I live in the English basement of a rowhouse, which is almost its own little apartment (though I share the lease and use of common areas upstairs with my roommates). A few months ago, I began having severe problems with flooding in the back (sunken) half of the apartment, particularly my laundry room and the adjacent second bedroom. This isn't the bedroom I use; I use it as a study and guest room. I have documented in writing, photos, and videos all of these problems and communicated with my property manager, and although my requests were not ignored, they were not taken as seriously as they should have been. This left me in the position of having to completely evacuate an entire room in my already-cramped apartment *every time* it started raining, dealing with up to 2 inches of standing water, handling property damage, etc. 

Recently, I was told ""the problem is fixed"" (it wasn't; it had flooded a few days before) but that they were very sorry and would cover any property damage and deduct it from next month's rent. I was happy about this, but again, the problem was not fixed. 

Finally, the *owner* (not property manager) got so fed up that he pressed the company to send a contractor and actually deal with it. They came by and did a thorough exploration of the problem. 

Fortunately, they figured it out! Unfortunately, we learned that the water is coming in not only because of cracks near the doors/windows but because the sump pump is not doing anything and the groundwater is seeping out of the bottom of the walls. The damage is bad and they will basically need to rip out the whole room and completely re-construct it. I have to totally empty that room and find places in my tiny apartment to store the (large) furniture that usually lives in that room. A room that my rent pays for will be totally unusable. This room served as a guest room and I actually will have family in town that now doesn't have a place to sleep. And, worst, due to the nature of the repairs, I will have to put up with several weeks of daily construction beginning every morning -- meaning my (again, SMALL) apartment will be full of contractors as I'm trying to shower and get ready for work. 

I'm happy that they are finally addressing the problem, but due to how poorly they have handled the situation (it should not have taken 3 months of constant flooding and overwhelming stress every time I was out of town to figure out the problem), I have reason to believe I would be granted a request for reduction in rent. 

My question is: How much is appropriate to ask in this kind of situation? 

**TL;DR:** Basement apartment I live in floods significantly whenever it rains and has for several months. I have kept property managers aware of the problem and was ignored, told that the problem was my fault, or provided with inadequate solutions and told that the problem was over. A few days ago, contractors discovered that this is a serious issue requiring full renovation of a room, which I will have to totally move my things out of for 1-3 weeks. I think my landlord will give me a reduction in rent due to the massive and prolonged inconvenience. What's an okay amount to ask for?",finance,1471032469

This is not a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your office provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you.
Please provide me with the following:
•	What the money you say I owe is for;
•	Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe;
•	Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe;
•	Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable;

•	Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account;
•	Show me that you are licensed to collect in my state; and
•	Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent.

Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you for the following:
•	Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act
•	Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
•	Defamation of Character
If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist.
Also during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel. This includes any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate when in fact there is no provided proof that it is.
If your offices fail to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to me immediately.
I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your offices to my home or to my place of employment.

personalfinance,Would it be an intelligent decision to sell my house based on the dynamic conditions in my post.,"Hi Everyone. I'm going to try and make this short and sweet and you guys let me know what you think. 

I make 70k a year.

I've been living in my home for only two and a half years on an assumable mortgage with an interest rate of 3.625%. I owe about 103k and I paid 136k for the house. Because this was an assumable mortgage I also inherited the previous owners MIP payments and the mortgage company requires you to both have 20% equity as well as be 5 years into your loan to get those payments removed. I will not be able to remove the MIP payments until 06/24/2018, and those charges are roughly 49 a month. 

I live in a city, and work in a different one. In the city I work I pay 2% of my income, and in the city I live I pay 1.5%. I get half of one of those back as a tax credit, but I am not sure which one. In the city I live there's also a school levy that equals 1% of my pay.

My thoughts are that if I were to move back to where I grew up which is considered a township I could save on the following:

-No MIP payment (49 a month)

-No city tax where I live(1.5%)**Remember its not exactly 1.5% since I get a discount for having to pay tax where I work.

-No school levy tax(1%)

-Potentially lower interest rate on the home(heard this morning they are as low as 2.9%)

When I first moved here this was not as much of a factor because I was making like 55k a year. Just a few months ago I got a nice promotion and now I feel like I'm getting rekt in taxes. I'm also going to be the next in line for another promotion in my group so I could potentially see another 7k in salary growth over the next 2 years.",finance,1471035890
finance,Reporting Sharpe in a Dollar Neutral Portfolio,"Can someone explain this? I'm having a difficult time wrapping my head around it. 

&gt;There is one subtlety that often confounds even seasoned portfolio managers when they calculate Sharpe ratios: should we or shouldn’t we subtract the risk-free rate from the returns of a dollar-neutral portfolio? The answer is no. A dollar-neutral portfolio is self financing, meaning the cash you get from selling short pays for the purchase of the long securities, so the financing cost (due to the spread between the credit and debit interest rates) is small and can be neglected for many backtesting purposes. Meanwhile, the mar- gin balance you have to maintain earns a credit interest close to the risk-free rate rF. So let’s say the strategy return (the portfolio return minus the contribution from the credit interest) is R, and the risk- free rate is rF. Then the excess return used in calculating the Sharpe ratio is R + rF – rF = R. So, essentially, you can ignore the risk-free rate in the whole calculation and just focus on the returns due to your stock positions.  

&gt;Similarly, if you have a long-only day-trading strategy that does not hold positions overnight, you again have no need to subtract the risk-free rate from the strategy return in order to obtain the excess returns, since you do not have financing costs in this case, either. In general, you need to subtract the risk-free rate from your strategy returns in calculating the Sharpe ratio only if your strategy incurs financing cost.  

________

Edit: I emailed the author and he was kind enough to explain

&gt;Sharpe ratio requires excess return as input. Excess return means raw return minus the funding (interest) cost. For e.g. if you have long $1M IBM, you need to pay interest on that $1M. (Another way to think of this is that your $1M cash could have been generating the same interest if you don't use it for buying IBM.) So the excess return of your $1M IBM is the raw return of IBM minus the interest cost. However, a dollar neutral position is self-financing: the cash earned from the short side is used to purchase the long side. Hence there is no funding cost, and there is no reason to deduct that in computing excess returns. You are generating returns out of thin air, and not incurring any real interest or opportunity cost in holding position. Anyway, with interest rate effectively 0 these days, such distinction hardly matters.",finance,1471037497
personalfinance,"[AL] Single mom, looking to buy home, wondering about USDA and timing.","I am a single mom with two kids. I have done some preliminary research and it seems I qualify for a USDA mortgage. I wanted to leave my information here and see if you guys think this is the right time to buy, whether there are any other programs that could help me, or whether I'm better off renting until I'm in better financial shape. 



My credit is fair, but I know it will get a big jump in January when my only late credit card payments (from divorce) fall off my report (per Credit Karma, these are a major factor in keeping my score down... I know not entirely reliable, but my report is otherwise pretty clean). I have heard, but have not done any research, that interest rates may be rising soon. So I am wondering if I'm better off waiting until my score goes up in January to apply but risk higher (or maybe not) interest rates, or if that will even matter with a USDA loan. I have also read that USDA loans can take several months to process, do they go by your credit score and interest rates at the time of application or at finalization?



The houses I am looking at appear to give me a mortgage estimate somewhere $100-200 per month cheaper than my rent, and would be in a much better school district.



INCOME     $35,500 with 5% annual raises

CHILD SUPPORT     ordered to be $700/month, but getting $0

RENT     $750 and will definitely go up $50 in May

DEBT     $41k in student loans, $0 payments on IBR, but paying $50 anyway, plan to go Public Service Forgiveness

FICO     689 per My Fico

EXP&amp;TRANS     ~670 per Credit Karma

SAVINGS     ~$6000




I know ideally I would save more money first, but if USDA is made for people who can't afford a down payment it seems worth it to give this a shot. (It could almost be seen as being ""punished"" for waiting for more savings/income and a higher credit score, since I've read they don't accept applicants who can qualify for affordable conventional mortgages.) Besides, I could probably save more by owning than renting... or at least, just as likely to save the same as I do now (which is not much as a single mother of two with no child support).



I know I'm no poster child for personal finance, but I'm trying to make the best of a situation where I am strapped, and I want my kids in a better school system before I end up paying more in rent and probably paying more for down payment and/or interest by waiting to move. I have sent my pre-qualification paperwork to USDA, but want to know all of my options and make sure I'm setting myself up for success. I'd like to take advantage of these programs if I could. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!

personalfinance,Refinancing an auto loan- lower payment vs shorter term,"My situation is a bit too complicated for my own mathematical abilities. I applied to refinance my truck and I have four options so far. My current loan is $472/mo with 54 months left on the loan. I budget $500/mo towards the loan, which I will continue to do even after the refi. Here are the offers.

4.75%- $392/mo x 65mo ($108/mo extra to principal), or $462/mo x 54mo ($48)

4.24%- $415/mo x 60mo ($85), or $457/mo x 54mo ($43)

As far as the total cost of the loan, 54 months at 4.24% wins at a total of $24,700. I just don't know how to account for extra money towards the principal, so putting over $100 extra every month may very well be worth the higher interest rate and longer term.

My financial situation:

- Stable full time employment (non-profit), 55k/year

- My employer is part of a state retirement system, which means I will be due a substantial pension at retirement

- Wife is also full time stable (different non-profit), 45k/year

- My wife also has a 403B, which her employer matches and she is contributing enough for the match and nothing more at this time

- Our house is a duplex, we generate 6k/year in rents

- Just finished paying off my student loans

- Wife has two years left on her student loans @ 6.8%, $300/month

- No credit card or other revolving debt for either of us

- One year left on my car @ 1.99%, $325/month

- Purchased the house with my wife two years ago, 60k left on the mortgage, 30 years fixed @ 4.35%, $530/month

- 10k in savings for emergencies and saving towards a big vacation with the waifu in the next year or two

- 30k in a 401K from my previous employer. Cannot be rolled over into a 403B (to my knowledge)


My employer does not offer any kind of match on the 403B, but offers all kinds of different investments and companies through the program.


Our first goal is to pay off my wife's student loans. But once that is completed, it seems to me investment will have a greater return than paying off the low interest rates on my car or our house.


My current thought process would be to roll over my 401K into a roth because the money would be easier (no penalties?) to access in the future since I already paid taxes on it, in the event of a dire need. Then contribute anything beyond what I need to pay the bills every month and maintain my savings for emergencies. 


But would that be the best course of action? Am I missing anything?


But I'm hardly an expert. Which is why I've come here.

I recently graduated college and will begin my career at the end of august. I going to be receiving $4,115.38 per payday and I will be contributing $692.31 each paycheck to my 401k to max out the yearly contributions. After taxes and 401k I believe my paychecks to come out to around $2,600. I have budgeted most of my expenses including rent, car payment, food, and other bills. I will be investing about $500 per month into low risk investments to help my leftover money grow.

As requested by a user to be more transparent here is a breakdown of my monthly expenses.

* Rent - $600

* Cell &amp; Car insurance - $200

* Gym - $30
 
* Car payment - $300

* Gas &amp; Food - $400-500 (This expense is going to variable because I will be driving quite a distance for work and I don't know if they are providing a company vehicle yet)

*  Me time - $200

* Investing - $1000

* No debt

* Emergency Fund - $4k


Left over at the end of each month would be around $3k

My question is with the extra money that I have left over should I be keeping it in my savings account so that I can keep it in a liquid state or dump the rest into my existing investment accounts or choose another retirement account (such as an IRA or a Roth IRA) to contribute to?

So how should I go about purchasing it? Should I save as much as I can to pay it down in cash or should I finance the car if I can get it at a lower interest rate than my investments are making?

personalfinance,Interested in hearing opinions/advice on a somewhat unique situation (How does one optimize a mediocre credit score/decent cash flow/very good non-liquid assets position?),"I'll try to give bullet points instead of a life story.

* Due to the typical progression of undergraduate &gt; grad school &gt; 1 year working a low-paying job while looking for a job in my degree field I have mediocre credit (the lowest I've seen in the past few months is 630, the highest 690, most seem to be in the 660 range). Part of my score is from the credit card balance/limit ratio, some is due to one late payment in the past few years, and some due to something that went to collections a few years ago that has been paid off for 3 years now.

* The college life and some financial irresponsibility also mean I have a decent credit card balance (~8k left to pay on 15K limit)

* The time and money spent going to school have paid off and I got a job I love in my degree field 1.5 years ago, so the 2 points above are improving.  I have no problem paying more than the minimum on my credit card.  Not a lot more, but I haven't needed to use the card in a year, and I have plenty left over for savings and enough fun stuff to keep me happy.  As a result, my credit score is improving steadily, but slowly

* I would like to get a small loan (&lt;10K) to make some home improvements before winter.  This is a combination of necessary safety things, comfort things, and things that would add huge value to my house.  Due to the safety aspect of them, I would like to get it done before winter and we start running the furnace a lot again

* Here's where it gets interesting - I own my house outright (no mortgage, and no mortgage history).  Home value has gone up significantly in our area since the house was purchased

* Here's where it gets confusing to me - I'm having a hell of a time getting a loan.  I know my credit score precludes from a lot of loans with decent interest rates, but I thought that having that much equity in my house would help.  Is that not the case?  The first thing I tried was a HELOC or home equity loan through my bank - denied.  I tried SoFi and Avant, and considering they didn't ask anything about my assets, they were also both denied.

So I guess that's my question - What is the best way to leverage the equity in my house to get a relatively small loan?  The only options I can think of trying next

* Just keep hammering away at my credit card (and maybe divert some from savings and fun stuff to make it go faster) until my credit score improves enough to qualify for the HELOC I originally tried for.  This is less than ideal because by my rough estimation is will be mid-next year until my score gets where I think it needs to be.

* Switch my banking to a local credit union, because after searching this r/personalfinance it sounds like they are more willing to work with people on things like this than the gigantic corporate bank I'm currently with.  Plus I've been meaning to switch anyway because it sounds like a better way to go.

personalfinance,Credit Card Balance Transfer,"Two years ago I bought a laptop from the Apple store. I applied for a credit card through them (Barclaycard Visa) and used that card to buy it. 

Due to a couple of emergencies and a job loss, over the last two years this Barclaycard has been maxed out at about $5000. On my last statement, it is warning me that my deferred interest financing promotion will be ending in September. I am currently paying 14.24 interest on current purchases (not the promotional purchase), right now. 

I'm with Mountain America Credit Union as my bank, right now. They have a deal where if I apply for one of their credit cards and do a balance transfer, there will no fees for the transfer and they will pay me 3% of my debt for the tranfser, putting $150 into my account where I can pay off other bills, or use for whatever.

The banker at MACU checked my credit, and said he wouldn't know until I applied, but believed I could increase my credit limit with them (which I am not looking for. I'm wanting to pay off, not purchase more) and get me at about a 10% interest rate.

I've never done a balance transfer before, and I want information before I go into this. The banker, which is their job of course, kept trying to convince me that I'd save money and have a lower monthly. Then kept trying to sell me this balance transfer deal. I told him I'd do my research first and decided on my own.

Is this a good deal? How sure can I be that I will be get a lower annual interest rate than barclaycard? How can I be sure they won't jack up the interest rate a year or two later?

personalfinance,Financing Part Time Masters Degree,"Hi all,

I'm starting a part time masters program at Berkeley this fall and was looking for some advice on paying for it.  

Overview:

 | _
---|---
Cost | 60 - 65k over ~ 20 months (5 trimesters) in tuition and fees
Income | ~100k + 5-10% bonus at stable job/company
Current Expenses | Rent plus food, car insurance, hobbies, and savings - work covers insurance and cell phone - undergrad and car loans paid off
Savings | ~16k cash + ~22k in retirement accounts (focused most of my pay towards undergrad loans)
Age | I turn 26 tomorrow =)


My options for financing everything are:

Federal Direct Loan | _
---|---
Amount | 20.5k
Interest | 5.31% fixed
Disbursement fee | 1.069%

Sallie Mae | _
---|---
Amount | 30k
Interest | 5.75% fixed or 2.5% variable if I pay in school (other payment options here http://imgur.com/a/kWWku)
Disbursement fee | 0%

I didn't bother applying anywhere besides Sallie Mae because everyone else advertised higher minimum interest rates but if anyone has any suggestions I'd greatly appreciate it.

Because of my income I'm pretty sure I don't qualify for any tax credits (I'm not married so filing single).  The only tax benefit I'm aware of is being able to deduct my tuition (the degree is related to my current position) and interest paid on any loans.

So my questions are:

* Fixed or variable?  
Based on a 5 year repayment plan the effective interest rates are about the same accounting for the disbursement fee (according to my back of napkin calculations). So the question is do I go with the ~5.75% fixed or 2.5% variable?

* Federal vs private  
I have 3 trimesters until next fall at about 14.5k each.  I believe by the summer trimesterI can have 15k set aside so that I would need 30k for the first two trimesters.  Do I take 20k federal and 10k private or just 30k private?  Obviously this depends on the question above.

* Saving vs loans  
Is the plan above, to save 14.5k for the summer semester and pay cash a good idea?  Or am I better off just contributing that towards my retirement accounts and taking more in loans (which may involve asking Sallie for more I suppose)?

Anything else I haven't thought of above (I'm sure there is)?

personalfinance,Curiosity about auto loans,"Hi all

I've been wondering something about auto loans.
In my state (NY), there is no penalty for early payment. 
If you put extra money into the loan every month, the subsequent monthly bills come in at lower amounts, as the loan company rebalances the loan and changes your payments such that the loan will still last as long as it was originally supposed to. 

Given this, what's the better strategy on a loan with a low interest rate (&lt;1.5%)?

Large down payment, lower monthly payments from the start
Smaller down payment, and then one large first payment?

Or does it not make much of a difference?

My question is two-fold: does it matter which we do first, and if so, which one should we do first? We probably won't be able to delay buying the car much past December. So, if that's a given, is the benefit of refinancing the loans now worth the hit we'll take to our credit scores in the short run as we try to go out and get a car loan?

personalfinance,how much of a deduction in interest rate makes a student loan refi worth it?,"I have a substantial amount of student loan debt ($91,557),  with a majority at a relatively high interest rate. Here's the breakdown:

**high rate loans (10 years) - ALL FEDERAL**

amt | rate
---|---
$24,587.45|6.55%
$16,088.78|6.55%
$15,587.85|5.59%

amt | rate
---|---
$6,650.36|2.62%
$9,271.19|2.62%

My monthly payments are $862 for the high rate loans, and $95 for the consolidated. I take home $4700/month, and am usually able to throw ~$800-$1000 above the monthly payment at them.


I applied for a refi for $78k from Earnest, since they seemed to have the best rates for me, which would be enough to cover the high rate loans. 

The offer I got ranges from 5.31% ($855/mo, 10 yrs), to  4.82% ($1485/mo, 5 yrs). All rates (current, and refi offer) include the -0.25% for autopay, and are fixed, not interested in variable. I was really hoping for a rate closer to low 4%ish range. My credit score is ~780, and I dont have other debts.

At this point, I am thinking this isnt worth refinancing for. I could probably afford the 5 year payments, but that would leave me very little wiggle room in my budget, and I am hoping to get pregnant some time this year, and would like to save/buy a house etc at some point soonish (I'm 37). I could keep my monthly payments about the same at the 10 year rate but the reduction in interest doesn't really seem worth it for the loss of protection. 

I have been at my job for less than a year. It is fairly stable, and I can imagine staying there for a while, but there isnt that much room for salary increase. If I were to lose this job, due to my location/circumstance, I could have a very difficult time finding something else. 

So my questions are:

1) am i correct in thinking this refi isnt worth it?

2) should i just keep the loans as is, and keep chugging away at putting extra money towards the highest rate loans?

OR

3) apply for a refi again for $30k just to cover the 6.55% loans, and leave the 5.59% and 5.16% loans alone?

Now, here's where I'd like some validation on my method. I'm comparing how much interest I'd save by switching to the 15 year with the lower interest rate vs. staying in the current loan and paying the extra money towards principal. For my current loan analysis, I'm plugging in my outstanding loan amount now, listing the term of the loan as the rest of the loan period (I'm only 4 years into the 30, so 26 years total) with a loan start date of today.  I then plug in the extra payments and look at the amortization schedule. For the 15 year, I'm simply plugging in the numbers with the same total loan amount. When comparing amortization schedules, I'm finding that I'll end up saving a ton in total interest over the course of the loan. I'm also finding that I'll hit the amount spent in closing costs in total interest saving as early as next year. This seems like a no-brainer (I am comfortable making the higher monthly payments,) but I'm wondering if my methods are flawed. Am I doing thinking about this the wrong way? Are the calculations on my current loan off with the method I'm using (versus putting the entire 30 year loan term in and using the backdated start date?) Thanks for any help!",finance,1471188260

I'm a homeowner living in my starter house, which was bought pre-kids, pre-money... Meaning our mortgage is artificially high due to PMI. We've been in the house ~8 years, with one refi to lower our payments &amp; interest rate about 5 yrs ago. Very little equity in the house as a result.

My wife and I agree that it's time to move (we've had two kids, adopted a dog and generally have more stuff than when we moved in here) and have saved a decent amount of money. 

We have more than enough cash for a 20% down payment on the type of house we want and with our credit rating, and payment history I feel pretty good that we'd be able to take advantage of very low interest rates to save $1,000 or more on our monthly mortgage.

PF, I'm hoping you can take a look at my budget/loan/credit card debt and see if I should/can do anything differently to get things paid off quicker...

**My monthly budget looks like this:**

Pay post taxes ~$800 a paycheck
About $1,600 a month (assuming 2 paychecks a month)

Rent $729

Upstart loan payment $80

Wells Fargo cc payment $100

Car payment $100

Gas $80

**My loans:**

My parents were kind enough to pay the bank directly for my car ($10,000 and change). I am paying them back without interest and can lessen or skip monthly payments to them if absolutely necessary. Not ideal but could help.

I have $7,000 in credit card debt sitting on a bank credit card. I checked the last statement and the interest rate is 19.40% variable.

I have an Upstart loan for $3,600 with an interest rate of 10.96%. My monthly payment is about $80, usually including around $32 interest. I am eligible to apply for another loan in November, which I'm considering to see if I get a lower interest rate than my bank (basically some kind of balance transfer from WF to Upstart to decrease the interest percentage).

**Budgeting:**

I would love to keep Netflix but can cancel my Planet Fitness membership. Running outside is free, I just need to do it..! My phone contract is up in September and once I save up money to buy a new phone, I'll be switching over to Straight Talk (~$45/month).

I'm working on sticking to my weekly food budget and cooking meals at home. This is probably the biggest adjustment for me.

My apartment lease is up at the end of March, and I would like to search for something cheaper in rent... but that means I'll have to pay a deposit, moving company, etc, so I'm debating if it would even be worth it to move.

**Other random thoughts:**

I do have a 401k through work and 2% is automatically removed from each paycheck. I have no other form of retirement savings so I'd like to leave that where it is. I pay about $35 a month directly from my paycheck for dental benefits and medical is still through my parents.

I adjusted my W4 withholdings to 1 (from 0) but haven't seen it reflected on a paycheck yet. Per the worksheet I'd be comfortable going up to 2 but I am afraid of owing money at the end of the year - as I really don't have much extra cash for a sudden bill.

personalfinance,"Employer reimburses education, how to pay until then?","I'm looking at returning to school under my employer's education reimbursement program. They will cover 100% of tuition and most associated costs. The caveat is that they will reimburse me at the end of each semester and finally at the completion of the degree. What this means is that I'll essentially have to front the costs. 

I'd like to find the best method of doing this without paying high interest on loans. I've read that many student loans have grace periods that they don't require repayment until 6months or so after graduation. Does interest accrue while you're attending school? OR is it essentially 0% until that 6 month starting line?

A second option is using a 0% interest credit card each semester and paying it off via the reimbursement. This is obviously riskier because if for some reason I don't make the payment at the end of the 0% window, I'll have even higher interest rates.

Lastly, would banks be willing to lend money at an extremely low rate for this as the risk of defaulting/lack of payment is very low?

my credit score is 800+ and most credit cards offer 20-30k credit line when I apply, which would cover a semester or a year of tuition depending on the school. I currently have about 5k in debt at  1.2% that I've been neglecting paying off.",finance,1471195629
personalfinance,Tax Question. What if loan on a car immediately paid off?,"Let me elaborate what exactly I have in mind. (I only  have ever paid for cars in actual cash so I don't know anything beyond that)

Hypothetically:

* Single, with $250,000 in savings
* I go to the Land Rover dealership in NYC (where sales tax is **8.875%**)
* I refuse Land Rover financing and lease
* As far as dealer is concerned - outside financing/I am paying cash - no difference to him
* I negotiate and we settle on a price $118,050 (includes title, delivery etc.)

Now as I see it I have 2 options

* I pay cash from my savings (how btw? write a check?) 
and pay $118,050 x .08875 = $10,480^tax + $118,050 = **$128,530**

* Second option is I go to my bank and take out a loan, bank covers 100% with **2.5%** interest rate for 48 months.

**Finally the question:** 

* The second option with a loan, how much tax could taking the loan slice off the sales tax if I end up paying for the car in ""debt"" which is taxed less than if I bought the car with cash? 

* Are there any repercussions to breaking the 48 month agreement and paying off the whole debt immediately?",finance,1471196804

personalfinance,I haven't filed my taxes in 3 years. I'm scared shitless but I need to figure out how to fix my situation..please help,"So long story short, I was medically discharged from the military in 2012. I was involved in a horrible incident that left me pretty fucked up with PTSD and I literally shut down. I couldn't leave my bedroom let alone give a shit about filing my taxes. I received dumb advice from a family member who I ignorantly trusted that told me I don't have to file taxes if I made less than 15k a year in taxable income.

Fast forward to present day, I'm healthy and actively taking control of my life again. I'm in school and doing great physically and mentally...not so much financially. My main source of income has been military disability that is non-taxable (a total of about 20k a year), however I have worked three very very brief jobs since 2012 (have had issues holding down positions since the incident) which I earned less than 2000 dollars total. I don't have the W-2 forms from the first two jobs and I don't have any clue how to get them. My other income has been school based, a GI Bill BAH stipend that is also nontaxable, as well as the federal pell grant from the past two semesters which I have no idea whether it is taxable or not (it ended up not going towards school, I was able to pocket the cash).

I've read in other threads that people advise that I see a CPA, and I plan to make calls tomorrow. I guess my question is, how fucked am I? I've heard horror stories of people owing tens of thousands...and technically, isn't not filing your income tax a misdemeanor? Could I face jail time? 



UPDATE: I ended up just walking into a local tax office in my town today and found someone who really went to bat for me. She was able to get all of my lost tax info, w-2, etc straight away and told me she will have my 15' tax refunds back by wednesday, the other years in about 2 weeks. The price is about 200 all together, but I will most likely get that much back from my 15' refund anyway...worth every penny for all the stress it lifted off my shoulders (I could have straggled through the process myself, but school starts on Wednesday for me and I want to have this shit off my plate before SHTF) Thanks for all the kind words and sound advice, I love this board!

I currently have 3k on a credit card at 10.9% interest. I'm working on paying it off, but currently I can only put a few hundred towards it every month. This would put me at having it paid off by June assuming nothing happens and with no savings.

I could take out a $1000 loan from my 401(k) to help get a large sum out of the way. The terms of the loan are a $75 origination fee, 4.5% interest, 20.492% APR, 12 months. My monthly payment would be $40.91 per paycheck. I normally contribute $65-$70 per paycheck anyways, and my employer matches it, so that would be easily covered.

My question is, what's the difference between the interest rate and the APR? Do employer contributions continue during the loan? Can I pay it off sooner than 12 months? Would it be wise to?

btc,How to bring 100 Mill. users to bitcoin with demand of 1 Bill. USD for Bitcoin? My proposal: Use Federated 2 way peg sidechain. No code change of btc-core needed. First use-case: Kim Dotcom,"I got infected with the ""sidechain virus"" recently.

So here's my idea:

Kim Dotcom launches his new Megaupload service in Jan. 2017. He wants to bring his complete customer base (100 Mill ppl.) to bitcoin.

Apparently, the idea is to get money for uploads and pay for (priority) downloads per 100kbyte or so.

Clearly, this wouldn't scale for bitcoin today, not even with LN/payment channels. Bitcoin has too little capacity to even open/close payment channels for this many users in 1 year.

So the solution is this:

Kim goes [here](https://www.elementsproject.org/sidechains/creating-your-own.html) and creates his own sidechain"" KimCoin (kmc), that has a 1:1 peg to Bitcoin. The 2 way peg is realized by ""federation"" and has a high tx capacity, maybe 100 times higher than bitcoin.

btc--&gt;kmc: lock btc in certain address that is unlockable by ""10 of 20 multisig"". kmc chain observs btc chain and inlocks the kmc units on kmc chain.

kmc--&gt;btc: burn kmc on sidechain, and 10 trusted ""federers"" see this and unlock your btc via signature on btc chain.

Realization:

* kmc blockchain has much higher capa than btc (ca. 100x)

* miners get download boost tokens as a reward (not redeemable for kmc though)  OR miners do it for free (Kim's own miners) - tbd.

* users fill their account with 10 usd and get the corresponding number of kmc in their account.

* kim must purchase 10 Usd of btc for each such user, i.e. 1 Billion USD in total

* users can prioritize download by paying kmc

* users get kmc for uploading good content

* when dowloading, billing is per 100 kbyte chunk, charged via payment channel opened on top of kimcoin.

* users can cash out kmc either in btc via 2 way peg or directly in fiat for current xrate.

* If 100 mill users cash out via 2 way peg, it would take 1-10 years due to btc capacity. hence using 2way peg, while technically possible, is dis-incentivised via extra tx fee on kimcoin side.

* Instead, users can cash out in fiat, if they want, using current btc xrate (1kmc=1btc)",cryptocurrency,1471224231
personalfinance,"Just found out there's a 529 plan setup for me to help me with college. Problem: I don't really know how a 529 works, and I'm going into senior year.","Hello! The title lays out the gist of it, but there are a couple more details that bear noting. I'm going into senior year of a Mechanical Engineering degree, with a job already waiting for me, salary unknown for now (I've got a year of school left, and both my employer and I are playing things close to the chest). I'm not planning on doing any graduate level education beyond that required to maintain a PE license. 

To date, I have taken out ~45k in student loans, with a substantial jump in required loans this year at about 16k (they cut financial aid). These are a combination of both federal and private loans, with rates between 3% and 13%. Oh yeah, and I start school a week from tomorrow.

personalfinance,How can I continue paying for medical school? Or should I quit?,"I am an international medical student at a US medical school. This means I am not entitled to any financial aid, no FAFSA, no school based aid, and I'm ineligible for most scholarships. I'm currently in my 2nd year. 

My plan was to pay for my schooling with private US bank loans for the first 2-3 years, and then use loans from my home country (which have lower interest) for the remainder of the time. In my first year, I secured a really good interest rate from a US bank with a cosigner of 4.5% variable on a $70K loan, and I mistakenly assumed the rate would be around the same for the next year (notwithstanding changes in prime or LIBOR rates). Nothing has changed in my cosigner's financial situation, but he was rejected from most banks this year and the bank I was with last year is now charging 8% variable on a $67,000 loan. Because of currency devaluation, I cannot get loans from my home country to cover expenses for all 3 remaining years of medical school. The exchange rate will most definitely stabilize to a higher value (depends on oil) by the time I graduate in 3 years, so I don't want to take out too much loans from my home country just yet anyways and have to pay back more at a higher exchange rate later. 

I don't know what to do. It makes me sick to think I'm taking out a huge loan for 8% variable (and it'll most likely go up with fed hikes) - and that's with a shorter repayment period than my previous loan. I'm already $70K in debt from my first year so I can't really quit either. How else would I pay off that debt unless I manage to get a job in Wall Street? 

I'm already in medical school, I did really well my first year. I want to continue. I know I can pay off the loans from medical school fairly easily once I become an attending physician (after 4-5 years of residency where I get paid $50K). However, I wake up in bed, in the middle of the night, every night, because I don't know if I will be able to secure a loan for the next year of my medical studies without another cosigner. Seeing as my cosigner was rejected from most banks this year, even if he was accepted at one bank, it would definitely be at a higher interest rate than 8% variable I have right now. I don't know if I can take a hit like that again. I'm already overwhelmed just thinking about how I'm going to pay the 8% loan from this year. I don't know whether it's stupid of me to even think I can continue on in medical school with this type of risky debt. But I don't think quitting and finding another job is really an option either because I have too much debt already.

I grew up poor so I've been really good about minimizing expenses as much as I can. Last year, I saved 9K off the estimated cost of attendance and returned 4K of the loan when I had that remaining at the end of the year. So I can live below my means and won't mind doing that for the next 6-7 years until all my debts are paid off. 

But with a loan at 8% I don't know if I'll be able to continue in medicine. I don't even know how I'm going to pay for the next year. I don't know if I'll be able to pursue fellowship and become the best in my field or if I'll just have to settle for a specialty that lets me pay off my debts asap. I wanted to be a certain type of doctor that isn't motivated by making money, but rather by exploring the humanity in all of us. With this much debt on my mind, I am turning more and more into a doctor I don't like.

ethereum,Stabler coins,"One interesting set of ideas in the ""stablecoin"" area has to do with systems that do not try to perfectly provide price stability, but which do try to at least marginally improve conditions in this regard over the ""Bitcoin/ether baseline"". Stablecoins targeting perfect dollar parity (or euro parity, CNY parity, SDR parity, or some kind of decentralized CPI parity) have been criticized for (i) relying on a source of outside information on the value of the target in question, and hence either being centralized or being vulnerable to manipulation, (ii) being unable to handle large, sudden and permanent _decreases_ in demand (or generally market shocks), and (iii) being vulnerable to ""speculative attacks"" where attackers short the currency in very large volumes, eventually breaking the peg and profiting from the massive resulting fall in price and. (i) and (iii) are possibly both quite solvable even in the perfect parity setting, and (ii) can be mitigated with high collateral requirements; however, for those who are uncomfortable with the reliability or the capital lockup costs of such models, and for those who _want_ some profit potential but with a risk profile closer to a large company stock than to a cryptocurrency there is an opportunity for a ""coin"" that takes a middle path.

Option 1: **the PoW-based stabler coin**

This is based on the ""bounded difficulty estimator"" technique from [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/11/search-stable-cryptocurrency/), and incorporates a concept of one-way monetary policy. One simple set of rules is as follows:

* Normally, X coins are issued per year (where X may be decreasing according to some schedule)
* If the difficulty grows by more than 2x in some time period (say, six months), then increase the issuance by a factor to compensate for the excess (eg. if difficulty grows by 5x in six months, increase issuance by 2.5x)

To see why this works, let us work through an example. Suppose that the price and difficulty rise suddenly by a factor of 2, and then by another factor of 2. As a result, issuance should increase by 2x. However, this itself depresses price, so the equilibrium would be for issuance to increase by ~1.41x and price by ~1.41x (where difficulty would still increase 2x). You may worry about a cascade effect where increasing issuance leads to runaway growing inflation, but the fact that price expectations decrease if such a cascade starts occurring effectively prevents it from happening in the first place.

While allowing for both steady growth and technological improvement, this algorithm creates a cap on the upside of a cryptocurrency, preventing its price from going ""to the moon"" too quickly as if price rises too far then difficulty will rise too, forcing the compensator to kick in. Now, it might seem like this is a strictly undesirable formula to have: it takes away the upside, but if adoption _decreases_, it does nothing to take away the downside. However, this is not in fact true. The reason is that whereas sudden price rises are due to the expectation of large increases in adoption (it's always expectation, not actual adoption; adoption is predictable in advance far enough that price rises are almost never _directly_ caused by people buying coins for personal use en masse), sudden price _drops_ are quite often due to that expectation being _taken away_. However, if expectations of greatly increased adoption only increase price moderately, then reduced expectations of adoption should also decrease price only moderately.

The above is a fairly strict approach to price control, taking away ~50% of potential gains (and hence hopefully close to ~50% of potential losses). But there is also a more moderate approach:

* X coins are issued per year (where X may be decreasing according to some schedule)
* Every time difficulty hits a new 2**k value for the first time, release an additional Y coins

This may be appealing to some cryptocurrency enthusiasts because it retains the property that it has a fixed supply cap (as the annual issuance schedule can have a finite sum just like bitcoin, and the second issuance component is effectively capped at ~30 * Y if parameters are set appropriately, as the difference between an appropriate initial difficulty and a ""world domination"" scenario is likely well under a factor of a billion). It also works well with a Zcash-style ""delayed founder premine"" scenario as the founders' share can be designed ONLY as a share of the Y component, effectively giving the founders a superlinear interest in the currency succeeding, where if it does not succeed enough to trigger issuance bursts their returns are effectively zero.

Option 2: **the Seignorage Shares-based stabler coin**

Now, suppose that we are doing proof of stake (or an asset on top of _another_ PoW blockchain) and so we do not have access to mining as either a way of measuring price increases or as a distribution model. Suppose that the problem of measuring price in a decentralized way is solved. We can use [Seignorage Shares](https://github.com/rmsams/stablecoins) as a distribution model, but without sticking to any kind of absolute peg. Instead, what we can do is have some number of ""coins"" up for auction evenly across all price levels (ie. there are 10000 coins to be sold for $1.00 worth of shares per coin, 10000 coins to be sold for $1.01 worth of shares per coin, etc), and have a market where coins can be sold back - if all of the coins from $0 to $1.25 have been sold, then there would be an opportunity to sell back 10000 coins at $1.25, 10000 coins at $1.24, etc. Note that this is essentially a revenue-neutral market maker; we can also charge a spread (say, a 0.5% fee on selling coins back to the system for shares) and thereby make the scheme profitable.

This kind of scheme is harder to financially exploit, as (i) it does not try to maintain an absolute peg, instead maintaining a ""pressure"" toward price stability that we can expect to take away roughly ~50% of a cryptocurrency's price volatility, (ii) has a compelling mathematical argument for why it would not ""break"", and (iii) creates a role for speculators who are willing to protect the currency by buying it up on the cheap during an attack and profit from this.

Option 3: **the self-rebalancing portfolio coin**

This approach is inspired by collateralized debt obligations, and tries to get price stability in a different way. Essentially, we break up a volatile asset with prior price P into pieces A and B, where if the asset has a posterior price P', then we target `price(A) = min(P', P / 2)` and `price(B) = max(0, P' - P / 2)`. Essentially, A is the ""bottom slice"" and B is the ""top slice"". We enforce this using the following scheme:

* Every epoch (say, 1 epoch = 1 hour), we record the prior price, P.
* Anyone at any time can convert 1 unit of the underlying asset into 1 A + 1 B, and anyone can convert back.
* At the end of the epoch, suppose that the new price is P', where `price(A) / P' = x` and `price(B) / P' = y` according to the formulas above (where `x + y = 1`). Multiply A-holders' holdings by `x * 2` and B-holders' holdings by `y * 2`. Rinse and repeat.

The last step can be viewed as the protocol automatically making an operation where (i) A and B holders' holdings are settled in terms of the underlying asset (A holders should get `x` and B holders should get `y`), (ii) these holdings of the underlying asset are immediately re-split into A and B, and (iii) those who held A automatically sell their B to those who held B at fair market price and vice versa.

Unless the underlying asset drops by more than a factor of 2 during an epoch, this ensures purchasing power stability for A holders; if we want to convert this into a token with price stability (ie. users don't see changes in the _quantity_ of their holdings), we can create a simple DAO that holds A, and whose shares represent a constant share of its (fluctuating) A holdings. Alternatively, we can _pretend_ to do this, instead baking this functionality into the underlying contract by making the convertibility rate be 1 asset = x A + y B where x and y change as needed; this may actually be simplest to implement, because there is no need to loop through balances and increment all of them proportionately when you can instead just separately store the proportionality constant.

If the underlying asset does drop by more than a factor of 2, then A holders do suffer to some extent, but this is ok; the point was never to provide a perfect guarantee, only an approximate one. The scheme can be generalized to an arbitrary number of tranches tranches; eg. one can even do something like a five-tranche scheme with A = 0-33%, B = 33-67%, C = 67-100%, D = 100-200%, E = 200%+.

IMO it would be interesting to implement some of these on top of ethereum (eg. one can easily make the A/B scheme above on top of ether itself), although it's also important to come up with the tooling to make these systems liquid enough for practical usage, including decentralized exchange dapps, market makers, etc; I'd like to be able to purchase some ""bottom-tranche ether"" and hold it as a stablecoin just as easily as I can move between ether and bitcoin themselves. Coming up with a reasonably trustworthy decentralized oracle is also important; I quite like the recent [proposal by Edmund Edgar](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4xg2v4/an_arbitration_layer_for_ethereum_with_a_hard/) though we should probably try a few different ones.",cryptocurrency,1471265087

There's also the option of a Used car like going on kijiji. But That would require a loan from the bank and that's paying interest.

gaming,"Why do games like to use the ""this place is going to explode!"" cliche?","One thing I never understood. Games like to use an arbitrary time limit for certain parts in the game to make it more ""challenging"". However, if there isn't a single time limit for the rest of the game, then that means the time limit was stuffed in there like a plastic bag filled with chicken parts (Louis CK, by the way). It doesn't add anything else to the game other than to make you rush through one of the stages. That is, the challenge all of a sudden now has to do with how fast you can complete a stage.
I never understood why games have time limits in them, outside of arcade games where you see how many points you can rank up before the time limit runs out. It doesn't add anything challenging or meaningful to the game because it isn't usually part of the standard gameplay. That is, it's (I know I'm using the word again) arbitrary.
Nevertheless, why do games like to have moments where you need to rush to complete a certain part of the game?
Also, there are some games that are built entirely around a time limit, but it means that you'll have to redo the entire game if you fail. Pikmin and Majora's Mask are examples. In which case, I can understand the time limits because it's a core mechanic. However, when it's a game where timing ISN'T important and all of a sudden you get a time limit, then it's a sudden gameplay curveball.",technology,1471270371

personalfinance,"Moving to an expensive city from midwest, recent grad. Is this really as impossible as people say it is?","I'm planning next month moving to the west coast for work in my field. Unfortunately, it's a field that is located almost exclusively in the world's most expensive cities so I don't have the option of staying in the midwest if I want to get my career started.

I have a friend in downtown San Jose who is interested in splitting his apt with me in his spare bedroom, my share of the costs would be $1500/mo including utilities. For what it's worth, the apartment seems really nice. This arrangement can be temporary or long term, he's pretty flexible.

The downside is, the work I do isn't exactly high paying, especially if I'm entry level and going to start work at an associate level. I've had people tell me from the industry that I will not be offered relocation at entry level so will have to be local if I want a good chance. Literally got the line that any resume they get that isn't local is put into a separate pile that is almost never looked at unless the experience (5-10+ years) makes up for it. The upside is SJ/SF has one of the best job markets in the world for my field, and I'm confident in the portfolio work I have done so far. So I feel good about my chances of landing a job.

From my research I can expect to make $48k-$50K salary at this entry level. I have roughly $5K~ saved up in loose cash, and about $5K more in assets. I worked through college and have no debt to my name other than a really cheap $85/mo car payment, which I could pay off at any time if I wanted (my interest rate is so low though that it is hardly worth it).

All of this SOUNDS possible on $50K, but I've never made a salary in my life and never made more than $16K so I'm sure I'm missing something or just don't realize how expensive it really is. Everywhere I've searched online has people saying it's impossible to survive in the bay area under $70K and that worries me. At the same time, I don't have serious debts or financial obligations, and I don't really blow a lot of money on eating out/drinking/etc (I spend about $150-$200/mo on food, maybe up to $250 if I eat out a lot that month). Right now my savings rate is roughly $300-500 after all expenses in Ohio on $15K and it feels reasonably comfortable. So I feel like I'm missing something here, that I'll end up in a situation where I'm accidently finding myself living paycheck to paycheck on what (looks like to me) a decent entry level salary. I'm expecting sticker shock sure, but I'm also wanting to not end up worse off than my current position.

Yes, I have a portfolio with several completed AAA-level projects (two of which won awards from notable entities), so I'm not just some kid who made a pong prototype and was hoping to land a job.

personalfinance,Paying with credit while closing on house?,"To keep things simple, we close on our home in thirty days.  Our lender showed us several interest rate options, and the most appealing to us was 10% down, 30 years fixed, at 3.5% (the lowest interest rate of five options).  We both have near 800 credit scores, we have the 10% saved (most coming from the sale of our first home), and we have most of the closing saved as well.  ""Most"" is the key.  In order to get 3.5% our closing costs are quite substantial.  But, I would rather put as much money possible up front as I can.  A recent mini health scare wiped a bit of our savings that was going to go towards closing away.  But here's my question:

&amp;nbsp;

We can meet the closing costs (including downpayment, escrow, everything) if from **this moment** and up to our close date (exactly 30 days from now) we put *ALL* of our expenses on a credit card.  Currently we have two credit cards with a zero balance and an AMEX card we pay off each month.  Outside of our car payment (which is a goal of ours to pay off next year) and my wife's student loans (she is currently enrolled in PSLF) we don't have any other debts.  If we put all of our expenses: apartment rent (including additional ""break lease"" payment), food, gas, and utilities on credit we'll probably have about $4000 accumulated by close.  October each of us receive an extra paycheck, and since won't have our first mortgage payment until November, we'll have about $8000 to put towards that debt.

&amp;nbsp;

Does this sound like a good idea?  My thinking is, for just one month, we put everything on credit card, it will allow us to have more money in our checking account and meet the closing costs attributed to a 3.5% interest rate.  This will give us a lower monthly payment, a manageable PMI, and of course less interest in the long term.  We plan on living in this house for 10-15 years, and the increase in market value will probably allow us to remove the PMI is 3-4 years.",finance,1471289873

She *does* have areas of her budget I know she could shave off cost, but I'm wary of spooking her by taking too hard a line, so any advice on effective ways to help her realize this would be appreciated too. 

So far, I have sent her these books:

- [Your Money or Your Life: 9 Steps to Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Ind ependence: Revised and Updated for the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143115766/)

- [The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works, Why It Matters, and What You Can Do to Get More of It](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583335080/)

- [The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous &amp; Broke](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594482241/)

Although I haven't read them myself, they come highly recommended here and elsewhere. The willpower one I hope will be helpful to give her some strength to resist impulse buys and quit smoking since that is a pretty big expense for her per month. It's worth noting that she seems willing to try anything and has already started skimming through the books.

The second thing I have done is I have walked her through tracking her expenses for the last 3 months and creating a first draft budget. Here is her current plan:

**INCOME:**

- gross pay $50,000 / yr

- $2676 net pay / mo

- $ 300 child support / mo

- **2976 total**

**EXPENSES:**

- $1175 rent (2 bedroom apartment)

- $ 275 car payment (about 1 year since purchase of a used Nissan Sentra)

- $ 165 insurance (auto / renter)

- $ 183 monthly train pass (to get to work)

- $ 167 FIOS (basic cable / internet / cell)

- $  53 utilities (electric only, payment plan)

- $ 200 childcare (mostly family/friends babysitting)

- $ 200 groceries

- $  35 laundry (basement of her building)

- $  16 subscriptions (Netflix, Pandora One)

- $ 144 cigarettes

- $ 170 going out / coffee on the way to work

- $  50 credit card payments (min due, total debt: $800)

- **2833 total**

**MARGIN: $142**

I know this needs to be tightened further. I am hoping for advice on things I may not have already thought of. I know her credit card debt needs to get paid off as she is paying the minimum now and it will never get paid off that way. She does limit how much she uses her credit card because she has struggled with high debt in the past. I'm not aware of the interest rates on her cards (2 of them) or her car loan at this time.

I am especially worried for her because in January, her student loans (about $60k) will come out of deferment. I don't know what her payment will be yet but it seems like she has no money to pay them and save any money. I'm concerned for her and her daughter.

She has a pretty good job as the manager of a chain restaurant, and she lives in a state where the cost of living is pretty high (mid-atlantic region). Unfortunately moving out of state to somewhere cheaper is not an option due to her child's father.

What can we do?

personalfinance,"New job, want some advice on my benefit options while having school loans to pay.","Hi everyone,

I just started a new job recently and have to choose benefits and lock them in shortly. Basically what I want help deciding is my 401k percent, stock option program, all the while keeping in mind I have loans to pay.

Expenses.

Currently I still live at home and do not pay rent in monetary form. I have about 15k in loans right now, ALL are subsidized federal loans ( I have been paying off just unsubsidized while in school) I have 2 more semesters until I graduate where I will likely have about 20k in subsidized loans in total upon completion. I don't have a car payment: I drive a 2003 Honda with 130k miles which should last awhile, but you never know and this has to be apart of my calculation. I don't drink anymore or go out much at all. Majority of my monthly expenses are food, gas, cell phone, gym, etc. 

Wages, savings, and benefit options.

I'm making 19.50 an hour, which would be about 38k a year assuming I work the preferred 37.5 hours a week ( will most likely be more but I will figure 37.5).  My 401K is 100% match  for 3%, and a 50% match between 3 and 5%. There is a stock program as well. You can set aside money biweekly and every month the company will purchase stock on the last day of the month at a 15% discount on the closing price. ALSO I have a ROTH IRA that I am dedicated to maxing out every year ( when I make my 2016 contribution it will be my 3rd year ).

I have about 12.5k to my name right now. Not much, but I've been paying off those unsubsidized loans for the past three years and will now be making more than I have in the past.


I will tell you what my plan is, and I would like some feedback and help deciding if my idea is okay.

I will defer 5% in my 401k. I will spend every penny I have over 7k on my school loans ( unsubsidized first!) Going into the spring I will think about entering the stock program, as I expect to have under 10k in loans by then. I'm not sure exactly if I will however, as I want to put 5.5k in my IRA at this time. Also I would like to move out soon, even though it's not efficient I'm 26 and have to move out of the nest eventually! 

What are your thoughts. Thanks",finance,1471300039
personalfinance,Too much debt spread across different cards. Should I try to consolidate?,"I've accumulated some debt over the years and currently have:

$17k on a credit line at 6.2%

$1k on a credit card at 13%

$500 on another credit card at 19%

I have nothing in savings right now and was tempted to use my credit line. I would need to get an increase. The limit right now is 18k. My question is that if I managed to get an increase on my credit line should I consolidate the credit card debt into it. It made sense to me as the interest rate on the credit line is lower. Is this a good thing to do? I know I should really be carrying this much debt but I used to have a lot more and have been working to clear it as soon as possible.

personalfinance,Need clarification with closing a Roth IRA and associated tax forms and/or implications.,"So bear with me, because this isn't one of my best financial decisions. 

In fall of 2014, I opened a Roth IRA based on advice from my parents in order to begin saving for retirement. I opened it with Oppenheimer and contributed the maximum allowed for the year when I opened it, $5,500. To be honest, I really didn't know what I was doing, and at the time I thought I would learn more about it and become more involved with it. 


Well, I forgot about it... I goofed. Not going to deny it. I'm chalking it up as a learning experience and hopefully I will grow from the experience.


Anyways, so I left this thing untouched for almost 2 years. The value of the IRA is now at $5,400. Thankfully, it's a hit I can deal with. I've been wanting to get back into and really grow it after I rediscovered it. However, I recently got married and my wife and I have some debts that need to be cleared (student, credit card, etc.). My wife and I have decided that we could really use that money to get us on a better path moving forward in the foreseeable future. 


So I want to close the account and use the majority of the funds to put towards our high interest debt. I know I can redeem that money tax free, because it has been all contributions from when I initially opened it. What I'm not sure about is the possible tax implications associated with the distributions. I'm wondering if I would have to fill out the IRS Form 8606 because I technically am taking distributions from the IRA. However, I don't know how I would go about filling that out for the 2016 tax year. It'll certainly look odd that I'm taking $5,400 out of the IRA when I haven't made any contributions for it for the tax year. Would I fill it out and explain somehow that no contribution have been made since 2014 and that there are no earnings for the account?

I was just wondering if anyone else had any advice for an experience like this and how I might go about handling it. My wife and I do need this money. And I plan on taking the remainder after paying off debts and opening up another IRA once I am more educated in the matter. 


Anything helps. Thank you in advance.",finance,1471302842

personalfinance,Advice on helping parents rental issue (US to Australia),"My parents who were retired recently had to kick out a tenant due to him not paying rent in Australia for 6 months.

He totally messed up the place.  They will need to replace the kitchen, reinstall toilets repaint etc...  mum has already been taking on employment to try to cover the rent they were expecting.  Oh and he also left an old car there that they can't legally remove without a court order.

The bigger issue is that they have owned this place for 11 years and given the economic market and their interest only loan at 4% the place is probably worth 355k AUD, the same as their debt and their purchase price.  

When/if they get a renter they think they will get about $350per week.  This is less then the morgage plus insurance.  Also they recently rang the bank and they lowered them to 4%.

I live in the us.  I sent them about 5k as a gift to help.  

However I would like to figure out if there is more they can do and I can do. 

I live in the US.  I don't want to send them my life liquid saving of about 100k however I would be open to a deal that makes sense.  

When I did the maths of buying a stack in the property it looked like I would be making 3.5% ish a year without accounting costs, usd to aud exchange costs and potentially dollar shifts.  It seems like it would be a risky deal for me with small earnings.

The other thing I've been thinking about is using leverage.  US has a lower rate than AU even for investment properties (typically .5 to 1% higher than home loans). The best I could see was a 3.5% 15 year loan.  I was wondering if it was possible to buy overseas from the us using a loan in the us?  That way I could invest in a stake and possibly lower the interest compared to my parents 4% rate.  Potentially I could take a larger stake or the entire stake from them at a lower interest rate and pay them some sort of royalty or some such arrangement.

SoFi estimated a 4.8% variable rate instead for 5 years. That seems like a sweet deal. At this point should I even hesitate to switch? The consensus in other threads seem to be no.

personalfinance,How to get student loans refinanced.,"Hello reddit. I graduated college in may, with around $29k in federal student loan debt. Fortunately for me, I have a job grossing $44.2k per year. I am paid bi-weekly, and I expect to take home around $1200 every two weeks (not sure yet, as my benefits won't show up on my paycheck until this Thursday, but based on my calculations, I am certain I am within $20 in either direction.) With this in mind, I am looking to get a good value car for myself, as student loans are my only expense so far (parents aren't charging me rent.) 

What I want to ask, is why it is so difficult to find a way to get my loans refinanced. Here are my four loans (with balances updated as of today):

1-01 Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
Balance: $6,916.09 Interest rate: 6.800% 
1-02 Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
Balance: $8,301.74 Interest rate: 3.860% 
1-03 Direct Loan - Unsubsidized
Balance: $8,127.21 Interest rate: 4.660% 
1-04 Direct Loan - Subsidized
Balance: $5,500.00 Interest rate: 4.290% 

I currently use Mint to manage my finances, and their savings tool suggested some websites to look into loan consolidation/refinancing. However, when going for a quote on their sites, they all turned me down, citing that I do not have enough credit in order to refinance. My credit score is really good for someone my age (720+), and I just want to find a way to bring down that 6.8% loan, and the 4.66% if I can too. My mom says I keep getting stuff in the mail from Discover (that she so helpfully throws out), but when I go to their site, I don't see an easy way to try and refinance my loans.

Bitcoin,Scaling quickly,"Scaling-wise, the Bitcoin Core developers are mainly focused on:

* SegWit, which increases the ""effective"" max block size to 1.8-4 MB (the exact size depends on the distribution of transaction types).
* Lightning, which ""caches"" transactions off-chain to allow for much higher volumes and zero confirmation times.

Both are very good ideas which will probably be essential to Bitcoin's long-term scaling. However, some people seem to be extremely concerned that fees could increase too quickly, and that the above solutions may be too slow in becoming widely useful. As I have [previously mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/49fzfk/so_is_it_lightning_network_or_bust/d0rkba3), there are several options for quick scaling beyond SegWit or Lightning. I will outline a fairly simple one here, which will work on the Bitcoin network as it exists now. For those concerned about this issue, I recommend working on creating something like this.

The idea is to make a federated sidechain with an unlimited block size, and *rely* on a certain amount of centralization within that sidechain to increase efficiency. This is the same way that Blockstream's Liquid sidechain works, which is intended for high-volume settlement between banks.

With federated peg, a fixed set of centralized entities are designated as ""signers"" (aka ""functionaries""). These are the *only* entities which need to run full nodes, so scaling is way easier: just buy super-beefy servers for all of them. Everyone else just needs to download the sidechain block headers, their own transactions, and the needed Merkle branches. Also, confirmations are near-instant because there is no PoW mining, and fees can be very low because there is no block-space scarcity and the cost to signers for processing a transaction is minimal. If the signers are all independent (ie. they won't collude) and in different countries, then this arrangement can be quite secure, and arguably even more decentralized than when lightweight nodes trust the highly-centralized Bitcoin miners. The Tor network works similarly: the entire Tor network is administered by about 6 directory authorities run by independent organizations in separate countries. Obviously, this centralized arrangement would be totally unacceptable for Bitcoin as a whole, but I think that it's reasonable in this context.

Blockstream has a framework for building your own federated 2-way-peg sidechain that will work with today's Bitcoin network: https://www.elementsproject.org/sidechains/creating-your-own.html Take that code, make a few adjustments for high volume (see the end of this post), and run with it. The code/instructions above creates a sidechain with only 1 signer -- for security, you'd want to have multiple signers (maybe 10-20) in a production network. You could copy code from Elements Alpha for this.

From an end-user perspective: Wallets supporting the sidechain would have two separate balances, which can be thought of as ""checking"" and ""savings"". The savings part would be BTC balances exactly as now. The checking part would be BTC in the sidechain. BitPay etc. would show just one address, but would listen for transactions on both the Bitcoin network and the sidechain. Users would periodically move BTC from their savings to checking. Because the checking side is centralized and therefore less secure, I envision people generally never having a balance of more than $1000 or so in their checking balance -- if a transaction is more than a few hundred dollars, it's better to do it on the Bitcoin network directly.

It's like having a high-security Swiss bank account which only allows wire transfers (Bitcoin network) plus a less-secure checking account which has a debit card (sidechain).

Adjustments for higher volume:

* The overlay network would need to be different. It doesn't scale for everyone to broadcast their transactions to everyone else. Senders should just send transactions directly to one or more of the functionaries.
* To fetch your incoming transactions, you'd need to query the functionaries. It'd be nice to do this in some way that doesn't give functionaries a list of all of your addresses. Bloom filters are better than nothing, but it's possible to do even better.
* The functionaries all need beefy servers and low-latency, high-bandwidth connections between each other.

Additionally, it would be possible to add anonymity features to the sidechain (eg. confidential transactions). But I'm thinking here about something that could be done pretty quickly, so that's not essential.

Elements Alpha (already running, though not intended for production use) and Rootstock (apparently soon to be released) are federated sidechains and therefore offer many of these same advantages, but they're not really focused on high volume or close integration with Bitcoin transactions, so I think it'd be better to create a dedicated sidechain for this.

Since much of the code is already written, I think that a dedicated team could probably have this up and running in a month or two.",cryptocurrency,1471326942

personalfinance,Being Haunted By The Fact That I Have Thin Credit History. Please Help.,"Hi all. I recently had my lease application denied, and was ambiguously told that the denial was due to my credit history.

The thing is, I don't exactly have a credit history -- and I suppose this is part of the problem. At 24 years old, I've never used a credit card.

I called the organization (CoreLogic) that reported my credit history to the apartment complex and was told that there are just 2 items on my report:

1) A $105 ""open"" account owed to a collection agency. Long story short: in 2013 I was going to live in an apartment with 1 other roommate. Those plans fell through, but my name was still on the lease. The $105 is apparently owed to a high speed cable/internet company, and I guess my would-be roommate (who ended up living there by himself) never paid it.

2) A private loan of $13,000, which I borrowed in order to pay for my final year of undergrad. I have kept up with my payments every month. (For some reason this loan doesn't show up on my Credit Karma Report, but it was mentioned by the CoreLogic rep, who said that my payments are ""building good momentum"" for my credit score.)

My TransUnion score is 552.

Firstly, is it likely that my credit score is low due to an unpaid debt of just $105? Why is this not outweighed by over a year of consistent payments on my $13,000 loan? Is my score just low because I have next-to-no credit history?

And which one of these issues is likely to have ""scared off"" the apartment people? Am I going to be hurt by this for years to come?

Finally, how do I go about improving my credit score, and how long should I expect to be in the weeds? Should I look into getting a secured credit card -- using it for small purchases, and paying it off every month? I read something about signing on as an ""authorized user,"" so I can share a credit card with someone who has a good credit score (hypothetically, one of my parents)? Would either of these things dramatically help my score?

I am an incoming law student, and I will be taking out federal student loans (approx. $28,000) to pay for cost-of-living expenses. I do not have an income as of today (though I could pay the entire semester's worth of rent payments up front just from the loan $). I am just not seeing how I'm a ""risk,"" when I have 2 items on my entire credit report and the worst that can be said about me is that I (allegedly) owe $105.

I graduated last December and just landed a job with a base salary of $46,929. The problem is that I have appx $45,000 in student debt hanging over my head. This is not an ideal situation. The majority of the debt is owed to the government in the form of several Stafford loans, while appx $6,500 is owed to Discover. Here is a quick breakdown of what I am currently paying each month. 

Rent - $400

Natural Gas - $10 (will increase significantly in the winter)

The loan payments are the minimum required payment, and I have been putting extra in when I can afford it. 

I have been putting 7% of my salary into a company provided 401k program, and the company matches a maximum of 3.5%. I plan on continuing this until my loans payments are significantly reduced, and I can afford to raise that number to 10%.

The company offers a stock option, but I haven't even considered it based upon the amount of debt I currently have. I would like to take advantage of this eventually, but just don't see it as an option at this point in time. 

I have no savings, and I'm sure the fine people of r/personalfinance will tell me that this is a problem. I have been primarily focused on paying off my loans, and have kept putting it on the back burner. 

Questions:
1) Would I benefit more from paying the minimum payments on my loans, and putting the extra cash into savings. Or Should I keep funneling any additional funds into paying off my loans.

2) Should I consider loan consolidation?

3) If consolidation isn't the route to take, should I prioritize my payments and pay more on the discover loan in order to make one less payment?

4) Anything else I haven't mentioned, but you feel should be addressed.

personalfinance,"27, planning to buy our first home in a year. What steps should I take?","/personal finance has been a fantastic resource for me. COming from a family that has a long history of making terrible financial descisions, it has been the advice of this thread that has helped me get my finances in order over the past 2 years. It's for that reason that I'm asking for s ome advice.

A bit about my current financial situation:

I previously had a lot of credit card and student loan debt from college. While I Still carry a lot of this debt, it is all (finally) under manageable payment plans, and current. I opt to pay of my high interest rate balances before lower interest rates. I should have my credit card debt paid off within a few years. My federal student loans are consolidated, and i have a private Sallie Mae loan (side note: fuck them, seriously) that is current and being paid upon. This cannot be consolidated because of its private lending nature.

My credit is not terrible, but it is certainly not good- we're sitting at about 620. Through using various credit monitoring tools, I see that the biggest hits on my credit are in the ""available credit line"" and ""credit used"" area. Which makes sense, honestly.

My SO and I are serious about buying a house within a year or so. What I'd love to know is, what can I be doing to raise my credit score in a situation like this? If I raised my credit line within my various line of credit, would that put the ""available credit"" stats in my favor? Is there a way to right past credit hits, such as tiny outstanding bills that you might've lost track of (I know thats a possibility with relocating a few times)?

What are the tricks of the trade? This is completely new territory for me.",finance,1471360287

personalfinance,Student loan recommendations for returning to graduate school,"Hello everyone,
So here is my situation.  I am looking at going back to graduate school online while I continue to work.  I am unsure if I can/want to pay for all of my schooling upfront.  I have already paid off all of my student loans for my undergrad at the stupid interest rates the federal government has.  

So are my questions:
Are there any loan providers that give lower interest student loans to professionals with a decent credit score (780)?

I would also want to borrow from someone who does not have any penalties for paying off early since I will be using what is left of my GI Bill at first.

personalfinance,Car was totaled. In the market for a new car. Need help making sure I make the best financial decision.,"On Friday I was in a car accident and my car is most likely totaled. The accident was my fault - stupid, stupid mistake. Luckily, no one was hurt and I don't think the other car was even damanged. My car is a 2012 Ford Fiesta SE with 70K miles on it (bought it new in 2012) and had been paid off for about a year, so I don't have a loan to worry about. I'm waiting on USAA to make the final determination (hopefully by today) and to calculate my settlement amount. I looked up my car's value on KBB and Edmunds and the private party value was $6,600-$6,700 between the two. So I'm hoping to not get less than $6,000 for my car to put down on a new (used) car.

I'm currently in a rental until Friday so I need to make a decision by then so that I don't have to renew my rental. Yay emergency fund! I'm looking at the following cars as a replacement:

2013 Toyota Camry SE -  39,841 miles, list price $16,231, KBB $13,332

2014 Toyota Camry SE - 40,509 miles, list price $16,299, KBB $13,966

2015 Toyota Corolla LE - 4,685 miles, list price $16,990, KBB $14,076

There's also a 2015 Toyota Camry SE I'm interested in, but the website doesn't have the miles or price listed. I've emailed the sales lady I met with yesterday to get that information. She knows and understands that I'm waiting on my settlement check from insurance. She was not pushy and did not try to steer me from vehicles I wasn't interested in, which I appreciated. She was impressed that I came in with a spreadsheet of information.

My goal is to put the entire settlement check down on the new (used) car so that I can keep the loan to $8,000 or less. I had planned on having my student loan paid off in 2 years and this is going to put a kink in that plan. But I've calculated that if I can keep my monthly payment to $180 or less, I can still be debt free by summer 2019 - only one year later than planned. I believe a $180 payment would mean a 4 year car loan, but I would have it paid off in less than 3. The lower payment, though, would allow me to still pay off my student loan as quickly as possible and then pay off the car.

I'm currently preapproved with USAA for a max used car loan of $18,750 @ 3.35%. Obviously, I don't plan on borrowing that much. I told the sales lady that I'm interested in their financing options as well so see who can get me the best interest rate. She thinks they can beat it, so we'll see.

I've also gone through the process on USAA's website to see what my car insurance will do. Luckily, I had accident forgiveness coverage so the accident (again, my fault) won't make my rates go up.

Current coverage with the Fiesta is $539.28 6-months. 25/50 Bodily Injury Liability, 25 Property Damage Liability, 25/50 Uninsured Motorist Bodily Injury, 25 Uninsured Motorist Property Damage, $5,000 in medical payments (my insurance deductible $$), $500 comprehensive deductible, $500 collision deduction. No rental reimbursement or towing.

For this same coverage, the coverage on the Corolla will be $571.51; the 2013 Camry will be $609.64; the 2014 Camry will be $605.59; the 2015 Camry will be $602.40. I can afford any of these increases with no problem.

I've also looked at changing my coverage slightly - everything the same but comprehensive and collision deductibles go to $1,000 and adding in towing plus a 20% increase in car replacement if I total another car.

For this coverage, the Corolla will be $531.15; the 2013 Camry will be $563.94; the 2014 Camry will be $559.81; the 2015 Camry will be $556.45. I figured it up that I would break even on the higher deductible after 3.5 years. I'm almost 29 and have never had an auto claim before so I think I'm OK with that.

Basically, what does /r/pf think of these options? I don't want to go any older than a 2012 and the ones I've been able to find have close to 100K miles, which is more than I want in a car purchase. Am I forgetting anything?

For information purposes, I have a salary of $48K plus $4K annual bonus. I have a $36K student loan which is on a 5 year repayment @ 3.28%. After all bills and slight discretionary spending (including student loan minimum of $750) I have an extra $680 a month - $200 goes to a vacation fund and $480 has been going to make an extra student loan payment. By keeping a car payment to $180, I'll still be able to put a good chunk towards my student loan and pay it off by the end of 2018 (original plan had it paid off by June 2018).",finance,1471361882
personalfinance,How to figure out monthly payment on CC,"I am trying to make a budget at the moment and ran into the problem of calculating my monthly payment on a CC.

Let's say I have a outstanding balance of $12,700 on a CC with an interest rate of 11.90%. So .1190 * $12,700 will get me my annual interest rate. Then I was dividing that by 12 to get the monthly interest rate, and I thought that would be my monthly payment, but that wouldn't make sense because all of that would be interest.

So how do you calculate the monthly payment? I know that my bank will end up calculating it for me but since the balance is always changing I would like to stay ahead of the game.

personalfinance,Use HELOC to payoff mortgage sooner?,"I'm looking for advice on whether using a home equity line of credit would be a worthwhile strategy for paying off our mortgage sooner. I've heard of people paying $1000 plus for software that does the math (e.g. Truth in Equity), but I'm looking to DIY-it. Here's my situation:
- Primary mortgage of $68,000, 5.375% interest. Original mortgage was $81,400 started in May 2010. Standard payment is $541, which as of this month translates to $307 applied to interest and $150 to principal. We typically pay an additional $100 per month toward principal. 
- Offered a home equity line of credit through local credit union, 3.99% initial rate, but variable at prime + 1/2%. Variable interest rate is capped at 12% max. Ten year initial term requires interest only payments calculated based on average daily balance. 
- Strategy would be to use the HELOC account as our primary bank account, meaning our paychecks and savings would go directly into this account to bring down the principal amount owed.  We'd payoff our mortgage and then use the HELOC account to continue making the same payments to this account until we have essentially paid ourselves back.

personalfinance,Pro's and con's of taking out a 401k loan to payback student loans,"I really just want to bounce this idea off of some people. I've been doing the math and I think it could be cost efficient. I have multiple DOE loans and so I think I would just target one to start that is the highest interest rate, but is also low enough balance that it could be paid off using the minimum loan amount specified by my plan.

Some parameters objective to my situation:  
1.  401K loan interest is ~2% lower than student loan interest (and the interest goes back to me)  
2.  I would be double taxed on the interest paid (once now, once at retirement as earnings)  
3.  401k loan has one time $50 fee to servicer  
4.  401k loan has annual $25 fee to servicer  
5.  I am generally bearish on the market right now (not concerned with time out of market)  
6.  Even so, the minimum loan amount represents a small portion of my total 401k balance  
7.  I have enough savings to cover the minimum loan amount in savings in the event of job loss.  

  
I know after #7 your first thought might be to use savings to immediately pay off the loan, but I don't have my savings to a level that I'm comfortable using it like that. I would rather keep it separate from this situation. Plus, I'm not completely burdened by my loans, this is more an experiment in cost effectiveness.  
  
Given all that, is the only thing I need to check is that the interest  paid on the student loan over the period that the 401k loan would be repaid is greater than the $50 (+ $25 for every year of 401k repayment) ?",finance,1471370777

I'm starting a new job and hoping to get feedback on my plan retirement savings plan as to whether or not to invest in a roth or traditional. My goal hopefully is to become financially dependent before retirement age, which means I'd potentially rely on my nest egg before the age of 65.

I'm currently 26, single, and just started a new job after graduating grad school (so from Jan 1 - now, I had 0 income). I currently have about 75K saved up for retirement, and of that, about 13K is traditional IRA, the rest is in a ROTH. So currently my portfolio is heavily in my ROTH. My salary is 100K, with a 32K bonus that I will receive by the end of the year. My ROTH IRA is set to max out the 5500 by the end of the year.

I live in Washington, where there is no state income tax. Looking at my prorated salary until December 31st and my bonuses, I am set to make around 70K or so by year end, which puts me in the 25% tax bracket. Next year, assuming I make 100K again, I should make a total of 122K (100K + another yearly bonus I'll receive). At this point, my salary will be too high to contribute fully to the Roth IRA. 

With all that info, I'm considering putting my 18K for my 401K into a traditional IRA for this calendar year. My thinking is that making 70K this year - 18K is 52K. With social security and federal taxes, I think I might drop to the 15% range of 37650 (though I'm not sure how to verify this, I haven't received a paycheck yet). For this to happen, would I need to contribute the 18K by the end of the calendar year (Dec 31) or can I max out my 401K by the end of the tax year (April 15, 2017)?

For the 2017 calendar year, I'm thinking about contributing enough to my traditional 401K to lower me enough so I can contribute fully to my ROTH, and then the rest into my ROTH 401K because even if I contribute fully to my traditional 401K, it doesn't seem like I'll be able to drop my tax bracket at all. 

My assumption is that my salary will continue to rise, though in retirement I don't expect to withdraw this much to support myself. I understand there are also other benefits of ROTH that I'm not fully aware of, so hoping to get feedback on this financial plan.

personalfinance,Need advice re: debt reduction and saving money.,"Hi PF,

Long-time lurker here, first time poster. I was just wondering if I could get a few opinions as to what I should do regarding handling my finances and where to allocate my cashflow.

Ultimately, my goal is to purchase a home sometime in the future. I'm thinking 2-3 years from now but I really don't know if this is possible.

Background information:

I'm employed as a supply teacher. Work is pretty consistent, and last school year I was fortunate enough to land a contract for the entire year. With a full year contract, my pay is $1710 (net), bi-weekly. Obviously, if I'm only supply teaching, my income is far more variable. I also have a part-time job that I generally take home about $250 (net) a month from.

From reading this sub, I certainly understand that money that can be put down toward debt (provided you have a 3-6 month emergency fund) is a good idea. You'll get a better return putting your money toward the debt than you would in most savings accounts right now. I'm just hesitant to throw a lot of money toward my debt because of the variability of my income.

Useful information:

**I have zero CC debt. I pay my balance in full every month.**

Salary: 
Teaching: $1710/month (if I have a contract. I do not have one lined up for this school year, as yet.)
Part-Time Job: $250/month

Expenses:
Rent: $900/month
Utilities: $160/month
Groceries: $160/month
Phone: $60/month
Student LOC Payment: $103/month
Car Loan: $322/month
Car Insurance: $115/month
Misc: $100/month (gym membership, other recurring bills)

Savings:
Checking: $5500
TFSA: $5500
Savings Account: $6000 (0.75% interest; increases to 1.5% if no money withdrawn for 90 days)

Debts:
Student LOC: $8400 @ 4.7%
Car Loan: $14,000 @ 3.29%

Essentially, my main questions are:

1) Should I be more aggressively paying down my debts. I know general consensus on this board is that yes, I should (as I am not going to find a savings account that yields an interest rate equal to the interest I am paying on my debts.) However, I'm nervous to throw too much money toward my debt as my income is highly variable depending on how often I am teaching or if I land a contract.

2) If I should more aggressively pay down my debt, how would you suggest I do so? What should I keep as an emergency fund? Where should I allocate my funds exactly?

Sorry for the newbie post everyone, but all feedback and criticism is more than helpful. I love reading this sub and all insight is appreciated.",finance,1471381625

I'm trying to fill out the NY IT-2104 form and the CT-W4 form. Some background--- single filing status, NYC resident, annual income just south of 200k before taxes. I've already filed my federal W4 and used 0 as my withholding.

Using the worksheet that comes with IT-2104, my calculated withholding comes out to 0. It's asking me to predict a few things which I honestly won't know until tax time (i.e. itemizing or not? IRA contributions?, etc). Any advice of how to go about that or should I just be safe and stick with 0?

For the CT-W4 form, which withholding would make more sense for me? D (Nonresident of CT with substantial other income) or F (Expected annual gross income greater than $15k)? D makes sense because I'm a nonresident, but I don't have ""other income"" besides income from that 1 job I have.. But F fits as well.


Any advice/suggestions appreciated! Thanks!",finance,1471382330

personalfinance,"I received $50,000 in backpay, and I need you to review/advise what I plan on doing!","Ok first off I just want to say that I appreciate everyones input! So here is the deal on how I plan on using it to wipe my slate clean and have a new start on life. I will give a high estimate and close to actual in ($X,XXX) next to the high estimate to give us a better range of cost. I'm a recent college graduate with a a family and we plan on moving to washington state ASAP from South Texas. I was stationed there from 2006-2010 and moved in dec 2011 and miss it like crazy. So back to the #'s.....

==&gt;I plan on paying off my our outstanding debt first of course which is less than $5,000 ($3,500) and I'd like to know if I should pay off what is owed or negotiate a lower lump sum? I dont know if there is a positive to paying old debt for the full amount as opposed to a settled amount. The biggest debt is a little over 1k for breaking the last month of my lease when we moved from washington back down to texas.

==&gt; $5,500 to rent a home in western washington based off looking for houses in our budget and finding one for $1,500/mo but asking first month,last month, and deposit which is unusual so ($3,500)

==&gt; $5,000 cost of the trip for the move. Keeping this at 5k though I know it could be more...

==&gt; $3,000 to pay off my car note ($2,100)

==&gt; $700 light payment

==&gt;$500 for a provisional patent ($350)

==&gt;$2000 down payment on a vehicle

==&gt;$1500 tires for car im paying off and front end work ($1100)

Total Cost: $23,200 -&gt; ($14,900)

I plan on paying off all the debts first and then trying to get a new preapproval on a car loan. Right now with the debt on our name we get at best 9% apr. Do you think this is the right move and how long will it take to get better interest rates after my debts have been paid? 

I plan on investing the rest of the money that is left over, Ive been using robinhood for about 6 months now and have made a 50% return on my investment. Too bad 6 months ago they messed up and only gave me about 2.5K in backpay so i payed bills and only invested $150 :'( I really wanted to buy Tesla it was at $140 a share when I started investing!!!!!

I also have about 5k in student loans but I think im going to let it sit since its really low APR and have that money in the market making money and just make double the monthly payment on the loan. My wife has more like 18k and I plan on doing the same for hers.

When we move we also plan on selling the majority of our stuff to minimize the cost of the move just plan on taking a few big things like couch, 2 dressers, 3 beds, and washer/dryer as the biggest things we are taking. I feel so blessed to finally be on the decline from the hell in my life I raised myself as a kid and life has been tough but I got good degrees for the long term investment and this short term is beyond amazing to help me get my life on track!",finance,1471384594

personalfinance,How much should I offer on a house when the interest rate varies based on the loan amount?,"Hi everyone—first time posting here, and I would really appreciate getting any advice you all might have to offer.

My husband and I are preparing to make an offer on a house (it would be our first). The list price is $139,000 in small town in a rural, economically stagnant part of Maine, and the house has been on the market for about 2 years. The only reason we're able to move to this area that has few job opportunities is that our work is online, and so it makes sense for us to live somewhere cheap since we aren't dependent on the local economy.

Our plan has always been to put down 20% (which avoids mortgage insurance and gets us a better interest rate) and get a 15 year loan. Initially, we planned on offering $117,000 on the house with the expectation that they would counter and we would probably end up getting it for something between $120,000 and $125,000.

Our loan officer has told us that the interest rate on our loan varies depending on the $100,000 marker—the rate goes up if we're below it. Which means that we need to get the house for $125,000 ($100,000 loan after 20%) in order to get 3.25% (at least, that's the rate now and of course could be different once we move forward), and if the loan amount is $96,000 (as it would be after 20% on $120,000), the rate would be 3.75%.

Ultimately, over the course of the loan, those two numbers even out a bit. The final cost of the mortgage at $100,000 at 3.25% over 15 years is $126,480. For $96,000 at 3.75% over 15 years it's $125,664. So that's a difference of $816, plus another $1,000 that we'd pay on the down payment on $125,000. Our loan officer suggested offering $125,000 and asking them to provide credits to cover closing costs, but we aren't sure that kind of option would be on the table since we're making an offer well below asking price. We've considered writing a cover letter to our offer that explains some of this to them, but we aren't sure if it's wise to lay our cards out so soon. Particularly if we're dealing with numbers that are a lot lower than they'd hoped for. But we simply don't know.  

It's perhaps worth mentioning that the family now lives a couple towns over and the home is vacant. Since it's basically the end of the summer season, they aren't likely to receive any other offers this year (their agent mentioned that she's hardly shown the house at all so who knows if they've ever received an offer), and so they would have to heat the place (as well as paying taxes, insurance, etc.) for another winter. 

Any suggestions on how to proceed? Thanks so much in advance.",finance,1471386594

personalfinance,Help Me Understand My Savings Account and Invest.,"This is my first time posting here, I've read a bit off and on though and was recommended to post here with my current situation. I graduated from college with an associates degree in Game Development and a bachelors in Computer Science. I live in the Bay Area so prices and taxes are high but that's not the point. I'm 27 years old and am slightly over two years out of college working as a Software Engineer. I was raised semi-sheltered I guess in the sense that I didn't have to do anything on my own, I had help with everything and kind of goofed around my entire life. This is my first job and don't know much about the ""real world"". I don't fully understand some of the investment options I have, and when explained they usually aren't in simple enough terms for me to grasp the concept of completely which leads me to ignoring them, so any advice put into the ""explain to me like I am 5"" mentality would be greatly appreciated.

I have no debt (that I pay), not many expenses, just my medical bills, food, gas, rent...etc. I probably spend like $2000/month on average. I am very good at saving money and only buying what I need with the occasional splurge on a vacation or fancy gadget. I make $70k/year pre-tax and 8% of that goes into a 401k which is automatically managed. Past that, I don't have any investments and don't quite know what to do. I have over $70k sitting in my bank account. I know I should keep $20-30k of that as an emergency fund but I don't know what to do with the rest of it. I understand the concept that over time it becomes less valuable due to inflation and such, and just keeping it sitting in a savings account is losing me money so what do I do with it? I can't just keep it building here forever. I've spoken to a financial advisor at my bank but as stated in the first paragraph, I didn't really fully understand my options and didn't know what is the best choice for me and never acted upon any of his advice. 

With my monthly expenses and income I would estimate that ~$2k goes into my savings account per month. Since I already have more than enough money as an emergency fund advice would be super appreciated. One quick side-question though is this: My bank gives rewards for having $50k in my account, is it worth it to keep that much or invest it in other things/put it somewhere else? It probably only adds up to a couple hundred dollars a year or should I just keep $20-30k? I'm honestly really scared to do anything with my money but realize I just need to suck it up and do it or else I am basically wasting it :-(.",finance,1471392281
personalfinance,Settling medical collections vs paying them in full,"I have a few old hospital bills collections currently, to the tune of around $2500.

I read an article that says that settling hurts your score, but hurts less when your credit is already bad. Transunion has me sitting at 644 and Equifax at 589. Is settling a good option for me since my credit is already kind of bad?  Or should I take my medicine and pay the $30 a month and my outrageous car loan until I get everything paid off?

personalfinance,Applying for public service loan forgiveness. Should I consolidate all my loans?,"Hi there, r/PF!

I recently finished my graduate program in clinical psychology, and my degree will be conferred at the end of August. My loans then enter a 6-month grace period and I'll start repayment after that. I plan to do income-based repayments (IBR) toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program (after making 120 payments while working at a non-profit, my remaining balance will be forgiven).
 
I have Direct Stafford loans (subsidized and unsubsidized), a Direct Plus loan, FFEL Stafford (subsidized and unsubsidized), and Federal Perkins Loans. Most of the interest rates of my loans range from 5%-6.8%, with the exception of a Direct PLUS loan with an interest rate of 7.9%. I know that I will need to consolidate all of my FFEL and Perkins loans for them to qualify for PSLF. 

**My questions are:**
 
* Should I consolidate ALL of my loans? I called the government's Student Aid office and they said it's up to me whether or not I consolidate the rest of my loans, which wasn't very helpful.
* OR should I pay off one or a few of the smaller loans (for example, I could pay off a loan with a high interest rate. I'm wondering if doing this would reduce my overall balance in the long-run---in particular since I would avoid consolidating a loan with a high interest rate with my other loans with lower interest rates). I could also pay off a smaller loan with a lower interest rate to avoid increasing its interest rate.
* OR would paying off a smaller loan be negligible in the long-run, since the balance will be forgiven after 10 years?
* When should I consolidate my loans? Should I do it now, or would holding off on consolidation reduce the overall balance (since I'd delay averaging the interest rate across all my loans), or is that also negligible?

Thank you so much! I appreciate any insights you might have.",finance,1471396076

My mother currently has $200,000 in debt (small business loan) and we're looking for the best way to handle it. I understand I have no obligation to help her pay this, but I just can't leave it.

1. First priority is our house. (Paid off, no mortgage.) The house is worth more than the debt, but we don't want to have to sell it to pay off the amount. Should my mother remove her name from the deed so it won't be taken? She's consulted with two lawyers so far who've given her a yes and a no.
2. I understand we can negotiate for a lower amount and interest rate. Is there anything we should know/look out for?
3. Refinance/transfer the debt. She doesn't plan on continuing the business after paying back the money owed. Does or how does, this apply?
4. Can we get a mortgage on our house for the amount and pay that back instead? (If that's a cheaper option of course.)
5. Since my father is still working, he's able to help shoulder a portion of it. We're also in the process of finding tenants for our second floor, which should also help with the debt.

personalfinance,Housing pricing sustainability,"Where I'm looking (St. Petersburg, FL) I've noticed the average selling price for a home is higher than it was in 2006 (which was at the top of the bubble) according to Zillow. Last year housing prices have gone up over 11% accordingly and continue to rise. To me this seems very unsustainable and will cause some problems down the road.  Wages haven't increased light years close to what the housing market has.

I just saved up about 50k for a down payment over the last two years but at this point I feel like the houses are over valued (now you get a lot more for your money where I currently live, which is in Tampa but the prices here have still gone up just as much percentage wise).  The average income in St. Pete is about 40k and houses are averaging near 200k (with houses in the demand area rarely selling below 300k).

Basically I have been paying about $350/month in rent but have been commuting over an hour to work each way.  Housing where I work has more than doubled in the past 6 years.  I've even seen some houses bought earlier this year back on the market for an additional 50k or more.

Every one and their cousin swears we aren't getting into another bubble and that St. Pete is just becoming an in demand area.  My realtor was telling me how putting 20% down is a waste because you can just use the money to remodel the house.  He also said that almost no one puts down 20% anymore.  I just feel the no money down and very low interest rates have shot the pricing of housing to ridiculous levels. 

Are we getting into a bubble situation where it's not wise to get in the market?   Or is this just the future of the housing market with the interest rates and lending rules?",finance,1471400883

I currently have no outstanding balance, and I always pay my statement balance in full.

These checks would appear as ""Balance Transfer"" on my account statement and I will have 0% APR for next few months (6, i think). I would like to use those checks for personal use*, say $3000 + $90 fee (3% of $3000) = $3090. Typically, I make it a point to pay off my balance statement in full to keep my credit score above 730. However, I will not be able to pay off this $3090 within one statement period. I plan to pay it off spread over 6 months before the interest starts to kick in.

I called up Citi and asked how this balance would appear on my statement and they said it will appear as ""Balance Transfer"". My question is simple: how will it impact my credit score? Specifically, how will it impact my credit score if I pay off that $3090 spread over 6 months?

personalfinance,(US) Another whole life insurance question...,"A little background info: I'm late 20's, married, own a house, and have a child on the way. Roths have been maxed out each year and have been phased out due to income restrictions. I max my 401k contribution, and have several taxable investment and brokerage accounts. I am not using the insurance policy solely as an investment/savings strategy.

I've always been hesitant of whole life insurance, as I understand the value in choosing term and investing the difference. However, my father in law works for NM and has continually expressed his opinion toward their whole life vehicle. He has setup accounts for all of his children and has his mother funding accounts for all of her grandchildren. He does not take commission on any of this. He does so because he has had whole life since he was a child and has seen the value in it and used the cash value several times for various expenses. He is well off and wants to see all of his kids and grandkids in a similar place later in life.

Long story short, I started an account with him as well based on his feedback and experiences. He has never pressured me into anything, but expressed his opinion on what he thought was best for me given I married his daughter and am family. I've been viewing it as an opportunity to gain insurance while essentially having money slowly gaining cash value at an interest rate similar to a bond while earning company dividends. I don't plan on dying anytime soon and it would be nice to have $1MM+ down the road in this account.

My question is- am I (or him) missing something? All of the whole life insurance comments and feedback are negative. If something is off and he has been misled his whole life, I want to try to convert this to term. However, if the NM vehicle is different and everything he is telling me is true, then I am just looking for some peace of mind since I am not an expert on this.

TLDR: Father in law works for NM and has me and all of his kids and family set up in whole life based on his personal experiences. Based on all the internet experts, this is wrong. What am I, and him, missing, if anything? This is not being used as an invesment/savings vehicle, solely life insurance with the ability to have a future cash value. He is not taking commission but doing so in the best interest of his family.",finance,1471405646

personalfinance,I'm thinking of taking out more in student loans than I need for education related expenses down the road. Is this a bad idea?,"I earned my bachelor's back in 2013 in psychology, and didn't really know what to do next, so I took a break from school.  About a year ago, I found the career path I want to follow.  It's everything I want, and my salary will go from around 30k to 65-80k.  Seems like a solid move.  Buuut I didn't know it was a thing I wanted to do while I finished my undergrad, so I'm missing a few prerequisite classes.  I paid for the first class I needed with an education award I earned through AmeriCorps.  This class confirmed that this was the path I wanted to be on, so I quit my full time job in favor of a part-time position so I could take more classes.  This year, I'm going to need to take out loans for the last four classes I need (spread over 2 semesters).  

I still have 1k of my education award, and I was awarded 12.5k in loans--5.5k is subsidized and the other 7k is unsubsidized.  Both are offered at an interest rate of 3.76%.  Total funds available are then 13.5k.

The school will cost about 3.2k/semester, plus maybe $250/semester for books (science classes...what are you gonna do?).  So total cost will be 6.9k.  

Since I can scrape by on my part time job, and will not need the loans to pay bills, I would normally take out just what I need.  My parents are very supportive and are fairly well off.  If a small emergency came up, they could help me without it being a huge strain (and yes, I understand how incredibly lucky I am).  That being said, my grad program of choice is pretty rare.  It's one of those things where you go where you get in, even if it's in another state.  A cross country move is expensive!  And though my parents are very supportive, it would be too much to ask them to fund this.  I'm thinking that my best move is to take out the extra loan money I was offered, and just tuck it away to fund my move.  If possible, of course I'll throw any extra cash I have at the interest for the subsidized loan.  I think it would be worth it just for the peace of mind that if I get into grad school, I can afford to get there.

So, would this be a terrible, irresponsible decision?  Or is this a reasonable thought?",finance,1471414934

Right now I have about $1000 a month to throw at the debt but I'm looking for any advice and feedback on my plan of attack for clearing this as soon as possible. 

First I've been using balance transfers with introductory interest rates of 0% to keep my credit cards from a building interest. That has worked so far.

Second, I'm looking at cashing out my 457k of $3800 to knock out some of the balance on a high interest rate card. I also have a pension and the 457k was a supplement retirement plan that I opened from advice from my mother. I understand that there's no penalty for withdrawing early but it does become part of my taxable income. I definitely plan to build it back up after clearing debt.

Thank you in advance for any feedback or additional advice. I've been quite bummed out after looking at ways to manage this problem I've created.

personalfinance,Me and my boyfriend were rejected for a personal loan. What should we do to get on the right track?,"My boyfriend has an account. The payoff is around $4300 and the interest is 23.99%. He'd pay around $7000 when all is said and done. He's been making extra payments to get ahead, but I figured I'd help him out by going for a personal loan, so we could pay the account off and pay the loan off at a lower interest rate.

So, last week, we talked with a loan officer. We applied together for the payoff amount in an effort to boost his credit. His credit score was 646, which is actually much higher than what I thought it was. My score is 672 (it was 720 but it took a hit from a vet bill when my dog was sick). She said that we shouldn't have a problem getting approved.

Well, we were turned down because of no prior similar loan history. We've never had personal loans. We only have student loans. I have a credit card and my boyfriend has the 23.99% account.

What do we do now? I'm just a little upset because I would not have applied if I knew we were going to be rejected. Our goal is to apply for a mortgage by the end of next year, but this experience has us gun shy now. Also, I'm not sure how much our credit will take a hit now just from this inquiry.

Where do we go from here?

**EDIT**: We do plan to be married before buying a house. Also, it makes sense for us to buy a home because rent is extremely high in our town in comparison to a mortgage payment (taxes, insurance included).

My boyfriend makes $13.50/hr or around $28k annually. He will be switching jobs soon and will be making more (we don't know the wage yet). This account is his worst debt. The rest are student loans. He's on IBR.

I make $14/hr at 35 hrs/wk or around $25k annually. I look for higher-paying jobs consistently (check the job boards everyday). I have a car loan that was a mistake, but I'm working on it. Besides that, I have student loans (I'm also using IBR and I work at a non-profit so I *may* go the PSLF route, but I haven't decided).",finance,1471444070
personalfinance,"$15,000 raise at 23 - where do I go from here?","Hi r/personalfinance!

So this past Monday I found myself in the very happy position of having unexpectedly received a $15k raise!

I am 23 and a year out of college. I had previously been making $45k/year. I’ve been reading this sub a lot over the last year and with this new raise, I need some advice about the wisest way to use it.  

* 60k income
* 3k in emergency savings
* 7k in checking
* 5k remaining in 3.4% student loans
* Contributing 3% to a 401k with an employer match of 20% of any contributions up to the 18k annual limit. 33% vested.

Current monthly spending is about $1,800 ($1,025 of it going to NYC rent). With this, I expect to have about $1,400 remaining each month after 401k and taxes.

My immediate goal is to pay off the remainder of my student loans this month with the excess balance I have in my checkings and to boost my emergency fund to $5k. This will take me about 2 months. 


After that though, what would you all recommend? I’d like to increase my retirement savings and also dip my toe in the investing pool, but I have some questions about the best decisions there.

With my 401k matching and vesting schedule, I’ll only walk away with $6.66 for every $100 I contribute – is this a good deal? Or would I be better off putting any additional money past the current 3% into a Roth IRA? 

Also, while it’d be awesome to dump all my money into retirement savings now, I’m still young enough where I'd like to keep liquidity (but maybe at an interest rate better than 1%..) Is a brokerage account the right move here?

Sorry for so many questions, but I’d appreciate any insight/recommendations/advice on any of it!",finance,1471445728

personalfinance,29 y.o. single guy wants to buy first condo. Kindly ask for my budget review,"Hello.

I have been reading this sub-reddit for a years now, which has helped me to improve my personal finances quite a lot. It's time for me to ask you for a brief evaluation of my decision to buy apartment.

Initial data:

* 29 y.o., single;
* live in Malmö, Sweden;
* software engineer;
* salary: $3,081 after taxes;
* about $32,000 saved in bank on deposit account;
* about 6,000 in personal pension;
* looking for 2 room apartment for up to $175,000;
* need to pay 15% downpayment to be able to get a mortgage, which is $26,250.

Used loan calculator from my bank with following numbers: loan of $148,750 and $380 operating cost (monthly expense).

Result:
* monthly payment with the current 2% interest rate: $808;
* monthly payment with fixed 3% 10 years interest rate: $896.

Law requires me to repay 50% of my loan (2% a year down to 70% and 1% a year down to 50%); after that it is interest only, so my monthly payment will go down over the time if interest won't go up dramatically.

Monthly expenses:

* food and lunches out: $380
* clothes, beer, etc: $350
* vacation money: $355
* rent: $710
* private pension: $120
* unexpected: $120

**Total:** $2,035

**Left:** $1,046

Additional information:

* my occupation is in the labour shortage list here in Sweden; 
I have got diploma, years of experience and good recommendations, so finding a job won't be an issue;
* have got unemployment insurance, which would pay me $2,370;
* prices have been rising over a significant amount of time (15 years or so), which is bad;
* we have got huge housing shortage in Sweden, which is good.

personalfinance,"If you buy a new car and plan on keeping it until it dies, is it a bad buy still?","Hello All,

In a few months time, I [21M single] will have to buy a car.  Currently drive a 2009 Corolla that my parents let me use which they also pay the insurance for.  At the latest, I will be buying a car May 2017 and will have anywhere between 8-10k saved for a down payment.  If everything goes well in my situation, then early next year (Feb-May), I will be in my career earning 60k/year with guaranteed increases for the next few years. Currently, make a minimum of 800$/month and save more than half of it into a savings and Roth IRA. I try to live below my means with the occasional going out to bars etc.

So, this brings me to the title question:

If you buy a new car and plan on keeping it until it dies, is it a bad buy still?

As much as I enjoy the current corolla I drive, I absolutely love the new 2016 Honda Civics, especially the coupe. I like the sporty look,   fuel economy, and that historically much like Corollas, Hondas are reliable.

 I have a good credit score (750+) with very little debt. If I do go with a new car, I'm budgeting for a cost of 22k OTD cost and through Costco Auto, I think I will be able to swing that price without haggling. The loan I am trying to get would get would be 3 year loan at max 5% interest rate. 

Some goals I want to achieve is that I would like to own a home by my 30s and to continue adding to my Retirement Fund 2060 at Vanguard for my Roth IRA.

I recently started tackling my loans using a hybrid snowball method, starting with almost the lowest balance. My individual loans range from 2,000 to 60,000 with interest ranging from 1.25% to 8.25%.  At first I tried paying on the 60K because it has the highest interest at 8.25%, but I had no momentum. It felt like an impossible mountain to climb. So I started working on the 3K loan which is at 6.55%, and I paid it off! It felt SO GOOD to pay off that loan and see the $0.00 balance. This really motivated me and I'm on my way to paying down the next 4K loan. I'm obsessed with seeing the next $0.00 balance.  I can totally see why the snowball method is recommended by some people even though logically it would make more sense to pay on the 60K loan with 8.25% interest, but this other way feels better and I think I'll end up paying these loans off faster because I'm actually excited about it!! 

I'm practically obsessed with paying off these loans, now. I'm working an extra job moonlighting, and I'm putting all my extra earnings into these student loans.  

If I can keep up this momentum, I think I'll be able to pay off this ungodly sum of money within the next 4 years.

I have been putting all the money I can into a savings account with the plan to pay it down before the introductory rate expired.  Although it doesn't look like I'm going to make it...

Also, now that we are no longer travelling full time, we need a second vehicle for my wife to go to school.. so we are looking for her a car.  We are looking at used vehicles trying to stay under a $6,000 price point.  (Possibly a ~2006 Prius.)

Finally, on top of all this we would really like to purchase a home with some land.  We don't want to get rid of the RV (which has a monthly payment, because we hope to travel again in the future (3-4 years) and the RV is a very rare model that would be very hard to replace.

Imagine a currency backed by a renewable resource, with the benefit of manifesting our basic human needs and the means by which to share it for the progress of mankind.  There is no other than the dog star plant to raise humanities standard of living to one of comfort for all lives.

Cannabis has been a useful plant for humanity since it's discovery several millennia ago, but around the world it was made illegal due to the U.N.’s Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 1961 A.D. (UN). However, people’s attitudes are changing today with Colorado, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington becoming the first states to legalize cannabis for purposes beyond medicine, we are now free to rediscover all the amazing things this plant can do for us and our planet.


As much as the digital age is fast reducing the need for printing many things, paper is very important to a modern economy as it serves as a medium for our currency, contracts, study, and especially artwork. Paper that is typically used in modern times is most often made of wood, along with chemicals not found in nature (Gendell). Needless to say, modern paper making is bad for the environment because it not only removes trees from their ecosystems, but also adds pollutants to the atmosphere by its production. Cannabis has the potential to replace wood, and does not need chemicals to become paper (General). Cannabis also produces more biomass per acre than trees, and in less time than it takes trees to grow. For comparison, one acre of cannabis will produce two crops in a year with the equivalent amount of 4 acres of trees. Cannabis can also be used to make cardboard and even tissue paper; basically every practical industry involving trees could instead be accomplished with cannabis.
 
Cannabis can also be eaten in a number of ways and all parts of the plant can be prepared into a wide variety of meals. It is very common for medical dispensaries to mix the flowering tops of cannabis into sweets because of its medicinal properties, and many of these sweets could pass as just regular food (Ferner). The seeds of the plant can be used to make a bread like substance known as hempseed cake. This cake is very good for whoever consumes it as it is high in many vitamins and minerals such as magnesium and manganese (Hemp Flour). The leaves and stalk of the plant can be prepared into a drink that the Indians call “bhang” (pronounced bong) it’s a very creamy and smooth drink that tastes like water if nothing is added to the original recipe, however one can add chocolate to it for flavor, or cinnamon for flavor and memory enhancing properties. Now you can eat cannabis and drink it too, all the while its good for you, they basically made the best vegetable illegal.

Cannabis has very strong fibers that can be made into products ranging from T-shirts to Hammocks. Cannabis also grows faster than traditional sources of clothing fiber such as cotton; two to three times faster to be exact (General). What this means is that cannabis is a stronger material than what people currently use now and it is also easier to grow more of it. Cannabis could therefore be a solution to clothing the world’s population at a time when many are worrying about overpopulation, and lack of resources.

The parts of the cannabis plant that are not used for fibers are known as hurds which make up about 70% of the plant’s biomass. These hurds can be used for building material when combined with lime (General). The resulting material is called hempcrete; a material which is both self-insulating and fire proof. This material also has a carbon negative action on the atmosphere, which means that it takes CO2 out of the atmosphere and locks it inside the material of the building. On top of this carbon negative benefit of hempcrete is another: reduced energy costs due to its superior insulation properties. One of the biggest contributors to greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is human homes; making homes carbon negative and less dependent on fossil fuels could help turn the clock back when it comes to excess carbon in our atmosphere (Perritano). These buildings are not new, in fact the roman aqueducts in France were made of this same material, and are still standing today even 2000 years after Rome collapsed! This implies that carbon negative action taken now will have positive effects for generations to come. It also implies that if we made public buildings out of this material we could spend less on maintaining them, and less on replacing them.

Finding a sustainable, efficient, and clean energy source has been a very big challenge for people in the 21st Century, but the search may be over as cannabis can also be made into fuel. Biodiesel can be made out of cannabis oils from the seeds and stalk of the plant, while biofuel is made from just the stalks of cannabis (General). As stated earlier cannabis grows much faster than many plants in the world, and it can also be grown all over the world. What this implies is that people would have the ability to generate their own fuel, and in turn the laws of supply and demand would lower gas prices. Not only would gas be cheaper if we produced cannabis fuel, it would create a respiratory like cycle between cars and their fuel. CO2 would be burned and released into the atmosphere and then reabsorbed by cannabis plants ready to be turned into fuel or another product. Henry Ford even demonstrated that a car can be fueled by nothing but cannabis (Henry Ford's). Essentially what cannabis allows humans to do is have a healthy natural relationship with our planet while still enjoying the pleasures of the modern world.

Motor vehicles are a huge part of our economy given that they transport goods and people from place to place, but they are made of materials that must be mined to acquire. Luckily cannabis can be made into a light durable plastic that is ideal for motor vehicles. In fact Canadian scientists have already made one.(Gordon) The Scientists discovered that by using cannabis in the creation of this car that less fuels are needed to push the car forward because the cannabis plastic is much lighter than traditional materials. Cannabis is also stronger than steel when put in this form (Gordon). So now you can make a car out of cannabis and fuel it with cannabis, while at the same time being more efficient than regular fossil fuels and stronger than traditional car material.

The most well-known use of cannabis is its medical applications. Over 20 states in the United States have recognized that cannabis is effective when treating certain ailments. For instance just recently Utah passed a bill that allows epileptic people access to CBD oil: an extract of cannabis that prevents seizures and is known as an antipsychotic. Cannabis has another compound in it loved by patients everywhere because of its innumerable applications, that compound is known as THC. THC was the reason the plant was made illegal in the first place, but that was because people had very little knowledge of its true effects. The most shocking of these medical effects is that THC actually strengthens the brain rather than weaken it as THC protects it from neurdegeneration (Walia). This protection actually prevents Alzheimer’s disease and other symptoms of aging.  THC has also been proven to reduce tumors from different cancers in multiple studies. One myth about cannabis is that it gives the consumer more lung cancer than tobacco, but the opposite is actually true cannabis cures and prevents lung cancer in the consumer, and has also been found to reduce asthma. When it comes to most cancers cannabis makes these cells wither and die; denying someone this medicine because of a propaganda campaign is morally wrong. Cannabis can be used for less serious conditions as well such as chronic pain from multiple diseases (105 Peer-Reviewed). Cannabis has also been proven to help people with bipolar disorder manage their condition by improving their memory, attention, and general attitude. THC also has the effect of improving appetite which is very valuable to AIDS patients who have trouble eating, as well as people with eating disorders. To say the least Cannabis has a lot of medical applications and more are surely going to be discovered now that people are more accepting of the plant.

Cannabis’s greatest application could be its use as a currency.  Throughout history, I know of 3 monetary systems: bartering goods and services, gold/silver standard money, and fiat currency.   Cannabis as a medium of exchange is not a new idea; in fact Thomas Jefferson used it as currency when the government ran out of money in May of 1781 while he was governor of Virginia.(""Hemp history"") Just as with gold backing, such a currency would operate by having each note redeemable for an amount of hemp, whether raw or in a refined state of oil, seed, fiber, or hurds.  AN ACTUAL ""federal reserve"" would grow, harvest, and hold this crop, along with printing the amount of money equal to the amount of resource held, so that these notes can be redeemed at the banks for the harvested raw and/or refined hemp (oil, fiber, hurd, etc).  Currently our currency is based on debt, not value, and this can lead to problems among neighbors, fearing scarcity. For every dollar we print we go that much plus interest in debt: meaning we can never pay our debt off even if we used every dollar in existence. Cannabis offers us a way out of perpetual debt, and also gives the power of currency to the people rather than the privately owned Federal Reserve.

Cannabis backed currency is a unit of accountability to our ecosystem and the betterment to our every man, woman, and child.  An open worldwide market utilizing a network of claimed lands would serve as the basis for a cooperative economy and government, funded by a property tax of cannabis; that is to say, the more land that you participate with, the more cannabis you pay in taxes. The government would have to send high quality seeds to all land owning people in order for this system to be fair, but at least debt is not inherently created as a loan of principle and interest when this money enters the economy.

Citizens would replace their current currency notes at the reserve with the new cannabis notes, at the same value as compared with how much raw material that amount would purchase from the reserve.   ANYone, at ANY time, has the option to grow a crop to turn in to the reserves, to attain cannabis currency (the reason that this benefit does not collapse the system and erase the need for jobs by citizens, and in turn erase capitalism markets, is because it can only be done once, possibly twice, a year). 

To phase it into society, the best method would be to start with businesses that can utilize the crop either by 100% or a considerable amount, for them to pay their employees in hemp notes in a slowly increasing percentage of wages and to buy hemp ingredients for their products from the new hemp banks, at an appropriate amount per unit of the resource, in relation to the present economic state in the nation (These companies would buy, in USD, the hemp to manufacture with, until the harvesting is USD proofed; not requiring petroleum to run the machines or paying wages in USD). 

After the first fiscal year, the number of circulated notes would be tallied, by the use of catalogued serial numbers (tracked like anonymous credit card numbers, tied to the hemp serial note, not the person), so that the sum could be grown to sustain the size of the economy.  The supply will constantly grow and shrink at the same time because of how people consume and renew it.

 As the fiscal years turn, all uncirculated notes would leave behind an amount of unredeemed hemp, that would rollover into the value of each note in the following year, i.e. out of 10 trillion pounds, if all but 1 trillion is used, then the notes are now worth 1.1x the amount as they were previously.  That amount would be factored into the next year's crop size, to cover it possibly being redeemed later.  

 There could be a maximum of the number of years this amount would be covered by next year's crop, making inheritance of ""old money"" wealth out of the question and keeping the crop reserves fresh. So, if notes are not redeemed for, say, 3years, the serial numbers on the notes are ""burned"", removing that amount from what is to be grown the next year and making those particular notes unredeemable.  This portion could be taxed to supply public sector programs with their needs, by turning into free food, clothes, shelter, fuel, etc.  

 The amount of hemp donated from the civilians between federally sanctioned crops would count against the amount of ""hemp debt"" factored for the added value notes (that didn't circulate the previous year and are not set to ""burn"" in that cycle) By surpassing the notes queued to cover the size of the economy for the next year, this starts to reduce interest rates on loans, potentially leading to a system that has NEGATIVE interest rates on loans.

 The final reason this currency is inflation proof is that it's supplies will grow with the population: the more people alive, the more people that will want to consume cannabis, so more people will grow it. Inflation would only take place on non-renewable resources, that would increase in price with the overall amount of resource/money held at reserves, just to maintain it's rate of attainment, so as not to use these too quickly.  

Cannabis can be grown everywhere humans live, so it can even be put to use as an international currency free from the barriers of languages and governments.   The numbers I have crunched are only to outline a general concept.  Starting with an overestimated 350 million US citizens, at 50k pounds per person, a 17.5 trillion pound reserves would be grown.  Going from an estimated 6-10k pound per acre yield, it would require 1.75 to 2.92 billion acres.  The US has ~2.25 billion arable acres, so this can possibly be done in a single year. 

Some numbers I ran based on a full capacity use worldwide:

3.10798574 billion arable hectares of land on Earth * 2 crops a year * 8000 lbs is average between 6 and 10k lbs per hectare * 16 ounces per pound as the individual units likened to a dollar, totals 795,644,349,000,000 or 795 trillion, 644 billion, 349 million.  That's the total potential of a world cannabis currency in individual slices in the pie if grown at full capacity.  

Only 7.59 billion hectares are needed to give everyone on Earth a 1,250 square foot home. 971.25 trillion units worth of work that can be done in about two and a half years.  On top of the fiber and hurds content used from the plant to make the houses, there would also be 3,000 lbs average of seed yield per hectare * the 3.10798574 billion hectares a year * 2 crops a year is 18,647,914,440,000 or 18.65 trillion lbs of seed, 46,619,786,100,000 or 46 trillion 619 billion 786 million 100 thousand lbs of seed after the 2.5 years to grow the hemp for fiber to build houses for everyone.  37 gallons of oil per acre from seed is 284.16 billion gallons in a year, or 710.4 billion gallons of hemp oil after the 2.5 years to grow the fiber to build houses for everyone.

That is a hypothetical cap to the planet's capacity for this economy.  Even if scaling it down to small fractions of the areas mentioned, you can see that it still yields a considerable amount for trial local economies.  

On top of all this the flowering tops of cannabis, which hold the most THC and CBD, would be representative of other products in the economy due to the other parts of the plant being applicable for so many uses. How could this system be managed? Since all cannabis varies a spectrometer device will be needed to “read” the THC and CBD of cannabis while simultaneously weighing it. This device could also double as a virtual wallet that would account for how many cannabinoids you have stored in the bank to avoid theft and inconvenience. 
 
All in all, cannabis has a lot of uses, and potential uses. One day you could be driving a cannabis car, using cannabis fuel, on the way to your cannabis house, to eat your cannabis dinner, while wearing cannabis clothes, and all while everything was purchased with cannabis. This plant clearly forms a symbiotic relationship with humans, and for the health of our planet it should be accepted as a wise alternative to the harmful things we do to maintain our standard of living currently.

personalfinance,Looking for recommendations of part time work that I could look for that would keep me constantly occupied throughout a shift,"If this post doesn't belong here, please let me know of a subreddit where it might be appropriate to ask!

Okay, so this is kind of a specific request.  To start off, I'm a college student looking for some extra cash while I finish school.  I've had part time jobs in the past in retail but I ended up quitting both of them because there was SO much down time standing behind a cash register in a not-so-busy store.  Having nothing to do in addition to having to interact with so many people throughout the day made me extremely anxious.

Recently, I stumbled across two days of work for this mass mailing company where they had me sitting in a back room of the office stuffing envelopes for about 6 hours each day.  I thought I was going to hate it, but it was actually kind of awesome.  I didn't have to interact with anyone, no dress code, they didn't care what I was doing (listening to music, watching a show on my tablet, etc.) as long as I got the envelopes stuffed.  The best part though was the fact that I got there, sat down with hundreds of envelopes and inserts in front of me, and stayed completely busy for the entirety of both shifts.  Time flew by because I was completely occupied and knew exactly what I should be doing at all times.  It was extremely low stress. Decent pay. too.

Anyway, the company said they'd give me a call whenever they had more work, but I don't know how often that will be.  Does anyone have any other ideas of jobs similar to this that I might be able to look into or any advice on how to find more work like this while I'm in school?  My schedule is super flexible (most of my classes are online).

I'm generally pretty good at keeping on top of my credit and checking just now, see that I have a 787, 762, and 762 from the 3 scores I can easily get while on mobile. My understanding is that these are solid scores and am past the 740 score that generally qualifies parties for good interest rates. Would paying my car off really affect me that much? Furthermore, if there was a drop, would it be significant or something I could climb back from in a year?

personalfinance,Loan for 10K at 11%,"Good morning Reddit,

Background: I had been going to school on the Post 9/11 GI Bill, but my benefits ran out. I was informed by my VA office there is no way I can get an extension to finish my senior year of college which I start next week.

I applied for a Parent PLUS loan, but was denied. I appealed, and was awarded a $2500 pell grant. 

My tuition is $12,500 and I still owe $10,000. I have $11,000 in my bank account. I plan to pay my tuition out of pocket leaving me with $1,000 left over.

That being said, I want to take out a Discovery Loan for 10K at an 11% interest rate to live off/ have as financial security while I finish college. 

My GI Bill gave me a BAH of $1,800 monthly and I make around $1,300 a month at my part time job at school. I enlisted into the Marine Reserves when I finished my active duty contract. I make around $200-450 monthly with them. Without my GI Bill, my only income is the $1,300 a month. plus my Reserve pay. I want this loan to have financial security and money to live off of.

My bills are:
Rent/Utilities: $550
Car: $357
Phone/Internet: $100
Credit Card: $60

I finished an internship this summer and was offered a job at the firm making $64,500 base plus an $8,000 sign on with $5,000 annual 
bonus. 

After I graduate I plan to move home with my parents which will eliminate my $550 rent and cheapen my cost of living. I don't plan to spend the whole $10,000 this next year at school either. Once I start my full time job in June I plan to put my sign on bonus directly towards the loan and pay off the rest at $500 a month. Can anyone confirm if I am making a mistake or if this is a safe decision?",finance,1471522690
personalfinance,Taking out 10k student loan and 7k car loan in the same couple of months: dumb?,"Here's the scenario: currently drive a 2001 V8 expedition that devours gas, and just transferred to a university (Industrial Engineering) that is 10 miles away. i work at a college 6 miles in the opposite direction. I drive to both each day, so around 30 miles everyday. That's probably ~8 bucks a day on gas. (And that's not counting weekend mileage, trips to the gym, and other miscellaneous trips)

Want to take out a loan for used car for 7k, my credit is very good but young, only a year and a half old. Shooting for a 48 month loan.  

As for School, tuition is 8k, so I rounded up to 10k for books, parking permit, and a laptop (definitely would improve my academic life). Average salary right after graduation is around 60-70k. Will probably graduate in 2.5-3 years. Confident paying this loan won't crush me after graduation. Also, banking on the fact that next year I can claim as an Independent on Financial Aid and get more help. Tops would take out 6k each following years (but highly improbable according to school advisors/peers).

Last minute notes: income is ~900/mo; bills ~100/mo; parents would pay insurance.

personalfinance,Buy a used car or maintain my clunker?,"Hi, Reddit Finance,

I have a question concerning if it is the right time for me to buy a used car or continue to fix up my clunker. I spent about 800 a year on repairs on my 98 Ford Contour. I've spent a ghastly amount of money keeping it alive while I built my education and career. I bought it from my grandpa in 2010 for $1500. I'm now 28 and I feel like I've outlived the car. While it has no AC (in Saint Louis that's miserable), and the driver's door is almost unusable, it still only has 115K miles on it. I replaced the transmission entirely in 2011, the fuel system in 2012, and the brakes recently. But to maintain my registration in Missouri it needs a new windshield, some work to the ball-joint, and possibly engine work (or hopefully just a bad O2 sensor). It will probably cost between 500-1000 to fix just to be legal again.

Here are my vital signs:

-$19,000 in the bank
-divided into nebulous funds for emergency, retirement, and a nest egg for car/home/PhD down payment
-Bare minimum monthly expenses around 800-1,000
-So about 6-8K is for a very healthy emergency fund
-I'd like to consider 2k of it is retirement funds (but I have to wait another 8 months before my job starts matching)
-Annual income is 32K, wonderful benefits package. I can expect a steady increase in salary with time.
-4k student loan at 4.5% interest rate, and no other debt
-No serious medical conditions
-Only planning on doing a PhD if it is paid for, after my girlfriend passes her Pharmacy boards

I am thinking about buying a 2010-2013 used Hybrid, either a Toyota or a Honda. Depending on year an mileage they can cost between 5k-10k. There is one craigslist ad that has me very intrigued. The ad goes as follows:

""$8950 Honda Insight civic hybrid 2012 . 44-45 miles per gallon
Absolutely no issues. New tires. Low miles 55k only. Clean no smoke interior.
Excellent condition. ""prior salvage"" title, was minor rear end collision, no airbag deployed.""

Lets consider that the car has no serious issues, as the seller claims. I still want to have an emergency 2k available in several years if/when the battery needs to be replaced (they usually last 10-15 years).

The bottom line: do I continue to fix up my clunker, which I hate, or spring for the nice hybrid car, save on gas, repairs and headaches, and prepare to replace the battery when need be? Or should I do something entirely different, such as buying a conventional used car, or even lease? Thanks for the help!

Best Wishes,

personalfinance,I am in the final year of my PhD. Is it legal (and advisable) to take out a new student loan to pay off credit card debt I've accrued in graduate school?,"I have been in graduate school for 7 years, and I am finally finishing this semester. My entire time in graduate school has been free (tuition waived) and I've been earning a stipend, which is enough to live on, but just barely. For most of my time in grad school, I was debt free, but lately life has been getting more expensive (e.g. car repairs, insurance, travel, doctors visits, suit for job interview, etc.), and I have (perhaps irresponsibly) put a lot of this on credit. It's about $4000 at ~21% interest. I have no savings.

I have about $20k in student debt left over from my undergraduate studies. All payment on these loans is deferred until I finish grad school.

I'm wondering if it's possible to take out a new student loan in the last semester of my graduate career to pay off my credit card debt at a lower interest rate. I have a relatively good-paying job lined up after graduation, so I am confident I can pay this off, but for the next few months it would be a huge relief to stop paying these credit card bills. It would also be nice to free up some of my credit limit for any emergency expenses that might come up before I graduate.

I haven't had to take any loans as a graduate student, so I'm not even sure what the process is, or if it's legal to get a student loan for non-educational expenses.

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments! Not sure why everyone's so concerned about bankruptcy. I mean, I suppose anything can happen, but it seems pretty unlikely at the moment. I'm just looking for the most efficient way to pay off these debts.",finance,1471535203

Doing so will deplete the vast majority of my savings (will still have a small emergency fund left) but I can't help but feel that ridding myself of that debt would feel great. 

However I also need to $30-40k of medical work done that insurance won't cover. I'll need to take out a personal loan for this. I would like to have this work completely done within the next year. 

I need help planning out the next year from a financial standpoint. 

Should I pay off the student loans completely and then take out the personal loan for the medical work?

Or should I continue to make regular payments on the student loans while simultaneously taking out the personal loan? 

Would not having any student loan debt help me secure a better personal loan? Maybe a lower interest rate? I have excellent credit and a good salary for my age so I don't have any concerns about getting the loan regardless though.",finance,1471535237

My company currently pays 100% of my graduate school tuition, and has been for the last few years. Each year at tax time, I am hit with the burden of paying tax on the amount of tuition that my company has paid, because it is a fringe benefit. It can be significant - last year it was about $4,000.

I am trying to lessen my burden this year by changing my W-4 form to have more taxes taken out of each paycheck in the form of federal taxes. Will this help lessen my burden at tax time since I am paying more tax now (instead of paying about $4,000 cash at tax time)? I want to make sure I am doing this right.

personalfinance,Owe about 15k to family for school. Monthly payment is $400. Would taking out a personal loan help lower that payment?,"Hey guys, so I currently owe my SIL $15k out of the 25k I have paid. I am currently paying $400 a month which I think is outrageous. I just recently found out that she used her credit card as a payment and the interest rates are sky high. I was thinking of getting a personal loan instead, as I could reduce my monthly payment. There was a falling out and had I known these payments were credit card based, I would have focused on quickly paying them off before I moved due to the falling out. 

Are there any long term 10+ year loans like offered with student loans? Obviously I can't take out a student loan even though the money spent was for school.

My credit score is 730+ and I make about 45k a year.

personalfinance,Spending Portion of Savings to Pay Off Student Loans,"Looking for advice on a big decision I am debating. 

Right now, I am a little over $42,000 dollars in student loan debt spread across 6 individual loans. 3 of the six loans are small enough now that their total is less than 10,000. These 3 small loans are also the ones with the highest interest rate (2 at 9.8% and 1 at 11%). 

I am debating simply paying off my 3 smallest loans and using the extra income (it would be about $450/month) to aggressively attack the bigger ones. 

Some info about me and my situation: I have a little over 20,000 in a personal savings account I have accrued over time, partially while living at home and working but most from just saving since my first job at 15. Right now, I am currently living back at home, rent-free after a break-up. I don’t see this being the case for long however because it’s very difficult to be around my family and over an hour away from my job. I have a very stable 9-5 where I am payed 49,000/yr. 

I’m afraid because I spent so much time accruing that 20k that spending half of it is not a wise decision. I’d like to buy a house eventually in the next 4-5 years so I’d like to save as much as I can for that. 

All advice is welcome!",finance,1471542608

Basically, I'm looking at going to some U.S Medical schools, and I'm a Canadian. There's a couple I'm quite confident I'll be accepted to, which means I need to figure out finances.

Anyways, I'm on track to be graduating with my Bachelor's of Science with $0 in student loans and ~$25k CAD in cash, plus my car in assets. I *might* need approximately $250k-$270k CAD in loans total in order to attend any of these medical schools in the US. My bank(s) here in my province give $250k/$275k max Professional Student Line of Credits (LOC) for Medical Schools. However, this is for Canadian Medical schools as mentioned on all of their sites- I doubt they'd budge on that for an American medical school (Though, I have an appointment to discuss it). One banks in Canada who I'm not with currently said it might be possible, and I'll be talking with a portfolio manager at the bank about it apparently. The interest rate with the potential is currently ~3.8%-4.5%, with interest only payments during school &amp; residency. In the unfortunate case that they wouldn't finance U.S Medical school tuition loans for me, what would be my next best option? I'm thinking a private loan through a U.S lender? But I have no U.S credit history (My Canadian credit history however is very good, no issues there).  And I'm completely unaware of who are good lenders and such in the US so any inputs on that would be nice. From my research the interest rates on private loans for school in the US are really high, up to 9%. I wouldn't be comfortable with that interest rate, maybe 6% at maximum- which again I have no idea if I could get that ""low"" with no US credit history? I'm in no rush, I have plenty of time to figure this all out so time to set it all up and get it figured out isn't an issue. Thanks for your help!

financialindependence,Rent out vs sell house,"Hi all, I posted this in r/realestate, to mixed feedback and, unfortunately, no math.  We are looking at moving and I'm trying to figure out if it makes sense to rent out my existing home when we do.  I would love to get into real estate as part of our FI plans, and I think this could be a good segue in to it.  But I'd like to see some numerical comparisons of renting vs selling, considering our goal is to build up our net worth and asset base.  I'm not particularly concerned if the house cash flows right now, just like I don't care if my stocks issue dividends right now.  Growth is fine, as long as my NW is increasing.  We are 31, shooting for FI by ~40.  I would like to get to about $2M in investments and another $1M or so in real estate.  I love markets and finance and investing, but I have always been drawn to real estate as well, and love the tangible nature of it. I like the idea of having a little of both as well, just for diversification.  

Here's the situation: our house is worth about $210k right now.  We owe $125k on a 15-yr, 3% note and then about $55k on a 2%+prime HELOC.  We have 14 years left on the primary mortgage and 19 years on the HELOC.  We also have enough non-retirement investments to pay off the HELOC if necessary.  We live in St Pete, near the city center, an area that has been growing like crazy, in a highly-desirable neighborhood.  Property appreciation has been ~11-12% for the past 4 years.  I don't expect that rate to continue indefinitely, but I think something like a 6% average would be a good estimate.  We are not in the suburbs (or a housing development-only area) and we are not in an overbuilt white-elephant McMansion, so I think we are more crash-resistant than some.  Our rental market is completely insane and has been for over 5 years.  Rentals are usually rented before they are officially listed.  I think our house could rent for ~$2k/month.  

Napkin math gives me:  
$2,000 rent  
-1,300 PITI  
-400 maintenance/repairs/pest service/termite bond  
-160 vacancy (8%)  
Gives us:  
$140/mo cash flow (+600 Mortgage principal, for NOI of $740) 

Assuming I put ~$540/mo towards the HELOC (payoff in ~14 years to roughly coincide with the mortgage payoff and assuming an interest rate increase to 6% avg) that gives us a negative cash flow of $400/month initially.  However, $600+ of that is equity in the house (and increasing each month), so the way I see it, I'm increasing my NW by at least $200/month (~2.4k/yr). Moreover, I should get a depreciation of ~4k/yr ($140k house value) + mortgage interest deduction of another $5k/yr, which is a combined $2,800/yr in tax breaks @ 28%?  That is effectively increasing our NW by $400/month, absent any appreciation or rent increase, which is I think is unlikely.  The historical average nationwide has been ~5.5%, and I think ~6% is a reasonable estimate in our area. 

If I use this calculator (http://bit.ly/2bBoEm6) as though we were buying a $210k house with about ~$30k down (what I'm assuming we'd net if we sold the house - ie: the opportunity cost of keeping the house) and financing $180k over 14 years at 4% avg and it looks like we get a substantial net worth increase.  At the end of 14 years, we either have a house that generates enough inflation-adjusted income (using the 50% rule) to pay for roughly 25% of our expenses or a house that we would sell and put the proceeds into the market.   I should add that we are looking to move just down the street and I am self-employed, so it will be no problem to come by the house to check on it, take care of items that pop up, perform basic lawn maintenance, etc.  As far as potential problems the house has (or is in the process of getting): new roof, new plumbing, new electrical, new AC/ductwork, new windows, new appliances, new toilet, new water heater, new low-maintenance landscaping, so all the major headaches should be minimized (I will not say impossible).  We have plenty of funds for repairs and plan on setting aside ~5-10k and adding to it each month from the maintenance budget.  In the worst case, we could afford the mortgage on this house + our future house without any issue. 

Our goal is FI, so it looks like this brings us closer to that.  Am I missing anything here?  Thoughts?",finance,1471548277

personalfinance,How much can I afford to spend on a car?,"Hey /pf/,

I will try to keep this brief without sacrificing any crucial details.

My wife and I have been thinking about buying a used car. Her car is barely alive. I have been riding a motorcycle or taking the bus.

Earlier this week, I was hit on my bike. Breaking my hand (excuse any typos please), totaling my bike. Insurance company is writing me a check for well over what i paid for the bike, coming out to 4,000 dollars. This is a rather large windfall to an early 20s married couple.

With the quickly declining state of her car, we decided its time to sell or scrap it, collecting hopefully 500 bucks, and invest the money into a new car.

Collectively we bring in between 3500-4000 dollars a month. We pay 967 a month in rent, approx 200 in gas, electric, internet, renters insurance. We also pay 60 in car insurance, 60 for a phone (mines free) and we have no debt or loans or anything.

We are searching for a reliable vehicle we can travel the country in. Large enough we can crash in it when we dont camp out on the road. its also important that we dont end up with a car that costs a bunch to fix. Ideally a car around 50000 miles with some sort of warranty on it. AWD. Something were not afraid to let our dog hang out in with us.

We do have a cosigner who will get us a great interest rate.

Based on this information, does anyone have any advice on how much we can spend, what to buy, and what to avoid? Thanks.",finance,1471552103
personalfinance,Student Loans. Should I refinance?,"Hi Guys. I've always been an impulsive consumer and finally something clicked. I firmly believe I'm on the right path to good Personal Finance by changing old habits, listening to a bunch of podcasts and realigning my goals and means to do them.

A little bit of Background. Recently Graduated from an Architecture + Real Estate Development Masters Program. About 35k in debt, plus 4k in a Credit Card.

I recently landed a job @ 35/hr with a renegotiation in 3 months, plus I have a side business that is starting to pick up. 

My main concern is if I should refinance my student loans with a private lendor. A couple of things come to mind. 

* Fully aware that If I consolidate the loan I forfeit Income Based repayment plans and such. With the relative small amount that I owe, I do believe it's the right choice. With a low interest rate (3.5%~) , payments could end up below $400. I would be very comfortable with that amount.
* Variable Rates. What's the deal with these? Can a sudden spike happen? How likely? Too big of a deal?
* The only drawback to this consolidation is that I wouldn't be able to do the snowball method. The more I learn, the more I think that would be solid for my financial education and discipline.

personalfinance,Should I re-finance my car?,"Hey guys!  I'm a grad student (income ~$30k annually)  living in Southern California, and my rent just increased a LOT.  My university only allows so much time in student housing, and I've had to move into a relatively expensive situation due to the rental market being out of control in my area (I really tried to find inexpensive housing, but rent prices have jumped 70% since I started school).  

When I started school, I bought a brand new car at 0% interest and I have 16 months left before it is paid off in full.  Payments are around $300/month, and I'm wondering if it is a good idea or bad idea to re-finance my auto loan at a higher interest rate to lower my monthly payments.  On one hand, I could really use the extra cash, but I also realize that I would be paying some extra moneys.

Currently house is estimated on Zillow (I know it's not accurate at all) at 580k and 529k on Redfin.  I'm considering refinancing the house and cashing out if it appraises for 529k or there abouts.  My current interest rate is ridiculous at 4.375% (closing cost money) and possible rates are as low as 3.25 but more likely 3.3.  My payment would go up to around $2900 from $2600 a month but I would be able to pay off all other debts, which cost me around $1200 a month at various interest rates (none nearly as low).  This should give me around $106,000 in cash at closing and my only bills would then be cell phones/cable TV/power/water/car insurance which is less than $1000 combined per month.  My credit is around a 680 so it seems doable.  Googling this stuff is hit or miss, looking for solid advice and willing to divulge more information if needed.  I've only owned the home for 8 months but it sure seems like an advantageous time to do this.



I expect to put the money towards home improvements (fenced in property/pool) and debt consolidation and then either invest or sit on it (invest).  $2900 a month seems like an easy payment at my household income level, especially because it seems that I would save some money by actually reducing my debt.  $2900 a month is approximately 1/3rd of our monthly income.  I understand that currently I could probably easily sell my house and walk away with some money, but we are wanting to stay here for 15-20 years easy.

personalfinance,My experience with internet payday loans,"This post will provide examples of my experience with unsecured internet loans, specifically the dollar amounts and interest associated with the loans. Often, you gloss over the payment terms once you hear ""APPROVED"" because at that point you're just happy to get money to fix your car or eat for the month. Then you wonder if you should have asked for another $100 since it was so easy. Don't! You'll thank yourself later.
  
This post should serve as a warning to those who think a $400 or $500 internet loan is affordable. It isn't. I happen to have hit a string of bad luck (aka no emergency savings fund) with car trouble and moving expenses and was desperate as they come and in the end I have 4 of these running concurrently. I am paid semi-monthly and each pay cycle these payday companies skim a total of $450, or $900 month. 

Now, I am extremely fortunate to have come across a small windfall and am taking the opportunity to pay all loans off in full which will no doubt save me $$$ thousands not to mention I'll be able to eat something beside rice and beans once my monthly cash flow improves. Please no preaching..I know it's dumb I'm trying to help others learn from my foolish decisions. But hey, when your car breaks down and you don't have credit cards the options are limited..  
  
**Payday 1**  

This first payday loan example is from a company that is the most predatory I've ever come across in terms of the interest rate and length of the loan.  I asked for $500 and the semi-monthly payment is $162 (~$325 a month).  if I paid the minimum amount ($162) semi-monthly until the loan maturity date I'd pay a total of $3915.89, or 706%!. The loan payments last 1 year until 5/15/2017.
[Payday Loan 1](http://i.imgur.com/gbub7kC.png)
  
  
**Payday 2** 

Next up we have a $400 loan and the semi-monthly payment amount is $79 ($160 a month). Paying the minimum amount until 1/17/2017 I'd pay $962 in total, or 420%. Compared to the others I feel this company isn't too predatory but it's still insane by prime loan standards.

http://imgur.com/a/hAN9d  

  
**Payday 3**
  
$500 loan amount. $100 semi-monthly ($200 a month). 581% interest and you'd pay $1743 if you only paid the minimum.

**Payday 4**  
  
$400 loan amount. $108 semi-monthly / $216 a month. It started Jan 15th and it expires Sept  30th. Total payments are around $1728.  

So what can we learn? From borrowing $1,800, I could expect to pay a total of $8,348.89. That's the first I've done that calculation and holy shit..that's absolutely insane it's no wonder I felt robbed. I expect a shitstorm..be easy on me fellas.",finance,1471583936

personalfinance,Options for Self Funding Grad School,"Hi All, 

Thanks in advance for the advice..  I would love to sounds a couple ideas off you guys for options to fund a graduate program which costs about $56,000.  My employer is reimbursing my $15,000 ($5,000 per calendar year) and I am obviously responsible for the balance.

Option 1) Federal student loans.  I have been offered $23,000 per semester (4 semester long program) of un-subsidized and graduate plus loans.  These loans are around 6.5% and have a about a 1-3% origination fee.  The $23,000 is about twice the amount I actually need for tuition but I would need to accept both loans to cover the semester tuition.  So I would have about $9,000 which I would hold in a bank account until it was time for repayment.

Option 2) I have ~$20,000 in a 457 deferred comp account.  I could cash this out any pay no penalty for a qualified tuition purchase (as i understand it).  I would still have a deficit for the total tuition cost but could perhaps combine with one semester worth of student loan??

Option 3) refinance my house and cash out equity now while rates are low.  I currently am paying 3.875% on with a balance of 148,000 on my home.  I spoke with a lender and they offered 3.75% and I could take out 80% LTV.  So i would drop a bit on interest, cash out equity, and eliminate PMI ($50/mo).  They think my house would appraise for around $225,000, so I could cash out $32,000 and hold in an investment account as I pay for each semesters tuition.  Again this would leave me at a bit of a deficit but I could perhaps combine with a small student loan or aggressively save for the last semester payment in 18 months.  This option would raise my mortgage payment about $180 a mo on a 30 year fixed.

Option 4)  I looked into 529 plans but I don't think you can pay back student loans with them.  So I don't think this is a viable option to start now unless I am missing something.

Please let me know what you would do in this situation?

This may partially be due to fiscal irresponsibility on her part(not checking her credit score ever), but her dad would vehemently tell her to not worry about the bills getting covered.

Admittedly, these loans aren't such a bad thing, as they are federal with deferred payment, which is better than a lot of 20 year old students have, however her dad outright lied to her about their existence, so either he doesn't know, or he doesn't care.

Also, her mother recently discovered that he has multiple maxed out credit cards that he seems to be paying the bare minimum on. This may double as an /r/relationships post, just because a great deal of these problems seem to be tied to communication issues, and trust between family members.

personalfinance,In-laws own the house husband and I live in. We want to buy it from them. Questions.,"My husband and I live in a fast-growing city with a very competitive housing market. Shortly before we got married around 3 years ago, our in-laws offered to help us out in getting a house of our own (we had always rented). We never really had a clear plan and threw around various possible arrangements. Meanwhile, husband and I found a house we liked and his parents decided to buy the house in cash before it got snatched up. The house was 200k. Shortly after they bought the house, it suffered flood damage during a storm that hit our city hard. They put about 10k into regrading the yard, and replacing flooring and drywall in the room that suffered the damage.

Days, weeks, months went by and we still never settled on a clear plan. Now it's been three years and we've been living in the house for free while they pay the insurance and taxes. This has given us the opportunity to pay off our student loans in full and save money for a down payment, all on our measly state salaries. They are wonderfully generous for helping us out and I am so ready to buy the house from them so that we can all move forward with the original goal. They have offered to sell us the house for the original sale price of 200k. Like I said, they are wonderful people and have given us more help than we deserve.

We are on track to have 40k in savings and 4k in checking by November. Putting 20% down would financially wipe us out. This makes me uncomfortable, plus I'm not sure a lender would be okay with that. Our credit scores are in the 760-780 range. Is there any reason (taxes? interest rates?) why we would want to rush to get this done before the end of 2016? If so, is it worth it to put less than 20% down in order to make this happen? I understand we would have to pay PMI, but we would be diligent about making large payments in order to get rid of PMI asap.

Would a lender take issue with the fact that the selling price of the house is under-valued? Current market value is roughly 250k. Would they require an inspection? Is there anything about our unique situation that would make our closing costs more expensive or perhaps cheaper?

personalfinance,Fraud charges - dispute was closed by bank with no further action,"This is for a friend of mine who has been going back and forth with the bank for months now and is not getting anywhere.

The situation is that an amazon purchase was made for roughly $500. This was a legitimate expense.

Another round of purchases was then made for $12,900 over the course of a few days. It was for items they already had, so they're sure that no one in the house was purchasing it. All the kids were in school at the time when the orders would have been delivered, no deliveries were seen at the door for those items, etc.

The bank is saying that since the delivery address was their address, and since UPS and FedEx have the tracking, that the charges are legitimate and that they won't investigate further. Now, my first thought is that a local criminal was ordering stuff, waiting for it to be delivered, and retrieving it while no one was home.

How should I start investing?","I am in my early 30s, I live in an expensive city in the US, and I have a few thousand dollars just sitting in my checking and saving accounts that I would like to start investing. I am hoping to get advice on how I might start doing that. Best practices, tips, anecdotes, anything you can offer by way of advice would be most appreciated. Here is my personal finance rundown:

- Been working at the same job for a few years now. Appx $60k per year salary before taxes (City, State, and Federal)

- Around $1k per month in rent and utilities

- Student Loan debt of appx $40k, monthly payments are about $400 

- Appx $10k in my checking account

- Appx $5k in my savings account

- Appx $20k in my 401k

I am not very well versed in finance or investments at all. I'm a good saver but with the expensive city I live in my personal wealth has remained pretty stagnant. I don't splurge on much at all, maybe spend too much on eating out but that's about it. 

A friend suggested Wealthfront as a good place to start and even sent me a referral code which offers free management on an additional $5k. From what I understand, $5k is the minimum I have to invest just to use their services and the first $10k is managed for free plus an additional $5k managed for free if I use the referral. 

I know I'm not exactly a Spring chicken. I spent most of my 20s in a band. It was fun and rewarding in many ways and while we had some minor success I know it set me back.

I'd like to save to buy an apartment but I am aware that will take some time especially in my city. Is investing a good way to jump start that process?

personalfinance,How to pick from a range of interest rates &amp; terms when refinancing?,"I’m refinancing a student loan of about $6k, and I have to choose from 15 different combinations of interest rates, loan periods, and monthly payments. They range from 2.4% for 5 years (monthly payment of $105) to 3.7% for 20 years (monthly payment of $35), and many other options in between.

My next goal on the horizon is to save enough for a down payment for a home in 2-3 years. I feel that even the higher rate options (up to 3.7%) are low enough that I can save for a down payment rather than throwing all extra funds to pay it off asap. 

Taking the lowest rate would save interest over the course of the loan, but would leave less funds available in the short- and medium- term. I’m trying to figure out at what point the amount of interest saved is worth giving up maybe a couple thousand more in payments in the next few years. 

Not sure if there is any rule of thumb here, or if entirely comes down to personal preference. I realize the amounts are fairly small, so it may not make a big difference either way. But I still have to make a decision between 15 specific options with very small differences in rates, and not sure how to hit the sweet spot between interest saved vs having more funds available.

&gt; The No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act (H.R. 2666), was introduced by Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), on June 4, 2015. This bill prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from engaging in harmful rate regulations on broadband internet service providers (ISPs). I supported this legislation because I believe it protects consumers while ensuring that no future FCC abuses its authority over small businesses. This bill has passed the full House of Representatives, and is now awaiting action in the Senate.

personalfinance,Add wife to insurance for two months?,"Hello PF, 

My wife just graduated from medical school in May this year. While she was there, the school offered subsidized medical insurance for students, which happens to be expiring at the end of this month. My work place provides insurance for the employee for $10 per month out of my paycheck. 

Unfortunately, to add a spouse I will have to pay an extra $468 PER MONTH. My deductible is $3,000, after which point 90% of expenses are paid. My wife will be starting work on September 1 with benefits effective after 60 days. So basically we would need something over $4000 to happen in this 2 months before adding her to my insurance would be worth it.  We are both very healthy and in our late 20's, and I just don't see forking out $1,000 over 2 months being the right choice. 

I don't have a huge understanding of insurance policies, federal care act, etc., so I am wondering if there is anything legally wrong with leaving her uninsured for 2 months? I obviously care about her and her well-being immensely and want her to be taken care of in the off chance something does go wrong. However, for $4,000 I think I would just pay for anything medical out of pocket and try to negotiate any large sums citing lack of insurance. What are reddits thoughts? Any input is appreciated.

personalfinance,Backdoor Roth IRA contributions using TSP,"I will be starting a federal job next month, so I will be eligible for TSP which I understand is pretty solid in terms of fees and performance. I max out my current 401k and IRA every year. Unfortunately, we make too much to be eligible for Roth IRA contributions and due to a previous job with a generous profit sharing plan, I have a pretty hefty traditional IRA balance which currently makes backdoor Roth conversions an unreasonable tax burden.

I’m planning to roll all of my traditional IRA funds into the TSP. In doing so, from what I understand, I will zero out my pre-tax IRA account balances and be able to do tax free backdoor Roth contributions in the future. I currently have $205k in a Vanguard traditional (rollover) IRA and about $55k of pre-tax funds in my current employer 401k (everything else is already Roth).

My questions are:

1. This would work, right?
2. Is this even worth doing? Or should I just suck it up and continue with the traditional IRA contributions in Vanguard
3. If I do this, do I have to complete the rollover (into TSP) before the end of this year to use this benefit for the 2017 tax year?

personalfinance,"$250,000+ in student loans, more debt also, but....","So here's the (unfortunate but could be worse) deal:

-- Undergrad loans of about $70,000. Some are ParentPlus loans, so technically parents responsible. I am most concerned about these because far harder to discharge if I have a low-income (see more below), and also because I would rather be in a personally bad position than force my hard-working parents to be so.

-- I also will have about $200,000 principal on law school loans. Yes, it's a lot. My law school, though, fortunately, will take these loans (as well as about $35,000 in undergrad - but not ParentPlus) loans if I work making under $55,000 a year or so for the government or non-profit work.

-- About $10,000 in credit card debt. Already put on a 0% APR card for 18 months, so not as worried about this right now.

I've been offered a job in Los Angeles at a law firm paying $180,000 a year plus bonus. I'm very fortunate with this. Given CA, federal, and local tax, I would make about $120,000 after taxes. 

I've also been offered a government job, where I would make about $85,000 a year. While some loans would be covered by the generous repayment assistance my school has, I don't plan on taking this job because of the situation I am in.

I don't plan on staying in this law firm job forever, I just can't - not why I went to school and the quality of life is miserable. But I could do it for three to four years. Pay increases each year, and within three years I will be making something around $240,000 when I include bonus (minus taxes and loans).

After I leave biglaw, I plan on working for the government, making something around $110,000 to $130,000 a year if I get lucky.

What I'm wondering is what I do. 

#1: My student loans will average just over 6% interest. I could consolidate and transfer to something with around 3% interest, but I then lose the protections my school gives me. Is it worth it?

#2: Do I aggressively pay down all, or pay the minimum on all (25 year plan)? The standard (and recommended for many or most situations) is 10 year plan.

#3: Do I aggressively pay down some, and pay the minimum on others? I am strongly considering aggressively paying down ParentPlus and paying minimum on law loans.

#4: Do I ALSO put into savings or retirement during the initial period where I am trying to pay off loans but also working at a firm?

#5: I've been given two start dates: August or October. Loans become due in November (six months after graduation). I take the Bar in late July. Most people wait until October and travel and relax before work gets intense. Do I wait, as I would prefer? Or do I suck it up and start in August, making some money before loans become due?

personalfinance,SO has significant student loans on IBR repayment plan headed for large tax bomb,"My SO has ~$180K in Federal loans, she makes significantly less than I do (about 16%), and is currently on the IBR repayment plan paying ~$100 a month with forgiveness after 20 years. We are both early to mid 30s and have shared finances for 11 years. Recently, through this subreddit, we found out about the potential **tax bomb** when the loans are forgiven. With what little I know now, I am assuming that the balance of the loans at the time of forgiveness is considered income. Based on the current payment amount she is looking at a hefty tax bill of somewhere between $200-250k in 20 years.

My assessment of our options:

* Pay more per month now
* Continue to pay the minimum and save and invest enough per month to cover the tax bomb in 20 years
* Hybrid

As far as I can tell, option 2, paying the minimum and saving for the tax bomb, makes the most sense by far financially. We could potentially set aside much less money per month ($600-800) than the standard non-IBR payments ($1100-$1500) and with some reasonable growth in Roth IRAs or some such expect to cover the tax hit and potentially have money left over. However, she cannot currently afford to do this entirely on her income if she wants to save for retirement and contribute as much as she would like to other expenses. I am willing to support this effort as our income disparity is a relatively recent (last few years) development and she supported me through my rough times some years back.

That said, another approach might be the best deal for her. Paying much more on the loans now would reduce the tax bomb outright. This could be advantageous if we had a major setback financially such as injury or job loss or if we split sometime in the next 10 years. If and when something like that were to happen she could then reassess moving forward based on her income at that time. This option seems less appealing through my rose tinted glasses or any glasses I have tried on.

Her current job does have some potential for growth and her income has increased several times since she started 6 months ago. It is difficult for me to estimate the ceiling, but just based on the current trends she may increase by 30-40% within a year or two as her workload and expertise increase. Beyond that it is difficult to say and it is not altogether unlikely that it will stagnate. If/when her income increases her payments will also increase which will reduce the eventual tax bomb. In any case, I want to plan based on our current situation.

Any thoughts or recommendations are appreciated! Our situation reminds me to keep perspective on the economy as a whole. I have been extremely fortunate over the past few years, I work in tech and my income has more than tripled. She, like many others, has struggled mightily to find work in her field. She now has a job that pays less with fewer benefits than her job just out of college 15 years ago. Don't take anything for granted!

Assuming about $6.9k net pay, that leaves me with ~$4.7k (minus food/gas) to save/invest. I might be super retarded and wrong about some of these numbers, let me know.

- **Total: 70-100k**

**Philosophy**

Since I won't be mortgaging, leasing, borrowing anything it makes more sense to my own retarded self to build a tangible savings, liquid assets, rather than throwing everything I have at this large debt just to avoid the stigma of bad credit. 

If one of these debtors do go through the entire process to sue me in another country, I'll just pay that one and move on. 

Remote work options and high-demand skill-set means that I'll have employment opportunities, and valid reason for work visa.

With dual income, thrifty lifestyle, and future business potential I'd probably be able to afford a modest home in the US with cash, should I return in a few years.

I am eager to live abroad, and don't see it as a consequence, but as an opportunity.

Rather than living beholden to these institutions for the foreseeable rest of my life, I can just live the life I want. I don't care if my tombstone says ""Here lie a man with a credit score of 530"", so long as I fulfill my own modest desires and goals. I'm a weird guy, ok?

---

**Hesitations/Concerns**

- If I get sued in another country, any kind of severe escalation of what I owe (ending up paying way more than I would have to begin with)
- Debt will always be there should I suffer some kind of brain damage and wish to mortgage/lease in the future.
- Will drag down my partners credit should we marry and they also suffer brain damage.
- Prevents me from realistically owning a decent credit card/new car if brain damage occurs.
- While it's a nightmare/suicide inducing amount of repayment, it would indeed be possible to repay it over a long duration.
- Should I move, suffer brain damage, and move back I may be angry at myself for not acting sooner.
- That dirty feeling of interest accruing in my subconscious.
- I'm super ignorant re: finance, methods (401k/Roth/etc), and probably don't understand some of the big-picture stuff.

personalfinance,What to do with £6000?,"Hey reddit.

So I'm 19 years old and from the UK as you can probably tell. I've been on a gap year this year, finished my A-levels last year and took a year out of study. During that time I worked and earned 6k, split up into 3k in bank, 1k cash and 2k ISA (I stupidly put it into a 2 year ISA with Halifax I think at 1.25% interest rate). In exactly 1 month's time, I'll be starting med school which is a 5 year course, and I'll probably do an intercalated year so 6 years altogether before graduating. My parents are paying for my dorm fees, and in future years for any living accommodation off campus.  9k a year for tuition fees will be covered via Student Finance England so I'll start repaying that when I start work as a doctor (hopefully). I've also applied for the maximum student loan I can get, with my parents household income of around 50-60k, which will pay for things like food, travel, nights out etc. (should be around 4k student loan per year roughly). Anyways with all that being said, what exactly do I do with the 4k I have right now? I wanted to invest and I've tried some apps like Plus500 but I feel like the demo version and actually buying shares is a complete different thing. Also, is there something I should do with the ISA? If I pull out my 2k now I don't get any interest on it (still 1 year 10 months) till I get full rewards from the ISA. 

A few extra things, I earned around 9k at my job. On my pay slip, was a PAYE deduction. However, I didn't earn over 10.5k which I thought was the amount at which you started paying taxes due to personal allowance. My tax code was 1050L, does this mean I need to contact HMRC and get my money back since I've been over taxed or? Also, I started work in around October and quit in June. That means I've worked in the new tax year so do I need to claim those PAYE deductions too or?

investing,"Interest Rates Ready To Surge, Signaling An F-U To The Federal Reserve","Interest rates are nearing a key breakout. This goes in the face of the uber dovish Federal Reserve chatter from the Fed Minutes this past week. The bottom line is, interest rates can go up even if the Federal Reserve does not want them to. This is what is called an open market system. While the Federal Reserve can manipulate them through quantitative easing, lowering the Fed Funds Rate and other metics, ultimately, if time is up, time is up.

 

Interest rates are close to a breakout. This is likely to happen by early next week and it will be a huge F-U to the Federal Reserve. The big question is, how high will they go. In the chart of the $TBT which mirrors interest rates (yields), there is a down-sloping trend line connecting recent highs. There is also the daily 50 moving average. Both these points meet at the current price. When price breaks above them, it will be like a jail break and a mega surge is likely.

I am 22 and recently just started a new job with the federal government with a starting salary being upwards of $50,000/year. with this being my first long term salaried job there are a lot of benefits that come along with the position that I basically have no idea about. I was hoping some people would be able to offer be advice regarding the TSP portion of my retirements benefit package. something that makes sense for someone my age. 

With TSP i know that i need to contribute at least 5% of my salary in order for my employer to match with their maximum of 5%. But, I am allowed to contribute up to 18% and the government will still match 5%, making a total of 23%. I also have been reading about a bunch of different funds that your money can go into and i essentially i have no clue about those, so was hoping to get advice again on what the best percentage I should contribute would be as well as what fun a person at my age should be contributing their money into. 

Thanks so much again for the help. I could really use as much advice as possible.",finance,1471706425
personalfinance,Pay extra towards mortgage or retirement?,"I'm 31 years old. I pay rent to live with boyfriend. I rent out my condo.

My monthly payment on my condo is: $629
(Breakdown: $213 - HOA, $267 principle plus interest, $148 escrow)

Rental income is $750

I bought my condo in Feb 2016. My interest rate is 4.125% on $55k for a $69k condo. 

This is where I'm not sure if I'm making the beat financial decision. I'm currently putting the different of my monthly payment and rental income into a separate savings. I also put an additional  $300 in that account per month. I currently have $3500. I am saving money thinking the AC sucks and will probably need to be replaced in the next few years. 

Which would be the beat financial decision for me?
1.  To keep doing what I'm doing? 
2. To put that $300 towards the principal?
3. To put that money into my SP 500 retirement account?

I currently put $1k into my retirement account. 

I have a good job and easily pay my bills and have no debt besides this condo. 

Thanks!!!",finance,1471708678
personalfinance,My Father didn't save money for my college.,"So long story short my Dad only just started saving for my college and has $1000 in an account. My backstory here is that i'm 17 and I leave for college in the spring because I am graduating early. I figured that since my dad makes a boatload of money (somewhere in the $180,000-$200000 a year range) that I would have more money saved up. Along with his income I also have my Mother's income which is somewhere in the range of ($100000-$110000) and also her husbands income ($80000). I'm just super scared right now honestly... Neither of my parents have anything saved up so i'm basically going to go into my college years with shit ton of debt. After filling out the FAFSA we don't qualify for any subsidized loans through the government so I will have to get private student loans that have awful interest rates. I have no clue what im doing currently, I leave for Western state in Colorado in the spring and I have basically nothing saved up. My questions for you guys are....

1. What should I do with my situation?
2.What kind of loans can I get?
3. Who can I talk to about all of this stuff?
4. Why didnt my parents save money for me? (kidding, I already know the answer)",finance,1471710309

personalfinance,Which card should I pay off first?,"So, after my previous post, I have decided to work towards paying off my credit cards as best I can. My question now is, which one should I pay off first? I have a severance coming of about $6k, of which I plan to use $1k for an emergency fund (currently I have $0 savings) and the other $5k to start paying down one or two of my credit cards.


**Here are my cards:**

1) $13,617 at 11.99% until January 2017, then interest rate will go up to 14.99%.  Limit on card is $14k.

2) $4,950 at 0% until March 31, 2017, and then interest will go up to something like 22% backdated to the beginning of opening the card (April 2016)

^ This is a CareCredit health-related card, limit is $7k.

3) $3,892 at 9.99% with a $5k limit


**So far, my ideas are:**

1) Put the entire $5k towards the higher balance, higher interest card (#1 above).

2) Pay off all of card #2.

Or

3) Pay off all of card #3 and a portion of card # 2. 

I know there are several different methods to attack credit card debt, i.e. the snowball method or the avalanche method. I know that using the avalanche method will save me more money overall, but using the snowball method will help my morale and allow me to use the payments I would otherwise be paying to the two smaller cards on the bigger card. 

I've tried running the numbers but I am not good at this stuff (clearly). I would really appreciate any advice on which card(s) I should pay off using my severance. Thank you!

personalfinance,Should I pursue refinance on my home?,"26 y/o idiot here. I purchased my home for approximately 270k together with my wife about a year ago. 

We discovered when we began scouting for home loans that my wife's credit was shot due to her father being 60 days late on 2 payments in a row on the car he bought her as a graduation present for paying her way through college. She was a co-signer to build her credit despite not being responsible for paying it. 

The hit to her credit was an unexpected blow but ultimately we moved forward with buying the home regardless under an FHA loan that was variable interest (we weren't sure if we'd be living her for longer than 5 years, and the variable interest offset the increased payment due to the FHA loan).

My loan officer at the time suggested coming back to him after one year and refinancing once my wife's credit has recovered. 

I assume that I can transition from a FHA into a non FHA loan, is that correct? 

We recently drained our emergency fund of about 10k due to a sewage pipe bursting (Within 6 months of purchase, and despite having home owner's insurance and having had the home inspection performed nothing had indicated we might be left footing the bill for something like this and we weren't covered for any portion of the repair).

Is it inadvisable to pursue refinancing when I don't possess funds to contribute to the cost of the refinance?


What sorts of things should I be aware of before I doing this?

Thank you for the advice and help!

Edit: the interest rate of the loan is 3.25, 3.5% apr, and the principal balance remaining is approximately 249k.",finance,1471717595
personalfinance,"23 years old, about to buy a house. Is it a good decision?","Hi personalfinance!

I'm a 23 year old web developer about to take my first dive into homebuying, and wanted to get some opinions on my decision.

To start, my current full time salary is 82.4k, but I have also recently started a side web business which I expect will generate ~10k in revenue in the next year (this is hard to estimate as it relies purely on what kind of clients we get).

The cost of the house is right around 270k. It's a brand new house that's a 3br/2ba and it has about 1550 sqft. It's in a very new subdivision, with plans for a 4 acre park to be built and complete within a year of me moving in.

I had a few personal reasons for getting a house, but I also felt that it's a good investment for the area I'm in - northern Idaho, CDA area. If you're not familiar with it, it's been booming on a pretty massive scale. Businesses and housing divisions are popping up like weeds everywhere, as a lot of people along the west coast are starting to take interest in the area.

For this reason, I felt now would be the best time to buy, as interest rates are low (initially quoted 3.25, but it's since risen to 3.375, locking it in soon) and, even if we have the housing bubble pop again, that supply/demand for this area would end up fixing the prices pretty quickly.

Unfortunately, I only had enough money to do the minimum down payment (while still leaving me a 6 month emergency fund), so the montly payment (including taxes, pmi etc.) comes out to be $1586, which isn't too terrible, as that's what a lot of people charge for rent around here for a house like mine. Being able to afford this payment isn't a problem, I've got an excel document full of my expenses, and after crunching the numbers I'm still able to pay extra on my student loans while saving ~$500/mo.

I guess my main question is, is my logic sound as far as potential increase in home value goes? I really feel good about getting a home in this area now rather than later, but I just want to make sure I'm not being blinded by the grandeur of owning my own home.

EDIT: I do plan on trying to find a good roommate to help pay towards the house.",finance,1471718489
personalfinance,Surprise! I Owe Taxes in 2015,"I would like to start by saying yes, I am an idiot. I didn't file my taxes for 2015 in time because I didn't have my documents in order, did some research and saw that as long as I was receiving money back (which I always have), I had nothing to worry about. I expected I would be receiving a small amount of $ back and put it off. Fast forward to now, I finally have what I need to file and it looks like I owe the IRS $800, plus I'm guessing a late fee.

This is what I've been able to calculate with the 1040EZ form online. I earned around 30,000 in wages and my employer withheld about $2000 for federal taxes. I also received around $2000 in outside, untaxed income (1099). My friend who earns about $50,000 in taxed wages received money back so I'm wondering what gives. I suppose my employer didn't withhold enough for federal tax, but I filled out my W4 as single, head of household with 0 dependents as always.

My question is, do you think it's worth it to have a professional look at this for me and see if I'm taking all possible deductions? I would hate to pay a professional and end up still owing the $800 on top of their fee. Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1471719221
personalfinance,What to do with state retirement accounts when moving out of that state?,"My SO and I are moving from Ohio to Georgia next week.  We're young, both 26 and completely unaware of how to handle our retirement finance situation.  Over the past couple of years we have both worked for government entities and have had to pay into the Ohio state retirement systems.  I have about $9800 in STRS (School Teacher Retirement System) and he's got about $3900 in OPERS (Ohio Public Employee Retirement System).  Obviously we can't roll these into our new jobs in Georgia since they're an Ohio retirement account.  A representative from OPERS told my SO that he could roll his into an IRA (I don't know anything about these except that smart people with money have them.)  I haven't had a chance to call STRS and see if I can roll my money into an IRA too.  I can't imagine leaving the money where it is, since it probably isn't collecting much interest.  In the two years I've worked here I only earned $118 in interest.

I don't know if we should leave them alone, or roll them into IRA's, and let them collect interest forever, or break them and take the hit on taxes and use it for something else..... like a house.... or paying off a chunk of student loans off (a combined $30,000 all federal).  Two things that would ultimately have a payoff later like paying less interest on loans, and building equity.

This money could be a great way to get a down payment, pay less for housing and save more since a mortgage would be cheaper per month, and build up some equity instead of throwing away rent money each month.  I feel like the housing market is on the upswing, interest rates are low, so it might be a good time assuming our finances are right.

We both have high credit scores, in the high 700's.  We have about $14,000 saved up between the two of us (and we're focused on saving more!), and a variety of bonds totaling $1,000 that have not matured yet (given by a grandmother).  No other debt aside from student loans.  We use the 2% double cash back Citi rewards credit card and have Capital One accounts to earn higher interest.  Small things, I know, but it helps when you're young, starting out, and trying to make good choices.

Side note: we also need to buy my SO a car when we move (another first of ours).  We would be looking used, nothing crazy- just safe and good on gas.  I'm not saying we're going to use the retirement account for the car, just saying it's a purchase in the near future that's kind of unavoidable.

So what should we do with these retirement accounts, Reddit?  I have a feeling you're all going to tell me IRA and save for a home later, but I'd at least like to talk it out with some of you fine folks.",finance,1471720291
personalfinance,GF is going to school. Tuition money suddenly unavailable. How do we mitigate debt damage and cover living costs?,"Hi PF. My GF and I are taking a good look at our finances after some unexpected events. We could use some help navigating this situation. I'm afraid this may be a long post, so I'll do my best to organize info and ask specific questions.

**The backstory:**

My girlfriend is going back to school for an MS in computer science this fall. She technically has enough inheritance money to pay for her tuition, however it is largely tied up in assets (like property) that her parents manage. Recently her mother has been suffering from extremely severe medical conditions and any fluid money that their family had available is going toward her mother's treatment. Depending on how things develop, it's possible that her money won't be available to her ever, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. 

**Our current situation:**

My GF has been approved for an unsubsidized federal student loan at 5.31%.

She is currently unemployed however she is intending to begin an internship at a federally- or university-run research facility within the next two months. We don't have an idea about what she would earn there at this time.

I am employed earning $3,000 a month, however since technically I'm self-employed, I need to squirrel away a third of that for taxes. I expect my income to increase some within the next 6 months, however I can't estimate how much at this time.

We spend roughly $2,000 apiece per month on living expenses. (So basically I'm earning as much as I spend, with a couple hundred going toward investments/savings.) Because of her mother's situation, my GF is considering taking on all of the expenses they're covering for her. This would bump her monthly spending to ~$3500. 

If my GF takes out the full amount on her loan, she would have ~$4,500 after paying for tuition that could go toward living expenses.

We both use YNAB and live frugally relative to our peers, however I'm sure there are ways we can improve our spending.

**Our assets:**

I have roughly $30k invested in equities and mutual funds, all managed by someone I trust reasonably well. I've never really considered this as ""my money"" so I never touch it, and I would like to continue doing that as best I can. It's on my list to evaluate if I should reallocate some of that into computer-managed accounts, but that's another story for another time. I also have roughly 10k in an IRA that I contribute to monthly, for what that's worth.

My GF does not have any money in investment or retirement accounts of her own, aside from some negligible amounts in retirement accounts from previous work.  As horrible as it is to be considering this: she is supposedly receiving a sizable inheritance (separate from the one mentioned above that would cover her tuition) from her 94 y/o grandfather when he passes. Who knows when that will be, but that would pay for her school and leave plenty left over to start investment/retirement accounts. Beyond that, she doesn't have any money that she can access easily within the next 5 years. 

We both have excellent credit and are debt-free as of today.

**Upcoming expenses:**

My GF has some pretty bad jaw problems and needs to get braces in the next month, so that will be a ~$1,200 up-front expense, and end up costing ~$4,500 over the next 16 months.

Beyond that we don't have any expected large expenses coming up. I typically have money in a savings account that I would use to cover emergencies/big-ticket expenses, however that's largely depleted at the moment on account of 1.5 months of travel. I'll be replenishing that account as soon as paychecks start rolling in.

**Final remarks:**

My GF is taking full responsibility for her financial situation, however I want to help how I can without absolutely screwing myself in the process.

**Tl;dr: My girlfriend is starting school and money she was relying on is no longer available. Now she's consciously going into debt, and is not earning enough to cover living expenses while in school. I can help support her some, but I don't earn enough to support her fully. How can we best mitigate the damage?**

**Questions:**

* How heavily should we/she depend on the student loan to get by? Do we take out the full amount or not?
* What are some big-win ways to save/earn more money I may not have thought of (I've read and implemented Sethi's IWTYTBR)?
* What options are there for her to cover living expenses in the event her internship still doesn't cover everything? I'm assuming avoid using CCs, etc.

We're kind of buried by all of the details and it's difficult to see the big picture, so I'm sure there are a ton of questions I should be asking that I'm not. If you think of anything that might be useful, please do mention it for us to consider.

personalfinance,"[US] Going to be kicked out of the house, 20yr old with funds!","Hello r/personalfinance! 

TLDR; going to be kicked out the house by the end of the month, have 250k in managed brokerage accounts and 4k in ""liquid funds from father passing away, need help getting on my feet. 

I've been a huge lurker of this subreddit and it's time that I explain my story and ask for some advice.

Back story: My parents were not the greatest couple, my dad had a gambling addiction and nearly lost everything including our house. Our mom on the other hand was always angry at my dad's gambling addiction (go figure), and they ended up always fighting due to wage disparity. Fast forward, me, my brother, and my dad are living in a smaller house (after losing the other one and filing for bankruptcy) with our mom and she is fed up with dad due to the constant nagging about how the house is small and doesn't fit the 4 of us. This fighting has escalated and escalated to the point of my mom calling him a ""loser"" since he recently lost his job and was getting paid 40k instead of his normal 75k. After a year or so of living in the house, my dad finally got a decent job with stable income that could support me and my brother independently. After constantly fighting and having my mom call the police on us and trying to kick us out, we finally packed out bags and moved out. That was last July and we are happily living with our dad...now fast forward to September when my dad was diagnosed with MRSA, a type of infection due to his weak immune system and diabetes. After fighting it for several months and the infection spreading and getting worse, he was found by my brother and my mom (who picks my brother up from school) passed away on the couch at home since he wasn't feeling well from work. The diagnosis was that he died from diabetic ketoacidosis with a blood sugar of over 400. 

Grieving ensues and since me and my dad and me were close, he left me as the sole beneficiary of 300k from his life insurance. Now since my brother and I have no place to go (me being a full time college student and my brother still in middle school), we end up going back to our mom's home and live in a single bedroom together. I recently turned 20 and now my mom is fed up with my attitude after I called CPS on her since she was not feeding my brother or leaving us in a home which now has a bedroom being rented next to ours (the home is a small 2 bedroom 2 bath with 1 office space which my mom lives sleeps in). I felt that my mother was not properly taking care of him and took the responsible (or irresponsible) role as a dad/mom. We ate out since my mother cooked fried foods all the time and our clothes were not properly being washed due to the dysfunctional washer/dryer that she does not want to replace (even after receiving 100k from a different life insurance plan that my dad forgot to update to my name), and a whole array of other nit-picking bullshit that I could list. 

Now after being ""disrespectful"" to her and me being over the age of 18, she is kicking me out. She thinks that she is teaching me a lesson even though I fully know she is incapable of raising my brother alone. We've had several occurrences of ""disciplining"" my brother by grabbing him and yelling at him to the point of tears. This fact alone is not worth anything to CPS. but scares me since I do not know what would happen to him - side note, I overheard him thinking suicidal thoughts after he overhead me and my mom yelling and telling me that I can't stay here anymore. Moreover, my mom is receiving over $1800 from Social Security and is supposedly keeping it until he turns 18/21 (the story keeps on changing every time we fight) and gives $500 every month to my brother for expenses to which he gives to me since we eat out and do laundry at my grandma's. I keep that $500 in a separate account because it's not my money to use.

Now since I peruse r/personalfinance often, I try implementing many of your suggestions in investing this 300k. I have 200k split up into to managed accounts, 50k in a CD, and 50k in liquid assets in case of emergencies like me being kicked out. That being said, I am still in school full time, have an outstanding balance of around 15k in student loans, and I have already paid off ALL existing credit card debt I owe (&gt;$7000). I need some help figuring out my next steps in living on my own. My grandmother has told me to deal with it and try to compromise because the money I spend on rent would be wasted (I honestly agree with her, but the emotional stress is just too significant!). However, that being said I believe it's not worth living in a home that is un-supportive and unloving and in some cases have even impacted my grades due to constant fighting and yelling.

personalfinance,What should I be looking for when I open a new bank account?,"Hello everyone, apologies in advance if this isn't the correct forum for my questions. 

So I'm 22 and just graduated college. I will be moving to a new city on Monday to start grad school. My current bank (Citi) does not have any branches in the new city, so I'll have to open a new bank account. Unfortunately I'll have to do this alone this time around. I've come to realize that if I walk into a new bank, I'll have absolutely no idea what I should be looking for and what would be most to my benefit. 

So my options: it'll probably have to be either Bank of America or my new university's credit union. Looking online, it looks like credit unions have the benefits of lower interest rates and lower fees, while big banks have the benefit of reward points and cash back. 

I'll have an income of ~$3,000 a month, with about a third of that going to rent. Also, in the situation of an unexpectedly high expense, I can count on my parents lending me money to make sure that I don't miss the monthly payment in full. 

So at first glance I would imagine it would be better to go with BoA, to get the cash back rewards. I know that big banks also have higher fees, but I don't really remember paying many fees when I was with Citi (I think once for $5, and I've more than made that up with points). 

I guess my general question is what questions should I be asking to make sure that I'm making the right decision and that a big bank won't be trying to nickle and dime me? 

Sorry if this is a simple question, since I feel it has a simple answer.

personalfinance,I finally have a credit score and a credit card - now what?,"I'm 23 years old. Last year, my car gave out and the repairs to fix it cost more than the car, so I basically sold it for parts and started shopping around for a car. I found one that I liked and started the process for the loan only to find out my credit score was literally 0. I had never had a credit card before but I did owe money to two places: I had owed money to a vet from a couple of years ago, and I owed some money to a bank for some over draft fees. This was going to make it very hard to get a car, after going back and forth with them, I was able to get a loan based on my income (I make $60k a year), with a very high interest rate on the car. 

This was a real awakening. I instantly paid off the vet and bank that I was aware I owed money to, and began to make monthly payments on my car. I have now had the car for 10 months and have never been late on a car payment. I started to look into the details of different credit cards to figure out which one I should try to go for, during this I got something in the mail from Capital One (which is a credit card a couple of my co-workers recommended). So I went online, applied, and got accepted for a line of credit of $300. At this point, I still don't know what my credit score is, but Capital One has a service called Credit Wise which shows you stuff like this. Here are the details that it gives me (note: I have only had the credit card long enough to make 2 payments on it, both were on time, so some of the data regarding that isn't based on a long history):

Credit Score: 588 (Below Average)

So like I said, my credit line is currently only $300. I have had the card for a little over a month, and have been primarily using the credit card when I can, and then every pay check (twice a month), I pay the whole amount that I owe. Both times that I have paid have been on time.

Where should I go from here? I would ideally like to get to a point where I have a much higher credit line, $2-3k is my first goal. In addition to what I'm already doing (making car payments on time, paying off my credit card in whole every couple of weeks), what can I do to try to reach my goal? And about how long will it take (roughly, I know it's nearly impossible to try to predict it accurately). When would it be appropriate to ask for more credit, and how much should I ask for?

personalfinance,Switching from a lesser known bank to one that works with Android Pay + Samsung Pay.,"I am with Woodforest Bank (woodforest.com) right now because my mom is with them and she helps me with the bills sometimes and having an account there is easier cause she can just transfer money back and forth and I have an account with no fees whatsoever, so that's nice, too. I also get paid a day early but the convenience factor of this bank went down the tube when I moved from Alabama to Florida.

Now I live about 45 minutes from the closest branch and was thinking about switching to something like Allo or Navy Federal (dad was in the Coast Guard).

I wanted to switch because I just got the Note 7 and I'm tired of having to lug my wallet around with me. The only card I have that is supported (I think) is my Best Buy card. I have a case for my Note 7 that holds 2 cards but I prefer my debit card and everything else to be on my phone so I can use Samsung Pay. At least among other reasons (listed above).

Am I being stupid for wanting to make the switch?

If not, how should I go about making the switch when I have bills that come in automatically to that account? Should I do it slowly over the next few months or all at once?",finance,1471788845
personalfinance,Moving on to step 4 of the flowchart - which employer plan should I choose?,"Hi,

I'm 15 months out of college and into full time employment, and I've been trying to follow the [recommended guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). I make $48,000 a year, have saved up a $7,500 emergency fund, and recently paid off $9,900 in unsubsidized Stafford loans (~6.8% interest). I still have $7,100 in subsidized Stafford loans at a 4.15% interest rate, and I'm making $400/mo payments to have them paid off by March 2018. I'd like to now start putting some money towards a retirement plan. 

I work for a hospital that does not offer any employer match for 401k contributions. The hospital does offer a pension that vests after three years, and a number of options through Fidelity for a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA, I think this is the same as a 403b?) that I've listed below.

What would be the recommended strategy here? Should I pick one of the employer sponsored plans, or go with an independent options? I'm planning to begin a PhD program in two years, so I'd like to maximize my investment now before my salary drops to the grad student stipend level. Any advice would be very much appreciated.

personalfinance,"Is it possible to ""pay"" student loans like this?","**Debt background:**

**College:**  ~130k 
1) 80-90k of this is in the form of parent PLUS Loans cosigned by my parents with vomit-inducing interest rates around 8-8.5% 
2) the Remaining 40-50k is in Stafford/Perkins loans with rates around 3-6%

**Medical school:** ~50k, mostly Stafford grad loans ~6.5% interest

I managed to work a lot during my last year of medical school (I don't advice!) and save ~10-15k for living expenses, travel to residency interviews and such. Thus, this year I took out 10-15k less in med school loans than in previous years.

**The question:** Is it ""legal"" to take out an additional 15-20k of loans this year (under the guise of needing it for residency) and immediately throwing it at the parent PLUS loans with highest interest?

My parents took out parent PLUS loans to help me realize my medical school dreams and I would have never accomplished any of this without their help. Sticking them with the bill is not an option, but they cannot currently make the minimum payments on these loans, which are currently in deferral and thus accruing interest.

In my poorly financially-educated mind, this plan would save me from a couple % points of interest (I would have 15-20k at 6.5% WITH REPAYMENT/FORGIVE OPTIONS! vs 15-20k of parent plus at 8.5% with no REPAYE or similar options). 

**If it matters:**
Currently a 28 year old 4th year medical student applying to residency. My training will take 4-6 years, depending on whether I pursue a fellowship. Expect to make 250-350k as attending. I own nothing and the only thing I have to my name is debt.

personalfinance,Help! - Collections Agency trying to collect 38K on old 7.2K Student loan I believe I’m already paying or have paid.,"TLDR: Student loan from 1997 for $7.2K that I believe I’m paying on, Debt collector contacting me about trying to collect $38K for in 2016.

&amp;nbsp;


Hi Reddit – First off, apologies for the wall of text.  I’m turning to you to see if there is any guidance you can provide as to next steps.  I received a collection letter for a student loan that I took out in 1997 for $7.2K that a collections agency contacted  me  about via mail recently stating that I now owed, $38K.   The collections agency said that they had been referred to them by the “Department of Education”.  However, I have a monthly payment against my student loans that I make to Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) which I understand is the official student loan servicer for the Department of Education.  When I log into Navient’s site, all of my loans are in good standing.

&amp;nbsp;


So within 30 days of receiving the initial notice, I responded in writing to the collection agency asking for details about the debt and why the collection agency felt that I was obligated to pay the debt.  Specifically I asked 12 points below.  I did receive a response back, most of my inquiries have not been answered.  Where I have received response, I’ve filled in the information below.  Also, the collection agency and original collection letter details in question are:

&amp;nbsp;


FMS Investment Corp
P.O. Box 1423
Elk Grove Village, IL 60009-1423
T: 1-800-889-6321
F: 1-800-880-4583

&amp;nbsp;


Principle: $18.8K
Interest: $11.7K
Penalty: $0
Fees &amp; Costs: $7.4K
Total:  $38K

&amp;nbsp;


I am based in Washington State:

&amp;nbsp;

1)	I Dispute the debt as all of my student loans are currently in good standing w/ the official loan servicer for the U.S. department of education as reflected on their official website.  

**[No response in reply – None expected frankly]**

&amp;nbsp;

2)	If this debt started with a different creditor, provide the name and address of the original creditor, the account number used by that creditor, and the amount owed to that creditor at the time it was transferred. When you identify the original creditor, please provide any other name by which I might know them, if that is different from the official name. In addition, tell me when the current creditor obtained the debt and who the current creditor obtained it from.

**[Response indicates that the debt was originally held by U.S. Department of Education, and was referred to FMS Investment Corporation for the purpose of securing payment on the delinquent account]**

&amp;nbsp;


3)	Provide verification and documentation that there is a valid basis for claiming that I am required to pay the debt to the current creditor and that the debt is not currently in good standing. For example, can you provide a copy of the written agreement that created my original requirement to pay?

**[Response included a copy of the original Federal Direct Stafford/William D. Ford Loan agreement paperwork I filled out in 1997.  The loan amount approved was for $7.2K which is NOT the same amount as the principal listed in the first collection letter]**

&amp;nbsp;


I then followed up asking for additional information about the collection agency authorization to collect the debt.  Specifically:

4)	I asked for information about the firm before discussing any theoretical debt with them. Does the firm have a debt collection license from my state? If not, say why not. If so, provide the date of the license, the name on the license, the license number, and the name, address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license.

**[No Response]**

&amp;nbsp;

5) If you are contacting me from a place outside my state, does your firm have a debt collection license from that place? If so, provide the date of the license, the name on the license, the license number, and the name, address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license.

**[No Response]**

&amp;nbsp;

Then I asked for details about the standing of the debt itself.  Specifically, I asked for:

6)	A copy of the last billing statement sent to me by the original creditor.

**[No Response]**

&amp;nbsp;

7)	State the amount of the debt when you obtained it, and when that was.

**[No Response]**

&amp;nbsp;

8)	If there have been any additional interest, fees or charges added since the last billing statement from the original creditor, provide an itemization showing the dates and amount of each added amount. In addition, explain how the added interest, fees or other charges are expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or are permitted by law.

**[No Response]**

&amp;nbsp;

9)	If there have been any payments or other reductions since the last billing statement from the original creditor, provide an itemization showing the dates and amount of each of them.

**[No Response]**

&amp;nbsp;

10)	 If there have been any other changes or adjustments since the last billing statement from the original creditor, please provide full verification and documentation of the amount you are trying to collect. Explain how that amount was calculated. In addition, explain how the other changes or adjustments are expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.

**[No Response]**

&amp;nbsp;

11)	 Tell me when the creditor claims this debt became due and when it became delinquent.

**[No Response]**

&amp;nbsp;

12)	 Identify the date of the last payment made on this account.

personalfinance,401K vs Student Loans,"I'm sure this has been answered already, so I'm sorry to ask, I did look.

Without getting too far into specifics (can be provided if necessary), I graduated veterinary school recently with about 190K in student loans. I have a variety of private and government loans with various interest rates. My job does not offer any retirement plan, so I know I need to find a fiduciary to help me manage that.

I plan on paying down the private loans quickly and doing REPAYE on the rest. Is there a resource that will help me plan where the balance point is between putting more money into retirement vs loans to balance the money I gain on the retirement accounts vs the money lost on loan interest? I just want to make the best financial decisions possible.

personalfinance,strategies for housing upgrade,"I'm looking for advice on how best to finance the purchase of a new primary residence.

Currently I

*  earn about $160k/year
*  have about $350k accumulated in two non-retirement investment accounts, split $185k and $165k
*  owe $285k on a mortgage for my current residence, which is worth about $530k according to comparable sales
*  owe $12k on a car loan at a minuscule interest rate

My current residence is in one of those hot markets you've heard so much about and I'd like to upgrade within the same area. Unfortunately I lost out on my first offer since it included a sales contingency on my current property. That's why I need help.

My mortgage broker will approve me for up to $800k if I don't sell my existing home. I have no intention of keeping the property and without that debt on the books I'd be approved up to $1.2m. I'd really like to purchase in the $900k-$1m range. Conceptually I'd love to sell for $530k and use the profit (plus $50-75k proceeds from investments) to put 30% down on a $1m property. But that requires the sales contingency and so any reasonably competitive offer is unlikely to be accepted.

Some options I've considered:

*  make an unreasonable offer so high that the seller is willing to accept the sales contingency; I hate this idea since it contributes to the pricing problem in our area 
*  sell first and rent; this is a problem since the rental market is no cooler in my area and it's likely I'd need to lease for a full year; I'm also not thrilled with the idea of moving twice
*  sell with a rent-back clause; my concern is the risk of not having an offer accepted before the rent-back agreement expires, panicking, and then grossly overpaying to secure a new place to live
*  sell $200-250k worth of investments for the downpayment and sell the old property after closing on the new one; this is painful since I'll owe taxes on all of the investment proceeds
*  rent my property for a year; once I secure a rental agreement the debt won't count against my mortgage limit but this introduces a new wrinkle, I don't really want to be a landlord

Are there any other options that I'm missing? Can I purchase the new property with less of a down payment (10%? 15%?) and then refinance with 30% equity after I've sold my current property?

Thanks in advance for your help!",finance,1471840606
personalfinance,Voya Retirement Question [1+ million USD],"Hello Personal Finance, first let me say: sorry for the long post and thanks for taking the time to read this question. 

Some Background: 

----------------------


My father recently became blind and was forced into retirement. I moved back home to help out while things were settled and during the process of doing his retirement paperwork his 401k became an issue of discussion. 

My father has worked at the same (oil) company for 30+ yrs and had 100% of his 401k invested in a single company stock. Said stock had an average yield of 3% but a 52 week avg between 50 and 100 USD per share. This wild price fluctuation is a long term trend. Over the years the yield was never withdrawn, but reinvested into the company stock.

I had mentioned that there was talk (in multiple countries) of charging oil companies for damages (climate change) under RICO laws [[1](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/science/exxon-mobil-under-investigation-in-new-york-over-climate-statements.html)] [[2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-fossil-fuel-industrys-campaign-to-mislead-the-american-people/2015/05/29/04a2c448-0574-11e5-8bda-c7b4e9a8f7ac_story.html?utm_term=.d04f6cd1d744)] [[3](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/sep/29/is-the-fossil-fuel-industry-like-the-tobacco-industry-guilty-of-racketeering)] - like the tobacco companies - and that he should consider investing in Vanguard (Market) Index funds. Working with a Vanguard Financial Advisor that has an fiduciary responsibility with him. In the long run, I don't trust anyone to beat the market, and the low yield + volatility made it worth considering. Hedge your bets. 

Now, he has no need to withdraw money from the 401k (between Pension and Social Security Disability) and plans to just let it sit until he HAS to start withdrawing by law (~ half a decade from now). I dont think he understands the tax ramifications from dying before it is fully liquidated. Nor the real (IMO) risk of higher tax rates before then. It will take around 2 decades @ ~80k/yr. I have suggested that he max out his tax bracket (he doesn't want to pay ""high taxes now"" and start paying taxes (withdrawal) on as much of the 401k as he can before taxes are raised in his twilight years. His income is not dropping - as I remind him. He will never be in a lower bracket to take advantage of. Take the 401k withdrawals, (since he has no desire to spend the money as income), place it into a trust, and have the trust (and not him) sit on it - reinvested in Market Funds. 

Now here is where it gets interesting. My father has no financial knowledge and **ZERO** desire to learn, or really ability to at this point. He has no idea *why* markets behave the way they do. He fully trusts whatever an ""expert"" tells him (I have heard him repeat wrong information from ""News"" stations) and has zero desire to do independent research, etc. Nor does he really have the ability now beyond asking people verbally. As he triggered his retirement, VOYA who manages his account called him up to discuss the 401k. In the call he spoke of the possibility of liquidating the stocks and buying ""funds""...  and they sold him on three funds over the phone after speaking with him for a few mins. No research done into the funds beyond what he was told over the phone. (I wasn't there) 

I believe that it was a salesman just trying to get a commission, and not in my fathers best interest. The fees are high, and I am not thrilled with what VOYA placed him in. There seems to be a lot of risk. Furthermore, he seemed confused about what he actually was sold: saying ""it has a great yield and is safe"". He also described it as ""those Market index funds you were talking about"", which they are not. I would like your input. It is worth mentioning that he is comfortable with VOYA (""they are the pros"") and does not want to change over to Vanguard - whom he has never heard of (guess commercials really work). He is open with other VOYA products though. 

He was sold: 

* Yoya Intermediate Bond Fund

* Voya GNMA Income Fund

* Voya High Yield Bond Fund

--------------------

As I see it...

* Voya Intermediate Bond Fund:

A 2.6% yield, with a 0.66% expense ratio. 

Yield to Expense of 25%

* Voya GNMA Income Fund 

A 2.9% yield with a 0.93% expense ratio!

Yield to Expense of 32%

* Voya High Yield Bond Fund

A 5.19% yield, with a 1.07% expense ratio!

Yield to Expense of 20%

--------------------

At first glance all three of these funds concern me - to be honest. My educational background is in economics (MACRO, not micro or in PFP) and I fully admit that I am bearish about the upcoming years. This has absolutely tainted my viewpoint, and that is why I am seeking a range of opinions here. The High Yield Bonds seem to me to be glorified junk that is only valuable due to the FEDS Interest Rate Policy of ZIRP / NIRP. Not stable long term, as was seen in 08 when the fund crashed alongside the economy. 

The Voya GNMA income Fund looks like a glorified ponzi scheme - reliant on a continuing housing boom in the country to retain any yield. Much less prevent a loss in principle. Thus, the health of this fund seems predicated on the Federal Reserves ability to provide liquidity in the form of negative interest rates/near zero (fund new construction), continuing growth in employment (ignoring upcoming automation), and for the aging demographics to be ignored.

Even if you consider loans to governments safe, the Voya Intermediate Bond Fund seems lack-luster in its return / fees considering how much risk it caries (more and more governments are discussing bond default as a solution to budget shortfalls). That last part is just my opinion. I understand the conventional wisdom is government bonds = safe. You do not have to post to remind me.

Anyhow. Enough ranting. 

Thoughts? Recommendations **within Voya for better funds**?

Ideas in general?

personalfinance,How to get out from under upside-down car loan?,"Hi, my fiancee and I bought a car almost 2 years ago. (Washington state, USA) We are trying to save for our wedding now, and this car is expensive to have and maintain. 
Intially, the loan was for $17,800, at 9% interest rate (luxury car, used). The car was worth about $13,900 at the time, and we also got a 3 year warranty. 
We've put a lot of miles on the car commuting to work and some road trips, and it now has 117,000 miles. It's a 2008 Volvo S80 T6 AWD. Great car, but expensive to maintain and not-great gas mileage.
We pay $380.00 per month, on a 4 year loan. It's Wells Fargo. 
We still owe $12,144, but the car is now only worth about $7,500. 
We would prefer keeping it for roadtrips/groceries...etc, but trying to lower the monthly payment if we do. 
Would it be best to refinance? ...or is it even an option due to the upside-down value? My credit score is around 700, and my fiancee doesn't have much of a credit history yet so I'd probably keep it under my name. 
Also, what are my options if we want to sell or trade in the car? 
TLDR: 
Upside-down on $380/month car loan
$12,140 still left to pay/car is only worth $7,500

personalfinance,Selling my house or not? We've owned our south florida home since 2013. About to relocate to atlanta. Wondering if it makes more sense to keep the house or sell.,"Hello everyone, 
A few details about the townhouse: 
Purchased in 2013. 
Interest Rate: 4.5% becomes variable in 2018. 
House value was $170k
Renovation costs: $15000
Closing costs: $5000 (might be off by a few)
House could probably sell for $215k
Could probably rent for $1700 if an extra $5000 is spent on floors, backyard, front yard 
Taxes: $3700
Monthly HOA: $170
Insurance: $3100
Equity in house is about $100k

Another point of importance:
 the houses in the community have been subject to major underground plumbing issues. Several neighbours had to spend between 2000 to 10000 in plumbing repairs. 

As stated in the title we will be relocating to Atlanta in the next 6 months or so. 
We will probably rent initially to figure out where we want to live and then purchase. 
There is a chance that we will move 
 to the west coast after 3-4 years in Georgia.

personalfinance,Should I transfer my high interest auto loan to my new 0% interest credit card?,"A few years ago, when I was young, clueless, and had no business getting an auto loan... I got an auto loan. The interest rate is embarrassingly terrible. The original loan amount was somewhere around $10k, and now the balance is about $7800. I have no trouble making the payments every month, and have never missed one (if there is any good news there). The winning combination of a high interest rate and a low down payment means I'm very underwater on the vehicle. KBB puts it at about $4,000 private sale. 

After a couple years of educating myself, I've boosted my credit score from the very low 600's up to just over 700, and got my first unsecured credit card. It's the Chase Freedom with 0% interest for 15 months, and free balance transfers. The credit limit is $7,000.

So now that you have (hopefully) all the relevant information, we can get to my question. Would it be a good idea to transfer the $7k from my auto loan onto the new card, and just pay the remaining $900 to close the account? The upside is obviously saving a TON of money in interest, and I'm confident that with no interest, we'd be able to aggressively pay the loan down in 15 months. Even if we didn't quite get it all paid, the interest rate on the card is still lower than the existing rate on the auto loan.

The downside to this is the obvious hit my credit would take. Maxing out a card, and closing out an older account would make quite the ding, I would imagine. How bad and for how long would this impact my credit score? Would it bounce back immediately when the card's balance was paid down? Would it look terrible on my credit report for years, making lenders wary of me? Am I just better off staying the course, plugging away at the auto loan and throwing all the extra money I can at it?",finance,1471878922

2. Pay it off slowly, calling the company to renegotiate the interest rate

3. Borrow the money from a friend, and pay them off over time (this eliminates any hits to my credit score, and although I would pay interest, I would have a tad bit more flexibility, not that I plan on using it)

personalfinance,Student Loan in collections 3 months delinquent... Thought I was paying it on time... Advice?,"Hey r/personalfinance,

I had a debt to my university go to collections for roughly 1800 dollars. I learned that my parents were hiding my mail from me, so I didn't even know I had debt to the university - I thought it was all to my federal student loan (I know I know I was irresponsible, I've got my shit together or at least I thought I did now).

When I learned of my debt, I (thought) I had set up a payment plan for 100 dollars a month. I was told by a member of the collections office at my University through email that I was set up for that payment plan, and that I could sign up for automatic payments online at the website. I did that, and on the first of every month I check to make sure 100 bucks has been paid out to them. It has been.

I recently decided to apply for a credit card to build some credit. Did my research, found one that I knew almost for sure that I would be approved for. Got denied. Checked my credit score, and my Equifax is trashed. Went from 694 down to 460 something. Checked and it's saying this debt is delinquent, and that I owe it in full (just over 1500 dollars). 

Is there anything I can do? I'm waiting to get on the phone with them right now, but I still have the emails from the collections office at my school agreeing to set me up for that payment plan every month. I have no idea if that is even valid or what, but this is really killing me. I've been saving money, throwing as much into my debts as I can, trying to build credit, living as frugally as possible, and I feel like that's all been for nothing at this point.

I appreciate any and all thoughts and advice!

personalfinance,"What to do with my ""fun money"" acct when I'm not really doing anything fun? (+other general PF questions about savings)","Hi everyone! My first post here.
This sub is so so helpful but at the same time there is SO MUCH information. After reading many posts I'm still a little confused so please bear with me and please help me sort out my situation?

**The background**: I'm a 30-something professional making ~90k/yr. My husband makes ~150k/yr. We just got married last year. We put most of our paycheck into our joint account but we both put small portion of our paycheck each month (like ~$500) into our own individual checking account for whatever personal stuff (""fun money"").

Here come the questions......

**Savings**:We've started saving a little each month and currently we're putting them away on our Ally savings acct, which bears 1% interest (best I could find at the time). We've both been in school for a long time so we've only just started saving and have ~20k in savings at this point :( FYI, we live in a pretty expensive area and want to buy a house sooner than later. I'm not sure if we should be investing to grow this $ more quickly or keep it conservative and just keep funneling into our trusty Ally savings. Realistically we'd need at least 100-120K for down payment where we are, so we still have few years of savings to go.

**Employer-sponsored retirement**: We are both participating in our employer's retirement plans with max contribution. No plans to change this.

**Roth IRA**: I have a small Roth IRA acct (~$2000) from 2014 before I was married but I understand that I am no longer eligible for Roth IRA since we are jointly filing and make more than 180k/yr. It's invested in VTI for now.. I'm guessing I just forget about this until I hit 55 and cash out then?

**My personal ""fun money"" acct**: Even though $500/mo isn't huge, I've managed to save about $5000 in my personal checking this past year. What should I be doing with this money? Since I am no longer eligible for Roth IRA should I just open another Ally savings and get at least 1% interest? Or invest in more VTI etf through a traditional brokerage acct for a little more return (but I'd pay ~20% tax on capital gains)? I've read a little on backdoor Roth IRA but that also means I can't withdraw the $ until I am 55, correct? Ideally I'd like this acct to be somewhat liquid so that I can use the $ to do something fun every now and then... But get more than 0.00% interest rate I get from my current checking acct when I don't need it (which is... most of the time. Turns out I don't do much fun stuff).

I guess my biggest question is, what do I do with my fun money acct when I'm not spending it? I don't mind keeping couple thousand in checking acct for all sorts of emergency and what not, but I feel like the rest could be earning more elsewhere.

personalfinance,Advice on CC debt repayment,"Hello all, 

I read PF here and there and thought this would be a good place to ask about my own debt.

Currently, I take home after taxes $4,731 dollars, a combination of my salary (60k annually, and my VA comp of $1200 monthly).  I also contribute 6% of my pre-tax salary to my employers 401k matching. 

I currently have three credit cards that I would like to pay off:


CC #1- $3,500

CC #2 - $1459

CC#3 - $2000

Total - $6,959


CC 1 and 2 have  a typical interest rate for CCs between 16 to 20%.   CC #3 is a card that currently is under a 6 month no interest repayment of the 2k. 

I have approximately 2k in savings and another 1k or so in cash.  I also generally have about 1k a month to spare after all my bills are paid, including a $500 dollars for general ""entertainment"" expenses. 

Should I empty my savings and and pay off CC#1, and then move onto CC #2?  Or should I retain some money in my savings?  I just bought my house and everything is brand new, so I don't expect any surprises, spending wise.  My cards are also not maxed out so I could always charge new expenses.  

I know this is a common question, but what should I do?",finance,1471908206
personalfinance,Need help making decisions regarding my refinance. Please advice.,"Hello All,

I am in the process of refinancing my house and wasn't sure what the right step forward should be:

**House Info**

Bought in 2014

Purchase Price: 505k

Initial Down Payment 22.5k [FHA with PMI]

Principal: 482.5k 

 Interest Rate: 3.75% at 30 year fixed.

**New Information**

Appraised Value: 565k

Principal left: 467k

Cash on Hand: 30k

Interest Rate offered: 3.75% at 30 year fixed. [Lender pays Closing Costs]

**Options**

------------------------------

*Option 1: Do Nothing*

Mortgage Payments = $2163 + $78 [PMI] = $2231 for 2 years. $2163 after. 

At the current rate PMI will drop off after 2 years without a refinance. 

-----------------------------

*Option 2: Put 15k down in Principal to get rid of PMI*

New Principal = 452k

New Mortgage Payment = $2093

Savings = $70pm for 30 years + $78pm for 2 years = $27,072

-----------------------------

*Option 3: Put 8.1k in Closing Costs*

New Interest Rate= 3.35%

New Mortgage Payment = $2058 + $78 for 2 years.

Savings = $105pm for 30 years = $37,800

-----------------------------

*Option 4: Put 23.1k to get rid of PMI and get lower Interest Rate*

New Interest Rate= 3.35%

New Principal = 452k

New Payments = $1992

Savings = $171pm for 30 years and $78pm for 2 years = $61560 + $1872 = $63432

--------------------------------------




Option 1 doesn't hurt my emergency fund at all. 

Option 3 seems to give me the best return on investment and also doesn't hurt my emergency fund much. But if the rates fall and I decide to refinance in another year or two. This money will become waste. 

Option 4 seems to save the most money long term but hurts my emergency fund quite a bit. 


If I go with Option 1, any extra money I get over my emergency fund would go into IRAs or 401ks or Brokerage accounts. 




I am leaning towards Option 3. Does my math seem correct and is it is a wise decision to go for Option 3?

personalfinance,Getting constant VA Streamline offers. Is Nationwide any good?,"Nationwide called me a few weeks ago, and again today.  I did a 0 down VA home purchase last year at %3.85.  The home is a bit of a stretch, but we don't plan on moving - both of us work for government in one form or another.

Anyway, VA loans can be ""streamlined"" if the interest rates go down.  Nationwide is offering a refi in the neighborhood of 3.25% with no fees (the VA restricts what they can charge) meaning nothing out of pocket, and nothing rolled into the loan.

So, I remember Nationwide getting ripped to shreds due to their practices before the housing crash.  Have they gotten better?  Is doing business with them a foolish idea?",finance,1471909544
personalfinance,"Need advice, deep in debt...","Hey, all.

Let me start this by saying I've always been terrible with money, but I've just began to realize how bad of a spot I've put myself in. I'm sincere in my desire to get out of debt, and I'm so sick of living paycheck to paycheck, especially at this age. 

I bring home roughly 2900 a month after taxes (salaried so that doesn't change)

I've gotten myself into so much debt being frivolous and living above my means. I also got married 4 months ago and paying for a wedding with mostly credit cards was an obviously terrible idea. My wife doesn't know how bad my finances are because we are living apart while she finishes up school.

It just hit me that I'm $100,000 in debt. 

I owe $50,000 on a truck I bought last year. I actually got a hell of a deal on it, but I had some negative equity from a previous vehicle. I'd be lucky to get 35,000- 40,000 selling it Payment is $700 a month. 

I owe $32,000 in student loans. Not ideal, but interest rates are not too bad paying $250 a month there. 

Now my credit card debt. 

Discovercard-13,000= 250 a month minimum payment
Chasecard-1,500= 50 a month minumum 
Barclaycard-6,500= $200 a month minimum

Rent, insurance, utilities, Internet, etc. is another 600 a month. 

Basically I'm spending $2000ish a month on just bills. That only leaves me $900 in spending cash a month which may sound like a lot but when you take gas/food/things that come up out of that, it doesn't leave much at all. Pretty much just getting by making minimum payments. 


I had really really good credit (790) up until about a year ago then it started tanking with my rising debts. Now sitting in the 690 range. I've never missed a payment in my 10+ years of credit history. 

The obvious answer is sell my truck, put that money towards credit cart debt. When I owe 10-15k more than it's hard to do. Am I stupid for wanting to get a large consolidation loan and put the negative equity of my truck and all credit card debt into that? Is it possible? 

Need some advice. No need to remind me how bad of a hole I've gotten myself in, I'm well aware and feel like a piece of shit now that I've finally woke up.",finance,1471912463

personalfinance,"21yo with $31,435.52 in debt looking to get my life together","tldr; Trying to get my life together but am completely out of my depth. Don't have a degree and can't afford one. Don't have a very good job. Got a lot of debt going on.

Okay y'all, here's the wall of text explaining everything. I tried to bold important information. Sorry if it's way too much, I just really wanted to be thorough. 

Grew up middle class until the economy tanked and then my family was struggling. We were too poor to afford nice things but not poor enough to qualify for assistance. When I was getting ready for college, I had a $0 expected family contribution. We couldn't afford for me to apply to many schools (even with application fees waived) and I ended up only being accepted to one school that was very expensive. My parents didn't qualify for a parent plus loan (my father declared bankruptcy twice while I was a kid, once when I was very young and once when I was a sophomore in high school), which was the majority of my financial aid package. I had some scholarships and grants, but not enough. My school told me that my federal loans and grants would pick up what the parent plus loan was going to and I would be covered. (I talked to the financial aid three times before starting classes, in person and over email. What lying jerks.) It wasn't covered. My mother managed to keep me in school for the year to avoid the ridiculous fees associated with breaking my housing contract, but **I have an outstanding debt with the university of $15,353.98**. It is currently being handled by a collections agency, but the debt is still with the university. That means that I cannot get a copy of my official transcript to attempt to get my degree in a smarter way. I don't know what the interest level is, but am working to find out. **My federal loans (which are consolidated) are $12,294.23 with a 4.125% interest rate.** They're currently not requiring payments because my income is so low. In order to try and cover books and plane tickets home, I used a credit card. **That credit card currently has a balance of $2,174.44 with a 15.4% interest rate.** I understand that that interest rate is way too high, but I'm not sure how to go about getting a credit card with a lower interest rate and am not sure how to get my credit score. I looked up my credit report right before making this post, but it wanted me to pay for my score. 

In attempt to make the money to deal with this debt and get my degree, I joined the military. But after a week in basic training I was medically disqualified. Right before I left, I was attacked by a hornet. I'm uninsured because I was planning on having military insurance this year. **The hospital bill is $748 and $864.87.** I can call the company handling the larger bill for financial assistance and plan to. 

I've been back from basic training for a week and can't rejoin anytime soon and I'm not sure if I want to. I don't have any savings (been living paycheck to paycheck and anytime I've been able to save something's happened). **I have a part time job that pays $10.50/hour**, but hours aren't guaranteed.  Before I left for basic I was making $500-$600 a month from my main job (sometimes more, sometimes less but that seems about average). Scheduling is flexible so it makes it easy to work other jobs. **I have a religious school position for two-three hours on Mondays that will pay $25 an hour**, but won't start until the end of September. **I have a different religious school job for Saturday mornings and potentially a few other hours a week. That will be $35/hour plus extra for working on Saturdays (around $125 a Saturday)**. That also won't begin for close to a month. I am also trying to get an office/assisting position at the private school that my mother is currently employed at. It would be five day a week 8am to 4pm hours while school is in session. Not sure what that would pay yet, but more than $10/hour. (Minimum wage in my state is $8.38). If I don't get the school position I am going to try to get a job delivering pizzas as I have done that before. It made about $9/hour plus tips and reimbursement for gas and I was able to get 40+ hours a week and around $60 of tips a night in cash. The only issue with that is it would be really hard on my car which isn't in the best shape.

I'm currently living with my mother and my 17yo brother. I want to stay through June to be able to help support my mother (being a single parent of a teenager is difficult) and be there for the important events in my brother's life before he goes off into the world. My mother is currently paying my car insurance and cell phone bill and that's a responsibility that I need to take on. **My bills each month are currently $129** (that's the minimum on my credit card, not even covering the interest on my university balance in collections, and a prescription). I used the little savings I had built to go to my older brother's wedding across the country, car repairs, and buying things I needed for basic training (running shoes, sports bras, etc). I have only enough money in the bank to cover my bills this month and keep a balance in my account. I've already started back to work at my part time job, picking up as many hours as I can. **I want to start paying all my own bills by January. By June I want to have enough in savings to move in with my boyfriend** (who is about to start training to be an emt so that he'll be able to help support me) **a few states away in our own apartment** (meaning I'll need a security deposit, first and last month's rent, etc) **and start at the local community college for dental assisting and then dental hygiene**. The school is very heavily subsidized and offers a lot of financial aid, accepts federal aid (gotta get that Pell grant), and has options for payment plans. They also have several options (CLEPS, Dantes, AP scores) for me to get credit for most of what I took in school already (and since I was a note taker I might even be able to get credit for classes I never officially took). I will be able to have residency there as long as I've been living in the county for three months prior to classes starting (another reason to move in June). If possible, I would like to have the money to take a semester of classes (one or two courses, not full time) before I move down there. I also know that I need to build an emergency fund for myself, but I'm not sure how much it needs to be and what place that should be on my priority list. I did read the article, but I'm not sure what to do in my situation since my monthly expenses are so low and my debt is so high. $1,000 maybe?

Sorry, I know that this was a lot of information. I just feel really lost and I wanted to answer questions before they could be asked. I feel like I'm too old to be working barely above minimum wage jobs and living with my mother in her barely two bedroom apartment. It's a lot of pressure on her to be taking care of me and my brother and it's not fair to either of them. I'm an adult and I need to get it together. I don't want to be relying on anyone anymore.

personalfinance,Can we afford this house?,"Hello PF, long time lurker here. My husband(33M) and I(30F)are in the midst of looking to buy our first home. We live in Australia, I'm an expat with PR, he's a citizen. 

On our hunt to look for our first home we have been advised that it might be a better idea to buy vacant land and build a new home. This is because the government will chip in $20,000 to use toward a deposit. You also get a reduced stamp duty (tax).

So last week after months of looking I found a new development that I LOVE. He also like it but is much more hesitant with the costs. I come from a major metropolis in the US where housing in crazy expensive, so it sounds like a bargain to me. The land parcel also isn't huge like he's used to, he's from a more country Australian town (cheap large land). So our views of what is small greatly differ. Just for reference the land is 4600 sq feet or 430m2. This leaves us the ability to have a nice 2 story home with a modest back yard. However there is a big park that's going to be just across the street. How great, right? There will also be attached to that lovely park a centre with 2 pools, a gym, and a large walking path around the development that goes along a little canal that actually connects to the ocean. The beach is 10 minutes drive away, and there is a train and an upcoming tram that will connect us to the centre of the city being put in by 2018. There is also a large shopping centre a stones throw away. Basically it is going to be amazing. Both of our jobs will also be less than 20minutes drive (his is only going to be 8!) 

Now he also has reservations regarding the cost. Remember he's a country boy and used to big open spaces for dirt cheap? Well we don't live there anymore, thank god! So he's a bit shocked by how much it costs to live in a city now. We've been renting in the city for the past 2 years and live in a location on the water for $370 per week (pw) and have many amenities within walking distance.

So after all that rambling here's the numbers:
Land cost: $340,000
Build cost: $280,000(including upgrades)
Stamp duty:$7,000
Lenders Mortage Insurance: $9,000
Fee's: $1,395
Total: $637,395

Joint Savings: $17,000
My US savings: $25,000
First Homebuyers grant: $20,000
Builders rebate: $12,000
Total: $74,000

Loan required $563,395
 
Interest rates are super low currently, so we'd qualify for 3.75% based on our credit and income. 
My income: $85,000 pretax, take home $$2,400 biweekly
His income: $65,000 pretax, take home $850-1100 weekly, depending on OT
We also get an additional 9.5% into our super fund (401K) by our employers
No CC debt, just for monthly expenses, gets paid in full every month. 

Expenses:
Car: paid off and he has a work vehicle and a motorcycle
Gas: $40 per week
Registration and insurance: 
Phones+Internet:250 monthly
Private insurance: $290
Electricity: $500 every 3 months
Food: $250-350 per week (we like to eat out, but I also love cooking with fresh products)
Entertainment/travel: $200-500 per month


Lastly, the land wouldn't be ready for settlement until Jan 2017, but they're needing a 5% deposit until then to hold it for us ASAP. 

Thanks in advance if you've made it down this far!

I have more big purchases Q1/2 2018 and need a realistic view of my cash situation to make sure I do not have to push any back or dip into savings.

  
  
Total Income: 180k  
Living in Texas:  
8000 Solar Credit  
3000 Health Insurance Annual Premium  
6000 Property Tax (Texas)  
8400 Mortgage Deduction  
5500 Traditional IRA (I did not qualify for enrollment in a retirement plan at either job in 2016 so I get the deduction)  
Can’t claim sales tax due to claiming state income taxes (I’ve read I can only have one or the other).  

  
  
Job 1 in MA:  
6700 OASDI  
1570 Medicare  
21600 Federal Tax (on 108k)  
5240 MA Tax (on 108k)  

  
  
Job 2 in CA:  
15000 Federal Tax (on 72k)  
1040 Medicare  
4460 OASDI  
4350 CA Tax (on 72k)  
650 CA OASDI  

  
  
My payroll department MA had 5 deductions on Federal, but only 2 on state. In CA I have 5 on federal and 0 on CA.

  
  
By my calculations, the deductions for Federal Taxes should be:  
3000 Health + 6000 Property Tax + 8400 Mortgage Deduction + 5500 Traditional IRA + 5240 MA Income Tax + 4350 CA Income Tax + 650 CA Bullcrap Tax + 2900 Personal Deduction =  
42240 Federal Deduction 

  
  
My State Tax liabilities calculations are simpler, I think mine are:  
MA 108k – 4.4k (single/personal deduction) = 103.6k * .0515 =  5335 which puts me at about even for MA. MA has a nonresident proration but I think this only applies if I paid MA tax on non-MA income.

  
  
CA 72k – no deduction = 72k * .0527 (effective off their progressive tax schedule) = 3796. So I will have overpaid by 550. I cannot get out of CA OASDI from what I have read, but it is federal tax deductible.

  
   
I will have overpaid OASDI since I changed job mid-year and hit the limit around then as well, calculation is 180k – 118.5k = 61.5k * .062 = 3813 overpaid.

  
  
So I am looking at:  
180000 – 42240 = 137760 * .2295 (effective tax rate off IRS tax schedule) = 31609 – 36600 (federal tax paid) = 4991

  
  
So final calculation of my tax return is 4991 from the federal government, plus 3813 overpayment for OASDI, plus 8000 solar credit, plus 550 net return from state taxes for a total check of 17354 come tax return time.

Background: I am 24 years old, married, have a 4-year degree (BS in Economics) and I just received work authorization from my US residency application. I have no debts, my wife has $3000 in student debt. I am currently unemployed and she works part time.


Situation: It is very probable that I will receive a job offer in Houston for a Commercial Collector position. The proposed salary will most likely be 36k and I have been told that new hires make $8000 to $14,000 in commission. 


Questions:

Question 1) I have never filed such a large income for my taxes (Last year I made 11k) so I am very excited. But at the same time I am scared that taxes and withholds will eat away a large shunk of that salary. Assuming I was paid $3000 monthly, how much will my net pay be?
I tried using this calculator:  http://www.adp.com/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/payroll-calculators/salary-paycheck-calculator.aspx . 
I entered my Federal Filing Status as Married and my wife as 1 allowance and got the following:


Gross Pay:3000.00
Federal: 215.21
Fica: 186.00
Medicare: 43.50
State: 0.00
Net Pay: 2555.29


Is this an accurate number? It seems too high to me. I have little familiarity with the US tax system since my University did my taxes for me.


Question 2) Assuming that my Net Pay is $2500 I am not sure how much I should be spending in rent.  I currently (parents pay for rent and bills atm) have a 2 bedroom unit (1 and 1/2 hrs away from Houston) that costs $600 monthly (has water and internet bills included), we spend $150 in utilities an $100 on our car in a monthly basis. Therefore most of our bills come down to  about $850 a month (excluding food). Realistically speaking, if we move to Houston this number will have to come up to at least $1250. Is this too high of a number? Would it be a better idea to stay where I live now and commute 2 hrs to Houston daily?


Question 3) I want to pay for my wive's studies so she too has a 4 year degree. Under the net monthly  income of $2500 is it possible to do this with out getting into more debt?


Question 4) Is the 36k + commission offer a good one for a first year graduate? Are commission based jobs even legitimate in the US? I have lived a very sheltered life here in the US with my parents and am very afraid of falling for some type of scam job. 


Question 5) I have held one job before in the US but have lost of volunteer experience, should I be looking for a higher salary that is not based on commissions/bonuses at all? I applied to at least 100 jobs and I am getting daily calls for interviews but most of them listed salaries that are much lower or simply refused a salary at all. 


Question 6) Are commercial collectors a legit position? I have never heard of such position before. 


I appreciate all the time and effort that some of you will put into your answers, I also apologize for any questions that are not appropriate for this subreddit. Additionally, to thank you all collectively, I will give gold to either the most up voted comment on the thread OR to the comment that I believe has the most objective merit to it.",finance,1471960080

personalfinance,Ex-Employer refuses to tie up loose ends,"Hi PF! 

I left my old job in April this year. Think global accounting firm. While employed at this job, I worked primarily in state and local tax on the corporate side. 

I moved from DC to Philadelphia on July 1, 2015. For my 2015 tax returns, my ex-firm is currently over-allocating my state wages to DC by $15K and under-allocating to PA/Philadelphia by $8K. The total of my state wages is much higher than my Federal wages and I did not have any overlap that would allocate extra state wages to DC (i.e. working in DC but living in PA). Safe to say, I'm 100% sure there are errors in the state wage allocation. Since the DC starting point on the tax return is state wages, DC thinks I owe them an additional $1K (when I should be getting money back or breaking even). My W4 was switched over by the end of July 2015 but on my paystubs, they're allocating wages to both Philly/PA and DC until the end of September. 

My ex-firm outsources everything to ADP, which has been awful in dealing with this. I have been through the ADP process four times since March 2016. When I call, only the call center person can take down my details. Explaining tax nuances to these people does not go over well. They refuse to let me talk to a researcher, manager, or anyone who understands tax to explain the issue. They refuse to look at the spreadsheet I have that calculates approximately what state I owe what. There is no escalation. Each of the 4 times, they have ""resolved"" my issue by saying there is no issue. One time they blamed my work location tracker, which I confirmed was correctly presented. One time, they said my withholding was correct (withholding isn't the issue, state wage allocation is). Another time, they blamed it on my W4. It's been a month since I started the fourth time and I haven't heard anything. 

On the firm-side, HR refuses to liaison with ADP. I have also spent hours on the phone pleading with them to step in. 

Additionally, my firm overpaid me during my last paycheck. ADP still has not issued me a debt letter so I can pay the firm back. This  matters because it's a conflict of interest at my current job to have financial interests with accounting firms. I have also tried to resolve this issue multiple times. It's 4 months later and I still have an extra paycheck floating in my bank account that isn't my money. 

Before I hire someone more versed, does anyone have any suggestions on what actions I could take to resolve these issues? I'm not interested in paying an extra $1K in taxes that I don't owe. I'm pretty sure the W2s have to be resolved on the firm-side and that I can't issue a statement explaining the situation with my tax return.",finance,1471962751

personalfinance,"Credit card debt, a federal tax lien, and a very bad auto loan. Help needed.","Hello friends,

I am a 1099 employee (and have been for about 8 years). When I first started working for my company I was pretty young and was making more money than I ever had. I quickly got behind on estimated taxes, and this snowballed until this year when I sought legal help. 

I went to a local attorney/accounting firm and they have contacted all tax agencies (IRS, state, and city) to arrange payment plans, and have filed all of my back taxes (3 years worth). Today I got news that I have a federal tax lien against me and my company. This will not be lifted unless I pay $650/m or pay the tax debt in full... 40k. 

I have been working really hard to improve my credit over the past few years and I know this is going to negate all of that work. I have a 15k auto loan with a very high interest rate, and about 6 credit cards worth of debt. 

Should I take out a consolidation loan before the tax lien hits my credit to consolidate as much debt as possible? Should I file for bankruptcy?

This all feels very overwhelming. I know I did it to myself, but I would like to achieve financial health at some point in my life. It is feeling further and further away.",finance,1471965075
personalfinance,"Need some advice on ""college debts"", statute of limitations, types of collections, etc...","So before you all tell me how morally reprehensible it is that I'm trying to get out of student debt illegally, I'm not. (Also why I'm using a throwaway - in case people get nasty.) I'm otherwise extremely diligent on my student loans. I wasn't always that way and struggled a lot right out of college, but I haven't had a single late payment in over two years on either my private or federal and I pay extra on my private loans when I can to pay them down faster. So far I've already gotten one paid off early (take that WF!)


So I'm not referring to actual student loans (hence the ""college debt""). I'm not sure if this would be considered a student loan or a different kind of debt or what, so I'm hoping you guys can offer some advice as to what my options are, if any.


What happened was - back in fall of 2011 I went back to school for half a semester and dropped out in the middle of the semester. Because I dropped out, the school revoked a scholarship that was around $4000. Since I had already taken out my student loans for the semester I was not able to take another one out to cover that additional $4000. I didn't have the money to pay it so I just... didn't.


I heard about it once in either late 2011 or early 2012 via a letter in the mail but then I never heard about it again. To be honest, I kind of forgot about it. It's never been on my credit report, I've never heard any more on it.


Until yesterday. I got a letter in the mail from a new collections agency. The total is $4500 and some. I've still never had any contact other than that letter and now this one. It's still not showing on my credit report. 


My regular student loans are already difficult enough to pay, especially when I'm trying to pay extra. I already work two jobs to cover them and try to pay them down. I just really don't know if I can afford another $300+ monthly payment right now or if they'll even let me make payments since it's been so many years. Maybe in a couple years once I have my private loans paid down a bit I could start paying on it but I just don't know if I can right now. Before I call to ask the collections company any info I just wanted to get some advice and opinions first. 


I guess my questions are: 

* Has anyone had experience with a debt this old and did the collections company let you make **reasonable** payments?

* If I try to just ignore and see if it eventually hits my credit report, how long can they do that for considering the original debt is from 2011? My state is SD if that makes a difference on statutes.

* What would this type of debt be considered? It's obviously education-related but not technically a student loan. Tuition debt? 


And any other advice &amp; information you can give me would be great! Thanks in advance. 

EDIT: After reading the Wiki about how to deal with Collection Agencies I now have some other questions.

* Should I request validation of debt? What is the benefit to this if I know I legally owe the debt and that they can legally sue me for it? 

If I should ask for the validation of debt:

I'm a bit confused on the process listed in the Wiki. What is the difference between the validation notice and debt validation letter?

It says to (I'm paraphrasing):

&gt; Ask them to send you a validation notice. They must send this within 5 days.

Then right after that it says:

&gt; ""Once you receive the validation notice, even if you know you owe the debt, send a debt validation letter within 30 days of receiving the Collection Agent's validation notice.""

Isn't that what I just did before?",finance,1471965893

personalfinance,Savings Vs Student Loan Advice,"Hello all I am trying to get your input on how I should proceed with my savings vs paying off my student loan. 

Currently I have two student loans, one federal for $13K at around 3.5% and a private refinanced loan for $30K at 4.25%. The refi loan requires a $625/month payment, but I have been paying $1K/month and the minimum on the federal. It was a 60 month loan, but I should pay it off in 36 months. I have also been building up my e-fund which is almost to 3 months by putting in $500/month. The fund is in a 1.05% savings account. My job is very stable and I do not expect to be let go in the foreseeable future.

I also have a vacation fund I put $100/month into for yearly vacations and splurges. I already put in 6% for my 401(K) and pay all credit cards in full every month. 

Now my question is when I hit 3 months of my e-fund should I keep building it up with the full $500/month as to get a down payment for a house faster or put it towards the loan? If I keep building it up I should be ready to buy a house when I get my student loans paid off. While I understand people's view that debt should be paid off as fast as possible while living very frugally I subscribe to the view that you want to pay it off as fast as you can, but not at the expense of experiencing new things.",finance,1471972744

My wife and I are wanting to build a home in the near future and are looking at this option to expedite the process a bit. I haven't received any hard information from potential builders yet, but I can tell you that the upfront amount through my lender on a $225,000 construction-to-permanent loan would be about $41k (which includes a $11,000 contingency). Saving up $41k will take us quite a while. 

My lender told me, on the other hand, that a builder-financed build may need as little as $12,500 (5%) up front. For those wondering, our gross monthly pay is $8,833, and net is about $6,000. We're not (in my opinion) trying to build too much house, but we do want to get the ball rolling sooner than later.

personalfinance,Told I don't qualify for a dependency override...,"Hi Reddit,

I frequent this sub quite often but made a throwaway for this, any who, on toward the purpose of this post.

I am 19, just moved to Colorado to get away from my mother back east. More on that later.

I graduated from high school in June 2015, and immediately after graduating my mother kicked me out of her house and I was told I wasn't to come back to visit ever. 

I couch surfed for some weeks, before a friend let me stay in her basement, and I got a job in the nearby metropolitan city. I learned how to drive and got my license. Basically I focused on saving money and making my life better. I wanted to go to school, but I wasn't able to get FAFSA as my mom and I don't speak. I read about the dependency override clause, and so I began to drop all contact with my family. 

I have always wanted to go to college though to pursue a Mech Eng degree. So when my best friend asked if I wanted to go to Colorado to school I jumped at the chance, particularly because the move should (has) have allowed me to wean myself off my mothers healthcare, making 100% of life's expenses my own. I am set to get a job in the next week, I pay rent in Colorado, etc. 

I signed up for classes at the local CC, as I want to go to the School of Mines. This option was way cheaper than out-of-state at Mines. 

Over the last 2 weeks, I've been meeting with various Finaid employees to discuss my situation. Following all their instructions, getting a new FAFSA turned in, collecting my tax forms, etc. Today however I met the director, who when I explained the situation to her (apparently the employees hadn't told her about me) she cut me off and told me I would never get a dependency override from her. ""Imagine if we gave dependency overrides to every student in your situation, parents would stop giving any money at all and the government would pay."" 

i argued back, saying that the situation she described is entirely hypothetical, and just not reality. She just countered that she wouldn't do it, she wasn't going to listen to me, and the fact i lived in the same state as my mother (even though I haven't contacted my family in 1.5 years) was enough to disqualify me from everything except unsubbed fed loans. I think thats a $5500 value?

I don't have any fucking idea what to do. I'm signed up for $5892 worth of hours, and my bank has about $5k in cash. Even with the job I have at subway, I don't know how I am going to pay for this.

I'm angry because all I want to do is study and go to school, yet every god damn corner I turn someone else is there to just throw a roadblock in front of me. I'm seriously just ready to give up. 

Also, attorneys, if I get married to someone equally as broke, what trouble would I be in for trying to gain the system?

personalfinance,TONS of student loans... Where to start?,"Hi everyone,

So I finally, FINALLY finished school and training and started my first, real grown up job. Now that I'll be making money in which it'll actually be somewhat of a realistic goal to pay off my loans, what should be my next step?
Heres the extremely heart attack-inducing breakdown:

Stafford loans still lingering from undergrad, from Navient/Sallie Mae:

$1391, 2.65%

$2722, 6.8%

Institutional loans from graduate school:

$28511, 5%

Federal loans:

Subsidized Stafford:

$34000, 6.55%

Unsubsidized Stafford:

$131031, 6.55%

Finally, the dreaded Grad Plus loans:

$62891, 7.65%

$14050, 8.25%

Total is over $300k. I've been paying IBR for the federal loans, and have been on a training deferment for some of the other loans for the past three years, but due to my income increase now that I'm working I will definitely not qualify for any sort of income based plan starting next year. Doesn't matter since I just want to attack these loans as much as I can, anyway.

My plan was to keep making monthly payments (I'll pay IBR until I get inevitably switched over to a standard plan), and put a ton of extra money per month into the highest interest loans, gradually working my way down. Is this a good idea? Would consolidation help at all? Any other suggestions?

personalfinance,Should I (24 yr old) cosign (again) for my (27 yr old) brother's private student loan? What options can I suggest to him?,"Hi /r/personalfinance,

A little background for me: I graduated college in May of 2015 with a good chunk of student debt ($70,000 total in private + federal totaling about $900 worth of minimum payments a month). I grew up with parents who due to financial hardships, were unable to help me get through college or even be my cosigner. As a result, I used my grandfather as my cosigner through the years. I landed a decent job ($50,000 a year) and have been able to struggle through my minimum payments without too much difficulty.

Now, my older brother needs a cosigner. The issue is my grandfather no longer controls his own finances. He lets my aunt take care of things. My brother does not want her to know his financial circumstances. He is pretty irresponsible with spending and I'm almost certain he has a lot of debt that he acquired in his time in the military. Despite having a GI Bill and monthly stipends from the Air Guard, he thinks he needs more money. Due to bad grades, he qualifies for no federal loans (so he says). For those unfamiliar with the process of private loans, the student gets approved by the bank for a requested amount, and the financial aid offices will ultimately decide how much of that chunk of money they will actually let you borrow from the bank (determined by a number of factors including the cost of living). However, they are not legally allowed to use his military help against him in determining how much extra he can request (so he says), effectively allowing him to double dip. I agreed to cosign one loan so far for $5000 for the summer semester and he was able to get approved due to my good credit. Well, this semester he is requesting absurd amounts (trying to reach that maximum ceiling). Knowing that he won't get all of what he is approved for, I tried cosigning two ridiculous loan requests for this Fall, one for $25,000 and one for $19,000 (after telling him to lower it) which the bank promptly denied before it was ever passed over to financial aid for review. But guys, these numbers scare me. I know he's trying to max out, but that seems incredibly irresponsible, and this is coming from a recent grad who wishes he hadn't been even half as needy with his loans (and who has a good chunk of low interest federal loans). He has all of this military help, and I know he is trying to pay other debts with student loans just to stay afloat, but should I give him tough love or help him out? Does anyone know of any advice I can offer him?  He's hurting both of our credit scores with these highball requests that are getting denied. He won't get approved without a cosigner, he's tried already. Thanks.

Edit: I should add that other than being a weekend warrior, he has no job (although he just did an entire summer of an unpaid internship that I'm sure took a toll on his finances).",finance,1471978099

I only say that to get to this: they successfully convinced the unemployment office that I was fired for ""misconduct"" which means I'm not entitled to unemployment payments. I disagree, but it's pointless to rant.

I tried to get a little help from TANF, but was told that our vehicle was too valuable by about $1,000. Apparently having zero income and almost no money in the bank isn't enough; if you have a vehicle worth a certain dollar amount, you can't get TANF...even if you can't sell the vehicle without losing every dime to the loan you have on it.

So my wife has gone back to work as a teacher after taking several years off to take care of the kids. She'll get her first paycheck soon, but she's making less than I was before, and that will be after three months of zero income. The only thing that we've got going for us at this point is that we were able to qualify for food stamps quickly and stretched that money enough to keep the family fed.

Meanwhile I'm still looking for work and taking contract jobs every chance I get (I'm an IT guy). I'm starting to get decent income, but it's slow building the business base. But this means needing day care, as we're both looking to work full time. The cost is about $1,200 a month. I just spoke with the state's child care services and was told that there's a months-long waiting list for assistance, and we would only be eligible if I was already employed and we were both working at least 25 hours. The really frustrating thing is, my wife's employer is building a daycare for their employees that will be free, but it's months from completion.

Now here's the tough part: I've already had to default on a small credit card balance that we simply couldn't pay. We've been paying on three others, one in my name and two in my wife's. Our utilities are (barely) current, but our mortgage is going on three months behind. We're trying to work with the mortgage company to get a forebearance, but it's slow going (more than a month now).

All in all, we're down like $5,000 and unless I can boost my income quickly or find some sort of assistance, we're going to lose the house. So I'm posting here hoping someone can point me to some resources to help us get some breathing room or give some advice on *something* I can do.",finance,1471980856

investing,How probable is an extension to the Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle Credit (as it relates to Tesla sales)?,"Background: Tesla is currently benefiting from the [*Plug-In Electric Drive Vehicle Credit*](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/plug-in-electric-vehicle-credit-irc-30-and-irc-30d), a federal income tax credit on the sale of battery-powered vehicles. The maximum credit for a single vehicle is currently $7500, and is proportional to the capacity of its battery, and not the overall cost of the vehicle. Once Tesla has sold 200,000 electric vehicles, new Tesla buyers will no longer be eligible for the full credit. The plan includes a ""phase-out"" period which will decrease the subsidy in increments to zero over the course of one year.

Dollar-for-dollar, any per-unit tax credit which remains by the time Tesla reaches volume production on the Model 3 should have a much larger impact on its sales of the Model 3 (and the number of people following through on pre-orders) than it had/will have for the more expensive earlier models, since the credit represents a much larger fraction of the sales price (assuming Tesla doesn't jack up the price in the interim).

In your opinion:

2. Will Tesla reach the current unit limit and exhaust the credit phase-out period before it starts rolling Model 3s off the line (considering its history of design delays)?

economy,Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21th Century and the rise of negative rates is no coincidence,"The central premise of Piketty's book is that r&gt;g, where r is the return on capital and g is economic growth...because of this wealth inequality is an inevitable consequence of capitalism leading to instability. 

He proposes a global wealth tax which is unfeasible politically, but I believe his ideas are being implemented strategically through central banking policy.

r can be decompose into two return components:

- r_safe: return on safe capital, ie AA and higher government bonds
- r_risky: return on risky capital, ie business, stocks, machinery, buildings...

The exact weighting w is not known but we can decompose r as follows:

- r=w * r_safe+(1-w) * r_risky where  0&lt;w&lt;1

For most of recorded human history r_safe&gt;0...however one way to make r=g would be to make r_safe&lt;0 or negative rates. This correction requires significantly less political strength than a wealth tax and can be implemented stealthily without much uproar other than academic.

I don't think it's a mistake that negative rates have been arising all over Europe in Fed banking policy since the publishing of his book in 2014.",finance,1472000099

personalfinance,Refinance student loans in my name?,"I (male/23yo) recently graduated from U of I Urbana Champaign with Chem Eng degree this past spring. Unfortunately, my parents couldn't help fund my education more than co-signing for parent plus loans. After graduation I ended up with ~$170k in loans ($30k a year, one extra part time semester, and 7 something % interest). Not all, but a large majority of the debt is in my parents name for the plus loans which has a crazy high interest rate. I got my current job straight out of college making ~$75k. Thankfully my job is close enough to home that I'm able to live with my parents and pack as much as I can into the loans. Right now I've got a little over 700 credit (lots of company expenses which boosts my credit), so I was thinking about refinancing the student loans in my name to get a much better interest rate. I'd love to be able to buy instead of rent when I go to move out, which leads into my question.

Question: How much will putting that debt in my name effect me? Will I be able to get a mortgage within the next few years? Will my credit take hit? Any clarification on this, or any general advice to make the best of my situation is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Preemptive Clarification: I know there are things I could have done to lower my debt going in, but I was the first person in my family to go to school so I made my fair share of mistakes along the way. I'm also very thankful my parents were willing to take such a big risk in cosigning and helping me as much as they can by letting me live at home rent free.",finance,1472004230

While the first two aren't a huge deal for us, the Reload @ the Register is worth mentioning. Currently, we go to the USPS branch to grab a money order for any cash deposits (we do 1-2 a month). 

*Questions:* 

- What is *rate* referring to? Notice it is 1.24%, while the stipulatory APY is 1.25%. 

- To get the full 1.25%, we would have to use this over our credit card (though we would still use the CC for big purchases, purchases we think might need a 1-year warranty on, etc.). Would this add up to be a better deal?

*Comments:*

Obviously, the baseline, non-stipulatory APY on the savings is much better than the BofI checking account. However, the possible APY is not. Also, this is the combo of two accounts. I feel that having one account with everything in it is an easier route, but because transfers between the Capital One Checking and Savings accounts would be practically immediate, this is a moot point.

*Questions:* 

- Again, there's that *Rate* on the checking account...

---

Please let me know if I'm missing anything. It looks like BofI would be the better account, and we would start using the BofI debit card rather than our CC like we currently do. *Unless, of course, I'm misunderstanding these figures.* APY is *annual*. Therefore, we would make that 1.25% on the balance of our account, interest compounded daily, with APY being paid monthly.

TL;DR: Southern California, $48k salary, $9k student loans, living at home and barely there, little to no financial issues besides having little to no credit while looking to upgrade to 15 Civic Si from 98 Integra that constantly breaks down.

So my car took a massive dump on me today and it's definitely the last straw. I thought about saving a few paychecks before I did anything drastic, but I'm just fed up with how this car treats me after babying it day in and day out. Luckily, it died fairly close to home and I can borrow my sister's car for the time being.

I have little to no credit. I receive the occasional credit card application in the mail, but I refuse to sign up for one just because I feel I would be irresponsible and just thinking about how my parents misused theirs really burned into my memory so I just pay everything in cash if possible (i.e. open a line under my mom's cellular account and give her the cash monthly). I suppose the only thing close to credit I have is that I took out student loans and although I haven't made a payment on that yet, I will next week, and they do not require me to begin paying it until this upcoming December. My plan was to ask my credit union and attempt to get pre-approved, but my largest fear is that I won't get approved for much due to my credit. I've searched online, did my research, and the car basically hovers $19k to $23k and I think I'll only be able to make a $2000-2500 down payment.  I want to try my best to keep a low APR%, but highly doubt I could. I'm not worried about monthly payments and would obviously like a good OTD deal, but it's the pre-approval + down payment that really makes me worried. Would there be any other options if I do get turned down from my credit union? My parents insist on letting the dealership handle the financing, but I'd like to be prepared in advanced even if that's my only true solution at the end of the day.

And to top it all off, I don't think I'll have a co-sign if I could get passed all the hurdles. I don't want to go to my uncles/aunts/cousins and my parents' credit is down the gutter. Is there anything I can do?

I know /PF and expensive cars aren't a good mix, but I plan on keeping this car until it breaks down. I'm not interested in the next renditions and I know how it's basically my worst investment due to depreciation. I understand that choosing a cheaper car would be more viable and makes more sense, but I guess I chalk it up to it being my possible first car where I have 100% say in what I want. Current Integra was selected for me and no complaints, but this being my first purchase on my own, this is the car I want.

Thanks for the help in advanced!

personalfinance,"Current college student looking to open entirely new checking, saving, and possibly credit card accounts - No idea where to start","Hi! I'm new to Reddit so please excuse me if I don't do anything right. 

I'm a 20 year old college student in California looking for help choosing the best Banks and specific programs for a credit card, savings account, and checking account. 
As of now, I have a Bank of the West Student checking (no fees when I bring my ID in once a year to prove I'm still in school) and their regular savings account (no fees if I keep a balance of $300 at all times). 
I'm fed up with them because I checked my account today to find THREE $35 overdraft fees in one day because some online Paypal purchases charged late and overdrafted my account back to back. I had over $300 in my savings that I could've easily transferd to avoid this, but I didn't get an emails, calls, or anything to warn me. Corporate said they couldn't do anything. There's also no overdraft protection for online purchases where they decline your card or transfer from available savings.  Maybe that's asking a lot from a bank and I should've anticipated these delayed charges, but regardless I’m pissed that the bank just took half my measly paycheck in fees. I'm ready for a change. 

My Finances: 
My University of California undergrad education is entirely paid for by government grants, but I have to pay my living expenses (food, books, rent, etc) while in school away from home. I have taken out one subsidized (meaning will not accumulate interest while I'm still in school) federal government loan for $3500 in 2015. I have not taken out any loans since then, and will not be taking out any this coming school year because I won a private scholarship for $3500 to be used this coming 2016-2017 school year.  I am not sure if I will have to take any more out in my fourth year of undergrad, I do not think I will because I work part-time as well. I also plan to continue my education with grad school or law school, which I may have to take loans out for. Ideally, I'll get scholarships and won't have to. 

I have never had a credit card before, so I assume I have no credit. 
I only have a regular savings and a student checking account at bank of the west, nothing else. 
Within the next month, I will be getting $1000 from a past security deposit to use as I please. 
I just won a $3500 private scholarship, to be disbursed to me in three separate payments throughout the school year. (Meaning at the end of September, I’ll have around $2000 in my pocket to do something with)

Proposed Checking account:
While in school, I make about $400 every two weeks for living expenses, and parents help me make ends meet with rent. This means that money cycles through my checking pretty quickly, and I often find myself with less than $50 in my account near the end of the pay period. 

I am looking for an account that offers: 
-No fees (maybe a special student account) 
-No / low mandatory minimum 
-Overdraft protection 
	-Declines card before over drafting 
	-Immediate transfers from savings 
	-Possibly gives me an alert when account close to zero 

Savings: 
I have a hard time saving when my money is right in front of me (now, when I open the Bank of the West app my savings and checking are right next to each other and easily transferable, so I end up treating both like a checking since I’m always scraping for money)
For this reason, I would like my saving and checking at two different banks, or at least not too easily accessible. If my savings were at a different bank then my checking, I could deposit my paycheck in my checking and then send off a portion to my savings and sort of pretend it doesn’t exist / hide it from myself. Right now, seems like that’s the only way to force myself to manage my money.

Like I said, I am about to come into about $1000 from the security deposit on a past apartment, plus this $3500 private scholarship I just won (which will be disbursed to me in 3 installments of $1,166 throughout the school year). –Keep in mind that my actual school tuition and fees are not relevant because my government grant automatically pays all of that—

I want to open up a new account where I can save this money, ideally with the highest appreciation rate possible and obviously no fees. 
I have had some people suggest investing it in a brokerage (index?) account. I have no idea how this works or what this is, but I would be interested in some type of low risk, investment account where I am able to access the money if I do need it, but still tucked away and not easily accessible. 
Would it be prudent to possibly divide the money into a regular savings account and a separate investment account? If so, with what banks / entities and in with what program / in what manner? 

Credit Card: 
Finally, I want to start building up good credit now. I know I need to open a credit card for this. I am looking for a credit card to basically use occasionally as a debit card SOLELY for the purpose of appreciating good credit, nothing else. I’m not an idiot, but I’m also not amazing with money, so I really need a no nonsense set up that will allow me to build my credit. I wouldn’t mind a card with good rewards either, though. I have heard that some banks offer special awards for students, but I don’t know if that’s true. 

I’m thinking it might be a good idea to open up the credit card and the checking account with the same bank? Just to keep it from getting overly complicated? Then it’ll be a lot easier to stay on top of paying the credit card bill on time. 



In conclusion, 



I’m looking for specifics on what exact banks I should open these accounts with, with what exact package/deal/program/card/account, and in what manner I should go about managing them to maximize this money and prepare myself for a financially stable future. 

In addition, if anyone has any advice regarding student loans and paying for school as it pertains to my situation and my future goals (law and/or grad school), please let me know. 

My parents do help a bit with rent but besides that, I’m on my own. No one has ever taught me how to do anything of this stuff. I will be so grateful for any specific help or other general / specific money management tips that the Reddit community can offer, because I’m lost and I feel like all the banks are just trying to suck me dry of the small amount of money I do have.

personalfinance,"""You're doing it wrong!"" Personal finance pitfalls to avoid (US)","You're doing it wrong!  Not you, singular; but you, collectively.  Among you, there are people undermining their personal wealth by doing things that seem like good ideas, but, in hindsight...don't really work out that way.

Here are ten things you might be doing, and why not to do them.  (We've covered some of these in other posts, so this is primarily a handy checklist.)   If you are not doing any of these, take a victory lap!

1.  **Spending more than you make**.  No explanation needed.  Don't do that!  Even if you like buying things, or don't have much income, or hope to get a better job soon.  Make a budget, and stick to it.  Make automatic savings contributions before you even look at your checking account balance.  Establish and maintain an emergency fund.  If you rely on a payday loan to avoid eviction, you're doing it wrong.

2.  **Financing a car that is [too expensive](http://genxfinance.com/your-car-is-making-you-poor-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/)**.   For example, one that costs almost as much as your annual take-home pay.  Even if it's really cool, or one you've always wanted, or you want a warranty.  Please don't do that.  You can't afford it; you'll be underwater and can't pay off the loan even if you sell the car; your insurance will be too expensive.  You can get a reliable used car for under $10,000.   

3.  **Carrying a balance on your interest-bearing credit card**, because you think it [improves your credit history / score](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/credit-score-does-carrying-a-balance-help/). It doesn't.  You just pay interest.  You want to use a card to generate positive history, but you also want to pay off an interest-accruing card in full.  Every month.  No exceptions.  And yes, that means you can't use credit to finance your lifestyle (see point 1).  

4.  **Taking out a loan to establish your credit history**.  You do not have to do that, when you can do the same thing with a credit card that you pay no interest on.  Taking out a car loan as your first credit transaction is a very expensive mistake.  A car loan with a double-digit interest rate means you are doing it wrong. 

5. **Not taking the match from your 401k**.  Even if you watched John Oliver's show about 401k fees and you are now a born-again mutual fund expense watcher...please, please take any match your employer gives in your 401k.  Even if the fund choices have 2% fees, it's still free money.  Even if you have expensive credit card debt, which you shouldn't, the match is probably still the right move.  You could be making 50% one-time gain on your money; that will cover a lot of fees.  

6. **[Cashing out retirement funds](http://www.rothira.com/blog/never-cash-out-retirement-accounts-when-switching-jobs)** to pay for things, or when you change jobs. This is almost never a good idea.  Even if you can do it, you shouldn't.  That $20,000 in the 401k from the job you just left looks like it might be a good way to make a down payment on a house.  Don't be tempted.

7.  Buying a house only to avoid **[throwing away money](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-nonsense-of-rent-vs-buy-myths-that-ruined-the-housing-market/)** on rent.   You need to live somewhere.  Renting is almost always cheaper if you aren't sure where you want to live two, three or even five years in the future.  Your transaction costs to purchase and then sell a property are ""thrown away"", as are your payment towards interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance and repairs. (Renting it out later isn't as easy or profitable as it sounds, either.)  Even in a hot market, appreciation is not guaranteed, and major repair expenses are not always avoidable.   Buy a house if you can afford to, and you know you want to live somewhere indefinitely, not to save on monthly payments.  [Edit: owning a house is financially better as you own it longer.  Over a short interval, monthly payment calculations alone are not enough to prove ownership is financially better than renting.]

8.  **Co-signing loans you shouldn't**.  While there can be some limited reasons to co-sign a loan, e.g. for your child, never co-sign a loan just because your significant other has no credit, or your parents want a better interest rate.  If they need a co-signer, it's because they are a poor credit risk.  Once you co-sign, you are on the hook for the whole balance, even if you don't have access to what the money went towards.  

9.  **Paying a financial planner to invest your money in a mutual fund with a [5% up-front fee](http://www.fool.com/school/mutualfunds/costs/loads.htm)**.  Despite what you might have been told, this is never necessary, and doesn't help you in any way.  You can buy alternatives with no up-front fees, and lower ongoing expenses.  

10. **Buying [whole life insurance](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/04/is-whole-life-insurance-right-for-you/index.htm)** from someone you knew in college  to ""jump-start your financial future"", even if you have no dependents.  You do not even need life insurance until you have responsibilities after your death.  If and when you do have them, term life insurance is much more cost-effective.  Politely decline the invitation to a free financial planning session from your old fraternity brother.

personalfinance,"Part of the VW settlement, and the buyout will help me pay off debt, but keeping the car would mean ""free"" driving. What to do?","My car is a diesel VW, affected by the scandal that you may have heard about (TLDR: VW cheated on emissions tests and is now liable to fix or buy back the cars). I currently still owe $7000 on my 2011 with 193,000 miles on it. The buyback value if I turn it in on the first possible day is $13,025. 

I am in a generally bad financial situation, and I've come to see this deal as a great opportunity. If I take the buyback right away, I pay off the car loan along with about $5000 in credit card debt that's at very high interest rates. All told I'll eliminate roughly $150 per month in interest payments, nearly $700 a month in bills. 

That should have a lot of positive effects on my finances. First, I'll finally be free of the high-rate debts that I've been largely unsuccessful in chipping away at. These are credit cards with rates over 20%. Eliminating that much interest from my monthly payments gives me a lot more power to reduce debt - and I have a lot of other debts, which at that point will be my student loans and mortgage along with $15,000 in lower rate credit cards. Second, eliminating these debts will lower my debt to income ratio and credit utilization figures, so it should be a *huge* boost to my credit score. That might enable me to get a home equity loan to refinance the rest of my higher-interest debts and get everything down to mortgage-like rates. 

I've already acquired a beater hand-me-down car to replace my VW. It's an SUV, much worse on gas but slightly better for my lifestyle, and may help me to achieve some long-term goals such as getting a trailer and living on the road when my work allows it, which is often. 

On the other hand, people in /r/TDI are talking a lot about the benefit of just keeping the cars as long as possible. The buyback values are fixed except for a mileage adjustment, which is cheap; for my year it's $180 per 5,000 miles. The price stays the same as long as you turn it in by November 2018.  The car is very cheap to drive as it gets 40+ mpg even when carrying all my stuff. So in theory if there wasn't opportunity cost it would make a lot of sense to hold on to it as long as possible and save money on miles. I do drive a lot and the truck is going to cost me a lot more to drive. 

There is another however. The car has nearly 200,000 miles already and there are two common mechanical failures that could occur with very costly repairs. The only condition attached to the buyback is that the car must be driven to the dealership under its own power, but if the fuel pump fails it could cost a few grand to get it driving again. To me this is a big risk not worth taking, along with the cost of continuing to carry all that debt ($150 a month in interest, not to mention the payments) and insuring the car (about $100 a month). 

So to me the deal seems like a windfall that I should jump on ASAP, but I do have FOMO about driving for an extra two years virtually free. 

Note that a few years ago I asked this sub for advice on getting my finances back on track after I graduated law school and found myself in a much worse job market and lower salary than I expected, and the first thing you all told me was to sell the car, which wasn't then possible as it was upside down. Now I've got the opportunity to sell or for twice what I owe. 

In terms of the rest of my financial picture, I make very little, between $40,000 and $50,000 a year, with about $175,000 in student loan debt , $20,000 in credit cards $5000 of which is above 20%, and a $40,000 mortgage with substantial equity available in the house. I work very few hours and while I'm trying to grow my business, I'm also very happy working only part time as I have bipolar disorder and don't handle the stress of work very well. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text. I'm pretty sure I know the answer, I'm just hoping that someone with a little more wisdom will confirm that I'm making the right choice. 

Edit: The question isn't whether to sell it to them at all, which is a no-brainer. It's whether to sell it back *now* or drive it for a few more months/years ""free of charge"" as the buyback value won't change except a mileage adjustment.",finance,1472050944

personalfinance,[RI] Odd issue regarding state tax refund.,"Hello everyone. I'm 25, single, work in Massachusetts (and previously also worked in Rhode Island), and live in Rhode Island. I typically use TurboTax to do my taxes each year since my taxes are fairly simple and it's quick and easy to do.  

This year, I completed my taxes using TurboTax as usual, and e-filed them. My MA state and US federal refunds came in in about 1-2 weeks, but my RI refund never came in, which was around $500. When I checked the status online, it told me that I was missing a copy of my W-2, and that I would need to mail a copy, so I did. I never heard back after that and still have not received my refund. I tried calling a few times throughout the season, but the automated phone system ended the call because there were too many callers waiting, so I never got to speak to anyone.  

I did a little bit of digging, and found that it may have been because I submitted my RI state taxes before TurboTax had updated its forms, so I submitted a 2015 form instead of a 2016 form. TurboTax e-filed it and it shows as accepted, and I don't see any way to redo it on the website using the newer form.  

How can I re-submit my RI state taxes using the correct form, so that I can receive my refund? Would there be any sort of late penalty, even though I don't owe any money? What are my options?

personalfinance,Time to refinance to a lower term + cash out?,"Hello everyone,

I purchased a home in 2007 for about $120k.  Four years later, I refinanced a 30 year mortgage to get a lower interest rate, paid the origination fees, etc. and have been pretty happy that I saved about $200 a month.  Now the situation has changed.

I'm 5 years into the mortgage currently sitting around 4.75%.  The property values in the area have exploded.  I know there are major reservations about using this, but zestimate says the property value is around $160k.  We still owe about $102k.

I have four goals I want to accomplish:

* Pay off a $9k student loan stuck above 5% (currently sinking in $630 a month to pay off)
* Shave a point or two off my rate (my wife and I have credit scores above 800)
* Shorten the term to 10-15 years
* Get rid of the PMI.

I also have yet to start saving for retirement. My job has a pretty high turnover rate so  I hoarded cash just in case, but now definitely have job security so I don't need to hold so much cash. If I do pay off all of my loans, I'd probably have to go back to hoarding cash for a bit just to build my savings back up to where I'd like it to be.

Since I'm still young and have the rare opportunity to pay off student loans I think it would be a good idea to go ahead and do that, and since that would save a lot of interest it's effectively an investment in my savings account that grows at the interest rate of my loans. But I also really want to get ahead with retirement savings too (didn't enroll at my company with a small monthly commitment because they don't match anyway), so I'm faced with three options that I see:

1) Pay off all student loans and start investing in my 401(k) gradually

2) Pay off some of my student loans, open an IRA and make a somewhat large investment into that

3) No early retirement of loans and large investment in IRA, probably also start making larger commitment to 401(k) as well since a student loan sized IRA investment probably isn't necessary at this point.


Thanks in advance!



edit:I'm also not sure how to weight the fact that the return on paying off student loans is fungible and not taxed, whereas putting money into an IRA locks it away and subjects me to tax (immediately if it's Roth I think).

personalfinance,"[Debt consolidating] at the risk of getting sent to a wiki, I'm posting to ask if I should do a debt consolidation loan.","We have five credit cards with balances, plus a personal loan we are paying on bi-weekly. One card has zero percent interest until April 2017. Then I have a loan and a cc with pretty good interest rates (5.99 and 10.5). Of the other two cards, one has a low credit limit but is usually charged to the limit because I use it for everything for the points, and until last month was paying it in full pretty much every other day, then we had an income gap and I got behind. Interest on that one is 22.99, with $2500 credit limit. No over limit fees.

The worst card is one used for business that got out of hand, and currently has about twice the credit limit charged on it. Also no over limit fees at all, but the large balance is costing us hella interest.

We recognize that we have paid off cards before and then gotten into debt again. As a matter of fact, we just rolled some $28K into a refinanced mortgage earlier this year. So, we do have some trouble staying out of credit card debt.

I'm feeling tremendous pressure with six different payments due every month. I hate credit card debt and yet we haven't truly been free of it for as long as I can remember. 

The debt con loan is being offered by the institution where we have the lowest rates, and would almost without a doubt be a much lower rate than the two cards which are most troublesome.

We HAVE to use at least one card for business expenses, which are almost all reimbursed within six weeks. But we've been juggling cards for that purpose because of credit limits and due dates.

So yes my question is is a debt consolidation a good idea and what else can we do to keep from getting into debt? Most of the purchases we make are either reimbursable business expenses our living expenses. I find credit cards to be 1000 times easier for record keeping and tax purposes, but there is something eluding me in staying on top of things.

The business expenses that populate that one card were mostly incurred and then reimbursed but the incurrer did not communicate with me that the reimbursement should go directly toward the credit card.

Communication has been challenging between the two main players here, but I have good reason to believe we've solved the communication problem and are on the same page. 

I know the debt consolidation loan would certainly help with my stress levels, but I'm not sure it's the best decision for long-term.",finance,1472064904

Barclay Card: $5,779 out of $5,400 limit @ 16.24% interest

If I pay off the BofA card and the Citi cards completely (zero them out), I could then bring both the Chase and Barclay under their limits again, and going forward every month I’d be able to take the minimum payments that had been going to those two and apply them to the remaining cards (plus their own minimums), but again, I could really use some guidance here.

To give you some back story, about 3 months ago I contacted Navient asking them to change the payment due date on my student loans.  For all but one of my loans, they were able to change the due date to an early date in the month without having to adjust everything.

However, my private loan (which takes up nearly 80% of my total owed debt) was somehow screwed up.  Someone at Navient cancelled my auto-pay plan without notifying me.  For anyone who doesn't know, Navient offers interest rate discounts for anyone with auto-pay setup.

Once the auto-pay stopped, my interest rate went up 0.5%.  As a result, my payment each month also went up.  This is understandable, as in order to pay the loan off in the right amount of time I would have to pay more.  However, when I re-instated the auto-pay, the payment did not go back down.  After contacting Navient 6 or 7 times, I was finally told that the previous lower payment would not be available to me anymore without any reason as to why.

Roughly $40 a month on gas (or $20 every two weeks) 
  
So that's about $705 a month


I get $41 a month from the government for food. Not proud of it, but it is what it is. 

  
  So before I'm crucified for anything
- I got the dogs well before this predicament. While it sucks, I'm not getting rid of them because they help me manage my anxiety and depression since i can't afford treatment

-the dogs also have medical issues that need to be addressed. The oldest is heartworm positive and the vet wants to look at her kidneys since the last blood panel was too high for the kidney values. The youngest has been in the same environment as the older one so he's likely positive but I haven't had him tested because I don't have the money. 

-The total for the treatment is about 1200 for both dogs. That money would come out of what I made from the blazer, the rest into savings for the 100k maintenance on my car

-the car is an 03 civic 5 speed. I owe nothing on it, but it's got 200k miles on it and needs an oil change, timing belt soon, a tire rotation, and preventative 100k mile maintenance. Oil and tires I can do just fine but the 100k maintenance I can't and it costs a pretty penny

I have no college degree and all my jobs have been food and beverage. I'm always applying for better positions but I lack the experience needed. I tailor my resumes and CVs as much as I can without lying.

I worked through July at my old job, making about $2k take home a month. I recently switched to a part time job that I am making substantially less. He is still at the same job. When I filled out my w4, I claimed 0. I just got my first check and they didn't withhold federal or state taxes. I texted my boss to get it fixed but one of the managers there argued with me that claiming 0 meant that they didn't take any taxes from me and I know that is incorrect. 

I guess what I'm wondering is if I should continue to claim 0 or change it to 1? Is it okay to both claim 0 if we are married? He makes at least double what I make. Not exactly concerned about getting a return as long as we don't owe. 

Edit: I'm sorry if this question has been asked before. I searched old topics and was still a bit confused.",finance,1472079343
personalfinance,Management Analyst Salary in D.C.?,"Due to a lucky break with a coworker and team member leaving (not happy they are leaving or anything, it just seems to be providing me with an opportunity), it looks like I'll be jumping up (in my opinion) two positions.  I'm a federal government contractor (subcontractor) who has been working my administrative specialist role for a year and a half.  I don't have a degree and only had the customer service work experience they liked since I'm at the front desk.  

Since being here I believe I've shown my work ethic and ability.  That being said, I think I'm getting the chance because the support contract is expanding to offer some additional positions and when I first arrived we were significantly understaffed and I came through in learning on the fly and helping out with some of the duties (data entry/reports, scheduling, and correspondence) that the management analyst position performs.  I also believe they are aiming at a strategy that would provide the strongest continuity of service and the other prospective hires fit the other new roles better.  

Right now I'm making $35,000, so my questions are: what salary should I be looking at trying to get (reasonably with my experience and whatever the average is ($62,000 to $67,000 according to Glassdoor)), and what are the best ways to defend it based on how poorly (I think) I look on paper (I always feel that lacking a degree is a big blow).  

*Additional Note* I initially asked about how to apply for one of the newer openings on the lower end, but was told that there seemed to be plans to place me here.  It seems the prime and sub are discussing things (nobody wanting to poach), and others in the office say things that seem to hint at a belief that it's nearly a done deal.

On this statement, my previous balance was $359.50. It was a 30 day billing cycle. It ran from the 29th through the 28th. I made a $25 payment on the 22nd. No purchases were made during the period. The first 23 days had a balance of $359.50, the last 7 had a balance of $334.50. (23 x $359.50 + 7 x $334.50)/30=$353.67. When I compared my math to the statement, the ADB doesn't match. The statement has a listed ADB of $356.98.

personalfinance,Need advice regarding student loan.,"Hey guys,

Could use some guidance on my private student loans. Little back ground about me, I went to Full Sail and graduated with a large amount of student loan debt. I graduated during the recession in 2009 and it took me quite a few years to get back on my feet. During those years I used forbearance and interest only payments to get where I am today. 

Fast forward to today, I have a great tech job where I make 70k a year + quarterly bonuses . I own my house with a roommate who pays me 300 a month, giving me a monthly take home of about 4k. My student loans are about to come out of interest-only and looking for recommendations on how I should handle them. 

I have 3 private student loans:

$31,606.05
Interest Rate
2.750%

$33,429.54
Interest Rate
2.750%

$27,425.39
Interest Rate
8.000%

My goal was to go with an avalanche method of payment and get rid of that 3rd one ASAP. I can afford the minimum payment of 1k but was aiming to pay between 1300 and 1800 a month. 

My question is, would it be viable to see if I could go with another year of interest-only from my lender(Navient/Sallie Mae) and then pay only interest on loans 1 and 2 and then throw as much to loan 3 as possible per month. 

Or should I go with more of a legit method and try to re-finance the 3rd loan to a lower interest(all 3 loans are variable as of now). I looked into re-financing back in June, but a couple of the lenders require a few months worth of paychecks for verification of income. Since I just got my raise I probably wouldn't be able to refinance for a few months. 

Any assistance is greatly appreciated.

The market will likely take a dive but rates going up that little wouldn't really mean that it makes more sense to have your money in bonds over stocks, right?

I graduated with $25k in student loans from Unsubsidized + Subsidized + Perkins loan. I intend on paying off the Unsubsidized loan first due to the accrued interest rate; however, I was wondering if it would be okay to consider saving into a retirement plan? 

The retirement plan offered at my company is a 403(b) which is typically offered at non-profit hospitals, and it does not seem like there are other options. :( What I was told after speaking with HR and TIAA is that my company's 403(b) will ""contribute"" 6% of my salary after being an employee for one year, but prior to that year, I can still open the 403(b) account. It's just that anything that goes into it from now until next year will be solely from my salary/pocket. I do not know what ""contribute"" in this case means, especially if it's a ""no-match"" policy. I was considering opening a Roth IRA instead since I intend on retiring at a higher salary rate than now; however, I also intend on attending medical school in the near future which will put me heavily into debt (am not sure how to account for this). Any advice would be greatly appreciated for a lost soul like me!

Just a quick scenario-based question for you. I am getting ready to transition out of the Navy in 6 months and am having a hard time deciding on which should happen first, saving money in the event I am unemployed come March or paying off debt and keeping my fingers crossed and praying I have a job by the time I get out.

Quick snapshot for you:

* Savings: $1,000 (for emergencies)
* TSP: ~$9,000
* Delta Sky Miles AmEx: ~$1800 @ 16.49%
* Amazon Store Card: ~$1,250 @ 25.99%
* Auto loan: ~$12,000 @ 2.74%

The reason I only have $1,000 in my emergency fund is that life in the military is pretty safe when it comes to emergencies (100% healthcare coverage, etc.) and I have been paying down my credit cards since June. My question is this:

Being 6 months out, should I try to zero out my credit cards as quickly as possible and risk not having enough money saved up in the event my job search isn't...fruitful? Or should I pay the minimums on the cards and start socking away money over the next 6 months?

personalfinance,car loan questions,"hey all,

I have a series of car buying questions I recently posted on /r/whatcarshouldIbuy, but I wanted to gather more general insight on what I asked there:

- do lenders, may they be banks, credit unions, or dealerships, alter interest rates if the borrower doesn't plan on making a down payment?

- following on the previous question: knowing an interest rate will be low on the loan, and not having a good amount of money saved, I'm considering 100% financing. I'm looking at financing $16000, or if I choose to do a down payment, doing something along the lines of financing $12000 w/a $4000 down payment. Doing the math on a 5yr, 3% apr loan on 16k vs 12k; the difference is ~$4300, but down payment considered, it'd be ~$300, which could be made up by principal payments down the line. I just want to verify if that logic makes sense and/or if I'm not considering other aspects. I've been reading up and I'm not sure I'm understanding the potential to be ""underwater"".

Bitcoin,World’s First Bitcoin-Based Oil Market Launched - Will It Be A Success?,"Every country needs US dollars if it wants to buy crude oil. This may soon change as a market selling crude oil for Bitcoin has emerged.

The term ‘petrodollar’ has been thrown around since the 1970s. Dollars for oil have been the principal source of earning for many oil producing nations in the Middle East, as well as in other parts of the world.

However lately the petrodollar has been under a considerable amount of strain. Many have predicted its imminent demise based on a multitude of reasons such as Iran wanting to be paid in Euros for its oil sales, and the Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to get his country to move away from pricing its oil in the US currency.

Yet among all of these developments perhaps the biggest alarm bell that has been ringing for the petrodollar has been the strained relationship between Saudi Arabia which is the fiefdom of the house of Saud and the United States.

A sweetheart deal gone sour

It has been the case for decades that the US and Saudi have had an understanding which involves the US protecting the House of Saud and, in return, the Saudis only pricing their oil in the US dollar.

Moreover, the Saudi Arabian currency the Riyal and several other Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) currencies are pegged to the US dollar. This pricing of oil in dollars has made the US currency the world’s reserve currency of choice. However, things are not well between the US and Saudi Arabia of late with the Wall St. Daily reporting:

“The tension between the two countries further increased recently thanks to the passing of a bill by the Senate – the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) – which would allow the families of the victims of 9/11 to sue Saudi Arabia, pending the verdict as to whether any of the country’s officials were involved in the 2001 terrorist attacks.”

The same publication also reported that the Saudi’s are miffed about the US doing nothing to shore up the regime of the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who was an ally of the Saudi Kingdom.

The slump in oil prices have also hit Saudi Arabia hard. The Guardian has this to say about the Saudi economic woes:

“The Kingdom, Opec’s biggest oil exporter, is said to need $100-a-barrel oil to cover its enormous public spending commitments. The International Monetary Fund warned recently that Riyadh would burn through all its financial reserves within five years under a $50 oil price unless it took steps to raise taxes or cut spending, which it has since started to do.”

The emergence of the PetroBTC?

If through political machinations or economic necessity the US loses its coveted reserve currency tag, then what will replace the US dollar is an open question. One idea worth exploring would be a cryptocurrency like BTC.

Cointelegraph had a chance to talk with Shannon Lowery, Sr. Founder of NJUF Investments whose SecureTradePlatform.com is being tagged as ‘Bitcoin’s First Crude Oil Market.’

Shannon is of the view that the US dollar is about to take a major hit in value and this will affect almost every major commodity and “shake major exporters.” In terms of commodity trading oil is of special significance because every country needs currently needs dollars to buy fuel. Shannon thinks that his crude oil market has the answers.

He says:

“The crude oil market is for commercial interests to prevent speculation on oil prices. All actual buyers and sellers who take delivery of crude can buy crude oil and other energy products using BTC, because the USD is about to collapse in value.”

BTC based oil trading may be more profitable

As of now SecureTradePlatform.com only caters to the needs of governments and corporates but Shannon says that due to the impending devaluation of the dollar, commodity trading in BTC will become more profitable. This could increase retail investor participation over time.

Cointelegraph asked Shannon what was the short and long term view of his trading platform. He says:

“The short term focus is to prevent the global chaos which will unfold due to the reserve currency being devalued. The long term focus is to provide stable prices in the global economy so that institutions and governments can properly plan for investments and that a system of fair trade may be had.”

The coming oil apocalypse

Governments have been huddling together to try to shore up commodities. It has even brought together unlikely bedmates like Iran and Saudi Arabia or, if you prefer, Saudi Arabia and Russia together.

There is an air of worry among the oil producers thicker than the smoke of the burning Kuwaiti oil fields in the 90’s. The linkage of GCC currencies with the dollar means that they are unable to have an independent monetary policy. If they keep their peg to the dollar they must sacrifice growth and if they abandon the peg, they face a level of uncertainty they have not experienced since they hit oil.

As for Shannon, he sees a future in which it is either trade in BTC or perish. He says:

“The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve will soon cause economic chaos for commodities and simply put, this market has been created for economies to escape what is about to happen. It is my firm belief that those economies that do not shelter themselves behind the walls of the markets will soon be in economic and social distress, much to the likes of Venezuela. Surely BTC has been a despised poster child as of late, but as ironic as it is, I believe it is the only thing that will save governments from the social unrest which will occur due to their policies.”

CryptoCurrency,"Cryptocurrency Insights: Monero, Bitcoin and Ethereum","This week it is Monero, XMR, that is making news regarding its value in the cryptocurrencies. The week before it seemed to be Dash, a few weeks before that it seemed to be Steem. 

The DAO captured the attention of all in June and then like a cloud that bursts suddenly into a storm, it presented obvious problems via its ‘white hat’ hack that has seemingly put the project into a holding pattern. The consequences that Ethereum, ETH, have had to bear because of the fallout from the implosion via the DAO has hurt its value and even seen a competitor (dissenter) arise – Ethereum Classic, ETC. 

Bitcoin stands on the summit of cryptocurrency for many as it gets constant use and a place at the table regarding the ‘outside’ world of investors. Yes, BTC, has its own problems too via exchanges that get hacked or are alleged to be scams if insiders have been up to no good. With the undesirable news that BTC sometimes generates, it still has a value as of this writing at about $573.00 USD.

But this is what we get for creating new types of assets in a decentralized environment, one in which a 14 year old kid can create a currency (he probably would have been building a tree fort and calling it his own country forty years ago). New cryptocurrencies come and new cryptocurrencies go. How many cryptocurrencies do we really need? 

Fiat currencies representing nations are many, but there is only a roundtable of currencies that are considered to be major FX players. However, there are not many 14 year old children designing blockchains. The technical ability of blockchains for the future of transactions via smart contracts may be the central nervous system for the future of cryptocurrencies that finds a profound amount of acceptance and use by the public.

The need for cryptocurrencies is still being debated. What is the underlying value? It is all about market sentiment and sometimes unfortunately about manipulation within the cryptocurrencies, which is sometimes referred to as pump and dumps. However, in a world where Central Banks have fierce critics and doubts surrounding them regarding monetary policy, isn’t it part of the freedom of citizens to find other assets if they believe that they generate values that are sustainable? Cryptocurrencies provide a tool to potentially preserve capital and possibly invest within. 

There are no guarantees with cryptocurrencies and it is likely that a vast percentage of them are destined to fail, but what about those that do not? What will Bitcoin, Ethereum, NXT and a host of others be valued at this time next year? In a speculative world of trading in which we must deal with the gyrations caused from a stagnant global economy, faulty Central Bank monetary policy which has brought about near zero interest rates and now negative interest rates, and the danger of black swans via political turmoil - isn’t it part of our rights to try use new tools such as cryptocurrencies? All investment vehicles have been proven to have a vulnerable Achilles heel.

Gold, the old reliable precious metal, is trading in a volatile manner this summer. While Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are often vilified for their steep declines and rapid rises in value, what is the difference between speculating in Gold and a cryptocurrency? Yes, the percentage of volatility effecting the rate of exchange may be less for Gold compared to cryptocurrencies, but it isn’t always. The ability to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currency is becoming easier than it is to exchange Gold. Cryptocurrencies are far easier to use as a means to purchase a good or service on the internet compared to Gold. 

As an investment and a speculative asset cryptocurrencies are likely here to stay and be more accepted as the evolving technology surrounding their creation and transactions become more transparent. Welcome to a new world.

I purchased a Harley Davidson in February of 2014 and used their financing option which had an outstanding interest rate of 8.0% with the intentions of refinancing with the Credit Union I have been using for years.
Time went by and I never refinanced : X

I am looking into it now and wondering if it is even worth refinancing at this point since I have paid so much of the interest already.  
The original loan was for around 5,000$ and I have paid 120$ consistently since inception.  (I have requested the original loan statement to verify exact numbers)

The most recent statement shows my payment of 120$ went to 23.02$ in interest and 96.98$ in principal.  Is there any way to calculate if it would be effective to try and get a loan with my credit union if it was lets say 2.5-3.5%?

personalfinance,Buying a house without your spouse?,"My fiancé and I are looking into purchasing a house. My question is if we should do this before or after we get married as we’ve decided that only I will be applying for the mortgage. I currently make 54k and have about 30k in student loan debt. I should have that paid completely off within 3 years, less if/when I get any raises. I know we could afford it because the mortgage including real estate taxes and homeowners insurance is $208 less than what we pay for rent now. We also currently pay all of our utilities. If I were to apply for the mortgage after we get married, how would his financial situation affect the outcome of how much I am approved for/interest rate/etc. despite being the only one on the mortgage? He currently makes 45k with around 100k in student loan debt. We are most worried about that hindering our chances at a mortgage, despite him having a handle on the situation and being able to afford our current living situation. Would it be the best to do get the mortgage solely in my name before or after marriage? He will be paying half for everything, just as he does now, so would I need to mention that?

Perhaps just leave the 13k in savings and then throw the 1k per month that would go into savings towards student loans?

personalfinance,First time refinancing a home,"A couple of days ago I received a call from our mortgage lender asking if we were interested in refinancing our home since the interest rate has dropped.  She stated that we would be saving about $200 a month on our house payment.

We've only been in our new home for a year so refinancing another 30 year loan isn't going to dig us down that much deeper.  Plus, we would be receiving an escrow refund of $6000 and we wouldn't have to make a house payment next month (since loan processes are usually a month behind).

She told us that the escrow is ours to keep, but if we opted out of putting it into the new loan, our loan would be going up about $8000.  I'm not sure why, but I'm assuming some of it is the month that we didn't have to pay and the rest is the amount to cover taxes which are due this December (since no escrow has been built up this time of year)

I've tried having her explain it repeatedly, but she said that the taxes would get paid regardless if we put the escrow in our new loan so I'm still not sure why our loan would go up?

personalfinance,Window to lower interest rate?,"This is a unique situation, so bear with me. 6 months ago, I put my boyfriend as an authorized user on my 12 year old credit card. He obtained DACA status a few years ago and has never had anything more than a bank account. With DACA comes an SS number so he can apply for credit cards, etc. Of course he had no credit, so I recommended he become an AU on my card first before he attempts to establish his credit.

He finally needed a new car, so we went to the dealer and purchased a decent used car for about 12k. He was about to put a few thousand down, but I cosigned on his car loan to finance the rest (we've been together quite awhile, and yes I understand the risk.) 

The interest rate came back around 4.9%. My credit is great but since he had zero credit history, the rate went up a bit.

Here's the catch. He previously was unable to get his credit report or sign up for credit karma due to having no credit, but today he tried it and he succeeded, and sure enough, the AU card was on his credit showing 12 years of history and a credit score of 775. The car loan was not on his credit report yet, so it is not related.

He purchased the car 11 days ago. Is there any chance, now that he has established credit, that we can obtain a lower rate? I've read about a 14 day window, but I'm not sure that's accurate. Also, am I way off the mark? And if I'm not, would it even be worth the hassle? Thank you in advance!

15-year mortgages of course, carry lower rates compared to 30-year mortgages.  However, since both are still pretty low historically speaking, might it be a good idea to get a 30-year mortgage with the higher rates, but then pay more ahead of time to keep from the interest accumulating for too long?  The reason is that if there is an emergency fund situation or finances getting squeezed there would be a lot lower risk.

Does it make sense to scale back mid-long term corporate and US bond funds (like VBMFX &amp; FTBFX) in favor of short term bond funds or individually holding a long term bond?  

Bond prices have increased the last 30 years as yields drop, but now that yields are at the bottom, they can either hold or go back up.   The benefit of mid-long bonds now is increased prices from investor demand.  However does the interest rate increase risk outweigh the portfolio diversification &amp; potential gains of investor demand in a crises?   Average maturity is 8 yrs in VBMFX, the fund should go down 8% per 1% increase in rates.  

It may still take a few years, but when inflation does eventually kick in, rates will go up quicker and these bond funds will get crushed right? For the portfolio with 15+ years, does it make more sense to limit bond allocation and keep what you do have in short term bonds?  

I am considering something like this 
60% Domestic stocks
10% Foreign stocks
15% Gold/Silver
10% Short Term Bonds
5% Cash - to play with options and put in domestic stocks in the event of a crisis.  (I know not everyone will agree with this or want to do it but the idea keeps me happy)

I have loans from graduate school, currently sitting at about 84k. They are all federal loans and I am about 3.5 years into PSLF, since I work at an approved non profit, they should be paid off in about 6.5 years. I was enrolled in PAYE repayment, but when I submitted my information for this year, I was advised to select REPAYE since payments are capped at 10% of income-- in any case the loan forms said it would automatically enroll me in a different repayment plan if there was a lower monthly option available and it still selected REPAYE so I'm assuming this is the lowest available option. 

Last year, I made 32k and my payments were 98$/mo, a lot for such a low income but manageable. Well, I got married and now my income is 62k when combined with my husband. Still not a lot, especially considering we are expecting our first child in three months. 

The income verification did ask if I was expecting a child and I'm assuming that was taken into account, however, our new monthly payment is $288/month. This is quite a bit more than I was expecting-- though I realize it is not 10% of our income, and may seem totally reasonable to many. 

We have a house payment of $975/mo which is far, far lower than we would pay for a 2 bedroom apartment in a safe area. We have no car payments, and minimal credit card debt (we recently had to prepay for the upcoming hospital stay for the birth, which was about 3k but other than that we have no credit card debt) We have approximately 5k in savings, which we're trying to add to (though paying off the credit card is our first priority) 

We're planning to drop our gym membership ($60/mo) in order to help cover the cost of the increase, but I'm wondering if there's anything else we can do. 

Is there a way to lower the payment or any other program in which I can participate to help with this burden? 300/mo seems like a huge expense, particularly in light of the fact that there will be many more expenses with the baby. I'm also feeling conflicted about pursuing any additional side income, I feel like the payments will just keep going up and negate any benefit I get from taking on other jobs. 

I realize many people are in this same situation with student loans, and 6.5 years is not a terribly long time to repay 80k of debt but I guess I'm looking for a bit of guidance about how to make this as effective as possible.

personalfinance,Looking for consolidation advice; I currently have several checking &amp; savings accounts open with 3 CU's.,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I have been thinking about simplifying my personal finances. As of right now, I'm not in any kind of financial trouble, I'm just starting to think that I need to do some house cleaning, and I'd like some advice on what I should do, if I should do anything. I have several checking, savings, and overdraft lines of credit open with 3 different credit unions. All of which are receiving direct deposits from my pay check in various amounts.

I am 28 Female, not a whole lot in savings but I have a 401K (just hit $50k this summer) that I have been contributing to for 8 years. I am contributing 1% of my pay check to an employee stock purchasing program, which is a 15% discount. I work full time and I am part time student. No student loans because my company reimburses the tuition. I make $48k/year, and I am currently living in California. 

Background info: 

-Prior to 2014 I lived in Florida, where I grew up. I used a credit union in my home city for everything. Let's call them Credit Union A. I financed a car at 1.99% in 2013, and this credit union still has the auto loan. I have a savings account, checking account, credit card, and an overdraft line of credit with Credit Union A. I opened up a 1% cash back credit card (visa) with Credit Union A in 2012, and I started using this in place of my debit card (while paying the balance in full every month). All of my bills are also set up on auto pay with the credit card. I only using this checking account for Venmo and bills that charge if you pay them with a credit card. I have $1000 in the savings account of Credit Union A in case something wacky happens with the checking account.

-In 2014 I moved to Colorado. I opened an account with Credit Union B once I got established. I started to direct deposit all extra cash that wasn't designated for bills into the savings account with Credit Union B. I also opened up an Amazon prime credit card, and I'm now using this as my primary credit card. I still keep Credit Union A's card open because my bills auto-pay from it. Shortly after I moved to Colorado, I reconnected with a good friend and we started dating. He lived in California, and eventually I moved. Before I moved, I was able to save $10k in Credit Union B because I made more money in Colorado, and the cost of living was significantly lower. I spent most of moving. Right now, I have $3000 in savings left.

-In early 2016 I moved to the Bay Area. I opened another account at a local credit union, Credit Union C. I needed checks to pay rent here (which completely blew my mind -- I've never had to write a check for rent, it's always been online), and opening an account with a local credit union was the fastest way to get it done. I have a savings account, a checking account, and an overdraft protection account with Credit Union C. I only use this credit union to pay rent, direct depositing the exact rent amount into this checking account every month.

I just refinanced my auto loan so I could afford to live in the bay area, and I don't want to pay the auto loan from another credit union because I'm getting a 0.25% interest rate reduction for having the auto loan automatically draft from my Credit Union A checking account. I don't need Credit Union B anymore, but I'm not sure where to transfer the little savings I have left. I'm also kind of flat-lining financially. I make just enough to break even every month. Here is a snap shot of my finances: http://imgur.com/zt2s9VR

I currently have enough saved to cover rent and living expenses for ~6 months while in school and have several job opportunities that will help cover the next 6 months, so living expenses and rent are covered. 

My initial plan was to use a federal or private loan, but because of my current academic standing, I may not be able to use either. I have petitioned to use financial aid with my schools financial aid office, and will hear back soon, but for now I need a contingency plan. 

How do you recommend I come up with the $2500 needed for dues and fees for fall quarter? I was thinking maybe a personal loan or using some of the 6 months funds to cover tuition and then replenish it with work but the latter involves a bit more stress as I would be cutting things closer than I would like.

Thoughts? Thanks!",finance,1472165371

personalfinance,What's going on with health insurance?,"Hello Personal Finance!
(Im not sure if this is the best place for this but please tell me if there is a better place for this post)

So I have been shopping around for health insurance for me and my girlfriend for the past few days and I have come to the conclusion there is no way we can afford to get health insurance without it dipping into our savings, We are barely making it by as is. Our household income is barely $30,000 before taxes, and we live in an expensive county in California with no possibility of being able to leave this area. We are above the annual household income for Medicaid, but fall right in the spot for it to be a requirement to have Health insurance unless we want a additional tax that we can not afford added when we file for federal taxes (Thanks Obamacare!).

 We barely get to save any of our income as is and assuming we have to get health insurance we wont be saving any money, but in turn loosing money! What the hell, what should we do? We can not afford to be paying for health insurance that wont even cover us when it's actually needed. The deductible for us would be around $6,500 per person, whats the point of having to pay health insurance if you literally can not afford to use the insurance due to the deductible being too high? Is it just us or are there other people in our situation? We aren't sure how to proceed at this point.

edit: Thanks so much everyone, you have all been extremely helpful. Thanks to all who clarified the info i was not accurate and certain about and for explaining the best actions for us to take, very much appreciated.",finance,1472167353

Do you think silver will see significant support from this level? Or do you think it has potential to go even lower? 

Considering that the Fed will do everything they can to calm investors' nerves before the US Presidential Election..

Some say it would be best to buy silver around November, just before the US Presidential Election.

personalfinance,Paying off home equity loan early but before early payoff date,"This is my husband's account; don't have my own account but I lurk :)

Texas. We got a home equity loan from PenFed just under two years ago. No closing costs. Caveat is we have to pay closing costs if paid off before 24 months. I had calculated payoff multiple times on their website, and early payoff penalty went away on September 20, 2016. So we paid it down to $0.01 so that the next due date is October 7, 2016 (a few principle only payments and some prepayments of the minimum payment). We received a letter from PenFed today now saying we agreed to pay the closing costs when the loan is closed and paid in full. Not true. I wish I had taken a screenshot of the early payoff penalty going away on the sept 20th date but I never thought a need to. Now when I calculate the payoff to that date online the fees show! Looking over the loan documents, we don't have to pay the closing costs 24 months after the anniversary date of the loan closing of Sept 19, 2014. I tried calling them but they're closed for the day. Has anyone ever run into this? What recourse do we have if they stand by the incorrect info in their letter to us?  Or am I totally in the wrong here?

TLDR: Credit Union wants to charge us early payoff penalty after early payoff date. Is this right or am I crazy?

personalfinance,20% down on your house? Let's take a deeper look... (x-post from /r/FinancialPlanning).,"Long time lurker, first time caller. (Google Doc included)

Hey everyone, I've noticed around here that we preach 20% down as the gold standard when purchasing a home. It's moved away from a discussion about what your individual risk tolerance is, what your current market is doing, and how much cash you have available; instead, it's morphed into a sweeping generality about striving for this golden 20% so we don't incur the ""Dreaded PMI."" I think in certain cases this ideology is great because it preaches financial responsibility to the potential home owner. If you struggle to run the numbers, might as well be safe, right?

On the flip side, what's the opportunity cost of meeting this 20% goal? The years leading up to saving for that 20% you're holding the funds in a very low risk account which is hardly earning interest. That's one drawback. So, financially, what's the optimal amount to put down, then? Is it really 20%? Is it less? Is it more? Well, there's a hell of a lot of factors:

- Will you have enough money left over for an emergency fund?

- Do you have other investments you can be using this money for?

- What's your risk profile?

- And so on...

If you want to pay down your house as fast as you can because you sleep better at night. Great. Your health is more important than a house. Pay that mortgage down ASAP. But the discussion I want to have is strictly financial, and the hope is to offer another tool to make the best decision for your situation.

[Take a look at my google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vh2m6gtRjy2OBOYoVeT3ly1k-rp9eTzoUU9T6hU_CS0/edit?usp=sharing). When I run the numbers for myself on a $300,000 home, it actually makes sense for me to put down 5%. FIVE PERCENT?! Won't your PMI be insane!? Yep, it'll be pretty high, but if I'm taking the money that I didn't put down and invest it elsewhere at a modest 6% return, I come out ahead...over $750 ahead my first year (even after capital gains). Carry that compounded 6% over the course of 30 years and now we're talking, ESPECIALLY after PMI is taken off your mortgage. 

All things equal, we know the best way to increase your investment balance over time is to invest EARLY and OFTEN. The earlier the better. If you can come out ahead even with PMI, why wouldn't you? This is all under the assumption that you are not pressed to have the necessary funds to meet your mortgage payments. The more money you have in the market NOW the more money you will have 30 years from now, all things equal.

Now, this spreadsheet is not perfect. I understand that, but it is rather comprehensive and is a good starting point. Firstly, you need to find out what PMI will cost you at various down payment amounts. These are estimates for me. Next, you need to know the value of the home and the interest rate you can get. Finally, you need to know the size of your ""Cash Pile"", your Capital Gains Tax Rate (probably 0%, 10% or 15%), and your assumed rate of return for the alternate investment. (Think: index funds...).

It important to understand why you're doing something. Just because everyone preaches 20% doesn't necessarily make it the best (or worst) idea. You are tying up a ton of money into an asset that can be incredibly hard to liquidate if you need extra cash for whatever reason. Your home is not an investment, it's a lifestyle choice, and to look at it as an investment is a bad idea. You shouldn't be buying a house because it could be in ""the next hot market."" That's called speculation, and if you want to speculate, buy some small cap biotech stock that's thinly traded or something. Or put your down payment on the Browns to win the Superbowl this year (200 to 1, yolo)... You're not a real estate expert and Robert Griffin III is not the answer.

Please...look at your individual circumstance and run your own numbers. It's important to understand the rationale behind these kinds of decisions and not blindly follow common thought. I want you to be informed yourself. If at the end of the day you feel compelled to put down 20% because it feels right, then do it. But if you're open to looking at something a different way to find out if it's advantageous, feel free to add the tool to your toolbox. Carry on r/pf'ers.",finance,1472175308

Follow up on this.

Using bankrate.com I found a lendor for a 2.75 rate 15 year, no closing costs (except title costs and apprasil). Did more shopping and found a nice title company who is going to do everyhing for about $1400.

My monthly payment is now 1850 + Taxes/Insurance... which is completely managable and about 250$ a month less than I was paying (in order to acclerate the payoff to 15 years). Which is pretty resonable for my families income of about 165k/yr.

So in summary, thank you guys for the advice. I will have a 1.5% lower interest rate, saving me nearly 4500$ this year alone in interest (more than covering the closing costs). Thank you for the push to the next step in shopping around rather than just taking my banks word for the best rate!",finance,1472178176

personalfinance,By Request: What the heck is an FHA Mortgage and what's the deal with it? (xpost),"This is blowing up over at /r/realestate, so I thought I'd post it here.

------------------------------------

Hello,

Fast facts about FHA...

* 3.5% down is the minimum, not the maximum. 

* Very flexible on credit and income standards, because it is a....

* ...Government insured mortgage. There is monthly mortgage insurance which for SFRs @ 3.5% down is priced at 0.85% regardless of your credit. You can put 50% down if you wish, FHA will still have monthly mortgage insurance. PMI is *Private* Mortgage Insurance, and FHA insurance is not private, so technically it's not PMI (but don't bite anyone's head off if they call it PMI, I've even heard industry insiders call FHA mortgage insurance PMI). FHA mortgage insurance is there for the life of the loan, PMI drops off at 20% equity and once XYZ and requirements are met.

* The above means that for good credit scenarios, if you can swing 5% down, Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac with PMI will often be a better deal because PMI rewards good credit whereas FHA mortgage insurance is 0.85% if you have an 800 FICO or if you have a 642 FICO. Conversely, there are bruised credit scenarios with 5% or 10% down where FHA is a better deal. On one that just closed, a bruised credit scenario, FHA was about $271/month better.

* FHA will always have a lower note rate than Fannie/Freddie because it's government insured (virtually no risk), but you need to add that 0.85% to the note rate to determine an approximation for your ""effective"" note rate. Mortgage APR is a wonky number that doesn't intuitively make sense the way it does for credit card APR, but when comparing FHA v Conventional APRs, you will note that FHA will in 99.99% of cases be substantively higher. 

* **Not** just for first-time homebuyers and **no income limits**, but FHA **is** just for owner occupants. In almost all scenarios however, you can only have one FHA mortgage at once. If you want to keep buying up real estate at 3.5% down, you must generally first uphold your promise to live there for a year, then refinance, which frees up your FHA eligibility again. Do not commit mortgage fraud and purchase a property you don't intend to live in using FHA financing. 

* FHA has loan limits. They are not always the same as Fannie/Freddie loan limits. To find out your max purchase price with only 3.5% down, divide the local loan limit, [which you can find here](https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/hicostlook.cfm), by .965. For example if your local FHA loan limit is $400k, you can go $400k / .965 = $414,507. Anything above that, which you certainly can do, you're coming up with cash for the difference. For high cost of living areas (like my beloved Bay Area) with a max loan limit above $417k, that range between $417k and the upper limit is the ""high balance"" range. Your interest rate will be a tad higher in this range. If you happen to be in this range and only $2k away from a $417k loan amount, it's often much better to make your down payment be 3.5% + $2000 just to get to that $417k number for the better rate (this is better than discount points because it's equity, whereas discount points are just money that vanishes and you never see again). 

* You can buy 2-4 unit properties using FHA 3.5% down, but it's very hard to get offers accepted in a hot market. Increased loan limits for 2-4 unit properties. 

* There are currently no federal first-time home buyer programs. There are however local programs you can stack on top of FHA. Many of these programs will delay a normal closing, which every real estate agent knows, which makes it very hard to use them in a hot market. For Californians, one FTHB program I'm a huge fan of, in no small part specifically because you can still close fast with it, and because it has so few strings compared to many FTHB programs, is the [CalHFA MCC](http://www.calhfa.ca.gov/homebuyer/programs/mcc.htm). Any public agency can offer an MCC, for example some areas near me you can get an MCC through the county, through the Golden State Finance Agency, or through CalHFA. In my experience, CalHFA is the best combination of the deal and timeliness and the county MCC programs are giant piles of crap in terms of organization, etc. I suspect that it's probably the same in the other 49 states, where the counties are one thing in terms of reliability, and there are a couple state-wide agencies that are another. Note that almost all FTHB programs, which don't just consist of the MCC that I love, but down payment assistance too in the form of grants or 2nd mortgages, are income capped either by census tract or zip code.

* FHA loans are assumable. In theory if rates skyrocket, this could end up being a selling point for your house. I can't predict the future, but I wouldn't suggest going FHA for this reason alone.

* Interest rate pricing for FHA purchases: The moment you close on your house, move in, and hit the six month mark, you will be BOMBARDED with junk mail from people wanting to streamline FHA refinance your FHA mortgage and lower your interest rate. For various reasons (mostly relating to costs), outfits that **only** do [FHA streamline refinances](http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/ins/streamline) (link to HUD, not to any private company) will **always** have the absolute best FHA interest rate pricing on the entire planet on any given day (but they aren't really equipped for purchases, see above about costs). If you wish to go this route, I'd suggest that to keep your life as BS free as possible, don't just pick the lowest interest rate on all these mailers. Call the three lowest, and work with whoever seems the least mentally challenged (FHA streamline call center cubicle sweatshops don't exactly attract the talent of my industry). A significant chunk of your FHA upfront mortgage insurance premium will be refunded and applied towards the new FHA upfront mortgage insurance premium. FHA streamline refinances have **very** minimal underwriting requirements, probably about 75% less paperwork and whatnot than what your purchase mortgage involved. 

* Fun fact: 203k are FHA loans, and always have a higher interest rate than vanilla (203b) FHA financing. But guess what? It's still FHA. That means you can streamline refinance it as described above. I'm not going to talk a lot about 203k because it's tough to get the offer accepted in a hot market. 

* FHA has slightly higher property standards than Fannie/Freddie, but not nearly as much higher as most real estate agents (at least local to me) seem to think. Local to me in the SF Bay Area our housing stock is old, and we do FHA on century old fixer uppers all the time. Sometimes the lender (me), the agent, and the buyers, go out to the property to identify the things that need to be patched up once we have it tied up in contract. If the list of things is minimal and low cost, no biggie just go do the things (with seller's permission, which if it's a 100 year old house, or otherwise in neglect, they will generally agree to). For example we recently identified a below-grade un-permitted basement bathroom with a jenky pump lifting the toilet waist up to ground level and into the sewer system that was all sorts of a hot mess, no way anything about that bathroom is up to code. We tore the toilet out, put a sanitary cover over the hole, took off a shower head, tore off the shower door, put both the toilet and shower head on the shower floor, placed an upside down box on top of both hiding them, randomly put the shower door in another room in the house, threw a bunch of other boxes and crap in there, and I suggested that the agent use the term ""storage closet"" as he opened the door for the appraiser. Appraisal came back ""as is"" and issue free, documenting the room as ""[the room] was once a bath room. There is a sink, BUT no toilet or shower. The room is NOT a functional bath room. It is now a storage room. The subject property meets FHA minimum building guidelines"" (exact quote, the CAPS are from appraiser, not from me... he writes ""was once"" like it was 10 years ago, not 2 days ago, muahaha). It's not my business, nor do I care, if they put that toilet back in 30 seconds after closing. 108 year old house, FHA and HUD and income taxes didn't even exist when it was built. If it turns out it's just way too beat up to go FHA because the roof is imploding, foundation visibly collapsing, etc, then invoke inspection contingency and back out.

* Normally, if your spouse has poor credit you can attempt to qualify for the mortgage alone. In Community Property states, such as California, however, your spouse's debt obligations must be included in FHA debt-to-income calculations (but not Fannie/Freddie). FICO score can be ignored, but the spouse's car payment cannot be.

* Conversely, you do not need to be married, or even in a romantic relationship of any sort, to purchase a home with someone else using FHA financing. Local to me as millennials struggle to make it in the Area that Builds the World, this is becoming more common. However, because you are not married in this scenario, our society does not have a built-in mechanism to dispose of the house in the event of a falling out (eg, there is no divorce court if not married). For this reason, it is highly advisable to speak with a lawyer and talk about what you need to do in order to establish a one-off custom mechanism for handling any falling out that may occur. This is absolutely not my area of expertise, so I will not comment further on it.

* Saving up 20% down will generally be the best strategy there is, period, from a numerical perspective. This is for folks that want to get into a home that they own quicker than that. Ultimately what will make you and your family happy should (ought to?) trump what the hyper-conservative PF/DaveRamsey/etc ""gurus"" have to say. You can't put a dollar value on happiness. Again, saving up 20% and renting for another twenty thousand five hundred and fifty seven years is always the best from that perspective. I do not deny that for a moment. 

* You can't hold title as an LLC or anything else fancy using FHA financing because, as one of our other posters recently put it, obviously a corporation cannot owner occupy a property and FHA loans are for owner occupants only. 


* I don't really know what else to include in this post. One of our mods [EDIT: a mod from another subreddit, actually] just asked me to write up a quick primer, and here it is. 

* Holy crap that stream of consciousness turned into a giant wall of text. Not so ""fast"" after all. Sorry!",finance,1472198927

A lot of people are talking about filing for debt forgiveness, and I am definitely one of those people. I currently pay just over $180 a month to [Great Lakes](https://www.mygreatlakes.org/) and plan to for the next several years (10 years in total). I don't know much about filing for forgiveness and all of it's requirements, so any advice is appreciated. Currently working 40 hours a week in a grocery store, so saving an extra $180 a month would be huge. Fingers crossed.

**Background on my situation/minor rant:** I was attending ITT Tech for the GCD program (Graphic Communication and Design) to get an Associates Degree. I had made it quite far into the program, and was taking the 3D Animation class. Unfortunately my ancient laptop wasn't capable of doing the work necessary, and struggled to even open 3DS Max. Well we got to about 8 weeks into the 12 week course and I wasn't going to pass, but had planned on retaking the course. I had just started working and building my own computer, which would be done by the next quarter and more than capable of running the 3DS Max program smoothly. At this point our teacher announced to us that our GCD program was being replaced with a nursing program IIRC (this was for all schools across the board, not just mine), and that all classes for the GCD program were being taught one last time for the students that needed them. We were the last class that needed 3D Animation, so after our 12 weeks our teacher wouldn't be returning to the school, for they had no need for him anymore. Since we were the last class that needed 3D Animation and it wasn't going to be taught anymore, I didn't have an option to retake the course. I couldn't even transfer to a different ITT Tech and retake it since the program was no longer offered. Since I was going to fail and didn't have the option of retaking it, I couldn't get the credit necessary to graduate with my degree. I tried my best to get a grade worthy of passing, but failed. My laptop could barely handle 3D modeling, let alone rendering animation, and I didn't have time or money to drive 90 minutes to campus every day and use their sub-par desktops. Anyways, my dean called me, and tries helping by asking if I could just ""turn something in,"" but I had already turned in my best. After that conversation, he said that I wasn't going to be able to get the credits needed for my degree, and would not be able to graduate even if I got a 4.0 GPA for the remainder of my education. That one 3D Animation credit would hold me from getting my degree. Since I was not able to graduate from the GCD program I had to 1 change my GCD program to a different one and transfer as many credits as possible (only gen-ed classes transferred, go figure) or 2 quit all together. They offered no other programs I enjoyed, so instead of starting all over with a new program like Criminal Justice and burying myself in even more debt, I decided to never go back. I've been paying student loans ever since.

So far I believe going [here](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation) and trying to apply for debt forgiveness may be a good idea, to be forgiven due to the school defrauding so many students, but honestly I've no clue where to start. After I started my monthly payments I knew it could be a rough 10 years, but this may be a silver lining for myself and thousands of others.

Like I said this may not be the correct subreddit and if not I will post elsewhere, but any and all advice is highly appreciated. Thank you.",finance,1472216490

When I received my financial aid package, it was expected that I would be receiving quite a bit of aid due to my financial situation for the majority of 2015 (I lived with my mother and five siblings; we lived below the poverty line and were on multiple government assistance programs). However, on Dec. 26, 2015 my mother committed suicide, thereby leaving my siblings and I with our father. My original financial aid had his 2014 taxes, which listed him as being legally separated from my mother and making ~100k, but he wasn't my primary care provider. 

When my information was audited, months after I received the original financial aid package, I submitted my dad's W2 and other paperwork from 2015 which had him making ~100k but now he is a single father. The only discernible difference is that I couldn't list living with my mother, so I could no longer claim that we were on government assistance. Based on this new information, my school and the federal government reevaluated their position and presented my new financial aid package: $6,500 in my federal student loans, and my father and I have to find $10,500 to cover the cost of /one/ semester. 

I'm calling the school today but I'm at a loss. It feels like I was played by my school; they made all these false promises that this would be affordable for my family and I but then swept the rug out from under my feet. My family and I cannot afford to accrue ~110k in debt over the course of my college career, plus interest. How much debt should I take on myself? I have my younger siblings to worry about, and I don't want my father's financial future compromised because he has ~84k in debt from my schooling (which is the current setup). Are there any options that I can look into to reduce the cost, if not for this semester than for semesters to come?",finance,1472218987
personalfinance,"Question about loans and equity- equal payments to car and student loans, or more towards one?","Hey guys, happy Friday!

I have two loans. One car, one student. Both loans have about the same principal and same low interest rate, making neither super advantageous to attack from an interest-saving standpoint where they stand. The car loan payments are roughly 1.5x that of the student loan payments. The car loan, however, is pretty new and not much of the principal is paid off. For reference, I put 20% down. 

Does it make more sense to put any extra payment towards the car loan for a while? By favoring the car loan, am I building equity on the car and lessening the risk of being upside down?

On the other hand, paying more toward the student loan payments would allow me to bang down the principal and keep both accounts at roughly the same level.

What do you guys think? Is it mostly personal preference at this point? In my head, I'm thinking hit the car payments hard and early to build up some quick equity, then shift my focus to the student loans later to beat down the principal.

Or maybe I'm just overthinking it all...",finance,1472219884

personalfinance,Lender Paid vs Borrower Paid Advice,"[x-post from r/mortgages]

I am currently in the process of buying a home with 10% down and a conventional, fixed rate mortgage.  I have the option of either lender paid or borrow paid.

Lender paid would be a higher interest rate with no PMI.  Roughly quoted at 3.75% and $1279/month for principal + interest.

Borrower paid would be a lower rate with ~$70/month PMI (up until the 20% mark).  Roughly quoted at 3.5-3.625% and $1309/month principal + interest for a total of $1379/month.

I am looking for some advice and/or a calculator that will help me understand the differences over the course of the loan and allow me to decide which to go for.  I am single and this is my first home.  I will be ""renting"" a room to a friend and plan to be in the house for at least 5 years (i can afford it without the ""rent"" money).

I'm an entry level engineer (by salary) with the duties of a level 2. General work weeks are 40 ish hours per week and the regular extra time put in for deadlines. I've been with my company 2.5 years. 

Recently there has been a lot of forced overtime with no pay. I was forced to go on two separate 2 month overseas jobs last year in dangerous environments, forced to work 14-20 hour days with only a modest per diem for food. I've been called back to work at 10pm on a Friday night. I've been made to stay till 3am to the point I could barely stay awake driving home. I'm asked to work during the weekend. You know..  beyond the regular couple extra hours to get a job done stuff. 

These things don't happen super frequently. Maybe once a month, sometimes in clusters. But it's getting worse. And after those trips last year, and the promise of a huge raise based on overtime worked, I was stiffed. And now every time I'm asked to come in on the weekend, it's all I can do to not break down if I don't have an excuse to get out of it. 

I understand that I'm not obligated to be paid overtime. But is there really no limit to what I can be forced to do? Am I really on call to return to work? To work weekends, to work 16 hour days for weeks on end?

I also know the obvious answer is to just leave, and believe me I've been trying. You don't have a lot of leverage when you're still trying to build your resume.

personalfinance,My ITT Story,"This is a story about a young man, inexperienced with the ways of the world, getting suckered into $25,000 of debt.  Forgive me for my awful story telling abilities.

It was around the year 2009 and I was fresh out of high school and didn't know what to do with my life.  Some friends told me about their plans to go to ITT because it was 'hands on' learning and had some pretty interesting majors.  Not having decided where I would go to college, this peeked my interest.  I found a major that was a great fit for me and since I had friends going, this solidified my decision to attend.

A few weeks later, I drove to ITT and started the enrollment process.  The first thing they do when you arrive is sweet talk themselves to you.  ""ITT is a great way to learn the skills you need in a short amount of time"", ""We have tons of students that find jobs right out of school"", ""Hands on training"".  Being young and stupid, my eyes lit up with excitement.  I knew this was going to be a great journey for my future self.  They then walked me into their office where they plop down a huge stack of papers to sign.  ""What's a little paperwork"", I thought to myself.  ""This is going to be the foundation of the rest of my life"".  As they were explaining the costs, it seemed a bit expensive but I had never applied to another school so for all I knew it was normal.  ""Good news!  you are eligible for a pell grant and federal aid to cover the remaining balance.""  Good ol' government here to save the day!  I can finally get an education and stop wondering what I'm going to do with my life.

Fast forward a few weeks and I finally get to attend something resembling college.  My family was proud because no one had gone to college before.  I was the perfect student.  Never missed a day and studied the hardest I've ever studied in my life.  One of my teachers was great and taught very well.  He attempted to help students understand the core concepts of the subject and was available to work with students that were struggling.  The rest of the teachers... not so much.  One teacher didn't know the subject they were teaching so they would play a YouTube tutorial video for us each day.  We would follow along with the video to learn the subject.  If we had questions, forget about it or google it.  The other teachers I believe were told to pass as many students as possible.  Students that only showed up every other class, whose work was half as good, somehow were making straight A's.  As long as you showed up enough to not get kicked out of school, you were getting a passing grade.  I was busting my ass every day and seeing people putting in 10% the effort getting the same grades.  This, coupled with the school being in a bad town and my long commute time, made me switch to a more local school at the end of the semester.  

At the new ITT location, I was feeling a bit hesitant but at least it was closer and in a better part of town.  Maybe this would effect the level of education I could obtain.  Maybe the teachers cared and just maybe I could make something of myself afterwards.  First off, I had to sign more paperwork and pay for school.  Same huge stack of paperwork, same tuition cost, BUT this time they threw a curve ball.  ""You're eligible for $[low amount] of financial aid because [reasons].""  We'll need you to take out a loan from this servicer to pay for the remaining amount.  This was strange, financial aid was available for the full amount before so why are they making me get a loan from this other place.  I can't turn back now... I don't have a backup plan.  Even if I did, state universities already started their semesters so I would have to wait 6 months to continue education elsewhere.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and started life at the new ITT location.

I quickly found that this ITT was not different than the previous.  My first class of the day was taught by a man fresh out of college with a degree in something totally unrelated to what we were learning.  He had no issue telling us this information.  ""Good morning class!  [Opens up YouTube].  It's time to start learning""  My god... more YouTube videos?  How am I supposed to get my questions answered?  After a few weeks I was fed up.  I started looking up universities in my area because surely they had to be better than this.  I was astounded when I saw the tuition prices.  I'm able to go to a legit university for a fraction of the cost?  I could have saved all that time and money if I would have been a little smarter?  It was time... time to say goodbye to ITT.  

During my free time, I began enrolling for the next semester at an actual university.  Wait... what happens to my credits from ITT.  Apparently there's this thing called 'Transfering your credits' where all your progress won't be lost and will count towards graduating at the university.  Awesome!  Not all my time and hard work will be a waste.  I headed to the office at ITT and told them my plans for university and how I needed a transcript so that I could transfer my credits.  To my dismay they told me that their credits would not transfer... WTF!  ITT is not an accredited university and all credits obtained are not eligible to transfer to my new university.  All.... for.... nothing.  At this point I was furious and decided that ITT will not get any more of my life.  Dropping out to prepare for the quickly upcoming university semester seemed like the best thing for me.  So I did.

Fast forward yet again.  I'm starting at a real university.  The teachers were great.  I was getting questions answered, and only paying $3k a semester.  I then started getting calls about a loan that was past due.  Huh? With student loans, as long as you're in school, payments are deferred.  Why am I getting this call?  ""We're calling to let you know your PEAKS private loan is overdue.""  I explained to them that I was still in school and it shouldn't be in repayment yet.  ""PEAKS private loans are only deferred if you're currently enrolled at ITT.  You will have to start repayment immediately.  The best we can do is give you a few months deferment.""  

I eventually had to start paying my PEAKS loan while going to university full time but it required me to work almost 40 hours a week on top of school to do so.  I was very young and inexperienced at the time which is my fault.  This doesn't mean I forgive them but it's not totally their fault.  It is the only true regret I have in my life and I'm still paying for it.  University life was great, I learned a lot and thankfully, now have a good job to show for it.  The End.

If there's anything I can do about the debt I owe to ITT please let me know!

I was wondering if someone could explain and help me better understand how the gift tax works (at federal and/or state level) for cash gifts. I've read a little bit about it, and it seems there's a $14,000 minimum/exemption of sorts. My question really is, if someone were to gift more than that $14,000 at once, is the income taxed in any way? So for example, if person A gifts person B $20,000 in cash, does either party have to pay taxes of any sort or will person B truly end up with $20,000 after the exchange?

My grandpa passed away recently and left me a little money, but it didn't go directly to me it went initially to my mom who is supposed to transfer it to me. So, I'm trying to figure out the best way to get that money in my name so that I can invest it, without losing some to taxes, etc. along the way.

My current financial status: I have $25k worth of student loans at 5.34%, all federal. I also have four credit cards: each with 20%+ APR.

personalfinance,Evaluate payment fees when assessing repayment order for loans.,"Brief background: have a huge amount of loans most of which are federal with interest rates as high as 7.9% have another small loan (~3600) through another provider (ECSI) which was at what I thought was a nice low (by comparison) interest rate of 5%.
Over the last 2 years I've been paying aggressively towards my higher rate loans and just paying the minimum monthly on the 5% loan + a service charge. It didn't occur to me to examine what that service charge actually was amounting to until very recently.
Minimum monthly payments for this loan were $40. For payments from a checking account they were charging a flat $1 fee which essentially equates to a 2.5% bump. For credit card payments they charged a 6% fee. So it turns out my 5% loan was actually a 7.5%-11% loan (depending on payment method). So, for convenience sake, I just paid it off in its entirety from my checking account.

personalfinance,Should I buy a home?,"I hope this is the correct subreddit I do not post a lot but really need some opinions.

My husband and I want to get our first house soon but the down payment has been very difficult to get. We recently moved into our in-laws home to save up the money. We have decent credit (about a 670 to 685 last I checked) but I am trying not to make a mistake and get something we can't afford or buy at the wrong time.

I live in the Houston, TX area and it has been booming with big businesses like Shell coming in. From what I have seen a decent house costs about 140 to 150. I really don't want to put down 8k by doing an FHA loan. I was thinking of doing a USDA loan because it is zero down. That way I could keep my 8k in savings (which I'll be at in a few months) and have money to fall back on in case anything happens  to either of our jobs or there is an emergency. I also don't mind the areas that USDA is in, I actually prefer them.

I feel like I may not be getting good advice  from those around me because my in-laws and parents all think I should jump and get a house now but I'm not sure the market is good. Also, I'm not sure about the monthly bills a house will typically have. I don't think the realtors I talk to will be as honest because they want me to buy now. 

If I do go the route of a USDA loan then I still don't know how to go about getting one. My credit union only does conventional and FHA (10% and 5% down), they don't do USDA loans. I don't know how to find a reputable company that will treat me the best and to make sure I'm getting a fair interest rate.

I feel like I have done all this research but I still don't know what I am doing. Should I just keep waiting? I need to leave my in-laws soon and tiny apartments here cost about 900 a month making it difficult to save very fast. My husband and I want a  home so bad but we don't want to make a mistake we can't easily fix.


TLDR; I want to get my first home but have no idea what I am doing and don't want to screw up.


Also if you would like to know my monthly bills are about 2000 without rent/house. That's phone bill, insurance, car payments (I have two, one at 250 one at 175), food, storage unit, gas.

I also might have the option of staying with one of my best friends. She just got a trailer (3 bedroom two bath) and has mentioned my husband and I could stay with her to keep saving. However, my husband is against the idea because she has a two year old daughter and in the past we have not had good experiences with roommates.

I’d like to get your opinions and advice on a couple of questions I have about early retirement. I’m in my mid thirties, with a wife and a 4-year-old kid. My wife is staying home, and is on-board with FIRE. I don’t think our current lifestyle is compatible with a FIRE goal, and I’m looking for new ways to approach and refine our goals.


Here is the summary: Until three years ago, we had had a quite frugal life -- both of us getting graduate degrees and then working in ""lowly"" academic positions. We never complained about the financial status then. Then, I was fortunate enough to find a high-paying job that I like to do. That requires us to live in a HCoL area in the U.S. We don’t have plans to continue to live here. In fact our retirement plans involve moving to a relatively low-cost city/country and downsize.


Status (all figures in USD)


**Retirement target** Have a stable net income of 50K to 65K annually. We know where we want to live -- it's a place we lived before and know about the quality of life we can achieve with that budget.


**Current Gross income** 280K annual (salary and bonus 200K which is quite stable, stock options 80K depending on the market conditions)


**Current spending** 115K annual + vacations

* 4900: Rent
* 1160: kid (including school, activities, etc.)
* 1000: Grocery (mostly from organic markets)
*  650: Dining out (three of us once a week ~100, with  friends once a month, ~150)
*  415: Car loan.
*  250: Coffee shops, sandwich, other expenses. 
*  250: Gas, public transportation, etc.
*  200: utilities
*  120: Hobies / books / entertainment
*  600: Irregular expenses (clothing, car maintenance, gifts, out of pocket health care)
* *Monthly* ~9500 (everytime I look at this number I shudder, but then I remember ~65% is rent and kid's expenses).


**Wealth** 210K

* 75K cash: Considering to make a home purchase and this would be part of down payment.
* 60K: A small house in a LCOL area. No rental income, but even if there was it would be minimal. 
*  0K: Yes it's 0. Summer / family house abroad (cost to acquire was 50K): We don’t consider this as material wealth, but it allows us to visit extended family and friends for long times. Our families are abroad, so I’m hoping this house will act as an anchor in my kid’s life. The opportunity cost to hold this is the 50K we paid to buy it.
* 95K in 401K account with the following distribution:
    - 65% domestic stock
    - 20% foreign stock
    - 15% bonds


**My questions**
1) I said my wife is onboard and she is. But she had a financially rough childhood and doesn’t really like to talk about budgeting, planning. She prefers that I budget, track the budget and set limits for our spendings and she is happy to follow along. Has anyone had a similar experience with their spouses? Is this sustainable in the long term? Are there any signs I should be aware of that could indicate a problem?


2) Our lifestyle is quite expensive. I think we’d be happy to downsize. Two of us had lived frugally in the past and we were happy back then. I started to use YNAB to track our spendings and create a budget. What little but concrete steps we could take?


3) Our retirement age will be way earlier than 59. But an important portion of our savings is in 401K. How can I take this into account when I plan our retirement budget? For example, let's say I decide we need 1M in wealth to retire. Does it matter 30% of that money is tied to a 401K account that we won't be able to touch for the next 15 years?


4) After retirement, we’ll only need to pay for US federal tax because we’ll be living outside of the US. Considering our spending is around 50K, what are my options for investment allocations to minimize the tax burden?


5) Even after retirement, I’ll be and would like to work on my main area of expertise (research/software) and that means we will have flexibility in adjusting our withdrawals depending on market conditions (if things get rough we can spend quite a bit less and/or make some money on the side to avoid touching our investments).

The real problem is, despite not paying the bill for 3 months, there are 9 missed payments on my report.

personalfinance,Best strategy to pay off my mortgage early,"I owe 480k on my mortgage at 4% interest rate, and I want to pay it off early. After budgeting I determined that my wife and I can save around 60k/year.
What's the best strategy to pay it off? I was thinking of various options:

- Make a 60k extra payment every year directly to the bank toward principal
- Put the extra 60k in a CD or bonds until we have 480k saved up, and pay the mortgage off
- Put the 60k a year into a riskier Vanguard fund, pay off the mortagage when we reach 480k

I am leaning towards options 2 or 3, because I see more benefits by saving the money, instead of giving it back to the bank over time:

- Savings are available in case of emergency
- They generate interest
- Making extra payments over time will not reduce my monthly payments (waiting on my bank to confirm that)

Is there something off in this strategy? Any advice, recommendation or experience sharing will be appreciated.

Sometime in the future, I am about to receive a $50K inheritance from part of my father's 401K (not passed away) set forth by my parents as part of their divorce settlement. I am not entirely sure of the path, but the FA with Fidelity said when all the paperwork is said and done, I can cash it out or reinvest. There are 2 things that immediately came to mind on how to use the funds: 1. Reinvest the whole amount into a more diversified fund (it's currently earning under a single company's stock at the moment) or 2. Use the entire amount or a substantial amount toward my $62K student loan debt. Here is the breakdown:

* 3.860% - 6,326.31
* 3.760% - 1,021.16

How to set her up for life?","**Edited 8/27:** Thank you, PF, for giving me a lot to think about and some great insights into how to help my mom remain independent and comfortable. Definitely hiring an estate lawyer and meeting with a more reputable CPA ASAP. I never even thought of a condo or 55+ living. 

Hi Personal Finance,

My father died very unexpectedly earlier this year a week after his 58th birthday from undiagnosed heart failure. He was self employed and my mother (60) hasn't had a job outside the home since I was born, oh, 33 years ago. She is very financially ignorant, and gets overwhelmed easily when it comes to money and hard adulting. She didn't even know where they banked, if they had debt, or what bills they had or how to pay them.

A week or so after my dad passed, I peeked into their finances. Yikes. A really run down home that has two mortgages on it for 90K now in foreclosure (nearly twice what this home could go for), an IRA containing ~5K that has her as the beneficiary, two paid off but older cars in his name, 19K in credit card debt in his name only, and 20K owed in federal taxes. $1200 in their mutual account. My husband and I took over her bills, and she was just recently approved for Widow's Benefits/SSI of $1289/month beginning in October.

My dad had just pulled out a life insurance policy for $1,000,000, 90 percent for mom, and 10 for me, exactly a year before his death. After 5 months of agonizing paperwork, interviews, and the ""contestable period"" gauntlet with his life insurance company we received notice that the claim was approved and the checks were in the mail! It is bittersweet, but a relief to my mom that she won't have to lean so heavily on me financially.

So... now what?

1. What does one do with a check for $900,000? She banks at a small credit union. Does she put it all in a savings account while she figures things out? She is terrified her account will get hacked and all her money will disappear. She is borderline considering just stuffing it into multiple mattresses.

2. Her knee-jerk reaction is to shove it all in savings, buy a small $100K home in rural Florida outright so she'll never have to worry about housing again, and live a very frugal life. She is very frugal, and I have no doubt she could make the rest of that money last, but I'm also worried about her getting older and needing a lot of expensive assistance considering she is 60, smokes 2 packs a day and weighs less than 90 pounds. She saw my dad crash and burn in the stock market repeatedly as he tried to create a retirement for them, and she's very anti-investment.

3. Her accountant filed their taxes separately, since she makes less than $2K a year selling on eBay. My dad still owes 20K in taxes for 2015. Am I missing something here or will she still be liable for his taxes since they are married? He did have his own LLC, and the accountant said the taxes belonged to the LLC and my mom was never a part of the LLC.

4. Her home is in foreclosure and she plans on walking away. Her name is on the deed but not on either of the mortgages. Is she still on the hook? 

5. What is her best case scenario for making this money last and work for her for the next 20-30 years, considering she will need increasing care. Is there a possibility she can put her money somewhere that could safely give her 30-50K a year in dividends?

6. She is currently on my health insurance (purchased through the Marketplace). Because Florida was run by assholes, Medicare was not expanded, and after my dad died she was suddenly ""too poor"" to qualify for a subsidy and 5 years away from Medicare. She is now my dependent. Can she remain my dependent even with the life insurance? Is it counted as income? 

6. Will this windfall cancel her social security payments? I don't think it is taxed as income, but I know any dividends she earns on it will be and if those are high enough they can lower her payments. 

7. She has no debt in her name, unless the 2015 taxes will also apply to her. No credit cards, no loans, no cars, no mortgage with her name on it. She does not plan on working. 


Thank you for any insights, PF!

I have already saved enough to pay off all these loans in full, and the money is currently sitting in an Ally savings account earning 1% interest. Since my servicer Great Lakes will let you call in to make a credit card payment with no fees, I plan to use my Fidelity Visa to make payments throughout 11/2016 in order to take advantage of the 2% cashback. The plan is to make a payment on my credit card and immediately pay off the balance with the cash in my savings account, freeing up my credit to make another payment, repeat throughout November until my federal subsidized loans have been paid in full (the Perkins will be dealt with 1/2017 before the grace period ends).

I also have a Chase Freedom credit card which has 0% APR until 10/2017. Should I consider making all the payments on my loan using this card (which has 1% cashback) and build up a credit balance?

So here is my wife and I’s situation.  My employer pays 100% of my graduate school tuition, as well as 50% of my wife's graduate school tuition (we're both doing a part-time MBA program).  This is all fantastic for us, until it comes time to pay the taxes.  

The way my employer makes sure I pay the taxes is for 4 weeks towards the end of each semester, the take the total tuition paid for that semester, divide it by 4, and add it to 4 paychecks.  Now I don't see that cash on my direct deposit, it's already been paid to the University, but it is counted as income and taxes are taken out at that time.  The first $5,250 each year is tax free, but everything after that I am responsible for ($9,640 x 3 Semesters = $28,920 - $5,250 = $23,670 for me, $14,460 for my wife [wife also gets $7,500/yr from her employer and she uses the $5,250 tax benefit there] so that's a whopping $38,130 of extra income that I'm responsible for in taxes.

My question is, my employer, up until this semester (I should mention this is my first semester, my wife’s third semester), had a tax waiver that stated if courses being taken were required to fulfill my job, or help you maintain your job, you were not responsible to pay taxes on that benefit amount.  For whatever reason my employer no longer offers this form.  My question is, is there a federal form that I can fill out come tax time that will do the same thing?  If not, why is it only through my employer’s payroll/HR that this was possible (and when I google it, other Universities are offering the same tax form to their employees)?  For my wife, when she’s requesting her tuition reimbursement through her employer, she just has to answer 3 simple questions, and it’s decided from there if she has to pay taxes on the benefits offered to her through her employer.

I understand there are other ways to deduct some of this tuition cost when we file our income tax return, but I feel like we won’t get that full benefit because we make too much money (my wife makes more than I do).  

Any advice or insights into some potential options I have would be greatly appreciated.  If any more info is needed, I'm happy to get it to you as quickly as I can.  Again, PF, I love you guys, and thank you in advance for the help anyone offers up.  Have a great weekend!",finance,1472297296

20k revolving credit, no balances  
10k credit account has 14% APR (generous cashback, so I use this for daily purchases)  
6k car loan at 2%  


Current budget for this fall semester has me losing approximately 400$/mo at 15hrs/week working. This is okay because I will only be in the hole ~1500 by the end of the semester and should be able to recoup this deficit while working over the winter break.

Is it in my best interest to withdraw from my retirement accounts that I have sitting? This isn't much $, but it could possibly be enough to keep me alive for a semester while I run a deficit. Perhaps I'm better off rolling one over into the other? Additionally, if I were to take out student loans what is my best option and deal regarding this?

personalfinance,I'm currently a student at ITT Tech. What do I do?,"I know, dumb mistake but now I have to sleep in the bed that I have made.  I enrolled in online classes because I have a full time job and a family and it was for electronic engineering in February.  As far as I can tell from all the research I have done (after I enrolled unfortunately) is that the are a Sugar Honey Ice Tea school with absolutely unless degrees. The information on the federal loan website I have seen from what I can tell gives 3 options.
 1. ""Pause"" my education to see what the outcome is and IF it closes I will receive a discharge of the loan and I can start from scratch (which I will end up doing anyways because the only school in my area that has electronic engineering doesn't accept  ITT Tech credits) 
2. Change to a different school for a different subject and recieve a discharge IF ITT closes 
3. Change to a different school for the same courses but I would be responsible for the loan. 

I think option one is the best bet because from what I can see ITT will most likely go bankrupt but the risk is who knows how long it will take and who knows If they well actually close. 

I don't want to go into a different course because I had fun learning what I did from the ""classes"".

personalfinance,First time post here - Questions on paying early on student loans,"My mother recently cashed in a life insurance policy and wrote me a check for $3000.  I want to put this full amount on my student loans; which are not currently in repayment.  Repayment beings 1/2/2017.  I have reviewed the debt wiki and understand the 2 methods of avalanche versus snowball and still have a couple of questions.  Here are my loan balances &amp; interest rates:

$12,000 at 7% with $500 accrued interest, 
$21,000 at 6% with $1200 accrued interest, and
$7,000 at 4% with $200 accrued interest

Obliviously I have no intention of putting the $3000 on the 4% loan.  My gut tells me to put the full amount on $12,000 7% loan because it is the highest interest.  However, my logic is telling me that the $21,000 6% interest loan will be accruing much more interest, faster than the 7% loan.  In your (very helpful) opinion, which loan should I put the cash on?  And also this prepayment before the loans go in to repayment should lower my minimum payment due right?  My current minimum payment starting in Jan 2017 is $350, which I plan to pay $400 every month.  Your comments are appreciated!",finance,1472314923

personalfinance,Bait-and-Switch Employment?,"Hello,

I saw a similar post on here not too long ago, but my situation is slightly different and I am not sure what to do about it. I'll try to make this as brief as possible.

I am a 23 yo graduate student at CUNY Hunter. I have been staying in Fishkill and commute via the Metro-North train 3x a week to campus. I picked up a job at a doggie daycare in Briarcliff Manor. The posting for the job I applied to as a professional dog walker and pet sitter listed the salary as $30-35k a year. I obtained an interview and was told that this was so and that I would train one or two weeks in the daycare center before they put me into a route, but that there were routes available for when I was cleared for my drug screening, driving test, etc etc. So I signed. My first worry was that I was not given a copy of any of the papers that I signed.

Come a month and a half later, I am still in the daycare. It is a fun job but I stand for ten hours, it can be stressful, and when it's not, I want to gouge my eyes out because I am bored. I have tried contacting the owner, who is directly responsible for scheduling, hiring, and the such, and she avoided me until conceding to let me ride along with a walker (unpaid) and then promised me to meet within the week to discuss ""promoting"" me to dog walker, if she thinks I will be committed to it, able to do it, and that I am responsible enough. Which threw me back, because wasn't I already reviewed for the position they hired me for?

It has been two weeks since the ride along. She has avoided all my attempts to contact her and the managers claim they can't contact her for me. I watched this woman literally run from the building and drive away as I pulled into the parking lot at one point. I have sent her four emails over the last week and a half with my evolving availability and informing her that I need to discuss my future with the company. She has blatantly ignored me and uses the same email to send me my daycare schedule (less than a day before the first shift starts, which is terribly inconvenient for planning). There is no HR department. I am ridiculed as a child (I look younger than I am) by the owner's husband, which is offensive. I also signed to be full-time and they have yet to give me more than 30 hours. My time clock never matches my checks, with the checks being what one would calculate based on the days and times I was scheduled to work (I arrive early, work late, and have been asked to work through lunches, which is never reflected). 

Furthermore, despite attempts to keep all the staff separated into different yards, I have spoken to at least two other people who are in the same situation as I am, with one hired before me and another after me. The one hired before me was told that there were a series of steps he had to complete before becoming a dog walker and knew about the situation. The one hired after me was as clueless as I was. She was also told that there are no routes available at the time and that's why we are there. However, the business is still posting for more dog walkers and pet sitters to apply, promising that ""available positions are both for existing and new clients, so this is the best time to come on board as you WILL NOT be starting with an empty route."" I know that the daycare is currently down two workers due to accidents and that they are short-staffed, which might be why they are retaining us there. I also was told that the other walkers were never made to be in the daycare, which destroys the ""it's procedure"" reply from the owner. It honestly feels as though baiting people in to be walkers and sitters and switching them down into the daycare is the only way they can staff the daycare. They did the same to the assistant groomer. We are all waiting for our ""promotions"" to the jobs we a qualified for and were hired for. 

Here's the skinny.

**My Issues:**

* Hired for a $30-35k/yr job, full time
* Being paid $10/hr, 20-30hrs/wk
* Dishonest hours in checks
* Lack of communication
* Utter disrespect

**My Monthly Expenses:**

* Rent - $800
* Auto loan - $160
* Auto/Life Ins - $105
* Phone - $110
* Transportation ~$500 (working on minimizing this)
* Student loans - Deferred 

As you can probably guess, I cannot live off the wages I am earning. I accepted the job using the figures they promised me, because I would be comfortable. Furthermore, between classes and the way this woman plans the schedule, I am blocked from getting a second job. My only hesitation to quitting, other than not having another job yet, is whether I might get the walking position. However, I am frustrated to point of not wanting to attend my shifts. And I am not making rent this month, which is an issue, in the least. I am not sure whether there is anything I can do other than leave.

personalfinance,Questions about doing a total cash distribution withdraw from my 401k.,"I've recently left my company of 12 years and moved to Canada to finish a degree program. I'm in my 30's and I have just under $30,000 in my 401k. I will need to eventually do a total cash distribution withdraw. I am aware of all the penalties associated with withdrawing funds, but how exactly to avoid making the matter worse I'm unsure of how to proceed.

My first question is should I roll my 401k over into an IRA now and then do a total cash distribution withdraw at the beginning of the next fiscal year to avoid being bumped up into another tax bracket and paying more income taxes? 

Another point for me to consider is I've heard that when I opt for a withdraw my company will automatically automatically withhold 20% of my 401k, and on top of that there's an additional 10% and I would be subjected to paying state income taxes. My federal income tax rate is only 15% so why would my company withhold 20%?

personalfinance,$12k in credit card debt and considering a personal loan to consolidate over 36 monthly payments,"I was the first in my family to go to college. Neither of my parents have particularly great credit, nor were they able to financially support me when I went to school. I attended a medium-sized public school, financing it with federal student aid as well as scholarships and on-campus work. I went to grad school and earned a master’s degree, and upon finishing got a job in my field originally making $42K and now $50K following my promotion. My career mobility seems to be positive and I got through undergrad and grad owing $50K in student loans (in total). That’s the good news.

I also built up quite a lot of debt over 5 years in school and then 8 months of job hunting, equating to $12K in credit card debt. I don’t consider myself to be financially irresponsible with my cards; I try not to live beyond my means, but there were times where I had to put things on my card and it just slowly cascaded into an unmanageable bundle. I sat down and analyzed my expenses in Excel, and as much as I have been trying over the past 6 months, the high interest payments on the cards are just killing me.

I looked into a personal bank loan to consolidate my credit card debt and start fresh. My FICO score has taken a big hit from the high utilization rate of 91%, currently sitting between 620 and 650 depending on the reporting agency. However, there is a highly-rated service out there called Upstart, started by what looks to be some Silicon Valley types that presumably considers education, test scores, and earnings potential in making a personal loan. I applied, and was approved for $13K at 11.03% APR over 36 months at a $402 per month repayment rate (roughly $1,700 interest). I shopped around for better rates, but this was the lowest --- SoFi would not even give me a quote, and others were way too high (&gt;18% APR). 

So many questions:
1. Does anyone have experience with Upstart?
2. Is this a crazy plan? I can make the monthly payments under my current income, it’s only $50 more than I spend now repaying my debts, and it puts a clock on my debt repayment of 36 months, instead of languishing in it.
3. Is this a reasonable APR, and prospectively, could I get a better rate elsewhere?

Thanks all!

personalfinance,"If a graduate pays a ""deferment fee"" on private student loans (i.e. ""pays NOT TO pay""), will interest still compound or stay simple?","I've been given an application in the mail by a federal student loan servicer, to discharge federal loans based on a disability. I haven't gotten that kind of application from a private student loan servicer. Is there such a thing as a disability discharge from private student loans?

When I asked what options there were to defer or forebear private student loans, I was told either pay interest-only (at $220-229/month), or pay a deferment fee (at $50 for each private loan, every 3 months. With three private loans, that amortizes to $50/month.)

While on that call, I didn't think about asking whether interest remains simple or compounds while paying these deferment/forebearance fees (which is ""paying not to pay,"" jiminy christmas.) That's why I'm asking you.

If interest compounds while paying this fee not to pay, then I'll actually save money in the longer run by enrolling in 6 credit-hours of community college courses every semester (on my own dime) so I can keep interest simple while continuing to defer loans.",finance,1472328286

His student loans | $119k | 6.8%
My student loans | $34k | 6.0%

Cash-our refi quote (30-yr fixed): $315k @ 4.25% rate / 4.379% APR (would receive $144k cash at closing and use to pay off bulk of student loan balances)

We (32F &amp; 33M) bought our house 5 years ago as a short-sale and the market has since surged here in CO. Selling would be our very last resort – our family loves our home, our oldest is finally in the school we wanted, extended family lives nearby, we’d have to spend even more to get in another house, etc. We also finished our walk-out basement (that’s what the remaining cc debt is from) and could likely rent it out for $800-900/mo. Even if we do the refi, our mortgage would still be comparable to what people are paying just to rent apartments around here. 

I recognize we’d be giving up the benefits that go along with federal student loans, but wouldn’t it be more to our advantage to have that in our house anyway? We are approaching the income level that we can no longer get the tax benefits from the student loans, but we would get tax benefits from the mortgage still, correct? And worst case scenario, if we lost our house, the debt would go away, whereas student loans can’t be discharged in bankruptcy.
 
Anything big I’m not considering here? Any other recommendations? Thanks in advance!

*Edit:* Current monthly mortgage payment is $1355, and current monthly student loans payments are $375 (IBR, likely increasing next year) and $250 (standard), respectively.

I get paid based on how much work I do, and how much work I do is solely up to me.

The minimum I try to make is $1400 per week before taxes. This past week I made over $2000. If this trend continues, then my monthly income could be anywhere from $5,600-7,000.

I've got disability accommodations now which should also help. 
I have a few student loans that I'm trying to figure out what the amounts and interest rates are. My dad did all of the FAFSA stuff for me (despite me asking to do it myself) so I've been out of the loop for that stuff. I'll likely go back to full-time next semester so Ill be well within my grace-period for repayment. The only clue I may have to how much my loans are from when I checked CreditKarma. I just got another credit card to even out my utilization and I'm into the whole churning deal. I saw under credit Karma about 4 or 5 different things labelled student. It totaled at $18000. I'm ASSUMING that's how much I've taken out in loans for the past 4 years.

I signed up for the installment plan at my college and have paid the first 10%, and over the next 3 months I'll have 3 more 30% installment payments. My total due currently will total at about $4000 in tuition when all said and done.  When I'm fulltime, my tuition will likely go back up to $6k a semester, but I'm trying to apply for scholarships at least and maybe take summer courses at a community college here.

+ Savings for loans: $500

+ Personal Savings: $500

+ Dog Expenses: $30

+ Taxes to set aside: 25%, I was planning on $1400 originally, based on the 5600 per month, but now I'm making more than I expected.

Total Expenses: $3903, give or take a bit. 
(not including tuition of $4k)

Total Income: anywhere from $5600 to $7000

Obviously, whatever is left over is pretty much added on to just savings and used for tuition and loans. Am I saving enough minimum for taxes? What about loans? If I really hunkered down and tried to keep earning that $2k each week, would I be able to possibly pay off that $18000 loan next year?

Also, as far as taxes go, I was told that technically I need to be paying quarterly, but that since I just started I can just start next Jan/Feb when my 'employer' (more like client) gives me my 1099?

&gt;The most straightforward way to unencumber interest rate policy completely at the zero
bound is to abolish paper currency. In principle, abolishing paper currency would be effective,
would not need new technology, and would not need institutional modifications. However, the
public would be deprived of the widely-used bundle of services that paper currency uniquely
provides—a generally accepted paper medium of exchange providing transactions services
especially for low-value transactions; a readily accessible, safe liability of the central bank; a
store of value; a degree of privacy in financial management; and the option to hold money
outside the banking system and to withdraw deposits at par as paper currency in times of
financial stress. Hence, the public is likely to resist the abolition of paper currency until mobile
access to bank deposits becomes cheaper and more easily available, ATM charges for access to
paper currency become excessive, and/or electronic currency substitutes become widely
available.

The site’s easy navigation, useful/ applicable information, and genuine people have changed my life like never before. One credit card down, 2 more to go!
So the skinny: (May, 27) 3 months ago, I was in delinquency on all three of my credit cards. ($5,000; about $2000+, and another $2500 or so). I got the $2000 (wellsfargo) one to settled for about 1500 (no interest), the 2500 (chase) one to bring the interest rate down from about 18-21% to 2.2, and the last one I messed up and still owe 4000k and still have an insane interest rate (18 or 21% from Elan Financial, GREAT LESSON BY THE WAY, more on that later). ALL OF THEM HAD MAJOR LATE FEES, INTEREST MONEY INCURRING, AND OVER CREDIT LIMIT FEES!

On 8/26, I paid off the Wellsfargo CC! Thanks again to personal finance and frugality subs! I cut some MAJOR fat out, set a budget, and even though it was soooo hard to pass up tons of clearance items and dining out, the future is looking very bright!

About me: I am a Junior high Mathematics teacher that made about $38,000 (gross)/30,000(net) during the 2015-2016 school year. (Being stupid/lazy, I barely put in the papers last month to have my loans deferred while I work in a low income school after paying about $170/month and have them forgiven 2 more years) I never budgeted, lived paycheck to paycheck from dining out, over spending, and not shopping around for prices on many things. I live with both my parents (I am in my late 20’s). My dad is on disability, my mom works, and sadly, pays the majority of the bills. Don’t worry, its even more saddening/pathetic…. I have three young children, and my wife is finishing up her teaching degree (student teaching this whole school year). Oh life’s bad choices just keep on piling on: I bought a Jeep two years ago for about $25000 ( I think I put 2-3 thousand down, I really tried to forget/ be in denial how dumb that purchase was/ be in YOLO mode) and the cherry on top? I made a STUPID decision (won’t say what) and got in some legal trouble that ended up paying for a lawyer/state fines/increased car insurance/classes/……a monthly ….fee for 6 months ( I had to pay for installation, and unstallation for it too, you get the gist of it). That Jeep also needs to be waxed if I want the paint to look as nice/ last long, which I Haven’t in a while, ANOTHER ADD ON I didn’t think about then!

Right before I got into legal trouble, I believe I had no debt “besides” student loans and my car loan. I would buy an unnecessary thing here and there (ex. Hundred dollars here and there for games, guitar lessons, whatever on Amazon, unused gym memberships (monthly fees and yearly fees), UPGRADED PHONE EVERY YEAR, stupid $5-8 starbucks drinks about 3 times a week, flank steak, craft beer, and so on and so on. So having to pay for stupidity with credit cards and not modifying my life style AT ALL, I ended up in a really deep hole. My credit score is in the 500’s after I was “proud” to be in the 690’s I believe. It was hard and embarrassing to tell the collectors to work with me and see what “options” there were.  I cant even transfer debt to 0% credit card, applied twice and got denied *its also possibly hurting my already low credit score from the reviews the companies are doing on me*

After I received my summer check, I was determined to begin to long climb out of this hole. After reading many post, I “negotiated/haggled” into a deal/plan. Chase and Wellsfargo were nice and worked with me. At first, Chase wanted to bring it down to like 9%, but I told them that I would call back if I could get more “money from friends”, I actually had some more wiggle room than what I told them but this was part of the haggling. Then after hearing Wellsfargo offering 2 or 3 percent, I called Chase and after many “talks with their supervisor” they lowered it to 2.2% and to $39 a month on a repayment plan. Wellsfargo settled after negotiations, but it was my biggest monthly payment of about $256 a month (I paid a whopping $1000 yesterday thanks to you redditors, my parents, discipline, and a pay raise).

BE CAREFUL, and learn from this story: For Elan financial, the collector told me I could settle and slash my debt in half if I paid like $1500 or something big (I wish I could have, but I didn’t dare ask my parents for that with them paying the mortgage, and 70% of the bills). All I could muster was $1000 or so to stop the over limit fees BUT she said I could call back and I could ask for a lower interest rate with the actual bank’s customer service once I got “out” of collections cause I guess once you’re in the super red, you get transferred to the collectors when you try to call some banks customer service. WELL…. I called back after my funds went thru like the lady said… and Elans financial said that there was no such thing as lowering interest rate with them/ settling. I talked to different agents and even talked to a supervisor and nothing could be done to help me I guess because now I was in the clear, even though I was barely under my credit limit.

My Next plan is to heavily attack that Elan CC with as much money as I can. (I make $2400/month net now, 2016-2017) One could argue that I should have put that extra money I did to wellsfargo towards the Elan CC because of the high interest rate, but please understand that I needed a small victory at this point of my life. I have virtually zero in savings, some of you could argue that that’s really dangerous, and I know it is. Nonetheless, I plan to be in a completely different place financially, physically ( thanks /fitness), and move out and stop living this irresponsible and immature life and start getting some self dignity.

There was a great excel sheet that helped me visualize my debt/income a user posted. I’ll add it later or confirm which one it was if one of you post the link.

There is hope! Don’t feel like a loser! ( Yes, we all wish we were in a different place right now, I wish I was paying 100% of utilities for my parents while we live here, graduated college sooner, didn’t buy [ insert overpriced item], didn’t get into trouble, ect) Read some leadership/self-help books and keep reading reddit post! Discipline is super hard for those first few weeks, but your body and mind adapt.

I hope to follow up with you guys when I pay off my other CC and hopefully show you how crazy my spending was and how much better it has gotten with data and graphs.

personalfinance,Just Got Pre-approved for a Home Loan-- Questions,"So my partner and I just got pre-approved for a home loan for $220K. The credit union had a loan program for first-time buyers that included 0% down and no PMI (NOT an FHA loan!). The catch? Interest rate is 4.5% (fixed, 30 year loan). Closing costs are high too-- in the $4K range. 

We were approved easily for the amount we requested, however, here's our situation: we have money for a down but not a full 20%. This puts us into a situation where we will be paying PMI on our loan if we go the conventional route. I have done a few calculations and it seems that if we go with a conventional loan and give the smaller down our payment ends up lower than if we take the 0% down loan. Interest on the conventional loan was somewhere around 3.7% and closing costs were in the $2500 range, if memory serves. 

It's hard to find a house under 200K in my area right now. Today we viewed a fixer house for $155K (but we have been advised it will go for more like $175K+). We really liked it, the location is pretty great and are not opposed to having a house that needs some work (floors, paint, power washing and painting exterior trim, possibly adding dual paned windows, A/C unit, kitchen appliances). The biggest expense our realtor pointed out was that the basement needs supports added to one wall and drainage added to the yard on that side of the house because water is coming in (we will have a thorough inspection done!). 

If we go with the 0% down loan we have money (~20K) that we can drop into the house for the needed repairs. Our payment would be in the $1150 range ($175K, 0% down) with no PMI including 1.3% property tax and $1000/year homeowners insurance, according to [mortgagecalculator.org](http://www.mortgagecalculator.org/). 

If we do the conventional loan and put our $20K as a down then we would have to finance the repairs somehow. However, our payment with 1% PMI would be less at $1,115 but would drop after about 5 years when the PMI falls off to $990. I have heard that there is a way to refinance to get rid of the PMI, but I am unsure what the rules are about this so maybe the PMI could come off sooner? 

Bottom line, I'm not sure which way is the smarter way to go. The plan is to live in the house for at least 5 years. 

*What sort of loans would we need to finance the work if we put money down instead of putting it toward repairs? 

*Are the interest rates similar to home loans? 

*The mortgage calculator I used factors in $1000/year for homeowners insurance as a default number but I have no idea if this would be a good ballpark number or not-- any suggestions as to how much I should assume to pay for homeowners insurance? EDIT: average for my state is $800 ish per year. Just to be safe, I'm doing my calculations at $1600/year now. 

*If we bought at 0% and 4.5% interest could we refinance it at a later time for a lower payment? How does refinancing work? 


Thanks for reading and answering my questions!

EDIT: The 0% loan *IS NOT* an FHA loan. It is a first time homebuyer loan product that is offered through Coastal Federal Credit Union and works as a conventional loan.",finance,1472348251

personalfinance,General Advice-Personal Loan vs HEL,"Sorry in advance if the format is in poor quality, long time lurker.

I'm going to be starting a ""business"", I use the quotations because I don't see a profit turn within 4 years reasonable. I suppose we can call it a personal project. Anyway, it requires me building a studio. I've been looking into personal loans and talking with an accountant in passing, he says I'm likely looking at 15% interest on a 20k loan. 

I mentioned this to my father and he said we could build a studio on his property (2.5 acres, doesn't plan on moving for 7 years)  and he said he could take out an equity loan since his house is paid off, as long as it meets the criteria for a barn after we strip it down the line so it adds property value.

Now, I have a great relationship with my father and appreciated the offer, but I've never asked him for anything like this and have been against being a burden in the years since I've graduated high school (currently 21) so I declined. 

Looking into all of the options however, it seems like that might be the smartest idea since it seems it's a lower interest rate and long term he would be gaining the property value after I've gotten my feet on the ground.

I guess I'm asking:

What are general interest rates on Home Equity Loans?

Is there a benefit to using a Home Equity Line of Credit over a Loan?

And, is there any downside to this financially I'm completely over looking?

personalfinance,"Accepting a higher interest rate loan/mortgage, in exchange for more cash in your pocket, only to pay down a large portion strait away","This is more of a theoretical question just to figure out how this works.

There are a lot of mortgages that give you cash up-front in exchange for a higher interest rate.  I don't remember the exact terminology but you can get ""cash out mortgages"", you can buy/sell the mortgage ""ladder"" at the bank (exchanging basis points for the total amount financed), and you can also get so-called no-fee mortgages that pay some of your closing costs upfront, but in exchange for a higher interest rate.

The idea of this last type of mortgage is that you end up paying those fees anyway, you just pay them in the form of a higher interest rate.  So my question is, if I take that type of mortgage, and then pay it down, say by 50%, do I end up ahead in terms of those fees?  Instead of paying $3,000 in closing costs in the form of a higher rate, would I end up paying $1,500 instead?  Does similar logic apply to other types of mortgages?

I understand that people suggest keeping your cash and investing it, so that, hopefully, the market return beats your interest rate, but like I said, this is more of a theoretical question.",finance,1472393771

I hate the idea of paying interest when I have the funds to pay additional principal. I get the whole ""if you make more return on your investments than you pay in interest on your debt, don't pay more on your debt than you have to and invest the rest"" concept, but as a new grad with minor credit card debt that needs to be paid off immediately and student loan debt to be paid after that, I don't think I have enough funds to even notice an effect of living by that mantra.

personalfinance,[Debt] How can I help my girlfriend with her student loan debt? (~6k on Credit Card).,"My girlfriend is halfway through her dental hygiene program. We've been together for five years, but she is still living with her parents so I've been letting them handle the finances. About six months ago, I asked for specifics on how they were paying, and she said she had a credit card for 'supplies'. Back then it was nearing 3k for things like tools, glasses (I don't remember what they're called but they are like 1500 bucks) [edit: dental loupes], and other things. She said that her mom planned on making payments so I really wasn't that worried about it. I did get an uneasy feeling, however, when she said 'well I'm not paying interested until x month so as long as we get it paid off by then we're good. Obviously, that month has come and passed, and adding new things such as food, more supplies, etc, has brought the card up to nearly 6k. I just found that out recently. 

She's going to max out that card before she's done with school (7k limit), and from what she tells me, boards (final exams) can cost upwards of another 5k.

With my current situation, I could technically just pay off her card right now, but I bought a house this year and wouldn't feel comfortable with my savings taking a hit like that. On top of that, if boards are really 5k, we're going to need some sort of loan either way. I've looked at student loans that seem like they aren't tuition specific, but the interest rates seem as high as the credit card rate (I haven't asked, but based off of my cards I'm going to assume her rate is around 20%).

Best case scenario, if we could get a 10-15k loan that wouldn't accrue interest until after she graduates, that would be perfect. Does anyone know of such a thing, or am I just dreaming? I wish I knew more about the loan thing, but I received a decent scholarship and worked full time during school, so I never took any out. I've really only been researching loans for the last day, so I hope you guys &amp; gals can cut me some slack on being so clueless. I'm researching this stuff as quickly as I can but I figured there would be some good information and experience here.

I've also heard people mention shifting the debt from one card to another which would transfer the debt and put off the interest until after she graduates. That would be ok, except for the fact that she's still going to need more money between now and then. I guess if this really is the best option, I could help here with whatever is left after that.

I'll take any advice I can get, thanks so much for taking the time to read.",finance,1472399559

I went for an annual preventative care appt in Dec 2015.  They submitted my claim under the wrong name and it took me four months and a conference call with my health insurance company to convince them to resubmit with correct details (they insisted this wasn't the issue, but it went through fine when they finally did it).

I thought that was finally the end of it.  I recently applied for a mortgage on my first home purchase and their credit check discovered a collections which took me below the excellent credit zone resulting in a higher interest rate.

I called the lab the collections was listed under, and they told me to call my doctor and ask about codes they sent that were non-preventative.  They also told me the address they were sending letters to, which was the wrong house number so that's why I never received them.

The doctors office was rude as usual and insisted all codes were preventative.  I called my insurance company, and they said there was work done that was indeed not preventative.  I had another conference call with insurance and the doctor's office, and they FINALLY admitted there were non-preventative codes for a test I was totally unaware of for a problem I knew I didn't have.  It burns down to the word of the doctor vs mine on whether we talked about having that test done or not.

To get this off my record, I called the lab and paid off the $60 balance.  I just found out that this doesn't remove the collections from my credit report.

We have previously taken a combination of Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, Direct Parent PLUS Loans, and then minor grants that barely make a dent in the larger number. The largest loan chunk has always been the Direct Parent Plus Loan which is coming out to be $34,555 this time, which is considerably more than we usually accept in loans.

This time around, my father proposed the idea of getting the student loans from Discover because they offer 1% cash back reward if GPA is at least 3.0 (mine has always been above that).

My skepticism stems from the relatively small return &amp; negative stigma around private student loans put forth by the federal student aid website.

personalfinance,Do we bother filling out the FAFSA if we make above 6 figures and have some investments and want to get scholarships?,"Hello all,
I'm in a confusing situation. 

My wife is in school, and wants to apply for scholarships but they all require ""demonstrated need"" via a FAFSA on file. I make enough money (albeit by working incessantly) that we can pay for it in cash with no loans but she would absolutely earn merit based scholarships if not for this little wrinkle about the FAFSA.

She has straight As and there does not appear to be any straight up ""merit based"" scholarships offered by her school (VCU if anyone's familiar) that don't carry this FAFSA requirement.
When I fill out FAFSA calculators, it shows our expected financial contribution to be between $70-80K.

It would seem to me that it's clearly saying she has no financial need whatsoever. Am I misunderstanding something? If she applies for a scholarship that aims for high achievers with the stipulation that there needs to be a FAFSA-proven financial need, are people going to look at her application and scoff?

As a side note, the FAFSA thing also says she could get somewhere in the order of 12K in Federal Stafford loans, which we don't really *need* per se, but if we took them would that be some kind of ""proof"" that we have financial need?

personalfinance,Want to ask in-laws for a a gift of downpayment. IBigetflamed,"TL;DR - afraid of being priced out of home ownership, want to ask for a gift of downpayment. Not sure what to do. 

My wife and I live in California where housing prices are outrageous. We are making low six-figures, which is barely enough to get by, here. Unfortunately, because we are professionals and are classy enough never to to discuss money with anyone--friends, family, whoever--my wife's parents assume that we are rich. They have even asked, at one point, whether we own the place we are currently renting. 

We would like to buy a condo, but just simply don't have a down payment. Our choices are either 100% financing (4-5% interest, no PMI through a good CU, but with a 3.5% funding) or to ask her parents for a gift of a downpayment (either as an outright gift, or as an advance on her inheritance).

We figured that if we SCRIMP AND SAVE (no vacation, no travel, no restaurants, no nothing, no unexpected expenses) to the point of deprivation, we can probably come up with a 10% down over the next 2-3 years. The problem is that 3 years from now, if the Fed linearly increases rates, interest rates are going to be around 6% for a traditional 20% mortgage and who knows what for less than that. Houses in this area are appreciating 3-5% annually ... basically it's a doomsday scenario. Our salaries are not going to increase in proportion to the increased cost of home ownership. 

We are not sure what to do, but I am increasingly confident that the only responsible path for us towards home ownership is through a gift of downpayment. I also am embarrassed to ask, and don't know how to ask because we don't know what they can afford to give us, we don't know what they're inclined to give us, and obviously they assume we have way more money than we actually do. 

Thoughts?

I have about 14k left on my student loan debt and is the only debt I have that has an interest rate, I also have a car loan but it is at 0%, so plan on just paying that off monthly as I plan on keeping the car much longer than the loan.

My worries is paying taxes when I pull that money out of the IRA. Would it be smarter to just continue to pay as much as I can monthly on the student loans, or just take out the exact amount and pay it off now and pay the taxes?",finance,1472442914

I'm not concerned as the money from the loan was used to pay my parents back anyway but haven't heard of this being a problem before.

personalfinance,"22, 100k saved, 150k salary, no debt, any advice or suggestions?","I'm trying to be financially independent as soon as possible. I make about 100k after taxes (would really appreciate some tax advice such as 401k traditional vs. Roth), but I'm going to try to live on 30k a year. I've been working since I was 15 so I have quite a bit saved by now, most of it is in Vanguard stocks/bonds. I'm interested in starting real estate but there's so much management costs and I definitely don't want to live where I'm current living more than a few years.

I don't really have an emergency fund (just a few thousand) but I have high credit card limits which would give me about 2 months to earn enough salary or liquidate enough stocks or bonds to cover likely emergencies. My skills are in high demand so I'm not particularly worried about being fired. Is that logic sound?

Of the 30k, half goes into rent and mandatory expenses (like utilities) which gives me about 15k to play around with. I like to travel cheaply, nature, buying quality things like linens and nordstrom rack, and going out for food and drinks so it seems reasonable to me. I'll probably also pick up a few hobbies now that I'm working too. But I'm in the NYC area so tell me if it's unrealistic. I don't have a car so public transportation and uber is a much cheaper option. (I can walk to work).

I max out my Roth IRA every year and have 25k so far as well as 65k in taxable account. I plan on contributing to the federal limit (18k) for my 401k. Should I do Roth or traditional? There's been analysis that it's the same effectively, but looking at the numbers it seems like I can effectively contribute more into Roth since its post tax money, which means I'm actually contributing more, plus the gains are tax free. Then again my state has 5-6% state income tax and my income is high enough to start giving me tax headaches (like Roth IRA phase outs) so I'm uncertain. I would really appreciate some insights.

I make 60k/yr as a nurse and my wife is stay at home mom. I have 75k in student loans (yeah... i know). No other debt. 

I have just recently consolidated all my loans to direct federal loans through fedloan in preparation for signing up for income based repayment. My company and field makes me eligible for public service loan forgiveness. I have no idea if i will stay with this company for ten years and i am pessimistic about meeting all the requirments for PSLF for ten years, that's a long freakin time for things to go wrong.

We just sold our condo because the market in our area blew up this summer and we will make 70k off the home (bought condo for 105k five years ago and with sweat equity sold for 185k now). We have savings and without touching our emergency fund, we could erase the entire school loan debt. 

My wife is not psyched about using ALL of the house money, which would be a down payment on a $225,000-$250,000 home for us. We both REALLY want a home and we believe that the area we are choosing will be an equally good investment as this first condo that we chose, plus more sweat equity of course. 

Without this down payment we are looking at many years, 5+, till we have 20% down payment for a home. She thinks we should keep 50k for a down payment and use the other 25k to pay down student loans to 50k then continute ibr payments. I don't like this because there will be no chance of getting any loan forgiveness on the student loan as we would for sure pay it off in ten years time. I'd rather do all or nothing. Pay it all off or pay nothing towards it except the minimum ibr payment and hope to get some loan forgiveness. 

If we pay off the entire student loan like i would like to do, our current compromise is that i would work overtime for the next year to secure a 5% down payment on a home and we will get a home in about 1 year instead of waiting for the entire 20% down payment. I can live with having to pay PMI if we are debt free. Part of the compromise is that i will also ask this sub for advice.

What is the best course of action for us? Thanks so much!",finance,1472462252

Forex,"Lessons of wrong monetary semantics from Jackson Hole Meeting by Emanuele Canegrati, Market Analyst at BlackPearlFX","Financial markets are more and more dependent on the Fed. And this is not a good news for investors, because it means that the decisional monopoly power of the FOMC is getting stronger and stronger. It is interesting to observe how FOMC meetings are now studied well before their dates. You hardly can remember of a Jackson Hole meeting so much awaited as than one of this year. The media coverage of the event was worthy of major world political events; televisions, social networks, newspapers: no one has missed the appointment.
The wait was all for the declaration of Fed's chairwoman Janet Yellen on the much anticipated rise in US interest rates. Will the hike take place during the next FOMC in September? Or do we have to wait until the last FOMC of this year? These were the open questions. At the end, Janet Yellen simply said everything and nothing (""gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over time to achieve and sustain employment and inflation near our statutory objectives.”), in deference to the new Fed communications course, better known as ""forward guidance"". Which is, in Hayek's words, a semantic trap, since the Fed is not guiding financial markets at all, as it is not clear where the central banks aims to arrive, and a dangerous contraddiction in terms, as a guide must have a clear language and not obscure as the Fed has. 
Yellen has hinted that a rate hike will take place almost certainly by the end of the year, but refused to give more precise indications as to which FOMC meeting will take this decision. And so, immediately after the speech, the most varied interpretations have been circulated among experts, economists and scholars of the semantics of the most cryptic central bank in the world. Finanancial investors seem not to have believed the interpretation of an immediate increase in interest rates, so that the stock indices reacted positively and the dollar weakened. Bond traders seem to have believe in the 2016 hike, as benchmark two-year Treasury yields, the coupon maturity traditionally most sensitive to Fed expectations, reached the highest since June and yield curve flattened.

Neither Fed's officials agree as to the timing of the hike. Fed's Fischer said Yellen speech is 'consistent' with rate hike as soon as September while the Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester on CNBC declared that she sees gradual path of rate rises. Fed’s Kaplan says the ancitipated path of interest rate increases going forward ""will be much flatter"".
So what can we take from Jackson Hole meeting? First of all, that monetary policy is gradually becoming a matter of a cryptic semantics. The ""do not say"" but ""let intuit"". Who benefits from this lack of transparency communicational? Because the Fed believes represent the relationship between institutions and the financial markets as a game is good? The answer is in the willingness of the central bank to strengthen its power and the dependence of the market by its decisions. Power, after all, is more in the ""do not tell"" rather than the ""make it clear."" And this is a law that the monetary bureaucrats seem to have learned very well. Secondly, zero interest rate policy is coming to and end, with great relief in the banking and pension sectors, those who have lost more from the zero-rate policy: the first for the collapse in profitability, the second for the value loss of savings accumulated over time. If the hike will hit emerging markets and currencies, make explode the bubble on equity markets and on some commodities (gold and silver are serious candidates for this) only time can tell us.",finance,1472471184

personalfinance,Unmatched retirement plan vs paying off student loans.,"I'm 24 and starting my first post-grad school job today and have to choose whether to waive or buy in to a retirement benefit plan through my employer. Since I'm an adjunct faculty, neither of my options, which are Roth or 403b (don't know what these mean), are matched by my employer. I only expect to have this job for one year. 

Presently I have about $7000 in a retirement account, compliments of my late beloved Grandmother and everyone in my family as well as the account managers told me to not think about it for 20 years and then check in.

Now, my goal is to be debt free as soon as possible, and my plan was to divert all my extra income towards my loans, which total about $30,000 at interest rates ranging from 3-6%. They are all in deferment right now, but they'll start gaining interest in about two months. I recently paid off all my high interest unsubsidized loans and their interest with the rest of what I got from Grandma, and the interest was painful!

Additional information is that I already have a few months rent and expenses in a savings account and am pretty good about lifestyle spending (eg I don't have a car, eat cheap, etc). 

**tl;dr** Given that I already have a small retirement account, only expect to have this job for one year, and the contributions are unmatched, is the best strategy for reducing total amount owed on loans to waive these benefit plans and divert the money they would cost to my loans? Is it worth it to contribute to these retirement plans and potentially take longer to pay off my loans?

We are buying a home in our 20s and are locked in at 3.25 which is way better than what my parents even have (slightly over 5 which was good for when they bought their home in 2001) , they are even thinking of refinancing . We are putting down 7% not anywhere near 20, and yes I know all about pmi, but our pmi is pretty low as in .7 of a percent. This would bring our adjusted rate to still under 4 and we still come ahead as far as the average interest back in just December 2015. The rates could easily fluctuate to this rate in the future. 

Say it would take us another 5 years to save up for a 20% downpayment.. The mortgage rates could easily start to climb again ( I mean they can't and won't continue to fall). We could easily be paying more on interest than we are our pmi payments. 

If rates stay low or rise and decrease again in the future we can always refinance to get pmi off. But at that point we would already be in a home in an area where home values are projected to rise greatly in the next few years and continue to do so for the long term future.

She graduated from school with her Doctorate in Physical Therapy, and took her first job at a non-profit hospital this month making $33/hr. She is non-exempt so there is overtime but we will not figure that in. Aside from this debt, she has no other debts. Car is new and paid off in cash.

Is there any way to determine what way mathematically is the best option for us here? PSLF v. Paying as fast as possible.


Any huge glaring issues with PSLF we should be aware of? She is starting on the program in October. Our main concern is the fact that it is not in fact a gauruntee once payments are made, so making any reduced payments will allow interest to accrue at a scary rate over the ten years. 


Family is pushing for her to join the Air Force as a contracted civilian to get them paid, but this isn't feasible right now. (Moving &amp; my job need  consideration).

I am 27 year old with a decent paying job ($60k), which is low for NYC, but due to spending very little, doing odd jobs during college, no student loans, and living with my parents, I have saved roughly $250,000. 

I have been in a long-term relationship and I wanted to buy a house within the year and move out before my SO and I get hitched next year. This death was very unexpected, so there is no financial safety net for my mother to pay her mortgage. She works for a living, but at the end of each month, she will have very little left over after mortgage payments and personal expenses. Also, she has very little put away in savings. I worry that a missed payment from a tenant could force her to miss a payment and problems with the bank. 

After a few weeks of consideration, I thought that the best option would be to pay off my mother's mortgage, have her transfer the home under my name (avoid NY property sale taxes), and take out a new mortgage for the price of the home ($550k/$412k loan after 25% down) under the much lower interest rate I'd been given (3%-3.5%). Considering my mother's income as well, she would not be able to refinance her rate from ~7% to ~3.5%. Finally, with the money given to my mother for the loan and down payment, I would purchase a home for myself without a mortgage. In this manner, I could make sure my mother won't ever face a burden of foreclosure due to further unforeseen circumstances, while also purchasing a home and starting a family. 

I would appreciate any advice or suggestions on my plan, as I have very little experience in matters of personal finance and housing. 

tl;dr - Dad died suddenly, $180k mortgage left on $550k home, 7% interest, $4k mortgage, mom works but income barely covers mortgage+expenses, also can't refinance, have job ($60k)+savings ($250k), want to move out and buy home before marriage by next year, plan is pay rest of loan, transfer home to my name, take out new mortgage (3-3.5% FIR), use money from loan and DP given to mom to buy house for myself, please advise!",finance,1472482873

My credit card has a $9,000 Balance (15.25% interest rate) and my credit score is falling. My parents are insanely strict about debt/spending etc so I need to take care of this without them finding out. I have a good job and can pay this off - I just need to go about it in the correct manner. I've created a budget, I'm working on finding other sources of Income (all of which goes directly to paying off the card) and I want to get this paid of as soon as possible - it's hanging over my head and causing me an insane amount of anxiety. 

**Here are my needs:**

* #1 priority - stop my credit score from falling 
* pay off 9k credit card

**Here are my questions:**

* Is a balance transfer a good idea? Would my parents have any way of finding out I did this? Is it even worth it at the $9k amount? Would it help my credit score if I transferred over a portion of it to keep my credit utilization % down?
* I know there's a ton of advice on this subreddit but for this level of debt (not *too* much) does anyone have specific advice on how I can get rid of this asap?

I'm sorry for the chaotic text, but I have so much anxiety about this, I can hardly live my day-to-day life. My biggest priority is stop my credit score from falling, I have a strong score (745) and need to keep it strong.",finance,1472487175

personalfinance,Federal Student Loan Consolidation (11 loans),"So my wife recently graduated with her degree.  She's already secured a higher paying job with better benefits and all that.  We're working on repaying a combined debt of about $38,000 which does not include any student loans (mine have been paid off).  Her student loans will be going into repayment soon, so we're starting to look at consolidation.  Below is a chart of her student loans sorted by interest rate, I believe they're all fixed rates.  

Two of the loans are starting repayment this month, but it's one payment.  I believe these are loans from when she first went to school before we had our daughter.  She took a couple years off and went back to school online while we both worked full time and raised our daughter.  I'm really happy the school part is over now.  We actually have family time!

Anyway, if the payments of the loans which aren't in repayment yet are anywhere near the ones going into repayment this month, we won't be able to afford them all.  I'm guessing that would be somewhere around $400/mo.  What are the downfalls of consolidating?  From what I've read so far, the APR will be a weighted average.  So, would it be better to consolidate the 4 loans above 5% and the 7 loans below 5% or since it's weighted is it not worth doing two separate consolidations?  I feel like if they're split then we can focus on the higher % loans first once we're able to make higher than minimum payments.

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.  I don't have access to all of the loan data currently but could log in later if more info is needed.  Apparently the amount due on loan A1 and A2 are wrong, they're combined and the combined amount due is ~$68, not $88 as shown.

I'm a gov't employee $87K a year, she's enlisted military $46K a year.  $133,500 gross.  104K net (includes 9k for the next year for GI Bill to finish my Master's).  Wife has 5 year orders to new station and I suppose ideally we'd like to keep our current place, buy a new place, live out the 5 years there and determine if it's better to stay in or get out.  We're not really set in stone at this point, since it's all contingent on me finding a similar/higher position in the new city, until then she'll be living in the barracks on base.  

$10,445 a month net pay, $1600 into savings/401k, 1750 house, 655 utilities (inc. ph/internet), 508 cars (7k owed on two vehicles) 1312 credit card payments (trying to pay these off, $19K left, all are below 6%, most 0-4%).  $490 student loans a month (paying through deferment for the fed gov't forgiveness ($50k between the two of us).  $1200 in food usually.  Leaves $2700 a month for flex spending, gas/school stuff/swimming for kids/paying down cards, we don't always spend that, but it's there and I'm sure we can better allocate it, but for now it is what it is.  


Own one home, 1750 mortgage, $310K owed, could sell for $345K.  Could rent because of high volume military area, very similar homes are renting for $2200 and full nearly all year. However, I'm wary if something should go wrong, no renters, two mortgages, something happens with either of our jobs, etc.   


We have $3k in savings, every time it gets too high I throw it at the credit cards because I hate them.  

We have our VA loan to use for this new house, the area we'd like ranges from $320K to $450K.  Everything I'm seeing shows $380K at around $2300 a month with insurance/tax/HOA and those are the houses we're mostly drawn to. 

Questions:
Sell or rent the 1st home?  

Buying range ok for 2nd home? I know $450k (2600 a mo) is too high, but is $380k ok if we want (2300?) or $350K (2126?)  

I'm leaning towards selling the first place as much as it'd be nice to have the rent/equity. And, I lean towards the bottom part of the spectrum because I can see all the problems that might happen even though both our jobs are pretty stable at the moment.  Wife is determined to do it all.

personalfinance,August was my best money month ever!,"***This could be very useful for people who own a home.***

I'm new here and I'd like to share all my success this month. Some of this might sound far-fetched but the fact is that I've let all of this stuff slide for years so now that I'm catching up the savings are huge.

1 - I went to my informal property tax protest hearing on August 9th. I was ultra prepared with photos and documentation. I got them to reduce their assessed value of my home by $35K. This will save me something like $400-$600 this year.

2 - I got the brilliant idea of getting a term life insurance policy. Turns out my insurance company had the lowest rate. I already had three policies with them and when I added the fourth one my insurance guy cut my home insurance in half - $535/year! So this life insurance policy is actually saving me about $340/year. Honestly, it's really saving me money by having more insurance.

3 - I got curious about what my flood insurance premium would be for the coming year. I have a creek in my backyard and I'm in a flood zone so FEMA forces flood insurance on me. My insurance company (Liberty Mutual) has screwed up my flood insurance many times and sure enough, they couldn't tell me anything about what the premium will be. So I contacted the National Flood Insurance Program myself. They called me and immediately discovered that I need to do a couple of things which would result in a refund. Turns out I uncovered another screw up on the part of my insurance company and now a refund check of $869 is on its way to me.

If you'd like me to provide more details on how I accomplished any of these things go ahead and ask.

If you want to criticize any of my money decisions please don't be rude!

PS - I'm not moving out of the flood zone because I owe $68,895 with an interest rate at 3.5% and I live in Austin where I will absolutely not be able to get a deal like that anywhere within city limits. My house is a fixer but it's MY fixer.",finance,1472491632

Been a lurker on PF for a while and decided to ask for some advice on my situation. I'm in my early twenties and am really new to taking my personal finance more seriously.

I'm already on an installment plan to pay off my state tax in about 5 months but the fed tax interest rate really concerns me since its compounded daily and a back of the envelop calculation puts me at close to an additional $1000 in penalties if I were to aggresively pay it off in 10 months.

My question is, would it be better to take out a loan of sorts with a more favorable interest rate to pay off the debt? I think getting a credit card to do a balance transfer would be another alternative. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Let me know if i'm missing something.

I know nothing about paying back interest or what it's like to have loans, and neither does my boyfriend, who also has no debt from undergrad.

This first semester is going to cost me around $12,600 and the three final semesters will hopefully cost $6k each if I can get in-state tuition.

I have about $17k in liquid funds at my disposal right now. I'm thinking of chucking $6k of that into a 529 which will pay for my final semester.

With the remaining funds, would it be better to pay off more of my costs right now or take out more in loans?

Does anyone have experience with this kind of situation and if so what would you advise me to do?

btc,EMU and bitcoin,"Today, I'm thinking about how to explain to people about a post-hard-fork bitcoin world where two bitcoin blockchain co-exists in parallel. I naturally thought about the example of Greece exiting EMU: The combined total economy output of the EU will not change, but the currency split into two, each have its own corresponding economy (Of course that's still not quite like, since bitcoin holders are not affected by the split but euro holders are, but leave that for now)

First, the problem in EMU: There are so many different countries with different cultures and weather, location, etc, it is very difficult to let them all share the same monetary policy. It is usually nice holiday weather in Greece but cold and dark in Germany, so they tends to do different things over the year. As a result, their economy output and the spending habit will never be the same, using the same monetary policy will result in over-spending for Greek people and huge surplus for Germans

Euro has been adopted for more than 20 years but it still have huge imbalance problem and maybe one day it would still collapse, just because you can't have the same monetary policy for these countries with different culture and weather etc... 

It is not difficult to see, bitcoin also have the same problem: Although bitcoin is spread widely across the internet like euro's European usage, it's usage is still very different from country to country: Chinese are only allowed to treat it as a speculative commodity, while western people are actively using it as a payment medium

Different usage leads to different user requirement, thus for Chinese it is not a big concern that block space are limited, they are doing most of the speculative trades in exchange anyway, the centralized solution suits their needs. They don't really understand why should people use on-chain transactions, they should all use centralized exchanges like OKCOIN and BTCC, and let those exchanges handle the on-chain transactions, that's exactly the mindset of lightning network 

But for those who really understand bitcoin's true potential, mostly in western, they will avoid centralized exchanges and use p2p exchange and direct on chain payment. So their requirement is strong on-chain transaction capability

Luckily, these two requirements are not exclusive, having strong on-chain transaction capability does not prevent the growth of centralized hubs. So the situation is still better than EMU. In principle, a split could be avoided if the on-chain transaction can get enough performance guarantee, that can be called functional compatibility",cryptocurrency,1472510554

Seeking a bit of advice on my current financial situation given I don't have a sound person to speak to so why not ask reddit.  I am looking to move out of my house to a nearby city for potential higher income earnings as well as living the city life.  The area I have been looking into has condo/home prices rising at a quick rate due to it's convenience. (City outside of an even larger one)

-I am 23 and work in the STEM field
-My current annual salary will be around 74-76k pending my year end bonus pre tax
-I have a part time job paid in cash that I do for an extra 10-20hrs a week at 12-15$hr.  At an extra 200 a week or so I would say a safe estimate would be around 8k cash yearly.  I am also figuring out an opportunity with the same hourly load but at 18-20$hr at a call center.  A reasonable estimate is around 60k post tax yearly.

-I have 26k or 28k in savings and exactly 28k in student loans as well I believe at 3-4% interest rate. 

-I am looking at 2 br condo's in the high 300's up to the mid 400's.

-My down payment would not be very high but I could get a room mate(very quickly) and as my income will jump I will pay it off faster.

-Over the past 3 years condo's in this area have gone up around 100k in value. I plan on staying until my late 20's-early 30's then going back to the suburbs (as of right now).  If the condo went up only another 50k in value over the next 10 I would still be happy. 

-I live a frugal lifestyle and don't really care to purchase anything expensive I don't need.  My idea of fun is working out or a nice dinner every once in a while. 

Reasons for a 2br over a 1br:  I strongly believe I can get a good friend or family member to eventually move in with me over time.  Either way I am happy with any random room mate.  Also, if my income jumps to where this apartment isn't in a tight financial situation and I have an open room I will convert it to a work from home office. Ideally if that situation comes I would also likely do renovations as an apartment in the high 3-400k range is kinda ghetto ish",finance,1472511416

By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: August 29, 2016
http://wallstreetonparade.com/2016/08/department-of-homeland-security-has-surprise-for-bernie-supporters-at-dnc-lawsuit-hearing/

Mavi Ramierez is a Mom, a social media entrepreneur and a dedicated citizen journalist who took a day off from work to cover the first hearing on August 23 in the Federal lawsuit that has been filed by Senator Bernie Sanders’ supporters against the Democratic National Committee and its former Chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The lawsuit, which currently has more than 100 plaintiffs and more than a thousand in the wings with retainer agreements, is charging the DNC with fraud, negligent misrepresentation, deceptive conduct, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligence.

Leaked DNC documents and emails by Guccifer 2.0 and Wikileaks show Wasserman Schultz disparaging the Sanders’ campaign while key DNC officials actually plotted to sabotage the Sanders’ campaign by putting the word out that he is an atheist (which Sanders says he is not) and characterizing his campaign as “a mess.” From a virtual unknown on the national stage, Sanders’ campaign won 23 states in the primaries, raised over $228 million, predominantly from average Americans, and held rallies that ranged from 5,000 to more than 20,000 supporters while Clinton attracted hundreds. Sanders’ supporters are demanding this court case to determine if the intentional sabotage by the DNC cost Sanders’ his primary battle.

Since mainstream media has failed to report on this first court hearing, the interviews conducted by Mavi Ramierez outside the Federal courthouse last Tuesday take on added significance. Ramierez interviewed the Sanders’ supporters and attorney for plaintiffs as they emerged from the hearing. But throughout these interviews, there was a constant, annoying, and distracting honking coming from an SUV parked on the sidewalk. One gutsy interviewee, who goes by the Facebook name of Jessica Rose Grfl, strolled down to the SUV, peered inside, and tells the videographer that this is an unmanned vehicle. The honking appears to be by remote control. Ramierez and her videographer move closer to the SUV and show viewers that it is from the Federal Protective Service of the Department of Homeland Security. ( Go to -31:00 on the video.)

The head of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, is an Obama nominee. Johnson has spun four times through the revolving doors of the corporate/Wall Street law firm, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison to work in either the Bill Clinton or Obama administration. Johnson was a bundler for Obama in his 2008 campaign and personally donated $28,460 to the Obama Victory Fund and another $28,460 to the DNC in 2008, according to Federal Election Commission data.

Clearly, Johnson is a big Obama fan and Obama is a big Debbie Wasserman Schultz fan. In June, Politico’s Hanna Trudo reported that Obama appeared at a DNC fundraiser in Miami and told the crowd the following about Wasserman Schultz: “She’s had my back, I want to make sure we have her back.”

Just two days after Wikileaks released the devastating emails in July, showing that key DNC officials had violated their own bylaws in overtly attempting to sabotage the Sanders’ campaign, creating an instant scandal in the media and forcing Wasserman Schultz to resign from the DNC, President Obama remained unconscionably effusive in his praise for Wasserman Schultz. The White House released this official statement from the President on July 24, which stated in part:

“For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful. Her leadership of the DNC has meant that we had someone who brought Democrats together not just for my re-election campaign, but for accomplishing the shared goals we have had for our country…Michelle and I are grateful for her efforts, we know she will continue to serve our country as a member of Congress from Florida and she will always be our dear friend.”

On the sidewalk with Mavi Ramierez last Tuesday were three Sanders’ supporters who were holding a large banner noting that Wasserman Schultz had “resigned in disgrace” from the DNC. Wasserman Schultz is battling for her political career in Congress in a Democratic primary next Tuesday, August 30, in Florida, where she will face off against progressive Tim Canova, who has the support of Bernie Sanders and his supporters.

The words “Homeland Security” on the SUV struck an immediate, familiar chord here at Wall Street On Parade over its dubious past escapades attempting to marginalize the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has maintained a large presence in the Bernie Sanders’ camp. We have previously reported on the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund (PCJF) releasing a trove of documents obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request, showing that the Department of Homeland Security routinely spies on peaceful protesters and was obsessed with the amount of media attention being given to the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) activities. Homeland Security was fixated on both mainstream media coverage as well as concerned that Occupy would gain momentum through social media – the very medium in which Mavi Ramierez specializes.

One of the documents released by PCJF shows a Homeland Security agent writing the following in an October 2011 memo:

“A distinct feature of OWS is how it was born from online organization and continues to use social media to spread its message, organize further protests, and keep protesters connected. OWS and the broader Occupy Together movement that organizes protests in other cities use services such as Twitter, Tumblr, Meetup, and Facebook to this end, as well as having set up a live video feed of the OWS encampment in New York. Announcements, videos, and images are all collected and disseminated via these social networks as well as on the OWS Web site.”

Ramierez comments on the video outside the Federal Courthouse on August 23 that the honking only started when she began to livestream her video.

Another memo released by PCJF reads:

“Social media and the organic emergence of online communities have driven the rapid expansion of the OWS movement. In New York, OWS leaders have also formed ad hoc committees to organize protesters and manage communications, logistics, and security. The OWS encampment in Zucotti Park features a medical station, distribution point for food and water, and a media center complete with generators and wireless Internet. Organizers hold general assembly meetings twice a day and a have established committees and working groups including an Internet Working Group and a Direct Action Committee, which plans protest activities and works to maintain peaceful and controlled demonstrations. This high level of organization has allowed OWS to sustain its operations, disseminate its message, and garner increasing levels of support.”

Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, Executive Director of PCJF, commented at the time of the release of the documents: “The federal agencies’ actions were not because Occupy represented a ‘terrorist threat’ or a ‘criminal threat’ but rather because it posed a significant grassroots political challenge to the status quo.”

In 2011 we broke the story that the Department of Homeland Security was using taxpayers’ dollars to fund a high tech, artificial intelligence surveillance center in lower Manhattan where employees of the serially corrupt Wall Street firms sit alongside officers from the New York City Police Department to spy on pedestrians (and any would-be protesters) on the sidewalks of Manhattan. In 2012, we wrote again to document how the CBS News Program, 60 Minutes, was aware of this joint staffing operation between the NYPD and the serially-charged Wall Street firms but failed to report on it in a fawning program on the surveillance center.

A report from DBA Press and the Center for Media and Democracy in 2013 showed how the Department of Homeland Security was funding “fusion centers” to gather intelligence on peaceful activists and then sharing it with the very corporations that were the targets of the activist protests.

The lawsuit against the DNC is Wilding et al v DNC Services Corporation and Deborah ‘Debbie’ Wasserman Schultz. The case is being heard in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida. (Case Number 16-cv-61511-WJZ.) The Sanders supporters are being represented in the lawsuit by the following law firms: Beck &amp; Lee Trial Lawyers of Miami; Cullin O’Brien Law, P.A. of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; and Antonino G. Hernandez P.A. of Miami.

Both the DNC and Wasserman Schultz are represented by a corporate law firm, Perkins Coie. The Chair of the Political Law practice at Perkins Coie, Marc Elias, is an attorney of record in the matter. He is also counsel to the Hillary Clinton campaign and one of a team of Perkins Coie lawyers that are legal counsel to the DNC. Elias turned up in the Wikileaks emails giving advice to the DNC on how to respond to charges from the Sanders’ campaign that the joint fundraising committee between the DNC and Hillary Clinton was, in effect, a money laundering scheme to evade fundraising caps.

The August 23 hearing was itself a continuing effort by the DNC to evade accountability for its conduct while stalling meaningful court action by challenging the manner in which the lawsuit was served on the DNC. See our in-depth report here.",technology,1472511672
personalfinance,Should I just pay off my car loan in 1 single payment?,"So basically i purchased a vehicle and financed $11,800 at 3.44% APR. The reason i financed was because:

-I assumed I would have gotten a better interest rate around 0%(high credit score) but it turns out that 0% is for only select car models

-$500 rebate to car if I were to finance through Honda

So i will be paying about $1,000 in interest over 5 years if I do regular payments of $214 monthly. Since I am also saving for a home purchase in a few years (savings in a 1% savings account), should I just pay it off immediately and avoid paying the interest assuming I wouldn't invest the $11,800 anywhere other than my savings account?

investing,Anyone familiar with investing in individual bonds on Interactive Brokers? I am quite confused.,"I've been looking to invest in individual bonds through IB (which I use for all my investments) but I am quite confused by the appellations. I called their customer service and their reply was - I am not kidding - ""not many people use us to buy bonds so we don't know how it all works"". Thanks guys!

So if one of you kind souls is familiar with all this, it'd be great if you could enlighten me. More specifically, if you look at [this screenshot of the details of a $GSK bond](http://i.imgur.com/6dhof21.png):

- It says that the face value is $1000 and the coupon $2.85 paid semi-annually. Am I to believe that the principal of the bond is therefore $1000 and that this will be reimbursed to the bond holder on the bond termination date, in that case 8th of May 2022? 
- Also does it mean that until the 8th of May 2022 the bond holder is paid $2.85 every 6 months? That would mean that the interest rate is a ridiculously low 0.57% which I'd imagine is not quite possible hence my confusion...

And if you look at [this other screenshot for the same bond](http://i.imgur.com/HJJSHtd.png):

- It says that the current ask price is $105.28 and that this means a yield of 1.865%. How is that yield calculated? Because if one divides the annual coupon (2 * $2.85 = $5.7) by the ask price ($105.28), one gets 5.41%...
- Also if the current ask price is $105.28 and the face value if $1000 as assessed above, am I to believe that I buy something for $105.28 today that will get me $2.85 every 6 months until the 8th of May 2022, date I which I'll receive the $1000 principal back?

I have the opportunity of a lifetime; I just got a call from one of the biggest companies in the country offering me a job in San Francisco. I don't want to have to turn this down.

Trying to figure for the higher cost of living, I have a budget to include my credit card minimums, food, fuel, my phone bill, and small utility costs like laundry, toiletries, etc. I am going to defer some student loan payments in order to make this work, and I plan on living in my Nissan Xterra in the company parking lot (which they allow).

So **my fixed expenses are $1,200/mo** without an apartment, without utilities. That's just food, fuel, and my bills. My **net income will be ~$2,400/mo** (figured from an hourly wage, after Union dues &amp; against CA state + federal taxes) and there will be no overtime for the first 6 months.

EDIT: Budget stuff.
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my current budget situation:
&gt;
&gt; * $250 - Food
&gt; * $150 - Transportation
&gt; * $80 - Phone bill
&gt; * $20 - Toiletries
&gt; * $20 - Misc (Netflix, Dollar Shave Club)
&gt; * $1,200 - Debts
&gt; * $450 - Rent (flat rate room)
&gt; * **TOTAL: $2,170/mo**
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my plan for living without an apartment, with prices deliberately inflated because I don't know how expensive SFO can be, and with $600/mo in student loan repayents deferred to help out:
&gt;
&gt; * $350 - Food
&gt; * $150 - Transportation
&gt; * $80 - Phone bill
&gt; * $20 - Toiletries
&gt; * $20 - Misc (Netflix, Dollar Shave Club)
&gt; * $600 - Debts
&gt; * $50 - Gym (to shower/shave)
&gt; * **TOTAL: $1,270/mo**
&gt; 
&gt; Here's my needs WITH an apartment, WITH all debts at minimum repayment. I would kinda like a place to shower, and an actual building to sleep in:

&gt; * $1,200 - Debts

How else can I help myself? I was considering going to my bank with the offer letter, and asking for a personal loan for relocation.

personalfinance,"25, looking for career/education advice","Hi PF,

Long time lurker and I have received an incredible amount of information from reading others' posts. Thanks in advance for reading.

My story:

I'm 25, not married/no kids, was previously in college when a familial issue took me away from my studies(issue has since been resolved). I left college with only about two full-time semesters to go until graduating. I could finish this degree with 2 years of night/online classes. After spending some time working full-time in different jobs, I no longer wish to work in the same field as the degree I was working on. 

I'm currently working in finance/banking and it's something I could see myself doing in the long term. However, other than the experience that I am gaining, I have no other qualifications for possible opportunities in this field. Unfortunately, my current work schedule is not flexible enough to allow me to attend school full-time while working so it makes things a bit more complicated. 

At the moment, I'm about 16.5k in student loan debt with higher interest rates (6.5-9.5%) and actively paying this down. I'm making about $30k/year without advancement opportunities in my current company. This year alone, I have done well with my budget, paying down 5k in debt already this year, as well as saving up 3 months of living expenses for my emergency fund. 

My questions are..

Should I go back to school or is experience enough for a career in finance/banking? Also, does my degree need to be in finance/banking or could I make it work with an unrelated degree?

Should I go back to school part time or should I save up, work elsewhere part-time and go to school full-time?",finance,1472529816
personalfinance,"Is it ill-advised to sell a car that's worth less than I owe, in order to go car-free?","Hey all, 

**If you want the TL;DR upfront, here it is**: I owe slightly less than $10k on a car (financed via car loan with USAA) worth about $7k at best. 2009 Honda Fit, good condition, manual. Car payments are $240/mo, insurance is $70, and gas is $80-100. Recent repair costs ($2500 with potential for more) have made me reconsider car ownership. Is selling right now and going car-free a stupid idea? 

So, here's a quick look at my auto situation:

* 2009 Honda Fit Sport manual transmission, Kelley Blue Book ""very good"" value of about $7k for a private party sale
* I owe just under $10k on the car through an auto loan via USAA
* Monthly car payment: $240, monthly insurance: $70

Last summer (right after I bought the car, no warranty) I had to pay $700 for some repairs. Over the winter, my battery died and that was another $100+. This summer, I had to shovel out $2500 for yet another, bigger necessary mechanical repair - one of the cylinder head gaskets was toast and the mechanic I went through had it rebuilt. I would not have been able to drive the car with the issue, nor could I have sold it as it was. This was fixed at the beginning of July and (I *believe*) it's still under warranty. 

Just in the last couple of days, I've heard a crappy, metallic rattling sound coming from the engine, from around the same area that just got repaired. It doesn't appear to be anything to do with the undercarriage or body, but I don't know for sure. I'm dropping the car off in the morning at the same shop where the $2500 work was done to have them look. A it stands, I've put an enormous amount of money into this car already, and it's not even that old - I've paid out an additional $3k in repairs alone, on top of gas, insurance, registrations and other routine things like oil changes. 

These stupid repair problems have got me thinking about taking the dive into a car-free life. I'm 27 now and have never not owned a car for the past 10 years, so it would be a big adjustment for me. The problem is that, even if I got this new rattling issue all fixed and sold it for the best possible price, I'd still be underwater on my loan by at least $3k. That said, I'd quickly save about $100 in gas and $70 in insurance monthly, which I would apply to paying the loan down more quickly - obviously. 

My question(s) about all this:

* Is it financially ill-advised to sell a car with that much of a discrepancy in how much it's worth/how much is owed?
* Would I have a difficult time trying to sell, considering the title technically has a lien on it because of the loan through USAA?
* Is it really that much more financially advantageous to go car-free? I live about 8 miles outside of a major city, and I work downtown. I imagine I'd be using a combination of Uber, car share programs, transit and my bike to get around. The monthly cost for a transit pass would be about $120. And I'd be doing all of this while working full-time and going to school full-time. 

Just wanna make sure I wouldn't be making a huge mistake because I'm fed up with this stupid car right now.

personalfinance,Growing up poor and reflecting back on it,"After going on a major shopping spree today I felt really guilty for splurging on myself. 

I grew up the oldest of 6 kids. Mom and dad were refugees who never made more than $14/hr. We were never hungry but we went without and I didn't realize how poor we were until later on in life. To me, that's just the way it was. I never wanted things, asked for gifts or even dreamt about designer clothing or extravagant stuff bc it just wasn't part of our life. I had never eaten at an Applebee's until senior year in high school.

I remember one year in fourth grade my elementary school had a program called ""Food for Thought"". You would attend an hour of after school session where you'd do extra readings and assignments. For each hour you attended, you'd get a credit that would go towards a large paper bag of food. After a week or two (I can't remember), I went home with a large paper bag of food (right around the holidays) filled with cereals, dry snacks and oatmeal. I was so proud of myself for being able to contribute to my household. I still remember the look on my mom's face as she opened the bag. I could tell she was so happy and it was in that moment that I realized I could provide for my family using my brains. I could come home with a bag of food every week just for an extra hour after school? Sign me up! I went back to school the next day and told all my friends. And you know how that went - they made fun of me and called me a beggar for accepting free food. Mind you, most of them were just as poor as my family. I was made to feel so ashamed I never went back to this after school program. It was also then that I made the decision to never accept handouts no matter how poor or needing I was. 

Flash forward to my high school years. I was so happy when I turned 15 bc it meant I could start working. I would walk to numerous job interviews in my cheap blazer and dress in the summer time for a chance to earn my own money. I never asked my parents to take me because they were always working or too tired from working. At one point in high school I managed to juggle a full load with AP classes and two part time jobs. Luckily it was a small town and both of my bosses knew each other and were very accommodating about my work schedule and did all they could to make it work. My junior year in high school, my mom put up a Christmas tree (we only did it every so years) but we didn't have any presents to put underneath. Us kids were just so excited to have a tree up we didn't even care that there weren't presents. One day, our better off cousins came over and asked where the presents were. My mom must have felt embarrassed so that night she suggested that we wrap up empty boxes to put under the tree. I was even more embarrassed to do this but it made my mom feel better so I went along with it. Come Christmas morning, it was just another day and we woke up and went about our way. Christmas was never a special day- my mom had long stopped accepting gifts from charities once my brothers and I grew up. So as we got older, Christmas slowly faded and that's just the way it was. 

Right after high school, I got married and started working full time. It was the first time in my life that I ever had that much money to myself. It wasn't much, but it was mine. The first thing I did that year was spoil my brothers. Come Christmas time I bought them each a shirt and wrapped them as nicely as I could. I would bring the presents over two weeks before Christmas and my gifts would be the only ones under the tree. They were so excited about having gifts and couldn't wait to open them. Christmas mornings during those years was one of the happiest moments in my life. The joy of watching my kid brothers open their present  (usually a $20 t shirt) made me beam with pride and almost want to cry. We never had a proper Christmas growing up so I made sure that going forward we would. They were younger than me and didn't start working until later so I never got gifts in those years. I never really did get gifts as a child and even to this day it makes me uncomfortable when people spend money on me, even my better off friends. This is something I am still trying to work on and be more comfortable with. 

Anyway...today my 3 out of 5 brothers are doing well financially and I have a good paying job that I got right out of college. We don't worry about not having presents or going without. In fact, sometimes I feel like we all don't respect our money and as soon as it comes in, we splurge and the money is gone. It is something I am conscious of and working to fix. I recently heard the phrase ""poor person mentality"" and that fits me to a tee. I never knew I behaved in that way and I understand that if I ever want to get out of this poor cycle I need to change my mentality on money. I'm not poor anymore but I still feel like I am bc I'm not making good money decisions. 

Reading this subreddit has helped me enormously and I am just passing by to share my story.



UPDATE: (In response to your questions)

My parents are doing better today. They still don't make more than $14/hr each but they also don't have to support 6 young children. They own their own home, cars are paid off and they take the occasional vacations to go visit family. They live within their means and are generous. My mom helped found a community service group and is very active and involved with it. She's a great role model for my siblings and I. She's never had much, but she was willing to give you everything. My dad is retiring in five years and he's found his own hobbies to keep him occupied now that the kids are grown. He's a quiet man and never says much except for the occasional motivational talk with us. My parents did their best with us. 

Like I said above, we were never hungry growing up. They fed us first above all else and we cut back in other areas. I never knew how poor we were until later in life. It was just the way we grew up- that's how life had always been and it was all we ever knew. We each got one pair of shoes every year for back to school and it had to last the ENTIRE year. As a kid, I never knew that other kids got more than one pair of shoes and I never noticed what other kids had. I had a happy childhood. My family was very loving and we had a large extended family. When everyone else around you is in your boat, you don't know any different. How could I, as a child, dream of owning a Chanel purse if I had never seen one? 

The dream wasn't to own fancy cars or expensive purses or go on exotic vacations. The dream was to grow up and get a good job so mom and dad wouldn’t have to worry so much about us.

So, we didn't have as much as other kids but we did have a lot of love, encouragement and hope.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation Loan,"Hello all,

I'm a 26 year old male in the US military. I currently have just under 10k in debit, spread between my car note and two credit cards (I recently got reassigned to California and racked up the cc debt in order to buy furnishings and the like for my new house). I live on base, so my rent is taken directly out of my check.

My debt isn't nearly as bad as some, I know, and I'm easily making payments to these accounts to pay off all of the debt. My question to the finance experts of Reddit:

If I were to secure a 10k debt consolidation/personal loan at a reasonable APR (I'm seeing offers at 5.5%), would this be a wise decision? How would it affect my credit score, if at all? The APR is higher than my car interest rate but lower than both of the credit cards. 

Honestly it just comes down to making a single, large payment to the debt rather than several payments to different institutions is just more convienent. Would this have negative repercussions?

Thanks guys!",finance,1472533197
personalfinance,Trying to turn my life around. Please help?,"Okay, this is going to be a long post, so I'll try to stay on topic. I've a 20 year old male who is currently living with my parents and working a part time job as a store clerk (10$/HR and averaging 22 hours a week). My parents, as of the last few months, are allowing me to live rent free, so long as I have a job or am pursuing an education. I own a car, though it is old and I do worry about it breaking down. I pay 200$ per month between personal and federal loans that I took out for college the first time around (I still owe around 3900$), plus expenses for my own food and gas. I've got a small amount saved up (a little over 2100$) in case of emergency. I'm currently seeking a full time job, so I would be able to save up more.

&amp;nbsp;

My problem is that after taking out all of my loans and paying for the first semester of college, I got clinically depressed (was medicated, but not very successfully), got into a huge fight with my parents, racked up a lot of credit card debt (this has been paid completely, as of July), and had to either get a job to pay for a place to live or live on the street. I didn't successfully withdraw from my classes, nor did I get any credits. I've been working hard to try getting everything from that expensive mistake paid off, have since made up with my parents and moved back in with them to reduce costs, and am taking steps to meet with the administration of that college to see if I can get my records amended, but I don't know where to go from here. I would like to pursue an associate's degree, and then possibly a bachelor's in economics. My goal is to become a financial analyst. 

&amp;nbsp;

My parents are not willing to pay for any of my education, but I'm fine with taking out loans if I need to. They make too much for me to get much financial aid, but I'm okay with taking courses slowly while I work a full time. I'm not even sure if this is the right subreddit to post this to, I was just hoping to get some good advice. I know I fucked up pretty badly two years ago, but I'm trying to fix it.

stocks,Fed Funds Futures &amp; Implied Probability of Feds Fund Rate and how you'll profit or get screwed,"I just learned (more like extrapolated) this one due to being extremely curious and frustrated with what happened on Friday (8/26).  All the news was talking about how the implied probability of a feds fund rate going from XX% to a **higher** XX%, watching the market **drop** due to it, and I'm like ""how the hell did they come up with that"".  Well this is how:

You take any futures contract from ""30-Day Fed Funds Futures Prices"" which can be tracked by looking up the futures contracts that begin with ZQ, in this case we'll use September's:

ZQU16 99.5825 (as of 2/30 pre market)

You minus 100 then times 100 and get a % (or do it in your head).  So this implies that a September rate hike is 41.75% probable, down from 42.5% where ZQU16 was 99.575 on 8/26 [(100 - 99.575)*100=42.5].

Before Fed's speech on 8/26, ZQU16 jumped to 99.59 implying 41% probability of a hike, and we saw the market (s&amp;p) go up, but at the end of the speech, shit hit the fan and it fell down to  99.575 &amp; 42.5%.

Some news sites will use a different month of ZQ like Oct or Dec or even calculate the probability in a different way.  **Watching Oct's futures on 8/26 we saw it move from 43.5% to 48.5%.**

Since this rate matters so much to the market's overall price movement, I'm now watching these tickers for sep, oct, nov, &amp; dec in order:

ZQU16

ZQV16

ZQX16

ZQZ16


Currently and based on Nov's futures, about 0.01% (0.01 points) move in ZQ translates to 0.25% move in S&amp;P.  I don't think that'll always hold true, but it's been true for 8/26 and 8/29.",finance,1472544012

I've worked at large tech companies since graduating college in 2008. About 6 months ago I finally quit and joined a local startup. Wanted to learn more about starting my own company, but don't have a solid idea yet. Would love to FIRE, but don't have enough saved up for it.

I just paid off my house last week, and both of my cars are paid off as well. Paying off the house may not be wise given a very low interest rate on a 15yr conventional loan, but it makes me feel good to not owe anything to anyone.

My current startup doesn't have a 401k, and my pace of learning has greatly diminished. Sometimes I think about just quitting and taking some times off to ponder on what to do next, but the fear of the unknown stops me in my path. I may do that after one year at my current place, since I have a good chunk of equity I can vest and I believe in the company's vision and leadership.

Current asset breakdown:
- 700k house value
- 40k liquid
- 250k in 401k and IRAs
- 300k in stock
- 280k in index funds

Our expenses are quite low, especially after the house is paid off. We can live our lifestyle happily with 50k a year.

I broke my neck BASE jumping in the Grand Canyon during Spring Break my freshman year of college. OK, really it was playing flag football, but I’m working on a much sexier legend.
 
I’ve been active in promoting inclusion of underrepresented groups, especially persons with disabilities in STEM for the past 15 years. I’ve chaired the ACS Committee on Chemists with Disabilities and am current chair of the ACS Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Board.

People with disabilities (PWD) continue to be a greatly underrepresented group in Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  PWD comprise 7% of the population between 16 and 21 (US Census) and 8.6% of the total school population participates in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Students with disabilities express interest in STEM at the same rate as students without disabilities. Approximately 20% of graduating high school seniors and ~20% of graduating college seniors wish to continue towards a higher degree in STEM. However, less than 2% of STEM doctoral degrees earned by US citizens or permanent residents are awarded to students who identify as having a disability! Remove soft sciences from the equation and the rate drops to 1%.
 
Amazingly there has been no improvement in PWD doctoral students since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1991: there is no statistical increase in the percentage of earned STEM doctoral degrees by PWD among US citizens or permanent residents at US institutions (see this figure http://i.imgur.com/3LPJMjN.png). Factor in foreign national students to get the statistics on all STEM doctoral degrees awarded by US institutions and the trend becomes negative improvement.
 
Across the same time frame, the percentage of STEM doctoral degrees earned by African American and Hispanic students each increased by 0.16 or 0.17 percentage points per year on average. Federal support and interest in the outcome may well be a factor. The 2010 Federal STEM Education Inventory Data Set on broadening participation (data.gov) shows $397.8M dedicated to ‘Institutional Capacity’ or ‘Postsecondary STEM’ with $378.3M earmarked for underrepresented minorities and only $19.6M dedicated to students with disabilities.

personalfinance,Verizon Wireless Debt Collections,"Hello Reddit -

This is my first post ever so please go easy on me if I break any posting conventions.

Brief background:

Around 2007-2008, some authorized cellphone dealers (all Indian guys) in NJ had shady business practices. 

For example, you walk into the store because you need a family plan for yourself and 3 family members. They would say ""ok why don't you do this - we'll set you up with a 10 person family plan and you don't have to use the other 6 lines. Your bill will obviously be higher than it would have been with only 4 people but every month we'll send you a check making up the difference. And for your trouble we'll give you that shiny new iPhone you wanted for free."" 

The store I had gone to was located in Passaic NJ. They had me sign up for a Verizon phone plan and wrote me a check for the excess amount of the 1st month bill. That one cleared but the 2nd month's check did not. The store and owner both disappeared and I was stuck with a 2yr contract.

I was a dumb 17 year old kid who wanted the newest phone for free and I fell for their promise of paying the phone bill difference. So did most of the Indian community in central and northern NJ. I couldn't afford to keep paying the bill so I cancelled the plan and was stuck with a $1300 cancellation charge which went to collections.

(I posted the above background story to see if any commenters have had the same experience as me)

Somewhere on the Internet I read a few things that led me to believe that:

 1. There is a statute of limitations on how long this could be reported and effect my credit report (I believe it was 8 years)

2. The fact that it is a phone bill (considered a ""utility"" vs something like a credit card), it will not have a serious consequence on my credit report.

So I ignored the collections calls for many years thinking this would eventually go away by the time I graduate college and become a ""real"" adult. 

My mother finally got fed up with the calls to the house and ""settled"" with the agency for $500 of the $1300 (I believe last year). 

My credit report still shows this Verizon Bill as ""derogatory"" and my score is definately taking a hit because of it. How can I have this ""derogatory"" piece removed?

My credit score is currently at 643 - I would like to get it higher. I have one secured credit card (only one I qualified for) and I am having trouble getting approved for unsecured credit cards.

On top of that, a new collections agency is now calling me trying to collect the remaining $800 of the bill. 

Can anyone provide guidance on how to remediate the situation? 

I truly believe that I was a victim of fraud (if that makes any difference) - the phone shop hustled many people. I am a pretty educated guy and I am having a difficult time figuring this stuff out. I can only imagine how hard it is for less educated individuals or people with a language barrier (like many people in my community I know that fell for the same trap). 


Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!",finance,1472564716

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans? Check local bank/credit unions as well.,"u/Lumpyyyyy said I should create a separate post to address this, so here it is: 

If you're looking to refinance your student loans and are not waiting for federal forgiveness or some other program that requires you to keep a federal student loan, read on. 

My SO is smart. She graduated in a high compensation field with a lot of debt and was making great progress paying down her 6 figure loan balance already when we met. I suggested why not refinance to a lower APR so more of that money would go to principal and less to interest. She was paying between 4 and 6% apr on the federal loans. In 2014, SoFi was advertising a lot, so we called them and averaged the rate down to something around 3.875% APR.  A little bit less than a year later, her sister mentioned to me that she refinanced her loans thru her employer credit union for under 2.5% which seemed too good to be true. I had never heard of unsecured debt at rates that low. I called around and while we were not eligible for the membership of that credit union, there was another local credit union that offered rates as low as 1.9% for student loan refinance. We jumped on it. She continues to make the same payments (lots of extra going to principal) but our local CU was able to extend the term from 3 to 5 years while still nearly cutting the APR in half. 

TL;DR: If you're paying &gt;4% APR on federal student loans and not holding out for forgiveness, look at local bank and credit unions for rates lower than the big clearinghouses(SoFi, etc).

personalfinance,"Am I prioritizing these debts in the best way? Private undergraduate loan, auto loan, and new unsubsidized graduate loans","Last night I got myself into a tizzy about some recent car repairs that have been causing me to question car ownership. I was very seriously considering selling the stupid thing and eating the $3k extra that I would owe to bank to release the lien, but have somewhat settled on the idea of making more aggressive auto loan payments to get that debt taken care of much faster than originally planned. 

So, here’s where I’ve landed; I’m hoping someone can help me figure out if this is a decent enough plan:

I net about $2950/month after insurance and taxes

My current debt situation:

* $10,761 undergraduate loan with 7.9% interest rate - currently pay $250 monthly, expecting my payoff to be sometime in early 2020 
* $9,705 auto loan with 6.99% interest rate - currently pay $240 monthly, with 46 payments remaining (payoff for current structure is June 2020)
* Additional car expenses: $70 monthly car insurance, approx. $80 in monthly gas
* No outstanding credit card debt - my only CC has a $350 limit because I signed up for it when my credit was crap, and had to put a CD down to secure it. Haven’t raised the limit, and recently paid the balance off in full.
* Other, non-debt monthly expenses include $400 for groceries, $40 for the gym, $30 for other monthly subscriptions. My company pays for my phone bill. All else rolls into a general safety net/incidental/personal/entertainment budget. 

I am in graduate school and live at home to save money. I will be taking out unsubsidized loans with an interest rate of 5.31% to cover the cost of tuition - $650 per credit, with 51 of my 60 credits needing to be financed. The original idea was to start paying on my graduate loans immediately with the money saved by not paying rent - I figured about $700 a month. I’m starting to reconsider my payment priorities, though. 

I’ve landed on the following plan but would be open to any better suggestions:

* Continue paying the $250/month on the 7.9% undergraduate loan, bump my car loan payment up to an aggressive $950/month solely toward the principle + whatever extra is needed for interest, and set aside $100/month for incidental school costs like books, etc, without starting my payments on the unsubsidized graduate loans yet
* Once the car loan is paid off (I believe it would take about ~10 months at the super aggressive rate I listed above) I would roll that whole payment into the 7.9% APR undergraduate loan to start chipping away at it a lot more aggressively
* And finally, once that undergrad loan is taken care of, I’d roll the payments into my graduate loans and start making aggressive progress on them before I’m out of school in mid-2020. 

Now, this is obviously assuming that I maintain the same income (or get a pay increase around my year-review next summer) and can keep paying at such aggressive levels long-term. Being in school full-time and working full-time may be a bit much to handle, so my income may decrease if I choose to go part-time, but I’d like to start making some really aggressive headway into these loans so I don’t have as much to pay off once I’m done with school, while I can. 

**my question is**: am I prioritizing paying off those loans in the most efficient way? I know the undergrad loan has a higher APR, but recent big-ticket car repair costs make me feel a lot more urgent about getting rid of that loan as quickly as I can and having it all paid off by this time next year, so I can sell it without being underwater on the loan, if it comes to that.

personalfinance,Anyone here have experience with Discover Banking?,"A while back, through this sub, I learned of the wonders of online-only banks. I found that my local branch, at 0.1% interest, isn't really doing my ~$18,000 savings any favors. They're charging me fees for my checking account. The appeal of a ""local"" bank doesn't really make me feel loyal to them, as I haven't stepped into the place since I opened my account with them three years ago. I do pretty much everything online. 

Enter Discover Banking. I believe it is the only online bank that can serve my needs:

1. Offer competitive interest rates for my savings (0.95% APY) .

2. Allow me to open 4 accounts with them (2 savings, 2 checking). I use these four accounts, respectively, to manage my long term savings, short term savings, recurring monthly bills, and day-to-day debit card spending. I almost went with CapitalOne 360, but they don't support this setup. 

3. Provide debit cards for both checking accounts I keep with them. As a bonus, Discover offers some nice benefits to their checking accounts.



I've used Discover for my credit card for a while, and only had very positive experiences when it came to customer service and card benefits. Just wanted to get some insight from you guys before I dump 18 grand and my future direct deposits into one bank. And since Discover Bank is relatively new.",finance,1472579579

personalfinance,Should I dump all I have into student loans?,"Hi all,

I've been using YNAB to help budget my money. At this point, I've saved up well over 3 months of emergency fund. I have a few other categories that I'm saving up each month (car, wedding, etc...) though I'm not dumping a lot into them. I have roughly $25k in student loans (varying from 4-7% interest rate). My question is, should I just dump all of my future income into these loans first and worrying about saving later? I could rid these loans in under 2 years if I did that. My and my SO's thinking is that we can get rid of the loans upfront and not have to ""lose"" money each month to interest. Are we approaching this the wrong way?",finance,1472583543

gaming,A guide on filing a Federal Trade Commission complaint for No Man's Sky.,"You may have seen this on GAF. This is a tutorial on filing a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission and their international website, econsumer.gov. I reformatted it to post it here on Reddit for those who,

* Can't get a refund for their game because of frequent crashes and bugs.
* May just be fed up with stuff like this happening to not only this game but many others in the industry.
* Would like to see more transparency and honesty with game marketing.
* Don't think that HG deserves to get rich off of misinformation and lies.
* Would like to take a stand for consumer rights.

Let me know if I got anything wrong or if anything needs to be changed. Also, feel free to reformat or make changes yourself and PM it to me. As far as I can tell it's almost identical to the [econsumer.gov](https://www.econsumer.gov) process that I link to for those outside of the states.

Comments:
For the past several years Sean Murray of Hello Games discussed his company's game, No Man's Sky. At gaming conferences, talk shows, other venues and media outlets he repeatedly gave information about the game, revealing more and more about No Man's Sky. After the games release a few weeks ago, it became glaringly apparant that he had blatantly lied about many features, inlcuding some key features of the game, as shown in the videos of him below. What has been presented about the game by Sean Murray for the past several years, and the information from Hello Games website is blatant false advertising. The game is not as described, and this company has repeatedly lied and continues to lie about the true contents of their product. This is a list of a lot of the missing features that where advertised and sources from when they where advertised to be there: https://archive.is/OCNdQ",technology,1472585942

personalfinance,Mom is turning to me for advice about 15+ year old Whole Life Insurance policy vs other investment options...,"A bit of back-story: My dad died almost a year ago, and, as the primary provider for the family, left my mom in a bit of a pickle. Luckily, he planned well for this eventuality and left mom with some savings, life insurance payouts, and other assets. I've been meaning to get on here and ask this for a while now, but with the Whole Life Insurance question that she just sprung on me that I can't adequately answer, I figure now is the time!

Whole Life Insurance Question: Dad opened up a Whole Life insurance policy on my mom almost 30 years ago. He then revisited it when he opened one for me a bit over 15 years ago. Apparently the interest rate is locked at 4%, which doesn't seem too bad, and the only penalty that she mentioned is a withdrawal fee of $25. I am aware that a well-diversified investment fund can yield about 8%, but she's wary of the market. I've convinced her to open a Vanguard IRA (whenever she gets around to sending in the paperwork...), but I'm trying to figure out why she shouldn't dump the rest of her assets into this Whole Life Insurance plan other than hearing from you guys that these things are bad and that your best friend from high school is out to get you with them. 

Mom's assets:

* $40k in a trust (the payout of Dad's own Whole Life Insurance policy, I believe) currently gaining 3% that cannot be added to, only withdrawn from.

* $100k sitting in a savings account gaining 0.1% APY

* ~$200k House, paid off

* ~$8k 2009 Truck, paid off

* ~1500 2006 Sedan, paid off

She's waiting on the Insurance rep to send her a statement of how much the life insurance policies are worth currently, but the rate is apparently locked at 4%, so how much it has in it isn't super relevant, I think. I can update this later with that amount if necessary.

As for her day-to-day finances, she seems to be ok. She gets about 3000/mo in various retirement plans from dad's past jobs, a renter, and her own part time job, and has about 2000/mo on necessary expenses, as well as 5000/yr on property taxes and home/car insurances.

As for me, I'm in my twenties and self-sufficient. Financially, she's just looking out for her own future, and I want to help her do that. So can you guys help me? :-D

TL;DR: Single mom has about ~150k in assets that she's not entirely sure what to do with. One possibility is dumping it all into a 4% Whole Life Insurance policy.",finance,1472592331

financialindependence,FIRE and changes in minimum wage,"With the changes from $7.25/hour to $15/hour being discussed for US 
federal minimum wage, I am curious what peoples thoughts are in terms of FIRE impact?

To frame the question a bit, currently (ignoring taxes)

For $7.25 per hour

* Yearly salary is $15,080
* With a 4% SWR, a portfolio of $377,000 is required to replicate the salary
* With a 4% SWR, a portfolio of $1,000,000 is equivalent to 2.65x minimum wage.

For $15 per hour

* Yearly salary is $31,200
* With a 4% SWR, a portfolio of $780,000 is required to replicate the salary
* With a 4% SWR, a portfolio of $1,000,000 is equivalent to 1.28x minimum wage.

My gut is that this has the potential to impact FIRE in at least two different ways

* The average portfolio will no longer have as much purchasing power relative to minimum wage
* I expect any increases to minimum wages to be eaten by corresponding price increases relatively quickly, resulting in a very sharp inflation spike.

personalfinance,Law student with bad credit,"I need some advice on credit card applications -- (I also posted this in the student loans forum but they directed me here)

I am starting law school this year after finishing undergrad this past spring. I have never had a credit card before and made the mistake of not applying for one when I had a steady income during undergrad.

My problems were compounded when I found out that my mom (who had been handling my undergrad tuition payments) had missed a payment for a few months (long enough to be noted by the credit agencies), and, because the loan was in my name, I got majorly dinged on my credit score. All the payments have been made and are squared away, but now I really need to fix my credit. I'm worried about finishing law school with a healthy amount of loans AND crappy credit, so if I can get that crappy score up over the next few years by buying a pack of gum here and there, that seems like a good idea.

I did my research, and it seems like the Discover secured card is the best bet for me for a year or so, just to build up my credit. The loans that I have for law school will leave me -- after tuition -- with enough to pay rent and conceivably live off of. I am not taking out private loans -- it just so happens that after paying tuition, I have federal loans leftover, enough to pay rent and live very meagerly on.  Other than that, I will have no income until probably next summer. I plan on securing it for the minimum of $200 and don't plan on using the card for more than $20 or so a month.

I need some general advice and thoughts on this! Any comments/tips/articles would be great. I've been searching around for how to best report income and there isn't a lot of help for someone with no income other than student loans who really just needs to build credit.",finance,1472594751
personalfinance,"Would love some advice and suggestions on my current budget, especially re: loans &amp; savings","Hi everybody,

Long time lurker here.  I've learned a ton of great information from this sub, and now I would really love some advice/guidance on my current budget.  I have a LOT of student loan debt (hooray, law school), but I also want to actively contribute to some kind of savings fund so that I can eventually retire.

Any advice or tips or help would be greatly appreciated!!!  I've tried to include as much information as possible.

**Salary**: $5,110.8 per month ($100k/year)

**Recurring expenses**: total of $1,242.5

* $1,008.96 − loans

* $96.23 – phone (expensive, but this is the lowest plan I can get)

* $28.34 – gym

* $11.99 – Hulu

* $6.99 – NYT crossword subscription (clearly not a necessary expense, but I love my crossword puzzles!)

* $40 – prescriptions

* $40 – wax (it's about $70 every 5 weeks)

* $9.99 − spotify


That leaves $3,868.3.  The past few months I've had a lot of unexpected expenses arise, so I am not sure I have the most accurate information on how much I spend monthly on the non-recurring expenses.  My guess is about $1,000/month.

**Other (relevant?) info**:

* $500/month into my 401k.  No employer match.

* $178,000 in student loans.  I have about 6 loans, and I'm currently putting extra money each month into the highest interest rate loan.

* I have $13,000 in an FNBO savings account, with a .95% interest rate

* I have about $22,000 in a rollover IRA, and another $11,000 in stocks and index funds

* I live at home right now and don't pay rent.  However, I'm turning 30 next year, and even though it's probably not fiscally the best decision, I plan on moving out in the new year.  In my area, rent is expensive, and with utilities and everything, I'm looking at probably $1900-2000/month.  I'm taking my time looking for a place, and am *hoping* to keep my monthly rent closer to $1600-1700.  But I thought I'd use the higher number here.

So...what do I do now?  I know that I definitely need to be stricter and more diligent about what I'm spending on non-recurring expenses.  For example, I'm not eating out as much, making my own food, and am trying to avoid the random purchases that add up (e.g., buying a dress for work, I need new mascara, whatever else happens, drinks with girlfriends).

While I'm living at home, it makes sense (to me) to put the ~$2,000 I'd be paying in rent into my loans, to try and bring the principal down as much as possible.  Once I move out, however, I'm out that $2,000.


**I guess my big question is**:  how much of my extra money per month do I put into loans, and how much do I put into some kind of savings?  Also, do I really need $13,000 in a savings account?

Sorry if this is all jumbly, but I'm a little overwhelmed because I want to get rid of my debt, but also want to keep saving money simultaneously.

Thank you all so much for reading.",finance,1472594943

**VIEWPOINT:**

Can SMRs unlock financing?

Whilst a project of the size and complexity of Hinkley Point C faces a range of challenges which lessen the availability of limited-recourse financing, it is clear that nuclear plant construction violates the basic precepts of project finance due to the unpredictability of project costs and schedule, write Rory Connor and Ken Culotta of law firm King &amp; Spalding.

As the UK government mulls over the project fundamentals for Hinkley Point C one last time it is worth reflecting that, if and when the project finally goes ahead, EDF and its Chinese partners will proceed on the basis of on-balance sheet corporate funding; not limited-recourse project financing, as originally touted.

For the industry to flourish, even in the presence of strong government policy support, the ability to finance is critical. There is the possibility though that new technology and new construction techniques, in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs), may hold the key to overcoming such issues.",energy,1472596257

personalfinance,Extremely Small / Unnoticed Student Loan Harming Credit,"Long story short, among my student loans there was a singular Perkins loan for $350 taken out my freshman year of college. I have been aggressively been paying down my remaining 30k in student loans and was looking to refinance due to the high interest rate on these loans. I was immediately declined due to what SoFi stated was a seriously delinquent account. 

""Hmm...thats funny"", I thought. Neither Transunion (offered through Capital One), nor Equifax (through Credit Karma), had any accounts in delinquency. 

Paying for a $1 trial on Experian I then discovered that this $350 loan has been delinquent for nearly 3 years and I had no prior knowledge of. 

Even though all other student loans appear through my ACS account, this one did not. 

Apart from obviously paying off the loan in full, are there any ""best practices"" in working with my college (who is listed as the creditor) or ACS (I'm assuming they are simply the processing arm) to having this removed from my credit report?

I'm 22 years old, living in the Bay Area, and just accepted my first full-time job offer at $87k/year + 7.5% bonus depending on performance at the end of the year. They will match my 401k contribution at 50% of up to 6% of my salary.

personalfinance,22 with ~4 more years of college to go on a 10.50/hr job looking to invest/save.,"TLDR: What is the best option amongst a ~1.0% rate savings account, money market, and a CD? I would consider investing in stocks or something, but I have no knowledge about stocks nor can I trust a stranger to invest my money in a stock just because they say its the best thing to do. I'm open to other fairly safe alternatives also!

I'm currently 22, with about 1 more year full time at my cc before I transfer over to a cal state for a 3 year program to get my bachelors. Currently, my job hours are kinda weird. Long story short, employer hired me on the pretense of putting me on the night shift, but as of right now, they still haven't figured it out, so I'm just working part time for 3.5hrs @ $10.50/hr until they can set up the night shift. I'll be working 8 hrs a day for the night shift.

My goal in life is to at least own a house ( not too sure where) and a Subraru WRX (haven't decided on the model, but let's assume its an STI). I was looking into a high yield savings account like Synchrony's or Ally's 1.05% and 1.00% rates respectively. But I'm not sure if its a great idea considering I have little experience with 100% online banking services ( the closest thing is my Amazon credit card..). Initial deposit would be around $1000, with a ~$400 (maybe more) deposit monthly. Granted, this is most likely NOT a permanent or long term job, but I would still like to start saving towards my goal ASAP. 

I live with my parents, so rent/food/bills are covered, but I pay for my own insurance (~$1200/annual) and my own gas. The costs I forsee would be gas, food (dates with my SO, not often as we only get to see each at most once a week), and school supplies/college books. I'm not in a hurry to buy a new car, as my current car is working just fine. But I would like to own at least a condo in the before my 30s.

I've read that it's best to go in with financing from my bank.

At what point do I do this?  Is this after I've already haggled down the price?  Do I leave the dealer and say ""I'll come back tomorrow with a check?"", and hope that the deal suddenly doesn't change?  Am I going to sign some agreement with the final price, that then requires payment in X days?  Or do I go to the bank first, and they give me some range?

Should I move all of my 401k and ira, currently 60/20/20 index funds, into bond funds?

I work at a large private software company, and as part of my compensation I have received a non-trivial amount of stock options. I have exercised 50% of my options, at a cost of roughly $200k total between the strike price and subsequent AMT. The whole $200k is paid for and done with in the 2015 tax year; I went through the process with a CPA. I paid $100k of that myself and have a few personal loans from wealthy friends for the other $100k at ~2% (federal minimum for non-gift treatment at that time).

The ""value"" of my exercised shares is approximately $1.25 million; I use quotes here because this is based off the private valuation, and my shares are totally illiquid (no secondary market allowed) until acquisition or IPO, either of which are far off... maybe 5 years? I exercised these options because I do not think I will still be with the company when a liquidity event does happen, but I really do think it will happen and I don't think I'm going to end up losing money on the deal, though I might not walk away with $1million in profit.

Now that you know my situation, I'm really seeking advice on what to do with the rest of my assets. I have $60k in normal 401ks and 15k in a Roth IRA. Right now they are spread out in a normal 60/20/20 distribution, but I've been feeling recently that I should move all of it into bonds to offset my large illiquid assets to feel some sense of security.

Other info: no kids, no house, my car is worth $2k, single but my future partner will likely start off at $100k-$150k starting in 4-5 years upon completion of PhD. $150k salary + ~$20k cash yearly bonus + more stock with a vesting schedule, $15k in Roth IRA, $60k in 401k, $20k cash, and in my early 20's.",finance,1472616736

btc,Bitcoin super-team creates MASS: a blockchain-based solution to online advertising,"(Press release)

Consumers are fed up with irrelevant and obtrusive ads, and the use of ad-blockers has become prevalent. As a result, data-tracking for businesses and ad agencies has become nearly useless, threatening the entire online advertising business model. The industry’s current solution is an arms race of anti-blockers versus anti-anti-blockers, and in some cases even risky alliances with the ad-blockers themselves. This inefficient counter-productivity leads to lots of wasted resources, and an inevitable dead-end.

To solve this problem, the ad industry and blockchain experts have combined efforts to create The Mass Network —a blockchain-based solution aimed at restoring the balance of power between the online advertising industry, and internet users who unwittingly provide that advertising industry its revenue source: data. Mass users are supported by contributions from Colu, which provides the asset protocol, and Mycelium, which provides the wallet component. Two other top Bitcoin giants are also in talks about how they can best contribute to Mass.

Mass proposes to replace this wasteful battle for what would otherwise be mutually beneficial proactive commerce, by creating a blockchain-based marketplace for consumers, webmasters, and data management platforms, where the industry pays a fair, market-determined rate to users for their data and attention. This voluntarily provided user information, exchanged for compensation, presents truly valuable data to the industry. Especially when compared to the current ill-gotten and often misinterpreted data harvested automatically by websites.

To power this network, and to create a more stable method of exchange, Mass will release Mass Coin to the public via a one-time only offering. Once live, internet users of this the system will be paid Mass Coin in exchange for watching ads and browsing sites that are part of the Mass Network. Mass Coin lives on the Bitcoin blockchain, and will have the same transparency, fluidity, and security of Bitcoin without the dramatic price volatility.

Mass paves the way to monetizing our everyday online experience, while improving the consumer's relationship with brands and publishers, and making advertising more efficient to the benefit of all parties involved. In a world where people's lives are becoming more and more digitized, Mass provides a safeguard from exploitation by improving access, integrity, and trust.

After my mother-in-law passed away, we sold off her car and house. That money is in an estate bank account now. Other household items were disposed of through the family - mostly trinkets and knick-knacks, nothing of material value there. 

For a couple items, our attorney has advised how to handle them, but there a few things that may have slipped through his crack and since he's just about done, I'd rather not tack more work on to his bill. 

1) Our cable provider:  We returned the equipment a couple days after she passed away, but did not yet have a death certificate, so we couldn't officially close the account.  They are mailing us letters and sending the account to collections. We've sent the cable company a copy of the death certificate, and a reminder that their equipment has been returned.  Should I even entertain the letter from their collection agency or deal only with the cable company, and insist that they stop collection attempts since the account is (or should be closed)?

2) Unsecured credit cards:  There are a couple accounts with moderate balances ($3,000-ish on one, $700 on another).  These are unsecured debt, and I always learned that unsecured debt carries a higher interest rate because the bank carries the risk that if something happens, they don't get paid. The attorney mentioned something about negotiating a settlement amount on this debt, but I'm tempted to just send them the copy of the death certificate and my warmest apologies that there is nothing else I can do for them. After all, they did collect a higher interest rate to carry this as unsecured debt. Am I wrong in thinking this? 

3) Hospital bills:  These are starting to trickle in.  First of all, she was on Medicare, and I believe there's a rule that you only pay the deductible once admitted. *(EDIT: one deductible per for admittance to inpatient care, and that covers that span of treatment, even if it's release, re-admit cycles for a period of time)* She was in and out about 3-4 times, into two different hospitals. Hospital A and Hospital B.  Hospital A was where we took her when we initially got the cancer diagnosis, and B was where we took her a couple weeks later for some heart trouble that started to appear.  She died in the care of Hospital B, and we feel they deserve exactly $0, but that's an emotion, not a rule.  But, under the Medicare rules, I'm not sure they're entitled to any additional funds, since the deductible was (or will have been) paid. Who should help us clear this bill? Or, since it is being mailed to her mailing address (which is now a  PO Box), should we just let them write it off?

Money was tight for a year but I live pretty small and I added a husband's worth of extra income so we're doing great now.

I had intended to sell the house after 5 years and move on, but life happens and I'll probably be in this house for another 2-5 years.  November of 2016 my interest rate will go to 3.75%, bringing my mortgage to $605 a month. I can expect it to go up 1% point every year until a max of 7.75%. Not sure what my mortgage will be then. 

My husband and I make about 4k a month. We spend about $2200-2700 a month. Just this past month I had a $350 car repair and my husband had to pay tuition and $800 on 3 textbooks, and we were still in the black. People (my mom mostly) are freaking out on me that my interest rate will skyrocket and I'll be house poor and that people like me are the reason the economy crashed in 2008.

My question is, if I don't intend to stay in the house for more than 5 years, do I even care what the interest rate is?

To recap:

 * 5 year ARM, 2.75%, about to adjust
 * I believe the rate can only go up 1 percentage point a year based of the prime index whatever. I'm not super educated on this part. 
 * I currently owe $59,000
 * We make $4,000 a month, only spend $2,500 a month.
 * No other debts


I really feel like the 5 year arm was the best mortgage for my situation when I bought the house. I needed the low payments at first. Now the rate will adjust, but interest on the paltry amount I owe wont be very much. And who cares about interest when I'm trying to move out in 2-5 years. It's fine! right?",finance,1472663634

We've been trending down the last two weeks or so and I've been down about a half percent.

These are all long holds for me, but should I pull it for a bit and try to time this for the interest rate hike (if there is one?)? I'm not sure how Fed announcements work--do they just come at any time or is there a date?",finance,1472665907
personalfinance,Just pulled credit; is now good time to shop for a new credit card?,"I have a credit card with $30k limit (currently $0 balance) that I have had for about 14 years.  It was my first credit card in high school and has a very high interest rate and no rewards system.  This card is not being used as my wife and I started using our debit card a few years ago to keep our credit card debt under control.  

I'd like to have some fraud protection and start taking advantage of cash back rewards that a credit card would offer and want to start using a CC again (now that we are exercising self-control and responsibility).

About two weeks ago my credit was pulled as part of a car purchase.  

Would now be a good time to shop for a new credit card seeing as my credit was pulled two weeks ago?  As I understand, and hard pulls within 30 days count as one inquiry.",finance,1472666419

personalfinance,Question about how student loan interest accrues while in deferment.,"I have two unsubsidized, graduate student loans, both with the same company. They are currently in deferment since I am still a student, and will remain so for at least another year. However, I am working and making payments towards them. I am a little confused about how the capitalization of the interest works.

From what I am reading online, it seems like as long as I am in deferment, I only accrue interest on the principle amount, and not on the interest already accrued. So if I have a $10,000 loan, with a 6.8% interest rate, I will accrue $680 worth of interest every year, until that interest is capitalized into principle (as opposed to accruing $680 worth interest in the first year, and then ($10,000+$680)*6.8%=$726.24 in the second year). Is this correct? If so, I think this has big implications on how I should allocate my payments. 

Like I said, I have two unsubsidized loans with the same company. For simplicity, lets say the principle balance on both is $10,000, and each have accrued $2000 worth of interest so far. I want to put $1000 every month towards these loans. When I make a payment, the payment goes towards the accrued interest first. Once that is paid down, it then goes towards the principle. If what I said above is true, then my accrued interest is not earning any interest (it is not capitalized), and it therefore behooves me to work my way towards the principle as quickly as I can, so I can slow the rate that I am accruing interest. Therefore, since I can choose which loan my payment goes to, I should put 100% of it towards one of the loans. I can therefore dig my way through the interest more quickly, and after 2 months or so of making $1000 payments, I will start paying off principle. As I pay down the principle, I accrue less interest, and the total amount that I end up having to pay back is reduced.

If, instead, I had put 50% of my payment towards each loan ($500 to each), it would take me more than twice as long to get to the principle, so I would be accruing additional interest over that time. 

Is my logic here correct? I have not seen anywhere that talked about it, so I am wondering if I am missing something important. If not, this would seem like a really useful piece of knowledge for people paying back student loans while in deferment.",finance,1472668705
personalfinance,"I'm refinancing an auto loan and have extra money to put to principle. Is it better to put that to original lender, or bring directly to new lender?","I just got a new vehicle for ~20k and was approved with a less than ideal interest rate. I'm hoping to refinance with another lender and get a better rate. I now have significant additional funds I want to pay towards principle - ~10k. 

I'm wondering if it would be better to pay that to my current lender so when I apply for new financing it will show as additional paid to the loan, or should I just go to the new lender and tell them I only need financing for $10k, and give them the extra funds like a down payment?

personalfinance,Need help devising good retirement savings plan as an engineering PhD student on nontaxable federal stipend.,"Hello all, 

I am a second year PhD student in engineering school on a (~$2500 / mo.) stipend. I have no student loans or outstanding debt of any kind. I currently have $7000 saved in a Roth IRA invested in some solid passively managed index funds. 

However, here is the catch:

It turns out since my stipend (coming from a NSF grant) is considered non-compensatory income (not subject to federal income tax), I cannot put any of the money I make into my Roth IRA unless it is from another taxable source. 

My question to the /r/personalfinance community is what would be the best strategy for saving for retirement while I'm still in grad school? So far, I've just been placing what I've saved in a savings account.

I am considering just buying the same funds that I bought in my Roth IRA in a brokerage account but I'm thinking the annual tax might offset any real growth. Thoughts?

personalfinance,Wanting to buy third vehicle...,"So my significant other and I are wanting to buy another vehicle. Well mostly me, here's the details.

She is a full time student and works 32 hours at a daycare. She lives mostly paycheck to paycheck. She does pay some of the bills but I pay the brunt of them, mortgage included. She drives a 2008 cobalt that I so most of the maintenance to and all in all it is in good shape and dependable. She hopes to keep it going until she graduates (2 more years give or take) the get something new.

My daily and our only other vehicle, is a 2003 Chevy s10 xtreme in which I have taken care of VERY METICULOUSLY. It only has 59k miles on it and needs nothing. 

My question, I would like to get a full size truck ( looking at a 2002 Chevy 2500hd 6.0 GASER) for work around the house, I use my s10 to its full ability as a truck BUT I can't haul heavy loads and have frequently had to make multiple trips for big loads (I'm a big time DIYer and constantly doing projects around the house) and I am not able to rent bigger equipment with my s10 such as a trencher ditch witch or termite excavators or back hoes. Now I won't be doing this OFTEN but the times I would, the delivery fees are crazy high and working 2nd shift make sit difficult to be there for delivery and pickup. 

Would I be justified to spend say 6k on a 2002 Chevy 2500hd 6.0 4x4 gas truck with 161k miles? I'm a pretty big right wad when it comes to money and I'm on te fence of justifying this purchase.
I'd rather not touch my savings as next spring I have a $3200 bill coming my way for the city project this year including new aidewalks curbs storm drains and driveway entry's...

EDIT: here is alot more information I posted during a downtime on this sub and did not receive much feedback on:

So I'm 27 years young now, army vet recently honorably discharged. Recovering alcoholic, 2 yeArs sober now living in Ohio. I have now lived in my house for a year this month. Got it with a VA loan. My interest rate isn't so great, about 4.2% on 110k home. My payment a month including taxes and insurance is 780. I've been trying to pay about 1000 a month however. 

I am an aerospace welder by trade and my net income a year WITHOUT Overtime is around 30k. I however am almost always guaranteed overtime and last year made right over 50k ( this is about my average a year now) I have very little debt to my name as far as bills in collections (less than $400.) but plan to get
That taken care of ( working off shift makes it difficult getting things taken care of haha) in the near future. 

I have about 3k in the bank in savings and another 1800 in another account. HOWEVER. I have a bill coming my way from the city next summer for a sidewalk/curb/ driveway apron project. 

My question:

I'm wanting to get into investing, I feel I'm in the perfect position in life to get into it. However I and completely ignorant to the entire thing. It sounds like a Vanguard total stock market index is what I should do? I feel like at my age, I could get into something more aggressive, but what do you guys think? I'm kind of a tight ass when it comes to money but I have been helping family out a lot with things ( my mother doesn't work and lives with her father whom she takes care of). But I would love to make some money and buy some fun toys to enjoy in my 30's with the Mrs.

personalfinance,Will canceling old credit cards create credit rating issues if they're my oldest lines of credit?,"I've got two Bank of America credit cards, VISA and MC (one used to be another bank that BoA bought out a number of years ago), that are 27 and 22 years old respectively.  I've wanted to get rid of each for years because every time I call BoA to have the interest rate lowered they steadily increase it for some unknown reason over the course of months or even a year or more.  Both cards have fees as well.  I want to set both aside and get two new cards that have 0 or low annual fees and give cash back (yes I can pay them off each month).  I think the annual fees on the two old cards is about $40 each (guessing).  I don't mind holding on to them for a while to give the newer cards time to age and give me a decent period of credit life.

Should I bite the bullet and keep the old cards for a long period of time due to their long credit history or is there a period of time after which I can finally cancel them and just use the new cards?  I want one of the replacements to be the Citi Double Cash card.  The second one would really just be for emergencies.
