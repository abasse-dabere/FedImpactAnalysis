personalfinance,How much can I expect to bring home after taxes?,"I am working on putting together a budget for next year. My wife and I graduate this December and have written offers for $110,000 combined plus bonuses (up to 25%; typically around 5-10%).

I have used the IRS calculator but I think it may be inaccurate due to the amount of taxes seeming low. Any way to get a better idea on what I could expect to bring home? 

Also, any general pitfalls? We both are first generation college students and don't really have anyone else to talk to. Currently, my plan is enter an IBR on our federal loans ($115,000) and pay off high interest rate loans. Once that it is done, we will begin paying extra towards student loans and saving for our first real estate investment.

Two final questions. I had an internship with another company (than where I currently have an offer) and while they loved me (their words) I do not have an offer. I have been told this is typical because they do not want to leave the job req open for the 4 months I have left in school. I would much rather work for this company. The pay rate would be about the same but no bonus. The promotion opportunities are significantly better. Would I be a fool to hold out for this other job?

Last question, should I negotiate the current offer? They are slightly higher than industry standard but not by much.",finance,1472691313

personalfinance,How to get returns from money that isn't yours?,"I've been paid a rather large signing bonus by my company.

As an investor, it hurts me to let all of that money sit in a savings account making .1% interest for the next year.

personalfinance,Evaluate our plan please! 2 students trying to become financially stable!,"okay so I am looking for some advise/criticism on our current financial plan. 

Income: 
Me-Salary $28,277 per year
Her-Salary $31,200 per year 
We are both in college full time and work full time. 

We recently refinanced a house we bought at 19 (my grandmother financed it for us initially due to inability to qualify for a mortgage)
We did a cash out refinance at 3.75% for 15 years, took 80,000 out. Payment $662/mo including taxes and insurance. 
All expenses including mortgage come to roughly 2000-2200/mo

We have student loans:
$16,540 @7.210% (parent plus) 
$10,270 @6.410%  (parent plus) 
$20,400 @4.375% (federal direct me)
$24,500 @4.25%  (federal direct her) 

We currently have $97,000 in the bank (including money from cash out)

The plan is to pay off the loan we owe my grandma ($75,200 remaining) which leaves us with around $23,000. Then take roughly $12,500 and pay down the parent plus loan at 7.210%. We will then pay an additional $1,000 dollars per month toward the parent plus loans until they are gone, and then continue down the line focusing on the unsubsidized loans. We have no other debt, pay off credit card monthly, both have paid off reliable cars, and have no intention to move for 8-10 years. Both of our incomes are very stable (I work for the federal government, she works for family company that has guaranteed her income until graduation).

personalfinance,I owe the US Treasury $30K in medical debt; should I declare bankruptcy? More details in the text.,"In 2012 I was in a motorcycle accident which led to surgery for injuries I sustained. I worked full-time but didn't make enough to afford health insurance. For whatever reason, I was taken to a local private hospital, then transferred to a military hospital (even though I am and always have been a civilian).

The surgery and hospitalization (at military hospital) were $23,000. I never received an invoice or a bill, only ""delinquency letters""; I called the hospital every time I received one, and was told that I had not yet been sent a bill because there were problems in their system with my information, and that I would be sent a bill. A bill never came. In May of 2016 (four years later), I received a letter from the US Treasury Bureau of Fiscal Service, who is acting as a third-party collector of this debt. They say that it is now $30,000 because of penalties and interest. They don't explain at what point they started charging penalties/interest, or what the rate is. The people working the phones are nice but not really knowledgeable. 

**I can think of the following options:**

*1. I start a fundraiser online to get help with this; I am a decent hobbyist songwriter so at least people can get music in exchange for donation. (probably the lamest idea)

*2. I enter into a payment agreement with the Fed, but not before trying to explain to them that there were serious miscommunications regarding the hospital sending a bill. TODAY I actually received an invoice from the hospital for the FIRST TIME, only after a dozen phone calls and requests. Hopefully I can get them to let me pay on the original amount of $23,000 instead of $30,000. If I don't enter into an agreement they will start to garnish my wages. Also, apparently they don't do ""itemized bills"" only ""invoices""; that was news to me.

*3. **I declare bankruptcy**. I don't have assets. I am married with a child, am the sole income-earner, (my wife can barely work part-time since we have a baby) we don't have that much in savings, and by the time the bankruptcy is off my credit report, that $30,000 (or more) will be better spent on a down-payment for a house. I'm only 31 and not in a rush to buy a home as we don't even have an emergency fund yet (in progress). We can barely save money at present as it is and we are living month-to-month.

*4. I get a lawyer and negotiate the debt (if that's possible?)
I paid every bill that came to me, including the first ER, the ambulance ride, all follow-up visits; I also have great credit, have paid off all student loans, don't have credit card debt, and am only financing a vehicle. I have excellent payment history.

personalfinance,"Federal Tax Rates (percentage, not total) changing on my paycheck depending how much I earned, varying from ~2% up to ~10%","Hi all. Allow me to preface this by stating that this is my first job, which i started around November last year with very little hours.

I was doing some perusing through my pay stub history and started getting curious about where exactly all of my paycheck was going, when I started crunching numbers and though something was a little off.

I noticed that when the amount of hours (so total earned) for that particular check is low (my first paychecks were for around $100-200), I pay a very low federal tax rate, the lowest being 1.7% on my lowest paycheck of $94. However, when I work more hours, that percentage increases, the highest being 10% on a paycheck for $507.

Now obviously I know that, at a fixed rate, the more hours worked means the more total taxes paid. But does the percentage I pay change as well? I looked at all of the deductions from a few random stubs and they all show a very similar percentage, however federal tax is all over the place. I opened up the lowest check and the highest check and compared all of the deductions and their percentages, and threw them here:


 |Lowest|Highest|
:--|:--|:--|
FED Tax|1.7|10.1|
FICA|6.2|6.2|
Medicare|1.4|1.4|
CA TAX|????|1.1|
CA DI/UI|0.9|0.9|


Note that there isn't a number for the CA Tax for my lowest check - this number is non-existent before my current largest paycheck, but has appeared on every check since then.

As seen by my table (which admittedly, looking at it now, was quite pointless seeing as only 2 things change), federal taxes deducted more than 5x the percentage of my paycheck on the larger one compared to the smaller one, while no other rate changed at all. Is this a normal thing, like the government takes a higher percentage if you earned more, or is this something I should be concerned about? And if it is something I should be concerned about, should I go to my store manager about it, or contact payroll directly?

Thank you for any advice, as I said before this is my first job so I'm a little clueless as to what is considered normal but I felt it a little foolish to blindly accept a larger deduction in my paycheck without any kind of explanation.

##Format for Petition to Intervene by Electronic Copy (Email)

##### To: Pamela.Monroe@sec.nh.gov

Subject: Petition to Intervene &amp; Investigate

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Re: Ethereum Foundation, Slock.it GBMH, and Bity SA Petition to Intervene

To Whom May Concern: 

[I/We] respectfully request to investigate and preferably intervene in the
illegal seizure of 7,000,000 original Ether by Ethereum Foundation, Slock.it 
GBMH, and Bity SA. Who tried to coordinate a sell of the illegally obtained
original Ether to coordinate crashing the price of the original Ethereum 
to convince users to adopt their new version of Ethereum that has features
to enable the Ethereum Foundation to change any past transaction, stop
smart contracts,  allow third parties to replace the code of a smart contract.

Due to gross negligence of Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit promoting and
trading a security created on their cryptocurrency Ethereum called DAO,
collaborating with the swiss SA Bity and the German company Slock.it created
a security contract and sold according to wikipedia 160,000,000 USD worth of the
newly created security for the cryptocurrency Ether.

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects

After being informed by security researchers a bug in the contract had been found
both Bity SA and Slock.it continued to promote the security, ignoring the risk.

If you look at the forum.daohub.org community you can clearly see, they see it as 
a security threads like ""Is profit from DAO investment unlikely?""

The contract they created can be found here: https://daohub.org

Source: https://forum.daohub.org/t/is-profit-from-dao-investment-unlikely/1466
Source: https://blog.slock.it/no-dao-funds-at-risk-following-the-ethereum-smart-contract-recursive-call-bug-discovery-29f482d348b#.4geeq3dny

Statistical analysis was done on purchasers of the DAO security, using blockchain
data. 

It was determined ""The wealthy few (top 1% of addresses) control over 55% of the 
voting power of proposals, while everyone who contributed 100 Ether or less (more than 66%) 
control barely over 2% of the total tokens.""

Source: https://medium.com/the-bitcoin-podcast-blog/looking-at-the-dao-address-distribution-part-1-f324e71381bf#.ivoddhx3y

After the exploit was reported and disregarded by the operators an anonymous entity
used the exploit to steal 1/3rd of the cryptocurrency that was used to buy the security.
Worth est. 50,000,000 USD worth of Ether at the time.

After the exploit was used, Vitalik Buterin, the leader of the Ethereum Foundation,
trying to encourage buying said ""@junseth I will provide my opinion in the way that 
@Truthcoin would approve of: I have been buying DAO tokens since the security news""
Source: https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/741832934814949377

Anyone with knowledge in finance would immediately ask, why is the leader of a project
that just had 50 million dollars worth of securities stolen, continue to buy those
securities? The answer is because Vitalik Buterin had not yet announced it, but had
already unilaterally decided that they would be creating a hard fork, essentially
creating a new version of the Ether cryptocurrency and modifying the contract to 
stop it, and replace it with different code. The original Ether would still exist,
but they would start a new one alongside it.

Invalidating the claim on their website that Ethereum:

""Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that 
run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or 
third party interference.""

Source: https://ethereum.org/

Despite pretending this decision was made by the community, the entire decision process
was centralized to the Ethereum Foundation internal private chats.

Later it would come out with chat logs between the exchange operators after the event and 
even more later in pull requests from the Foundation that internal chats had decided the 
entire thing long before it was announced. So when Vitalik Buterin was buying DAO tokens, 
he had already known he would soft or hard, regardless of the stakeholders. Chat log between 
Ethereum Foundation and Exchange Operators

You can validate the authenticity of this chat log easily by talking to the exchange operators,
they operate: http://kraken.com , http://poloniex.com, http://bitfinex.com http://yubi.com

Source: http://pastebin.com/raw/aMKwQcHR

Comments on code published clearly state that decision to implement the hard fork in the client 
used by roughly 95%+ would be defaulting to the option that benefited them the most financially.
The deciding factor it would be implemented because the majority of users do not even know how 
to change the setting.

""default behavior of Geth to be pro-fork as per internal discussions""
Source: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/2814

While they implemented this they started a back up plan where the Ethereum
Foundation, Slock.it GBMH and Bity SA worked anonymously as a hacking 
group named ""The White Hat Group"" or ""Robin Hood Group"" (WHG or RHG). They
captured 2/3rd of the Ether that was in the DAO security using the same 
exploit the original exploiter did.

This plays a very important part later but because there was a fork, advertising
efforts were made to brand the new copy of Ethereum with changes to one contract
as the real Ether while many people continued to use the same Ether The Ethereum
Foundation had sold them in the crowdsale.

The speculated reason for breaking their system, creating an entire new one is due the 
massive loss taken by the 1% of DAO owners.

The Ethereum Foundation actively promoted the DAO security on their blog, the
inventors of Ethereum both Gavin Wood and Vitalik Buterin  became ""curators"", 
claiming they would check every contract for errors making sure the DAO was
secure.The Ethereum Foundation having pitched sales of the DAO to wealthy 
investors from the financial sector had to answer to them when the contract
they were supposed to check, failed. Knowing they would lose all their 
instituational investment from the Financial industry they created a new 
Ethereum that was fundamentally different than Ethereum.

Some people in the Ethereum community began to call this new version Ethereum
hard fork, or ETF. This new ETF Ethereum had features that allowed the developers
to change old transactions, stop applications, and allowed third parties (them) 
to arbitrary change out the code in a contract. 

This made ETF distinctly different than the Ethereum that much of the community
continued using that they originally received directly from the Ethereum Foundation
during the crowdsale. It did not match any of the advertising about unstoppable 
applications, but the original Ethereum didn't have all these new features
that changed it into essentially the opposite of the description of Ethereum. So
people wanting unstoppable applications, with no third party interference and
censorship resistence just kept using Ethereum, trading it and building with it.

Then the Ethereum Foundation, Slock.it GMBH and Bity SA used the exploit used
by the hacker that led to the hard fork to get control of the 7,000,000 Ether
they wrestled from the hacker before the fork. Without telling anyone
they begin to launder the money. They did this by splitting the amount into
smaller amounts and sending it to random addresses they created before sending 
it to the markets.

But because it was done poorly it was quickly determined where it was going, to
currency exchanges to be sold.

Before some exchanges managed to freeze their accounts, they had successfully sold 
off large amounts of the stolen ETH to buy a new asset/security that was recently
created, which they hold significant portion of total security/token. 

Source: http://i.imgur.com/CBRclaF.jpg

The ""White Hat Group"" moved large amounts of the original Ether to exchanges and
coordinated a mass sell trying to crash the price. The goal was to crash the price
and convince people still using the original Ethereum that they had no choice. 

Leaked Skype chat logs from the private Ethereum Foundation internal chat were leaked
showing they were in fact colluding to control the price and force the community to follow the
decision they unilaterly made. If all the chat logs could be obtained from Skype
it would be very clear to what extent the collusion and illegal usage of the Ethereum
Foundation. 

In the private chat of the supposedly non-profit 
Ethereum Foudnation Skype channel, they are seen colluding control the price of the 
competing original Ethereum.

Chat logs from leaked Ethereum Foundation chat log indicating they were colluding to 
control the price of competing the original Ethereum.

Source: https://imgur.com/a/DHexx#4I1WrPY

In the chat logs, Jeffrey Wilcke and Fabian Vogelsteller can both be seen discussing 
ways to use the resources of the non-profit Ethereum Foundation to control the price 
of the original Ethereum and the new Ethereum. Owning significant amounts of the new
Ethereum.

This is not an isolated incident of Ethereum Foundation using their insider knowledge
from operating the non-profit to make purchasing decisions. Vitalik Buterin of 
the Ethereum Foundation, shortly after the hack but before he announced there 
would be a hard fork announced he was buying DAO security/tokens on Twitter.

This is the exact opposite of decentralized governance, depsite operating as a Swiss 
non-profit with money raised by the community crowd sale for the ""mission to promote
and support research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols"". 

Source: http://ethereum.org

There are likely more crimes actively happening but we only know of this because the
 currency exchange operators froze some of the ""White Hat Group"" accounts due to 
suspicious activity. This forced the ""White Hat Group"" to reveal themselves. It would
 be best to talk to Kraken.com and Poloneix.com, both exchanges who froze assets of 
the ""White Hat Group"" members after their attempts to launder and sell the cryptocurrency.

Ursium on reddit is Slock.it COO Stephan Tual creator of ""The DAO"" security, who originally 
designed with the intention to fund his businesses including Slock.it. Clearly named Ethereum 
Foundation devs as the first people on the list of the ""White Hat Group"" and included his  
own company Slock.it. Notice the ordering, the Ethereum Foundation is the first one listed
when talking about the ""White Hat Group"".

""Bit more info: this isn't spur of the moment. A lot of people have worked around the clock 
for several days now to prepare for this. The community (individuals from the eth foundation, 
devs, security experts, ethcore, slock, etc) all came together to organize a response, which 
is currently ongoing.""

Alex Van De Sande, or avsa on reddit and twitter, of the Swiss non-profit The Ethereum foundation 
is now denying any responsibility, or association, likely because of the legal fallout of recent 
events. But Alex was clearly involved with organizing the white hat group clearly was involved 
with organizing.

He was seen organizing on reddit.com/r/ethereum as seen in the screen shot below.

Source: https://d262ilb51hltx0.cloudfront.net/max/800/1*bY93URPw8UvehJXPcP2Qtg.jpeg

And more reddit posts with the titles ""We are doing a white hat attack on the DAO."" by avsa.

Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4p5zk9/we_are_doing_a_white_hat_attack_on_the_dao/

Alex of the Swiss non-profit the Ethereum foundation even goes further on reddit, tell people 
specifically to not to sell the DAO security they had previously promoted heavily on the Ethereum 
Foundation blog. Stating is actively being hacked by them. We here could mean presumably the 
""White Hat Group"" or the Ethereum Foundation.

""We are doing a white hat attack. More news to follow. Do not panic. Do not sell.""

https://np.reddit.com/r/TheDao/comments/4p60ie/we_are_doing_a_white_hat_attack_more_news_to/

He was seen organizing on twitter.com, claiming it was ""our white hat counter attack"", presumably 
he means the ""White Hat Group"" but the Ethereum Foundation. And from twitter he stated during the 
first use of the exploit by the ""White Hat Group"", clearly having insider knowledge by being in
the internal private Ethereum Foundation chat.

""alex van de sande ‏@avsa Jun 21 DAO IS BEING SECURELY DRAINED. DO NOT PANIC.""

""alex van de sande ‏@avsa Jun 21 I repeat. There was an attack on the DAO so we launched 
**our** white hat counter attack. More updates will follow"" (Emphasis is mine on 'our')

What is clear by all this that the recent claims that Alex Van De Sande has nothing to do with the
""White Hat Group"" is an obviously lie.

While there is no evidence he was active participant in the laundering or selling of the original
Ether cryptocurrency for the new version in collaboration Bity SA is not clear.

What is claer, is there is evidence from a leaked Ethereum Foundation skype chat that they were actively t
rying to manipulate the price of the original Ethereum cryptocurrency to force investors to buy the new
Ethereum they promoted. This original Ethereum cryptocurrency never stopped being used by its community,
even if the Ethereum Foundation actively tried to manipulate pulbic opinion.  The exact same cryptocurrency
they told exchanges was worthless, was being traded for almost 2 USD per coin. This was also the exact same
cryptocurrency they worked with Bity SA and Slock.it GMBH to steal millions of USD worth and dump on the market.

The primary purpose of the blockchain which cryptocurrencies are built on is to prevent modificaiton of past 
transactions to prevent double spending. The Ethereum Foundation added the ability to modify past transactions, 
to stop applications and allow third party interference so they could replace the DAO code. In doing that they
no longer were working on Ethereum, and Ethereum never stopped being used or valued even if they did not want
it to. They got upset and then commited theft, fraud to manipulate the markets and force their centralized 
unilateral decision on the whole community.

The Ethereum Foundation lied to exchanges, telling them no one is still using the original Ethereum network, 
despite massive arguments in the Ethereum forum ongoing for a month, where many people said they wanted to 
'stay on the original Ethereum. One person even wrote a manifesto, convincing others that staying is the 
only way for Ethereum, the one they were advertised and bought in the crowd sale, could continue existing.

Please start an investigation, please stop these three organizations from operating a corrupt system where
they take no risks, because they can rewrite history, where they get to decide for everyone which one is
""real"" even if others are actively using, trading and programming the original Ethereum all along.

Using an exploit to illegally seize the securities they created on the cryptocurrency Ethereum is theft.

We are sending this request to you, with copies to the SEC’s distribution list for this proceeding as noted
in the “cc” below.

[My/Our] particular rights, duties, privileges, immunities or other substantial interests that may be
affected if the SEC does not act immediately, start an investigation and work with Swiss Federal Police.

Swiss Federal office of police actively encourages people to report corruption. They have built a special
hotline, corruption they want reported includes:

""non-profit organisations (such as associations or foundations) in order to gain an unjustifiable material
or immaterial advantage.""

Report to Swiss Federal Police https://fedpol.integrityplatform.org/index.php?action=reportIncident&amp;type=report

Evidence that Ethereum has been abusing their non-profit for unjustifiable advantage is more than clear, as they
commit massive crimes hoping the system is too complex for them to ever be investigated.

My wife and I currently own a home in Denver and we are looking to move to a mountain town within the next 6-9 months.  We are currently DINK's (Dual Income, No Kids), we have both been contributing 20% to our 401k's, and we have an emergency fund of 2+ years worth of expenses if needed. I purchased our home in Denver using only my credit / income 2 years ago, we just Refi'd &amp; saved ourselves $300/mo by lowering our interest rate and removing PMI. I have no debt other than the house, and she has approx 20k in student loans we are focusing on paying off. We recently paid off her car which saves us $250/month so we've taken that along with the $300/month we saved by refi-ing and have began putting that extra $550 towards her lowest balance student loan.

I currently work as a Network Engineer and If we move, I wont be able to keep my job &amp; work from home since my company wont allow it. I'd probably have to take a tech support job working from home and get paid half my current salary. My wife will most likley be able to keep her current job and telecommute, otherwise she has already talked with her previous employer and there is good possibility she could go back to work for them and work from home. They are aware of this and have expressed interest in having her back. We would only make the move if one of us has a WFH opportunity with the same income we have now.

Our plan is to rent out our house in Denver since the market is hot right now. That way if things dont work out, we can always move back to the city and find jobs again, plus we wont have to try and buy back into Denver's crazy market. We'd rent in the mountains for a year and if it works out, we'd look at buying a house using my wife's credit / income. We are young (both 31) so we figured the time to do this is now, we're just nervous about leaving the stability &amp; comfort of our solid income in the city.

Forex,The FED’s problem with the US Treasury yield curve,"After FED Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s speech at Jackson Hole, where she and other FED officials suggested the case for a US interest rates hike by the end of 2016, U.S. Treasury yield curve (spectrum of all Treasury yields with respect to related maturities) has started to flatten. In other words, the gap between short- and long-term U.S. Treasury yields narrowed. An unusual phenomenon which may threat bank profitability further, as it reduces lenders’ net interest margin, the gap between the interest they earn on the loans they make and the interest they pay out.
The yield differential between the benchmark 30-year TMUBMUSD30Y, which rose on August 31 +1.35% and the two-year TMUBMUSD02Y, +1.47% Treasury note, has decreased below 1.45, as figure 1 shows (source: St. Luis FED). 
That is a problem the FED should seriously take into account as this phenomenon is something FED officials did not want to observe. Of course, the rise of the west-end side of the yield curve is due to the changed expectations by investors on the FED’s hike, which make Treasury bonds with lower maturity more expansive, which is, of course, bad news for the U.S. Treasury.

personalfinance,I need advice about a potential Spot Delivery Scam,"A few weeks ago I received a pre-approval offer on a car loan for up to $35,000 (or less depending on my credit score) from Capital One. I thought this was some what strange considering I have just recently graduated college and my only credit history is student loans and a  Capital One credit card that I rarely use. I also know that pre-approval offers are normally just bait in order to get you to apply only for them to accept you at a higher interest rate or not at all. But, I needed a new car, so I thought I ought to at least check out the dealership that was listed with the pre-approval offer and see if I could find a car I liked.
 

I went to the dealership over the weekend and spent several hours test driving cars, figuring out which ones would work with my pre-approval offer, etc. I found one I liked and the monthly payment would be about $330 a month which is right at my price point. After telling the dealer I would be happy to purchase the car, pending approval on financing, I signed some paper work and waited at the dealership to hear back from them about financing. After waiting in their lobby, my car dealer gets back to me and tells me I've been approved and we can move forward. 

I sign some  more paperwork, one of which said they made no verbal or written promises to me about the vehicle. My dealer told me this was about maintenance to the vehicle, or doing something like installing a navigation system or tinting the windows. IT was a hand written note on paper with the dealer's letter head and some boxes that could've been checked had they made any promises to me. I'm not 100% how legally binding this is. After signing this and the rest of the necessary paperwork, I signed a bill of sale along with the rest of the financial paperwork and was  given the keys to drive the car off the lot. I wasn't worried at the time and being somewhat naive, I assumed that everything would be fine despite my low credit score. Today, I received a call from my dealer and all he told me was that I needed to come in and sign more paperwork for the bank. I responded to him telling him I could come in after work to take a look at the paperwork.
 

I suspect that this is a spot delivery scam. I thought that it was a miracle at the time that I got approved, and at the time I accepted it, but it now seems clear to me that since it was Saturday the bank would take a couple of business days to evaluate my application before making a credit decision.
 

I did not put a down payment on the car or offer a trade in though, which makes me wonder if this is actually a spot delivery scam. I plan on going tonight, with a friend meeting me at the dealership. If they ask me to pay higher monthly payments, accept a higher interest rate, or to put a down payment on the car I plan on simply giving them the keys back and telling them I can't/won't do that. I'm assuming that this is a spot delivery scam, and without putting down a down payment or giving them a trade in, it doesn't seem like they have any leverage against me to sign a loan with a higher interest rate. I am in Kansas City, MO but I bought the car at a dealership in Kansas City, KS if that matters.
 

What I wanted to know is, if I just return the car to them, what would happen? Would I be in any legal trouble if I simply refuse to sign their offer that has a higher interest rate? Does living in MO and buying the car in KS change who I should be contacting if they decide to try to force me into a higher interest rate?


Thanks in advance.


**UPDATE:** So I went in yesterday evening. The dealership did have a new deal for me - I was losing my warranty for an overall lower monthly payment OR I could pay for the warranty separately for $250 down and then $90 a month for a warranty plan. I ended up taking the opportunity to back out, telling them the high APR and initial rejection by the bank has made me examine my situation closer and I've decided now is not a good time for me to purchase a car. Thanks everyone for the advice, it really helped calm my nerves and helped me figure out that purchasing the car was a BAD idea.",finance,1472747965
personalfinance,SmartyPig acquired by Sallie Mae,"Hey /pf/!

[As you can see here](http://blog.smartypig.com/read/introducing-the-new-smartypig/), SmartyPig announced that their accounts will be held with Sallie Mae starting this year. Although the official announcement has a very positive tone to it, I am not so sure this will be a positive move. For example, Simple partnered with Bancorp a few years back and not only was the transitional period a hellish few months for a fair number of users, but development on the website and mobile app seems to have slowed a great deal since then. I still enjoy the service, but sometimes miss the ""Wild West"" days.

I jumped on SmartyPig many years ago because at the time they had one of the best APY on offer--1% at the time. I also liked the fact that it was somewhat ""locked away""--I was learning to be financially responsible, and having my savings a bit more difficult to get to was helpful.

Since then, SmartyPig has basically remained static--they decreased the APY to 0.75% a year or two ago, but otherwise I haven't noticed any changes to the website or mobile app whatsoever.

With no experience with Sallie Mae, and no perspective on how they are with interest rates, customer service, and modern web and mobile development, I'm not sure what to expect here. It seems like this may be the time to consider alternative savings accounts. So I have a few questions for you all:

* Current/former Sallie Mae customers: what do you think of them?
* Current/former SmartyPig customers: what are you doing about this change?
* Everyone: what are the best/most recommended savings accounts (focus on strong APY and quality customer experience)? What makes that service stand out?

personalfinance,Refinancing Parent Plus Loans,"I just graduated law school with about 165k in student debt. I have several loans totaling to about about 100k in my own name through the government at an average of 6.8% interest (thought some are as low as 4).  The other roughly 65k in debt is in my parents name as parent plus loans - at 8+% interest. 

My parents didn't have a lot of money to put away for the my brother, sister, and I to go to college, and they aren't very financially savvy. They went to college by their parents co-signing loans for them, so that's essentially what they were able/willing to do for us.  When they signed up for the Parent Plus loans, they essentially thought they were just co-signing for us and that we would be the ones paying them back.  They didn't realize that the loans would continue in their name after we graduated - we were just happy to get loans for school at all because of their bad credit. So essentially, it was always the intention for us kids to pay for the loans. 

I got a good job out of school, making 95k plus bonuses and annual automatic increases, so I'm in a good position to start paying down the loans. Before I graduated, I talked to a financial counselor/planner through the law school, and she thought it would be best for me to do an income-based repayment plan for the federal loans in my name (which based on my income last year, would make the payments 0 for 1 year, essentially deferring them), and throw all extra money at the parent plus loans. If I scrimp and throw the bonuses at the parent plus loans, I think I can get rid of them in about 2 years, hopefully less. 

However, I've read about a few banks (SoFi, Darien Rowayton Bank, Earnest, Common Bond, Citizens Bank) that will refinance Parent Plus loans to the students.  I feel like with my job and relatively good credit, I could probably be approved by these banks, but I don't know if I should?  I keep hearing not to consolidate and refinance, because then I couldn't do the whole snowball/avalanche thing to pay them down.  But also wouldn't it presumably lower my interest rate and monthly payment so that I could potentially put something toward the 100k loans too in order to keep the interest from skyrocketing?  Also, if I refinance into my name and pay it off quickly, wouldn't that help my credit score and maybe my parents' (by showing I can pay down debt quickly and getting some debt off the books for them right away)? 

Does anyone have any experience refinancing parent plus loans through these banks?  Any input would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1472752756

personalfinance,"Would love some PF guidance on financial situation, with baby on the way!","**A little background info:** 32F, 7 months pregnant, married almost 2 years to 34M. A year ago, we moved from Boston, MA to Portland, OR.

In my mid-20s, I got married and divorced. It was a pretty bad situation, there was no co-mingling of finances, and I handled the whole divorce myself, so we left the marriage with what we brought in and no further contact/payments to each other. However, I really struggled on my own, and ended up racking up some credit card and other debt (approx. 15-20K) trying to get back on my feet. 

Met current husband, fell in love, he moved to the US from Canada to go to school for a specialized trade and to date me. We got married almost 2 years ago, very happy together, 7 months pregnant, and we have made a huge improvement over our living situation, debt situation, etc.

My credit score is now around 815, his is about 780 due to piggybacking him on my long-term credit card accounts to build his credit as a new permanent resident in the US. 

I basically just wanted to get some fresh eyes on our situation, and get recommendations for where we should go from here. We had a consultation with my father's financial advisor 6 months ago, and he felt we were on a good path. I just want to know if there's anything major that we're missing, or any suggested tricks to improve things even more. My school loans are high due to just law school, but unfortunately I graduated in 2009 when the legal industry sort of went to hell and I really disliked it and didn't want to go into practice, so I currently work in a related career with better work/life balance, and some potential for growth but it's unlikely I'll ever make a salary equivalent to big law folks. 

Edit: I should add that I have had two career jumps in the last 3 years, going from $56K to $91K, so I'm working my way up, but the current salary is just in the last year, otherwise I probably would have a lot more saved/paid off. 

Oh, and with baby on the way, we're looking at $1K a month in daycare costs. Husband and I also commute together, so we save on gas/car mileage that way, and baby drop-off and pick-up will be a part of that now. We've got most of baby's other first year's worth of expenses either taken care of or saved for already.

We'd love to buy a house in the next few years, but we feel pretty overwhelmed/terrified of the increasing housing prices in Portland, and whether my loans will make that completely impossible. 

So PF, please let me know what you think, give us some advice!

**Breakdown of financials:**

Income:

- My salary is $91K a year, with around $4K-$5K in bonuses, and side income around $2K. My job is Corporate/Legal in nature.

- Husband makes $15 per hour; works 40hrs a week, going forward this would mean around $30,000 a year. Has potential to negotiate raises fairly frequent and has a lot of potential income growth. He’s in a skilled trade, and is only a year out of school, started at $11 an hour and moved up to $15 an hour within a year, and Boss loves him and considers him invaluable.

Monthly budget: $4,074

- Student loans: $1015

- Rent: $1855

- Car payment: $404

- Groceries: $500

- Other misc. bills: $300

Cash:

- $10K emergency fund at Ally Bank.

- Had $6K baby savings fund, which is now at around $4,900. This is for all baby purchases and hospital bills, etc.

- $2,525 additional savings at Ally Bank. Expecting to add an excess of $2,300 in September to this as well.

- We try to save at least $1K a month, but miscellaneous expenses have been hitting our monthly spending lately.

Credit cards are all paid off, with around $21K spending limit.

401K's:

- Previous employer 401K at Fidelity: $18,905

- Current employer 401K at Fidelity: $11,082 (putting it 5% to meet company match)

Student loans (all mine, husband has no loans):

- Federal loans - $139,639. I went on IBR due to divorce and unemployment, and now somewhat trapped on IBR. Payments are $624 a month. 

* Private loans: One loan for $28K at 4.436% variable with $230/month payment; another for $1,557 at 5% with $43.43/month payment, and third is $1,865 at 10.5% with $50/month payment. (I have been throwing extra money at the 10.5% interest loan over the last year and have brought it down from $10K. Hoping to have it paid off soon.)

Cars:

-Own outright a 2009 Volvo C30, valued around $9,500 due to very low miles.

-Financed a 2016 Mazda CX-5 Touring, owe $25,499 at 3.99% with $404/month payment. Planning to refi this in a couple months at credit union with a 1.9% interest rate and a shorter loan length, so payments will be around $415/month.",finance,1472753685
personalfinance,Inherited ~$115k from my dad. Please help me weigh my options.,"Hi Personal Finance!

I've read the FAQs, the windfall wiki, and even hit the search button (I plagiarized this intro from another post), but I still am curious what people would suggest in my specific situation. There's a lot of pretty smart people here, so I'm trying to get various opinions.

Personal Details:

* Inherited about $115K, ~$103k traditional IRA &amp; ~$12k Roth IRA both with Vanguard
* I'm 33, with a wife and 2 kids (10 &amp; 5). I make ~$70k before taxes. 
* Wife is staying at home to raise the kids, so no significant income from her.
* Wife has zero retirement savings, so mine will need to cover us both.
* Single income household, and my job security is rock solid (Federal gov't employee)

Here's the financial details-

Assets and Positives:
* Good credit score in the low 800s.
* My current housing/utilities, paid by employer for next 2.5 years while living in Europe. When we move back to US, we will lose this benefit
* My rental house back in US, est value ~$260k, brings in $1100/month rent, which covers mortgage and gives me about $50/month profit
* TSP (federal gov't equivalent to 401K) balance of about ~$48k (mix of Trad. and Roth), FERS pension plan. I put in 5% of my salary to get full 5% match each biweekly pay period, but no more. Anticipate another 25ish years in the workforce to build this up.
* ~$2,600 in Roth IRA with Vanguard (no recent contributions)
* Term life insurance on me ($800k) and the wife ($250k)
* 529 accounts for both kids. ~$3,300 balance for the 10 yr old. ~$2,800 balance for the 5 yr old. Contributing $130/ month to 10 yr old. Contributing $140/month to 5 yr. old
* 10 yr old also inherited ~$25k, which is currently sitting in a savings acct 
Debts and “Liabilities”:
* Owe ~$3K on CC @ 0% for 12 months (won't have any problem paying it off before 0% APR expiration)
* Owe 151K at 3.875% on rental home
* Owe 28K at 2.49% on a car loan (I know how PF feels about car loans, please keep negative comments to yourself)
* No Emergency Fund (rectifying this is obviously a priority) 
My options (according to my limited knowledge):
* ""Stretch Method"" Mostly ignore the inheritance while taking RMDs. RMDs this year: ~$1900 for Trad. IRA &amp; ~$215 for Roth IRA. I could put those amounts to the start of my emergency fund. The Trad. IRA would grow to a pretty nice size by the time I'm retirement age, but the growth of the Roth IRA would be fairly limited because I can't add to it.  
* ""Stretch"" the Trad. IRA, only taking RMDs. Cash in the Roth IRA and use the ~$12k to create instant emergency fund of almost 3 months of expenses. This was my original plan before having a brief discussion with a person at Vanguard. 
* Vanguard suggested maxing my contributions to my TSP to $18k, and using the IRAs to replace my income. This would effectively allow me to roll the inherited IRAs (which I can't contribute to) into my retirement account and be able to take greater advantage of compounding. I would also have the flexibility of using some of the inheritance for short or medium term savings. The drawback being trying to figure out the tax implications. I would obviously not want to inadvertently bump myself into a high tax bracket.  
I like the suggestion given to me by Vanguard but I think I should consult a tax professional and/or financial adviser before moving forward with the plan. Unfortunately, because we currently live in Europe, I don't know where to begin in finding those people. The sad irony of this, is my dad would have been a perfect person to ask about this.

personalfinance,I need advice about keeping debt spread across 4 credit cards or if I should use balance transfer option and put all debt onto one card.,"So hopefully brief overview. When I was younger I made a lot of poor life decisions with a very high interest credit card. Over the years I have gotten rid of that card using balance transfers, followed by more bad life decisions on lower interest credit cards. 

I can very happily say, I learned my lesson. I have not used a credit card for any new purchases in almost two years.  I'm still paying for it. I'm in my mid 20's with four credit cards. I have never missed a payment on any of them. 

Now I'll get to my point. I logged in to pay my bills and saw that I have a balance transfer available on my card with the largest line of credit. 
Options for this
      - 0% Promo APR for 9 months with 3% transfer fee
      - 5.99% Promo APR for 18 months 0% transfer fee
On this card I currently owe $9,309.70 With interest rate of 19.24% Total credit line of $19,700. 

Other card balances.

Card one - Owed - $1,736.96 / Interest - 26.99%

Card two - Owed - $736.86 / Interest - 23.24%

Card three - Owed 2,534.22 / Interest - 17.24%

My main question is, would it make more sense to keep all of my cards separate making slightly more then minimum payments on each of them every month until paid off or just transfer all of them onto my card, that I have a balance transfer available on? Also open to ideas of a lower interest way to consolidate all of my credit card debt into one monthly bill payment.",finance,1472760473

personalfinance,"New to debt, Need some advice on efficiency","Hello PF!!! 

Before i start, I know i'm an idiot for getting myself into this situation.  I was not responsible and i have learned my lesson. 

I had a couple credit cards (2) and i was just getting into credit.  I had no balance and paid it off in full every month.  I kept up these habits for over a year, and found myself with a huge available credit line, and a 720+ credit score.  I was working a job where i was making okay money for a kid right out of high school.  

Well i wanted to go a different path, and enlisted in the Navy.  With a few months to prepare for my new job, i saved up some money, and quit my job to spend time with family.  The money i saved was enough to pay for car payments for 9 months (I was leaving in 6, but i'd be getting paid enough to make all my payments while in) and everything seemed good.  

After enlisting, my Chief told me to get an account with USAA and all the benefits, and he was right, USAA is awesome.  They sent me a letter about their credit card, and thought hey, why not?? Well i got it...with a $7,000 limit, higher than both my others combined ($3000, and $3500) 

I decided that it would be worth the up front cost to take one more college course that would push me up to an advanced paygrade before i left, so i signed up for an 8 credit course. But it was expensive, so i slapped the $1500 bill to the credit card. Then the books, then lunch at school...

Then i started getting irresponsible.  Going out to eat with the girl friend, Christmas came up, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Guy's nights... Long story short, i used my credit cards for everything with the notion that i'd be paying it off no problem after i leave for the military.  

Well i got out of hand, and i'm an idiot, i know, but i pushed my one card to $2500 and the other to $3100.  They were both interest free until June, and figured i'd be gone in May, i'd pay the price but it'd all be okay.  

Until my paperwork got muddled up and wound up having to delay my departure until September. I got a job making similar wage to what i was doing before, and began paying them down...

So last month when i got to pay the monthly payment, it went from 35/month to 86 MINIMUM.  I shat a brick.  Reality hit.  The card's 24.99% interest was at my door ready to smack me in the face.  So this morning, i got the mail and it was a CITI pre-selected junk BS that said something about balance transfer.  I looked into it. 

Then thought, instead of paying these 2 cards down at their respective interest rates, why not consolidate?  My USAA card has the option to transfer up to $2500 from another card, and my USAA interest rate is only 14%.  Theres' a $75 fee, but i think it's a good idea.  

Just looking for some advice if there's something ive missed or if this is a bad idea.  Thanks!! 

TL;DR Racked up tons of balance like an idiot, Should i pay $2500 @ 24.99%  and $3100 @ 14% separately, or Transfer the $2500 to the other card for a fee and pay it down just on the one card?",finance,1472766128

My 15kw system cost is $45,000 should I ask the installer to help with the attorney fees (up to certain amount)?  

Would like to hear how others have dealt with this.  
You're probably better off just installing more panels on the backside (I assume the north side) of the roof to account for the lower production.  The money spent paying for an attorney will probably be more than the extra panels.  Plus, the attorney's fees are not subject to a 30% federal tax credit.

My concern is that while I attack my smallest debt, and pay the minimum on my medical, I'll be generating too much interest on that balance. 

When I'm able to finish paying these off, my car will be the priority.
Is this plan the best possible way for me to pay it off? Will I be wasting money paying each month to my medical without it actually going away?

I have a good credit score and am curious about applying for a card with a lower interest rate that will let me transfer my credit card and medical balance over.  

Any advice would be appreciated!

personalfinance,Need urgent car finance advice!,"First off I know you guy are going to think I'm completely stupid, but I'm a stupid guy asking for help.

I was trying to get a car for a week and a half and got turned down by everyone because I have no credit history, a short job history and a derogatory my mom put on there when I was 18. Finally A car dealership called me and said they could get me financing with my grandma as cosigner, so I thought I'd give it a shot and see what they have for me. The salesman had me come to the dealership and test drive a car they had just received as a trade in. The first thing I noticed was that the back bumper had a paint scuff and the salesman said ""dont worry about that, I'll have that taken care of next week"" so I thought it was nothing to worry about and I got in and everything worked inside and drove well and when we got back to the dealership he rushed me inside and said they need to taker he car to get detailed. So we go inside and he sees what kind of financing he can get me and he comes back to me with 20% interest rate on this car which he still hasn't given me a price on. I ask what the total cost of the car is and he says 13.9k and I tell him that way more than I'm willing to spend and he pressures me saying it is a good deal on the car and that its my only option. I left the dealership and went back to work. Later that day he texted me saying he got my interest down to 16.9% and my payment to $300 a month. I thought that was okay so I though about. I decided to go back to the dealership that night and I asked to look at the car again and he said it was being serviced so I couldn't see it. I ask if there was any damage to the vehicle and he said ""no it's in perfect condition because it was on lease and any damage has to be fixed perfectly before its turned in"" and then I look at the carfax and it showed no accidents and one owner. So I thought it was good. So we sat down and went over numbers. This is when he brings out the out the door cost of the car of 15k and I am like that's way too high for me and again he pressures me this time into tears and I signed the paper. After a bit of paper work he finally lets me and my girlfriend go see the car, but we end up not being able to see the car because the door to the service building is locked. So he says I can come pick up the car at 3pm tomorrow after its serviced. I come to pick it up and drive off and stop down the road to look at it and notice that the back ""paint scuff"" is actually a crack in the bumper, and there is also a long dent on the bottom of one of the doors. I about cried and got so upset. And also the gas mileage of the car is suppose to be 30-40 and it is reading that I get 13-15. I want to return this horrible car and horrible financing and don't know how. My grandma (the cosigner) still hasn't signed her paperwork.

personalfinance,The best way to prepare for future college debt?,"Hey guys, I’m going to be transferring from a community college to a four year university next year and would like some advice on my financial plan for the future. 

I’m currently planning to apply to three different public schools which cost around $25,000, $27,000, and $35,000 each (costs include tuition + room and board + other expenses). I could attend one of the local universities to save money but I choose not to because I don’t want to live with family anymore and I would like to have the experience of living on a college campus (If I don’t do this I will without a doubt regret it in the future).

My parents make around $100,000 combined per year and have already told me a year ago that they’ll only be able to cover around $4000 for tuition because of my mom’s and sister’s loans that they had to take out for college (as well as other expenses). I’m very grateful that they are willing to contribute to my education costs because I fully understand that they don’t have to. With that being said, I still have to account for the rest of the $21,000 - $31,000 that I’ll owe.

I’m currently filling out scholarships and plan to use those awards + my current job wages on living expenses and books (I’ll save any extra for loan repayment after graduation). Hopefully I’ll qualify for the California Middle Class Scholarship but I can’t depend on that as of now so I’m planning as if I’ll have no federal aid assistance.   

I’ll have to use loans to pay for the remainder so I plan to take out  a combination of federal and private loans to pay for everything. I just got my first credit card around three months ago and am paying everything off in full each month as well as staying under the 30% utilization amount in order to try to get my credit score as high as possible for lower interest rates next year. I currently have accounts open with Wells Fargo and my local credit union so hopefully that’ll help me get better rates than if I wasn’t banking with them. I was even thinking about opening another account with the other local credit union because credit unions usually have better interest rates than large banks (right?). 

I’d also like to mention that I’m an accounting major and the median starting salary for the schools that I’m applying to is around $50,000 - $55,000 after graduation (the schools that I’m applying to are targeted by the big 4 accounting firms as well as other smaller firms throughout the year while my local schools aren’t). I am confident that I will be able to pay off the debt within a reasonable amount of time after graduation but would still like to try to avoid as much debt as possible. The military is also not an option.

She now has no savings, and can not afford to live there anymore so she's moving in with my family. We're trying to decide if it's best for her to rent the condo out and keep the investment property, or sell it now and cut her losses. 

The condo is in an area that will appreciate in value nicely. 

She owes 255K on the loan, and is paying $1983 per month on the mortgage and $257 per month on the condo fee. The interest rate on the loan is 5.25% and she has very good credit. We're considering helping her refinance to get a better rate and monthly payment. 

The condo is probably now worth at least $275K, maybe closer to $280K. A real estate agent friend who has rentals in the area has said she rents those condos for around $1900 a month. 

Her living with us is not a long term plan. We'd like for her to stay for about two years, build up her savings, and then release her back into the wild. That's one reason we'd like her to keep the condo.

For example, my loans total = 50,000.  But,for some odd reason they are under 5 year plans and I am paying about 900 a month on loans.  I can not do this any longer.  So to me consolidating them to say about a 20 year plan for about 350 a month and doubling up on my principle would make it a 10 year loan.  

Now my question, which companies do you suggest I look for in consolidating the loans?  Are there better than others??  Lowest interest rates?  

I am new to this stuff and just looking for some advice and maybe some consolidating firms (If that is what they are called)  to maybe set some stuff up today.

personalfinance,I'm struggling to calculate how much interest will accrue on my credit card balance,"I have a payment of about $500 that will be due on 9/20, and I'll be starting a new job sometime around then, as well. I was considering holding off on the payment for about a month or so until I start making some money from my new job, but am unsure of how to calculate how much interest I will have to pay by then.

The APR on my credit card is 18%

So is the calculation (500 x 0.18)/12 = $7.5 interest owed after a month?

If so, that small amount would totally be worth the breathing room that the extra month would allow. I've earned $13 in cashback bonuses in this month alone.

So long as I make the minimum payment, holding off for a month won't negatively impact my credit score, correct?

Thanks! You guys are lifesavers.

Edit: I think one mistake I made in my calculation is that I didn't account for the compounding of the interest. If I understand it correctly, the way it works with credit cards is that the 18% APR should actually be permuted into a daily interest rate, right? So the amount will actually be larger than $7.50 if I take that into account. That's the part that I have a hard time calculating.

From what I gather on the IRS website there is an agreement between the U.S and France that says income for interns isn't subject to income tax which is good news but my employer is telling me that they still need to take the money out from my stipend (roughly 400 a month if I count everything) and I'll be able to get most of it back in late 2017.

Back ground:

- Old salary: 46k plus around 8k-10k from side gig.  Plus benefits
- New salary: 65k no benefits
- Living in California, HCOL area
- Haven't moved tax brackets
- Tax rate % up 5% from 25%(old job) to 30% (new job)
- Filing status has not changed: single, no dependents

My thoughts:

- I did something wrong on my W4?
- Maybe I actually need to pay more in tax?  This one seems unlikely to me, still same filing status and tax bracket.

Other:

- My federal income tax literally doubled
- So did my state income tax

Overall I'm not too concerned.  I guess it's better to overpay than underpay!  Plus it's easy in my line of work to find side gigs.

personalfinance,I think paid too much for my house,"Hi all, as a recent first time home buyer, I was intimidated by the process, didn't negotiate well, and trusted too much in my Realtor, who, critically I think, was acting as a double agent for the seller and myself, and thus had even less incentive than a Realtor usually does to fight for a lower purchase price. Very stupid on my part. So, about 18 months later, I'm realizing that I almost certainly paid too much. I haven't had it officially appraised, but various real estate websites list the approximate value at less than I owe, so I may be technically underwater in my mortgage.


Somewhat related, I have very little equity in the home so I'm afraid I won't qualify for re-financing. I can afford the mortgage payments, but it's the absolute maximum of what I can comfortably afford, and of course I would love a lower payment. As I said, I didn't do a good job through the buying process and I'm now concerned I could have received a lower interest rate if I had shopped around and pushed for it. 


My question: are these major problems right now? If so, what actions can I take? Thank you!",finance,1472836876

personalfinance,Is there any reason I should not have a cosigner?,"Hi PF,

I know how everyone here feels about cosigners, and I agree. However, I am in need of purchasing a car about 6 months before I had planned to (mine had to be scrapped). I have about $2k in savings, but I have a 65 mile/day commute for work, so I need something a bit more reliable. I am looking to finance something $9k-$10k, very reasonable and doable in my situation.

I've been busting my tail to improve my credit for the last several months, and according to CK, it has already improved about 70 points (woohoo!), but it's still only in ""fair"" range. I was pre-approved through a local credit union, but at 9.15%. I could always take that loan, and then refinance in 6-9 months when my credit has improved (I will have all CC debt paid off by April) and remove him from the loan. After the CC debt is paid, I plan on aggressively paying off the car (I estimate about 2 years).

However, my father has offered to cosign on the loan in order to get me a better interest rate.

I have a secure job, as well as a standing job offer with a previous employer should it come to that. I can absolutely afford the car payment without stretching myself. I have $1800 in my FSA for medical emergencies. I understand that my father would be responsible for the auto loan if I don't pay it, and so does he. I don't foresee myself ending up in that situation. If all else truly fails, I can live with my mom rent-free and work minimum wage and still make the payments.

Is there any reason I should NOT let him cosign?",finance,1472838195
personalfinance,Need help with retirement projections,"I've got somewhat of an intricate personal budget going on MS Excel and, recently, decided I'd like to create two different tables/line charts to lay out my 1) retirement fund exponential growth up until standard 59.5 retirement age and 2) exponential decrease (or sustain) after I begin withdrawing. I'm able to play around with the numbers freely and, as I'm still learning about growth and investment, I'm not too sure what realistic values would look like for me as far as interest rated before/after retirement and income/withdrawal rates. 

Specifics:

Spreadsheet #1 = retirement growth

Spreadsheet #2 = retirement withdrawal

- I'm currently making 46k/yr and have, for the purpose of filling in data, assumed this annual income for the rest of my life

- I have 3 curves, emulating growth at 6%, 6.5%, and 7% interest

- I'm currently contributing 20% of my 46k (between IRA/401k) and have assumed the 20% contributions will remain consistent until retirement

&amp;nbsp;

**QUESTIONS**

- for Spreadsheet #1/2: are 6/6.5/7% interest rates reasonable interest rates for forecasting?

- For spreadsheet #2: the purpose of this spreadsheet is to play around with the **residual interest rate** and **annual withdrawal rate** upon retirement. What is a reasonable interest rate to assume that my funds will continue to build on after I begin to make withdrawals? Right now I'm assuming an annual interest rate of 3%. Is this high? Low? Normal?

- This is all just for my own fun and games but I'm hoping to learn more of the value of time and money through this exercise. Anything else I could implement or take into consideration?

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Help,"Thanks in advance for your help!

I'm considering a mortgage refinance, out of an FHA loan into a conventional mortgage. Here are the details:

Current mortgage is a 30-year FHA loan.


Item | Amount
---|---
Priciple remaining | 111,400
Interest rate | 3.75% fixed
Principle &amp; interest | 557.10
Taxes &amp; insurance| 190.85
PMI | 114.94
Total monthly payment | 862.89

The new proposed mortgage is as follows:



Item | Amount
---|---
Loan Amount | 115,150
Interest rate | 4.25% fixed
Principle &amp; interest | 566.47
Taxes &amp; insurance | 190.85
Total monthly payment | 757.32

Closing costs after lender credits are $3,335 and are included in the new loan amount.

Given that I am considering selling this home within a couple of years... I am thinking that I should NOT take this deal. I assume that building the closing costs into the loan puts me in a worse situation since I'll be paying interest on that amount as well.

Am I thinking this through correctly? I'd really like to get out of that FHA insurance, but I don't think it makes sense if it means $3000+ in closing costs and 0.50% increase on my interest rate.",finance,1472840772

personalfinance,"Need advice on using $5,730 education award toward students loans.","I recently completed a year of national service, and I received an education award of $5,730 to use towards loans or grad school. Whatever I use of this is will be considered ""income"" and will be taxed come tax season, but considering the fact that 2016 is probably the year where I make the least that I'll ever make, it's probably best to use it all this year. Gets taxed the least and I'll be able to get myself going with some lower student loan payments. 

In total, I owe $842 to one organization #1, and $18,868 to organization #2. All federal loans.

Payments to organization #1: $40/month
Payments to organization #2: $200/month

**Loan Details** (the ones I'm thinking of using the education award to):

*Organization #1*
Perkins Loan: $842, principal of $900, 5%

*Organization #2*    
Direct Sub Loan: $5454, principal of $5500, 4.66%    
Direct Unsub Loan: $2077, principal of $2200, 4.66%    
Dir Sub Loan: $2468, principal of $2443, 3.86%    
    

So here's what I'm thinking. Pay off the Perkins loan ($842) completely with my education award, and that's a $40 bill I don't have to worry about anymore each month.    
    
Then I have two options with the remaining $4888 of my education award.     
**Option A** - Put it towards the $5454 loan (4.66%). It leaves me with $566 to pay of on my own, but once I have that loan gone it will save me the most in the long run.     

**Option B** - Pay off the $2077 loan (4.66%) and the $2468 (3.86%), and put the leftover $343 towards the $5454 loan or just my monthly payments. Those two smaller loans accrue less interest and it saves me less in the long run, but it helps my credit more since I've paid off 3 loans instead of 2. I also don't have to deal with the remaining $566 on option A. 

I called up the loan company and they said paying off the loan in option A will drop me to $143/month, while option B will drop me to $146/month... so virtually the same. They also advised I do an income based payment plan, which will drop my payments to around $80/month after option A or B (I also don't plan on paying the minimum each month, but lower required payments are a nice thing to have if shit hits the fan). 

Should I go with option A or B? Personally, I prefer A, but then I just have to figure out the best way of paying off the remaining $566 (one big chunk out of my savings, pay extra each month towards it, etc.)",finance,1472843260

**URL**:   [Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjH6pHSQQ68)   
**Originally posted**: Aug 29, 2016  
**Original publisher**: [WEF](https://www.weforum.org/)  
  
Smart contracts came up on a recent WEF report and YouTube clip, the full 130pg report is linked after the transcript below. The transcript and 35 quoted smart contract report references are listed here as a means of reference and orientation. The focus of this post is what it means to have smart contracts implemented in the financial sector.   
  
###Transcription  
  
“What would happen if **your country** issued a **digital currency** like Bitcoin?  
The Bank of England **modelled** an economy with a **digital currency** equal to **30% GDP**.   
The results suggest a **3%** annual **increase to GDP**.   
An increase of **$80 billion** to the **UK GDP**  
The **simulated** digital currency was subjected to **typical real world** business **cycles**.  
One explanation was that the central bank's digital currency **reduced** both **interest rates** and the **cost of financial transactions**.  
The study found digital currencies would **give governments** another **tool** to **control inflation** and **interest rates**.  
Payments and **record keeping** in digital currencies would be **decentralised**.  
**Blockchain** is the **technology** behind **digital currencies** like Bitcoin, allowing **broad access** to electronic ledgers to process financial **Transactions**.  
Blockchain allows people to **bypass traditional transaction** brokers thereby **lowering** or **eliminating fees**.  
**Banks** could also **save** on transaction **fees**.  
Analysts predict savings of **$20 billion annually** by **2020**.  
**50** leading **banks** have announced **blockchain initiatives**  
Investors have pumped more than **$1 billion** into **start-ups** formed to exploit **blockchain** for **business**”.  
*FIN*  
  
*My take on this is that blockchain will stay predominantly decentralised whereas smart contracts will be used by regulating bodies as the tool to keep track of taxes and such?*  
  
**************
  
Delving deeper, it is worth reading the full WEF report on ‘The future of financial infrastructure’ released August 2016. [PDF](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_future_of_financial_infrastructure.pdf)  
   
**Smart contracts** are referred to 35 times in the report. It occurred to me later that if i dropped the ‘s’ would increase from 35 to 90 term references. I am not quoting 90 paragraphs here ;P check out the PDF link above if you do not want to double read the following 35 references. 

1. Implementing new financial infrastructure will require changes to existing regulations,standards of practice, and the creation of new legal and liability frameworks. Specifically, the implementation of **smart contracts** will require additional stakeholder alignment and governance considerations.  
2. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) can facilitate ‘regulatory-inclusive’ business models, in which regulators utilize **smart contracts** to verify transactions / deals in real-time.  
3. While **smart contracts** enable autonomous agreement execution between parties, they rely on architects and security experts to build business rules that prevent malicious behaviour, complete thorough end-to-end testing and verify all code.  
4. **Smart contracts** can capture obligations and drive reporting, minimizing operational errors and accelerating outcomes.  
5. **Smart contracts** can automate claims processing through third -party data sources and codification of business rules.  
6. Forming syndicates through **smart contracts** can increase speed and provide regulators with a real-time view to facilitate AML/KYC.  
7. **Smart contracts** can facilitate real-time loan funding and automated servicing activities without the need for intermediaries.  
8. Storing financial details on the ledger can automate the creation and management of credit facilities through **smart contracts**.   
9. Utilizing **smart contracts** to automate regulator reporting can minimize the need for point-intime stress tests, reduce market volatility and, ultimately, increase “CoCo” bond issuance.   
10. **Smart contracts** can alert regulators when loan absorption needs to be activated, minimizing need for point-in-time stress tests.  
12. **Smart contracts** can automate the validation of votes and increase the transparency of counting votes (e.g. end-to-end confirmation).   
13. Executing reporting activities through **smart contracts** can facilitate the automated creation of quarterly and annual findings.  
14. Utilizing DLT and **smart contracts** to facilitate post-trade activities can disintermediate processes, reduce counterparty and operational risk and, potentially, pave the way for reduced settlement time.  
15. **Smart contracts** can simultaneously transfer equity and cash in real time, reducing the likelihood of errors impacting settlement.  
16. **Smart contracts** enable the real-time reporting of asset history and the enforcement of regulatory constraints.  
17. Facilitating clearing and settlement processes via **smart contracts** can eliminate need for intermediaries and reduce settlement time.  
18. through **smart contracts**, foreign exchange can be sourced from participants willing to facilitate the conversion of fiat currencies.  
19. Development of digital obligations: **smart contracts** can be used to capture obligations among FIs in order to ensure that appropriate funds are exchanged, eliminating operational errors.  
20. Asset records must migrate to the DLT to allow **smart contracts** to consume reliable and updated asset information directly over the ledger in the case of a claim.   
21. If asset provenance and loss information are kept off the ledger among different players, **smart contracts** will lose their effectiveness to process claims automatically.  
22. Claims automation: Claims processing can be automated using trusted third-party data sources and the codification of business rules in **smart contracts** on the ledger.  
23. **Smart contracts** will be key: Insurance policies can be managed using **smart contracts** on DLT, capturing coverage conditions, and syndicate insurance agreements or insurer reinsurer agreements.  
24. ..   
25. **Smart contracts** eliminate the need for a third party to fund the loan, disburse funds and facilitate the loan servicing process.  
26. Servicing disintermediation: activities are executed via **smart contracts**, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries.  
27. Manage loan life cycle via **smart contracts**: Syndicated loans can be managed using **smart contracts** on DLT – KYC verification, due diligence review, underwriting automation, loan funding, payment dissemination, etc. – as the loan moves through the syndicated loan life cycle.  
28. ..   
29. To ensure **smart contracts** containing the details of the financing agreement flow through the trade finance process, FIs and technology providers must ensure the ledger is interoperable with many different platforms.  
30. Manage letters of credit via **smart contracts**: Letters of credit can be managed using **smart contracts** on DLT – capturing shipment details, financial information and payment data as the letter of credit moves through the trade finance process.  
31. ..   
32. Automated validation: **smart contracts** can ensure that voting is aligned to share ownership at the time of the vote.  
33. FIs and technology providers will need to collaborate to ensure flexibility and minimal downstream impacts to **smart contracts**.   
34. **Smart contracts** ensure the simultaneous transfer of equity and cash between custodian banks on behalf of all investors.  
35. As various servicing processes occur, **smart contracts** notify custodian banks and investors in real time.  
Since **smart contracts** execute commands in real time, batching trades with some predefined frequency may require customization.

personalfinance,Rollover IRA to Money Market as Emergency Fund,"Hello all.

Long time lurker, first time poster. Quick bit of background. I've been unemployed for about a year now. Had a nice little emergency fund that has been exhausted. I'm job hunting like a fiend, and we've trimmed expenses down to the bone, but I still feel pretty naked without *something* as backstop in case the roof gets a leak or the car blows up. 

As it turns out, I have about about 8K sitting in a rollover IRA from 2 jobs ago. It hasn't been earning squat anyway, so my thought was to transfer it to money market fund (likely Vanguard Prime - VMMXX), so that I would have some liquidity in the event of an emergency. We get a pretty good interest rate (1.75% currently) on our checking account from our local CU, so the long term plan would be to fill that back up with emergency funds.  Once that is in place, I would likely transfer the money market funds to something with better returns, lower liquidity.

But after searching this sub and the internet, I still have a few of questions I'd like to clarify.
1) It seems like the steps are: open Vanguard account, transfer original Rollover IRA to VMMXX. Is it really that simple?
2) What would the tax implications be if I did have to take a withdrawal? Standard early penalty?
3) Once the money market account is no longer needed, could I really transfer those funds to another IRA, invested in a different fund?

personalfinance,ATTENTION SMALL eBAY SELLERS!!! Why you need to report your PayPal Transactions! (Almost) A Tale of Woe,"Hello all! First time posting on this subreddit, but I've been reading a bit here and there ever since I've had my ""problem.""

So here is a little bit of background information: I am a recent college graduate going into post-graduate studies. During my undergraduate career (FY 2014), I started and maintained an eBay where I would buy and sell Pokemon Cards as well as clothing. Being completely ignorant to tax laws (and I mean completely - Never took a personal finance class or anything), I didn't file my taxes for 2014 even after receiving a 1099 from paypal! 
Anyways, fast-forward 1.5 years until today... I received a nice little letter in the mail from the FTB (Franchise Tax Board of CA) stating I owed 1,200 or so in state taxes for 2014. Having filed my 2015 taxes, I was a little shocked but wasn't really too worried because I had a better grasp on how taxes worked. I just thought, ""Alright! If this is what I owe, then I will not contest and just put this all behind me!!!""

So, initially I just planned to pay what they were asking and planned to get on with my life. Luckily, I was able to talk to a tax professional on the TurboTax hotline who actually walked me through the whole situation...
He was very surprised I hadn't received a similar letter from the IRS and said that NO, do not pay everything, COMPLETE YOUR TAXES and file a SCHEDULE C and show deductions. I had no idea that I was supposed to pay additional tax to the IRS on top of the FTB tax (Federal and State taxes, very clear now, but I had thought the FTB bill was for my IRS taxes).

This is when I got a little scared. I went through all of my taxes for 2014 and turbotax said I would have owed the federal government around 10,000 dollars before any deductions... This of course, would not include any penalties or late fees.

However, after going through ALL of my receipts and CC statements I got down my tax debt to around 2,000 for both state and federal before any late fees and penalties. 
Two things I'm extremely thankful for...

1) That my girlfriend at the time insisted I keep all of my receipts and that I kept them all in a file.

2) That I called turbotax and they convinced me to go through their service to fill out a 1040 to submit to both the FTB AND the IRS.

Since then: I have mailed the IRS as well as the FTB my proper 2014 returns and am waiting for a bill in the mail! I am happy to pay what taxes I owe, but this COULD HAVE BEEN an EXTREMELY costly lesson (it will still probably be since I will have to pay late fees and possibly penalties).

So for all of you eBay / etsy / Amazon sellers... Even if you're ignorant like I was, report your taxes. If you don't know how, or don't know where to start, look up CPAs in your area. One may happily talk to you on the phone for 5-10 minutes about what you should do, and may even help you file for 40-100 bucks. Or just do turbotax (cost me 100). For one, you shouldn't not have to pay taxes while people working full time jobs do. And secondly, it's not worth the headache and stress of getting mail from your state's FTB or from the IRS.

Anyways, it's nice reading the advice from everyone on this board, hope someone can take something away from this post. I will update in the upcoming months with what the FTB and the IRS has to say! 

--Edit 1--

Just to make it super clear, as some have posted it here: you owe taxes if you profit from any eBay sales if you were selling with the intent to profit and if you have made over 400 or so dollars TOTAL for the year. Just because you don't receive a 1099 does not mean you don't owe taxes.",finance,1472849321

investing,anti-/r/investing portfolio - 4 month performance,"4 month ago I started tracking a anti-/r/investing portfolio with 45k using largely contrarian ideas to the majority opinion in this subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4qs8cm/antirinvesting_portfolio_2_month_performance/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4n5net/antirinvesting_portfolio_1_month_performance/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/4v8m0t/antirinvesting_portfolio_3_month_performance/), to show people that active management by investment professionals can generate out-performance.

The general strategy being          
&gt;Short US/DM equity           
&gt;Long US treasuries        
&gt;Long hard assets: gold miners and farm land       
&gt;Long EM          

Additionally        

&gt;Short/Avoid Indexes    
&gt;Long specific stocks     
&gt;Long active management (timing and position sizing)     

There has been no movement of capital (distribution or contribution) since last month. I have switched methodology to reporting at month end.

Performance has been achieved maintaining a 35-45% position in U.S. Treasuries and Cash. Current positioning is 140%/40% long/short      

&gt;**Performance:** May: -2.2%, June: 12.4%, July:8.1%, August: -7.6% Since Start: 14.2% as of September 2        
&gt;**Benchmark (SPY+dividend)** May: 1.4%, June 0.6%, July 3.1%, August: -0.4% Since Start: 6.4% as of September 2               

Current 1 month performance is (7.6%), primarily driven by the correction in gold miners from fed jawboning. As of September 2, the poor jobs numbers have held back any prospect of fed rate hikes, the resulting recovery in gold miners have made the current positions recover more than half of the recent losses.  

**GDX/GDXJ:** I have nearly doubled my positioning in gold miners, taking advantage of the decline. I continue to be extremely skeptical of a fed rate hike. The fed has trapped themselves by signaling a strong economy despite weakish PMI and employment growth and non-existent inflation. Now the fed is forced to signal it is willing to raise rates to *signal* it has confidence in the economy while continuously delaying the hike because it knows the economy is not strong enough. This internal contradiction continues to create volatility and good entry opportunities. 

**EWJ:** I have entered a 20k short position in EWJ, as a proxy for shorting Japanese equity and a way to hedge against global illiquidity. BOJ has engaged in a largest monetary experiment program by any large central bank, acquiring all new issuance of JGBs for a country continuously running 5-10% fiscal deficits. BOJ is also acquiring USD30 billion of etfs and indexes. As a result, many investors have moved into the Nikkei last year as a way to front-run the expected buying. However, there is currently a greater internal debate within the BOJ between those who believe continuous monetary expansion and negative rates will cause a banking/insurance collapse chain reaction from the negative spread in marginal assets and those who believe the program must continue to bring up inflation. The former group will likely to gain traction the longer the program goes without driving up inflation and more and more small and medium sized bank edge towards the precipice. If the BOJ does pullback on its easing, it would likely reduce equity buying first (due to the illiquidity now in the JGB market, with the BOJ as the only buyer), and eventually cause a carry trade unwind, a strengthening yen, falling foreign assets and a falling Nikkei. As a result, the Yen and Nikkei are good positioning for a global risk on/off likely to emerge from Japan.  

**IEF:** U.S. Treasuries continue to be (cheap) at 1.6% for the 10 year compared against (0.04%) in Germany, (0.03%) in Japan and 1.1% in Italy. 

**JD:** JD has gone up by more than 20% over the cost basis. I still believe it is best in class in its category. I have very little faith in the character of jack ma from his alipay spinoff without shareholder consent and his random football team purchases. My interactions with Hillhouse has led me to believe that Richard is much more shareholder friendly and has built a better firm culture which is less likely to take shortcuts

I have a new vehicle loan for $21,910.93 @ 2.24% - I pay $1.36 per day in interest for this loan.

The new vehicle is a 2016 truck, the motorcycle is a 2013 bike.

My question is should I pay off more of the truck to get the interest paid per day to at or around the same as the bike and then start paying off the bike? I guess that is counter intuitive. I guess the question is there anyone who thinks I should pay off more of the truck rather than the bike first?

Also, since the truck is new, I could refinance through another credit union (I have two banks that I use frequently), and refinance it for $26,000 and keep the interest rate low, and then pay off the bike with the excess ""equity"" that I have.

I traded in a vehicle when I bought the truck. The MSRP was about $40,000, so I don't think anyone would have a problem with me refinancing it for $25,000. What do you guys think?

FYI - I bought the truck about 2 weeks ago. How long do I need to wait to refinance?

personalfinance,self-employed and graduate student,"Hello PFers.

TLDR: Should I open a retirement account?


I have been reading past posts about putting money towards paying off student debt vs into a retirement account, but I have been unable to come to a conclusion because of the unique variables of my situation. I would very much appreciate your advice on the matter.



About me

- 27/f, northeast USA

- Self-employed, running a small creative business.

- Income averages 6500 a quarter, before all taxes, business expenses and personal expenses

- full-time graduate student, mostly paid through loans

- no dependents

- I prefer doing my finances on a quarterly (not monthly) basis

- Already saved up 6-month emergency fund (savings account)

- Already paid off credit card debt (yay)



General/Estimated Expense Breakdown (not entirely accurate, but will give you the general idea)

- 30% rent

- 20% taxes

- 15% student loans, tuition, other education-related expenses (like textbooks)

- 15% business expenses

- 20% total for everything else, including food, utilities, travel, entertainment, personal care, etc.

- please note this does not include transfers to savings



Details on Student Debt

- Two remaining from undergraduate, both in deferment due to my student status. Both at 6.8%. One is just above 3k, the other just above 4k.

- ""In school"" loans, currently totaling 13k. This number will go up... Interest rate is 5.84%.

- Status of loans are all deferred or ""in school"", meaning I am not required to make payments. However, I do make payments every month, at minimal to pay off accrued interest, at most 200-300 dollars.

- They are all unsubsidized, so interest does accrue on all three loans.

- I do not have any other debt.



What do you think? Should I open a retirement account, or hold off? Should I pay off the student debt interest, and then invest leftover money at the end of the quarter into a retirement account? Should I pay off one (or both) of the 6.8% loans, and THEN open retirement account?

personalfinance,Are certificates of deposit worth it in my situation?,"To start out with, I am blessed with financially supportive parents and a grandfather who left me a generous inheritance. My father and my grandfather essentially gave me an inheritance of $200,000 and challenged me to act like an adult by wisely using that money. I did some research and because I am a relatively low-risk individual, I put half of that in four different Vanguard ETFs, a third of it in Ally's CDs, and the remainder in emergency savings and paid off what I owed to my parents for undergrad + graduate school tuition. 

I make $55,000 annually before taxes, have already maxed out my annual Roth IRA and 401k contributions, and only have my car to pay off. The interest rate on the car loan is so low that my parents and I agreed it was better to not pay it off immediately. 

Looking at my CDs now (CD ladder), I feel like the interest rates are too low. Now that I am more knowledgeable about ETFs, I might as well just wait for my CDs to mature and invest that money into index funds. Is this line of thinking correct? Is putting so much money in index funds taking on too much risk? I am okay with short-term losses now so that is another reason why I am considering to invest more. 

Any other advice would be great too!

personalfinance,"House, savings, and life.","I am not sure what I am looking for, but I feel like I could be doing more than I am.

I am 26(single) and currently making about 80k USD a year, I put 15% into my 401k before tax and the company matches up to 10%. This is currently at about 55k.

After bills I have about $1500 every month that I am putting into savings (i was doing a 0.45% apy cd and plan to do one again till I start looking for a house) This is at about 31k.

I have a credit card I am using for gas and a 14k car loan that I am putting $750 a month towards. I forget the interest rate for both at the moment

The only goal I have had for the last 7 years is a vague ""buy a house"" echoing in my mind. I'm not really sure what to do with the money I have once I meet that goal.

I've thought of bumping up my 401k to 20-25% but at the same time I think I should have a short, medium, and long term plan. The problem for me is that I've never owned a home before and don't really know what sorts of things I should be preparing for. What about prepping for a family?

I just don't know, and I feel like I've been coasting along waiting for something to click in me that will put it all in perspective.

Also if the loan isn't above 4% should I just keep paying it or just pay it off now? Should I pay it of in one go at all, or just put more into paying it off sooner?",finance,1472869522

- With P&amp;I and Escrow our monthly bill is $3066  

6 months after closing we are starting to get inundated with offers to refinance our loan.  Of course all of the closing costs are covered, our interest rate would be reduced to 3.5%, and our monthly bill would be reduced by $100-200.  It all sounds too good to be true so I have been ignoring the offers....but after the 30th solicitation I am starting to wonder.

What should I be looking at right now?  Is refinancing a valid financial strategy after this short of a time?  Does it matter that we are in the San Francisco East Bay area?  What is the downside that I am missing from all of these offers?

personalfinance,"24 year old graduating from college in December, looking for guidance on loan repayment prior to graduation","So, I'm working on finally finishing up my degree in Computer Science. I'm in the United States. I have an internship that started a week ago and will continue to run through the 22nd of February, earning $20 an hour with a cap of 40 hours a week, although I'm only pushing 20-25 for now until I'm settled into the job and my last 2 college classes. I also work 12-15 hours a week at a movie theatre where I'm making $9.75 an hour. I should also mention that I live at home with my parents and will be with them until the start of next summer when I plan to move out and live on my own again (after having done it before and running out of money due to poor spending habits).

After college completion I'll have just over $40,000 in federal financial aid loan debt. I also have a car loan of about $4,500 that I'll have paid off in two years, and make payments of $203.30 every month and its interest is around 6%. I have a private loan for $5,500 that has accrued $2,200 in interest with an interest rate of 9.94%. Lastly, I have a small private loan that has roughly $850 left with a 3.5% variable interest rate; this loan requires payment on interest every 3 months and I've been paying well over that to slowly bring it down.

Financially, I have $5,000 in the bank that I received back from federal loans over the years. I've used that money to pay for books for school or other classes during the summer. I have around $2,000 in savings as fallback money, and I have $600ish in checking to hold onto for card payments, insurance, and all that other stuff. From financial aid this semester, I'm getting $1,200 sent to my account that was an excess from grant money—none of it is loan money.

My plans from this information was that I would use the $5,000 of loan money to dump into my larger private loan to get rid of the interest and put a significant dent into the principal, and then use the $1,200 in grant money to further reduce it to around $1,400. From there maybe keep making large payments for the next month and a half, assuming $700 per paycheck from my internship (other job wouldn't contribute to this at all, and only $400 per paycheck from the internship would be put towards the loan). This way it would be paid off and no longer accruing debt.

My next goal would be to shift my resources more towards increasing my monthly payments on my car to roughly double what I'm currently making in the hopes of having it that much closer to being paid off by the time I graduate and hopefully complete it before I need to start repaying my student loans.

My last goal before having to start repaying student loans would be to pay off the $850 loan I have out since it has the smallest interest rate.

I'm hoping that by posting this plan I can get some pointers on what can be improved upon and whether some of my ideas are problematic or if they're roughly where they should be.

personalfinance,"My place of employment will not be renewing my contract, some advice appreciated.","Long time lurker here, now in a rather unfortunate spot where I will soon be unemployed if I do nothing, and will probably be unemployed for a bit of time even if I do something.

First, some very general information about the situation:

1) I am 24 years old and this is my first (career relevant) job

2) Biomedical Engineering Degree (B.S.)

3) On salary, 55k a year. Claimed 0 withholdings so I don't have to worry about tax liability at the end of the year (I am aware this is not ideal).

4) Contract was for 6 months, then was renewed for another 6 months (1 year total). Ending late September.

5) I work and live in New Jersey

6) I'm currently under my employer health insurance.

7) I can expect 2.5 more biweekly checks (plus I have some unused vacation time, ~44 hrs, and I would sooner take the cash out option vs. using it)
_________
**My financial situation**

1) Current Monthly Expenses:

* Rent: $0 (live with parents)
* Car: $0 (paid off, and have car insurance payment removed from later section on my available funds)
* Food: $150
* Gas: $250 (I traveled a lot for work, I expect this to go down considerably)
* Dance lessons: $250 (I want to eventually teach dance later in my life on a part time basis and into my retirement. I see this as an investment in myself)
* Student loans: $314
* Fun: $100

2) I have 28.5k in student loans, with $314 monthly repayment plan (all federal, interest rates from 3.1% to 6.5%). My loan provider takes credit cards, so I do have r/churning related reasons for not paying them off in full right away. I pay the statement balance of my cards each month.

3) Money across accounts:

* Checking: $880
* Savings: $460
* CD: $1000
* E-fund (more savings): $3700
* Taxable Retirement Acc: $1660
* Roth IRA: $11,700
* Trad 401k: $10,000
* Amazon GC Balance: $1000 (courtesy of r/beermoney in my downtime)

______
**My plan**

0) Get a copy of the contracts I signed from my employer, and file for unemployment after my last day. I need to do research to figure out any strange quirks to my state's unemployment process, there may be a best timing to when I apply, but I assume it'll be best to apply sooner rather than later. Appeal if necessary.

1) Update my resume, get current work references, and apply to many places. I'm really looking to get decent benefits (mostly retirement), 60k+ a year, and still be able to live at home, but now I am not in the best position to negotiate on that, so it'll probably be a game of pick two of these.

2) If I don't find employment within 60 days, get health insurance (I believe there some type of COBRA coverage that applies retroactively, once again I need to do more research in it.)

3) Do not touch my retirement accounts. If anything, reach into my taxable account. Unless a horrible accident occurs, I don't foresee this being an issue.

4) Rollover my Trad 401k to a Trad IRA.

5) Consider getting green belt certified in six sigma, which would make me more marketable in my field and would increase my salary prospects.

6) Consider switching student loans to Income Based Repayments.

7) Consider Grad School. I'd rather not dig myself deeper in debt, but it is an option that could pay for itself.

8) Consider a little vacation, I haven't had one in a few years and am not very well traveled. A break is good for me, and I am emotionally and mentally drained due to a recent break up of a long term partner, and worrying about my future.

personalfinance,Recent college drop out looking for advice.,"Hey, so I am in a pretty depressing state in my life and honestly I have no clue where to begin. What I know is some of the best things to do is talk it out and see what my options are, but the options I have are blurry.

I'll try to keep this quick. So before the situation I was a 5th year Biology(Premed focused) student at a major University in my state. I have a 3.3 GPA and haven't taken the MCAT. My schooling is mostly powered by loans, the total cost of my schooling lands around 25-6k a year, and federal might take around 12-13k out of it. So generally I am left with borrowing from a bank to cover the rest of the cost. Currently I have around 70k in loans private, and I'd say 30-40k+ in federal loans.

**Situation**

So my loans are cosigned by my mother because she was a nurse with good credit. However, around my sophmore-junior year she lost her hearing and was put on disability. Disability however only lasts for around 3 years, so she was put off it this year. The bank I get my loans off saw this and decided to reject me for the private loan I normally get. So I ended up having to put the rest of my federal loans for both semesters on just one of them. I could have taken this semester, but I would have absolutely no way to pay for the next semester, thus no degree for me.

**The** **Other** **Issue**

I happen to live with my girlfriend who graduated from nursing school and was employed at a nursing home that she got fired from. She loves to spend money, she often uses words like ""Who cares about money?"", or ""You know what money gets you? Nothing"". It gets to the point where I have to argue about financial security. She sees no point in having a savings account. Both our credit cards are maxed(Mine has 2200 limit, its at 2266 because I can't pay it, hers is at 1600). She also bought a fairly new-used car this January which we are paying around 275 in loans and 225 in insurance(Welcome to Michigan! The highest insurance rates in the US!). We also pay for rent(530), electricity(varies), gas, and water. Winter is coming so heat is gonna start to strain us next. Without her job I have around 40 in my account and she has like 50. She has one more paycheck of 1300~ coming in before we are completely broke.

**What** **I** **Did**

So to try to give us breathing room I dropped out of school. Seeing as the spring semester is shaky at best, and our current situation is getting worse, it doesn't make sense to continue when failure could be right around the door. How can I focus if finances is a constant worry? I am also hoping for a refund from my tuition by dropping now for extra rent money while I try to figure things out. What is apparent to me is that I am very concerned about my financial future. No savings, credit card debt, student loan debt, a girlfriend that seems not to care until its dire. I am a very money orientated person, I like to have at least 100-200 in my savings to feel safe, but I am constantly forced to use it for some odd reason.

**What** **Do** **I** **Do**?

So reddit users of personal finance, what should I do? I considered enlisting in the Army and going into active duty for 4 years, then when I get out I can finish my degree. I could also just work and have a side-business and try to find my way out there. Other than that I am in a complete mess, and I feel like a wreck.

- $1600 main hospital bill (I was suicidal and didn't know what else to do, would have preferred to tried a different cheaper resource in retrospect)

- $150 bill from attending physician (I don't think I met them) at said hospital

Basically my question is, given that most of my debt has been forgiven or can be paid within a few years, what is my best course of action? If I can do I gain anything by putting money towards the low balance on my student loans, or should I put the money into something like savings, 401K, pension fund through my employer, and pay it off when I become responsible for the interest (or income goes up)? I have no reserves with my low income, so would like to save for maybe 6 months worth of expenses. Is there anything else I can do beyond that in my situation? I feel like I've done a pretty good job at following a budget, keeping expenses to a minimum (no cable, Netflix, data on cell, don't eat out very often, etc), but I feel like my recently being disqualified for SNAP (my income is too high) and LIEAP (My roommate's income is too high) hasn't helped with my expenses, since I was able to subsist off of the $100 tax free food 'stamps' I got and now food where I live seems more expensive and I have to pay taxes and eat more due to the physical nature of my job.

I'm having trouble understanding if and why paying off the highest interest loan makes sense in this situation. The only explanation I've found in searching is that paying off the smaller, higher interest loan first has psychological benefits, but I'm already motivated to pay all of this off as quickly as possible and don't really care about how I feel about the process.

So, here's the scenario:
I have a student loan at 9k at 6.4% interest, and another at 20k with 5.875% interest. Everything I read says pay highest first, but I don't understand why it wouldn't make the most sense to cut the 5% interest loan almost in half first, making the collected interest the same as the 6% one, before doing that.

personalfinance,"Graduating soon, received job offer from fed.. negotiate?","Throwaway because.. fed.. first job.. numbers.. paranoia.. etc. :)

Here is my situation. I will be graduating with a BS in a STEM field in a couple semesters. I've received an offer from a US federal organization that is *amazing* to work for in my field. It is the only place I want to work, the only place I've applied to so far, and the hence the only offer I have received. I would feel fine not applying elsewhere.

So, on to my first question. How negotiable are salaries with US federal organizations? The position was posted with a salary range and my offer is pretty much at the bottom of that range. I interviewed with them one day, literally got the offer the next day. One of the people I interviewed with said the fastest offer he has seen was 2 days.. mine was 1 day. I'm under the assumption they really want me as an employee.

My gut says just take the offer and be happy but my lurking around here says to try to negotiate for a little more money to help get my career started out a little ahead, the worst they could do is say no, right?

My second question is how much more do I ask for? I've changed the numbers, but let's say the range is from $70k to $95k and I was offered $70k. Is there some kind of magic % extra to ask for to start negotiations? Do I run any risk of them immediately rescinding the offer if I ask for more?",finance,1472956289

The schools don’t offer specific advice due to liability issues, and it seems like there’s nowhere to turn! 

Even though I’m fairly familiar with filing my taxes, I need help this year.  I also worked in industry in a different state (Washington) during this fiscal year. In addition, I will be receiving a fellowship this year (so no federal or state withholding), and I believe I’m exempt from paying FICA taxes because I’m a graduate student employee. Because of these layered issues, I have a few questions about filing my taxes this year, and I feel like if I just had 10-15 minutes with someone who understands the tax code and forms, and maybe a bit about how my school funding will change the process (pretty sure I can’t just fill out a 1040EZ like the last few years) I would be set. I can’t find any avenue for advice without hiring a tax attorney or something, which I can’t really afford to do while on a graduate student stipend. 

I’ve read a number of IRS publications and other websites, and it just seems a bit absurd that it’s become this challenging for me to file my taxes! I want to pay, honest!

personalfinance,RSUs Vesting: Use for Employee Stock Purchase Program?,"Hi,

For the first time in my life I've had some RSUs vest, and now according to my brokerage (?) account through my employer, I have about $9K in ""Total Account Value"".

As I understand it, I can now opt to sell the shares those represent and then withdraw the $9K.

First question: what happens with taxes? Should I put some aside? Will my company/brokerage account handle that for me?

Second question: We have an Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) which allows us to put up 15% of our salary (post-taxes I believe) into it for 6 months, and at the end we get to purchase stocks at 85% of the opening or closing price for the period, whichever is _lower_. That means I stand to make a _minimum_ of 15% on that investment.

I've been planning and executing a cross-country move since I started at this company so I haven't yet enrolled in the ESPP; and I wouldn't be able to put the full 15% in — but I'm thinking I could use the RSU sale money to put in up to that amount and make 15% more on it.

Presumably there are also taxes on that too though? And more than 15%?

I also have a small loan that I could pay off entirely which has a 6% interest rate — not sure if I should pay that off instead. Or wait for the ESPP payout, then pay it off.

I should continue getting somewhere around $1200-2000 every 2-3 months moving forward also, as more RSUs vest, and bonus RSUs vest on a different schedule.

Thanks!

**Edit**: To clarify, I plan to use the RSU payout to cover the shortfall in salary from contributing the same amount to the ESPP from my paycheck.",finance,1472960964

personalfinance,Credit Score 770. Best place or website to find the best place to get a 30-60k home loan? And could use advice for how much to borrow.,"Two part question.  First deals with the means for getting the best deal on a loan I can.  Second is backstory to help you advise whether you think I should get a loan for the lowest amount I need, or the highest.  Note that with USAA, the minimum loan I could get is $50k.

My credit score is 770.

I bought at 45k foreclosure in a decent area of Tulsa (relatively near Utica and 15th Street, basically I'm near multiple hospitals and the University of Tulsa).  I used 15k of my own money, and borrowed 30k from my mom.  So originally I was just going to pay my mom back a month at a time, but obviously her money could be better invested in actual investments, so I need to take out a loan to pay her back.

So, can anyone recommend what bank/credit union/online bank might be offering the best deals now?  Best in lowest interest with minimal/no closing cost.  And there are two components to that.

First option is just borrowing 30k to pay my mom back.  The second option is, borrowing let's say, 50-60k, paying my mom back, and then using the remainder to fix up or tear down and rebuild the second structure on the property.  Details below (skip if you only came to provide info about the loan):

The property has two buildings on it, a 2 bed 1 bath house on the left (as you look at them), with a small piece of roof connecting to a 16 by 31 (16 by 40 if you count the porch) building, which I've just called the ""cottage"" but not sure what its correct term would be, it has a bathroom and kitchen on the back end and then a big area that extends to the front door.  Don't know why they connected the buildings with the small piece of roof, perhaps some city ordnance, the house was built in 1930)

The main house is Decent.  The living room and two bedrooms off it and that whole part of the house look like they are the original building and are in pretty good shape.  The kitchen and bathroom are in a room that appears to be an added builing, and which is a good foot below the rest of the house.  You have to walk through the kitchen area to get to the bathroom.  Works for a single guy, maybe even a couple, but it is absolutely stupid if one were to do any hosting.

THe cottage is a gut and redo everything/tear down and build new.  Stinks inside, someone already started the process of ripping out all the drywall before giving up.  There is no insulation in any of the walls, so where the drywall is gone, you can see the outside siding through the studs (outside covering may be asbestos siding).  Even the electrical wiring is gone.  Water works but I would probably replace the toilet, tub and sink.

Also, there is a crack in the concrete floor.  There is a tree right next to the cottage.  I'm thinking that a root caused that crack.  Tree needs to come down for sure.

Oh, and the studs suffered some termite damage.  The termite problem appears to have been solved, but the studs are pretty ugly looking.

Basically, 2-3 options:  
1) Remove everything including the siding but leave the frame and roof, replace/shore up studs as needed, and use some concrete fix stuff someone told me about that pours out of the floor and spreads out evenly and then hardens.  Then put some vinyl siding on it, run electrical and then put in insulation, drywall it up and call it a rental.

2) Same as above but leaving the siding on, cover it with foam and then cover all that with vinyl, so as to avoid any issues with asbestos removal.

3) Tear the whole thing down, assess the foundation after the tree is removed and see if I need to redo the slab, then rebuild the structure as a 2-3 story (if ordnances permit) rental building.

4) Clean it out as best I can but leave the siding on it and just use it as a garage/storage building for myself.  This avoids going into any extra debt or putting money into the property in a way that may be contrary to how I would do so if I had the money to tear everything down and rebuild as a really nice house.  However, this foregoes rental income, and the idea of essentially being able to live in my house for free is very tempting.

^ Part of me doesn't want to invest much into the place because the former owner paid 85k for it, so I could probably do nothing much a little bit of landscaping and turn around and sell the place for double what I paid, while leaving it in a state that someone with a lot more money would feel fine about demolishing and building their dream home.  I believe one of the reasons for the housing collapse was that everyone viewed their home as an investment that would inevitably pay off, so people dumped more money into houses than they should have instead of viewing their home as one of their 3 essential needs (food, clothing, &gt;shelter&lt;).  I feel like issues should be dealt with as they arise and when the house is finally about to fall down, tear it down and build a new proper modern house, and to do that I think one should utilize the space used by the cottage.  The house and cottage sit right next to each other, so one could combine their slab space and create one long rectangle on which to build an excellent 2 story house.

But the other part of me really wants that rental income.

I can of course borrow that maximum I would be willing to invest and make my decision, then use the money or immediately pay it back, which is my mom's advice given the low interest rates available now.

financialindependence,Improving Retirement Calculators / Models,"I was recently reflecting on how, every few months, I reformulated some components of my spreadsheet/model to improve its accuracy.  I always kick myself for how missing that complexity in earlier views, and how inaccurate my previous versions were without it.  I wonder what else I am missing in making my models more precise.

What's the most significant improvement that you made in your personal models that helped them be more accurate to your plan?

Some examples of improvements I've made in my personal projections, from most recent:


1. Including standard deduction / personal exemption in my federal income tax calculator, which I used to calculate total taxes paid + effective tax rate


2. Researching the tax treatment of various retirement contributions, realizing FICA was still applied to 401k but not HSA, and that my previous state taxed 401k pretax contributions (PA)


3. Calculating % salary contribution needed to achieve 401k max by end of year, given salary changes throughout the year, and adjusting that in my paycheck withholding.


4. Calculating both savings rates (Total savings / (Gross pay incl. company 401k  - Taxes)) and total amount contributed to savings account per year, to make better choices regarding salary / location / expenses


5. Calculating projected SS payouts with actual earnings history, projected retirement date, projected earnings increases, and projected claim age - rather than relying on rough estimates


6. Calculating non-taxed-advantages savings per year as a function of salary minus fixed expenses, instead of a fixed $$ amount/year, to better handle the scale of increased savings as salary increases


7. Changed 401k contribution amounts from a % of salary to a fixed amount to better handle maxing the contribution per year as salary increases over time",finance,1472965653

personalfinance,Better to pay off credit-card debt first or invest in retirement savings?,"So because of some unexpected emergencies, I ended up having close to $33,000 CAD in credit card debt. The average interest rate on my cards is about 13%. I have a good job, though, and will likely be able to pay it all off in about two years if I stick to the payment rate at which I'm going.

I also have about $4,000 in retirement savings. (RRSP account in Canada, which is the equivalent of a 401(k) account in USA.) So far this year it's been earning interest at a rate of about 8%.

I was wondering if it made sense to withdraw that money from my retirement savings account and pay off my credit-card debt. Withdrawal has a 10% penalty (withholding tax) for amounts below $5,000, so I'll lose $500 if I withdraw $5k.

On the one hand, I'm losing all that money to my credit cards in interest payments, so I'm tempted to withdraw the retirement savings to pay them off. But on the other hand, removing that $5k will mean that much less money earning compound interest for me every month.

I have $5500 left in student loans to pay at 8.5% (Federal Parent +Loans)
Well employed enough as a freelancer to be able to make more than the minimum payments every month and still live comfortably (IE afford rent, bills, ect)

I have a Liquid emergency $ fund of around $3500 at the moment and a ""Tax"" Savings account that's got ~$6000 in it to pay off 2016's taxes (I don't make quarterly payments and take the penalty because...well...reasons, don't hate) What I'm seriously considering at this point is using my Tax savings account to pay off the student loans in full, and then set up a payment plan with the IRS next year to pay down the 2016 taxes that I'll owe. My rational is, I'll probably be able to set up a MUCH lower monthly payment with the IRS at a MUCH lower interest rate than the student loans, which will allow me to pocket more every month into my other savings for buying a property soon.

personalfinance,Pension payout? (being offered lump sum),"tl;dr — I’m being offered a lump sum payout from pension, and I’m planning to take it and roll over into my Roth IRA.  Is this a good idea?

Full details:

My pension plan from a previous employer is offering a lump sum payment option, which must be acted upon within the next month.  I’m trying to determine whether it makes sense for me to select the lump sum option and, if so, how best to go about it.

I’m 37 and recently engaged.  I have no children, but plans to begin a family in the short term.  I have no debt, rent my home, have around $10k in savings/checking, and around $60k in a Roth IRA.  My current job pays around $70k annually and offers no retirement benefits.  My fiancé makes a comparable annual income and also has no debt.  I live in California.

If I were to retire on my normal retirement date in 2043, the pension in question would pay $870/month.  If I select the lump sum option now, I will receive $32k.  Additionally (from the pension materials): “The eligible portion of a Lump Sum payment can be rolled over into an IRA or another eligible retirement plan that accepts rollovers.”  I also have the option to begin receiving $125/month now from the pension.

“Any amount of the taxable portion of the distribution that is not rolled over will be subject to an automatic 20% federal income tax withholding as well as any applicable state taxes.  Any taxable portion of the benefit that is not rolled over may be subject to a 10% additional income tax.”

Regarding roll over to a Roth IRA: “If you roll over a payment from the Plan to a Roth IRA, a special rule applies under which the amount of the payment rolled over (reduced by any after-tax amounts) will be taxed.  However, the 10% additional income tax on early distributions will not apply.”

From a chart provided with the pension materials, California “State withholding generally follows the same rules as federal withholding with a default of 2% unless otherwise specified.”

My instinct is to take the lump sum payment and roll over into my existing Roth IRA, paying around 20% tax (I think) in the process.  Does that make sense?  Any sense in setting up a conventional IRA to roll over into instead to alleviate the immediate tax hit?

Penciling the numbers out, based on the CPI inflation calculator, I’d estimate the $870/month pension payment would have roughly half the buying power of today (or around $450/month) by my retirement date in 2043.  Assuming I live another 20 years past my retirement date (or to 85 years old), I’d expect to get around $108k in total pension value ($450 x 240 months) — noting that this calculation doesn’t take into account the additional costs of inflation that would hit over my hypothetical 20-year retirement period or the taxes I’d have to pay on the monthly pension payouts.

In comparison, if I were to take the $32k lump payout and roll over into my Roth IRA, I believe I’d take an immediate tax hit of around $7k — leaving about $25k in the roll over.  Assuming an annual compound interest rate of 6%, this $25k would be worth about $120k on my normal retirement date in 2043.  In addition, most of that $120k would continue to sit in the Roth IRA after 2043 (minus needed withdrawals) compounding and tax free.

Make sense?

Thanks very much for any and all guidance!  Greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,Would I need to report my 2015 wages to fafsa?,"Hello! I was recently selected for verification and I'm supposed to hand in my parent tax return transcript along with a verification form supplied by my college. Couple of my peers had told me I hadn't needed to report any income on my fafsa application due to not making over a certain number since I didn't file for taxes and they had no problem going through the application. So I didn't, but now I'm due for verification and on one of the questions I'm being asked with check boxes have the two following options.

Option 1: I have not filed (and am not required to file) a 2015 federal income tax return and I had no income earned from work in 2015

Option 2: I have not filed (and am not required to file) a 2015 federal income tax return, but I had income earned from work in 2015 as listed below. [List every employer and the amounts earned in 2015, even if they did not issue an IRS Form W-2. Attach copies of all 2015 IRS Forms W-2 that were issued to you by employers .]

personalfinance,15-yr vs 30-yr mortgage: how much does the flexibility or freedom mean to you guys?,"Hey PF!

I've been thinking about the 15-yr and 30-yr mortgage, as I'm currently looking into buying a home in the near future. While I've always had the idea of going for a 30-yr mortgage but budget for a 15-yr, my friend's perspective has always just been to go for the 15-yr to save money. 

So I did a little calculation on total interest paid, for a 1) 15-yr mortgage, 2) 30-yr mortgage, 3) 30-yr mortgage on a 15-yr mortgage payment, and 4) 30-yr mortgage on a 15 year plan. 

Because I live in LA, CA, these are the parameters I assumed:

* $550,000 home
* 20% down, so $440,000 down payment
* 30-yr interest rate: 3.42%
* 15-yr interest rate: 2.71%

Here is what I found for each of the four scenarios:

1) monthly payment: $2977.57, total interest paid over 15 years: $95,962

2) monthly payment: $1956.20, total interest paid over 30 years: $264,232

3) if we paid $2955.57 monthly for a 30-yr mortgage, an extra $1021.37/month, total interest paid over course of loan is $131,995, paid off in 16 yrs 1 month

4) if we bumped the monthly payment to $3136.80 for a 30-yr mortgage, an extra $1021.37/month, total interest paid over course of loan will be $122,644, paid off in 15 yrs

So roughly, in scenarios 3 and 4, we get the safety and flexibility of a 30-yr mortgage, pay both mortgages off in around 15-16 years, at a cost of an extra 27k-36k interest. 

Is it worth it for you guys? How do you guys put a value on flexibility? Or what influences you guys to make the decision between any of the 4 scenarios? I'm not trying to say any option is better than the other, as I believe everyone's situation is unique. Just wondering how each of you guys make up your minds and draw the line.

Yes, unfortunately this is another one of those ""windfall"" posts. I've read the sidebar and wiki but most of it seems to apply to US residents, so I thought I'd ask directly. 


I'm currently travelling around Europe for a year with my American girlfriend and have managed to save up ~ AUD$37,000 to fund my travelling expenses. I have all this in an e-Saver account (accessable only online) with a 2.7% interest rate. I use my credit card to pay for most things and just pay it off as required. All is going well on that front. 


While I've been overseas, I have been made redundant from my job and was paid ~ AUD$45,000. As stated, I have enough money saved to cover all my travel expenses. At the end of my year of travel (sometime around August 2017) I am planning on moving from Australia to somewhere in Europe. At that point I will obviously need a decent portion of my funds liquid, to cover the cost of moving and setting up a new life. 

**My question is: What should I do with the money in the interim?** 

While I'll definitely be using some of this money to 'start over' I feel like this is an excellent opportunity to being some kind of long term investment strategy and to build a portfolio. If so, given my international situation, where should I start?",finance,1473077716

I wanted to start out by thanking you guys for having such an awesome and informative community. This is my first post here, so I will try not to break any rules...

I just received notice that a lender will be increasing my variable rate student loans (from 7% to 7.375%). This rate has always hurt my eyes to look at, but this finally gave me the kick in the butt to look into alternatives (refinance/consolidate to lower rate, etc) to see if it made financial sense... So I guess this is where your help would be greatly appreciated!

Around the same time the rate increase happened, I received one of those annoying ""pre-approved"" student load refinance letters from CitizensOne offering a starting interest rate of 2.2-7.95% (variable) or 4.74-9.39% (fixed). Should I pursue one of these types of options (CitizensOne, SoFi, Earnest, CommonBond, DRB, First Republic, etc?), should I go to my bank and/or credit union, or some other alternative?

investing,"What does history tell us about high property prices, as is the case for many major cities globally ?","Prices are at record highs, homes are more unaffordable than ever, foreign investors are using homes for investment, new homes being built are generally expensive luxury condos, house prices and rent are increasing far faster than inflation rates and wages/salaries, there is a lot of uncertainty in currencies, interest rates are low, increasing frequency of quantitative easing, and finally the rising popularity of studio apartments.

I'm looking at major cities, where this pattern is mirrored globally. And I'm looking at this from purely an investing point of view. Say if I invested in a small condo, to rent out. I'm essentially risking that the already overpriced is actually going to become even more overpriced and expensive, which is just hard for me to believe. But it's hard to see home prices falling significantly. Will house prices stay the same or higher for the next 20 years? What does history tell us about these situations?

personalfinance,Car downgrade,"Hey everyone, long time lurker first time asking for request. I'm a 26 year old living in the Midwest. I'm a software engineer with a house and I'm engaged to be married next spring.

My first job out of college was about a 10 miles commute. My car at that time was a very unreliable parent hand-me-down which blew its transmission just three months into my job. Fed up with the unreliability I bought a new car, a 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT hatchback. It has served me very well. I paid $17,000 for it and paid it off in 6 months.

personalfinance,Convince me to open a 401k,"Alright so I need some convincing to open my 401k. 

I'm 29 and work in DC grossing around $3800 before taxes each month in this position(currently $2880 net). Every few months I also pick up part time positions which bring in anywhere from $500-$1000. This brings my average monthly net income to $3200.

My company offers a traditional 401k through Principal and offers a 4% match. However, the match doesn't begin vesting until I've been there a year and it vests at 25% a year until it hits 100% at year four. I just hit my 3 month mark.

This is my first job where I have the opportunity to open a 401k and was really excited to do so. However, things have changed and I'm planning on leaving this job and the area I live in in the next 6 months to year so I'm wondering what the point is in me opening the account if I'm not going to get any of the matched funds. 

I already have a traditional IRA and could begin contributing more to that. I only throw about $50 a month in it right now.

Here's a break down of my monthly budget for context.

Income $3200

* Rent: $697 (gf pays other half) (covers electric,water, heat)
* Utilities: $100 (cell phone/cable/internet)
* Student Loans: $500 (30k across 6 loans all fed (4 sub, 2 not) @ 6.8)
* Credit Cards: $600 ( 8k across 5cards all at 0%)
* Transportation: $150 (split between uber and metro)
* Groceries/Home: $230
* Going out: $250
* Gas: $50 (I help cover my gf since I don't have a car)
* Short term Savings: $200 (currently has $1500)
* Trad IRA: $50 (currently has $800)
* Extra: 370

The extra $370 sits as a buffer in my checking account or goes to credit cards so i suppose that's also short term savings.

I'm really trying hard to pay down my loans and credit cards and I'm thinking that at this point opening up a 401k will just pull money away from those goals. I really don't know though.

**Overview**

Hi All!

Welcome to week number two of the r/personalfinance Savings Olympics! [In week number 1]( https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5057bg/the_games_of_the_personal_finance_savings/), our competitors fought valiantly and saved **a combined total of over $10,600 a year** from cutting down on recurring expenses! Our average Olympian that completed at least one discipline saved **approximately $590 per year!**

This week, Olympians will be competing for  [gold](http://www.foliomag.com/files/images/reddit_gold.png), [silver]( http://i.imgur.com/C8lzpBJ.jpg), or [bronze](http://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/43/d9/d9/f2/04/reddit_bronze_preview_featured.jpg) medals in the discipline of debt/investments. Originally, I planned to include a few “advanced strategies” (backdoor IRAs, portfolio theory, etc…). However, I couldn’t do these topics and what is below justice in the same post, so those will be deferred to a later week.

Just like last week, keep in mind that, just like athletes specialize in one or at most a few events, not everything I post may apply to you. But never fear, everyone will have a chance to do at least something to show off their personal finance prowess! Additionally, I’ve tried to keep these as actionable as possible. Most of these changes, however, take longer than a day to truly pay off. But, you can at least **start today**.

**Discipline #2 – Debt/Investments**

This week, the focus is all about two broad areas – paying down debt and improving your investments. There are a variety of events in each of these areas, so find the one(s) that best applies to your situation!

**Qualifying Heat – Make a Budget!**

Before you can participate in any of these events, you must have a budget. If you don’t know where your money is going, it is almost impossible to cut expenses! So, if you don’t have a budget, make one. [If](https://www.mint.com/) [you](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) [need](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting#wiki_the_envelope_system) [a]( https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1r90pc/getting_started_how_to_make_a_budget/) [guide,]( https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/40q7jb/budgeting_101_the_simplest_way_to_start_budgeting/) [there]( https://www.dropbox.com/s/sscqk4zl91eklja/Budgeting%20101.xlsx?dl=0) [are]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RLGHboFwloFf93IG7Ad_juJSf6_GGtMSbpqCntEsHzw/edit?pli=1#gid=0) [literally](https://www.quicken.com/) [hundreds]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xawTXik_BkhU3vTnV888h7AthJRy5z6WNh9SjQXFr2s/edit#gid=18) [of]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Y8z8aDSZtZb30OMA-U-LUxx9LrjUlAcLB833YL5grk/edit#gid=191) [options]( https://consumerist.com/2010/12/01/dangerps-sweet-excel-budget-spreadsheet-with-debt-snowball/) [to]( http://www.mymoney.gov/Fast/Pages/Results.aspx?k=Budgeting%20worksheets&amp;s=All) [help]( https://www.smartsheet.com/top-excel-budget-templates) [you;]( https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2tymvf/poormans_budgeting_spreadsheet/) [find](http://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/budgets.html) [what]( http://www.enemyofdebt.com/EOD%20Deluxe%20Budget%202.0.xls) [works]( http://www.gatherlittlebylittle.com/wp-content/plugins/download-monitor/download.php?id=1) [for](http://www.vertex42.com/Files/xls/1/debt-reduction-calculator.xls) [you.]( http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/TC062062791033.aspx?CategoryID=CT101172321033) [More]( http://seedtime.com/2/xlyourfinances.php) [options-]( http://www.mymoneyblog.com/images/0611/budget_neil.xls) [no](http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/budgets/j_budget_template.xls) [excuses!]( http://www.spreadsheet123.com/ExcelTemplates/budgets.html)

Once you have a budget, you have qualified to move on to the medal rounds below!

**Event #1 – Pay off Debt!**

Let me make this simple – debt, except in a few cases, is poison. It weighs your finance down and sucks up cash from you, month after month, year after year. I hate debt with a [passion]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S1oHz99ZcU) (start video at 2:57 or so; cheesy but true at least to a point).

Now, I understand that all debt is not “bad” and that some debt is “worse” than other debt. That said, I err on the side of eliminating debt because I know that this is money in **my** pocket. I can’t control what the markets do. I can’t predict the economy or the future. I don’t know when the next recession will hit. But, I can pay off debt and so can you! Sell stuff. Take a second job. Cut expenses to the bone. Run like the gazelle!

One last note – I’m not going to recommend a specific strategy to get out of debt. Mathematically, the avalanche method (pay highest interest rate first), on average, will be the most effective method. Psychologically, the snowball method (pay the lowest balance first) may be the best choice for you. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Following through on a plan that is 90% of optimal beats merely designing a 100% perfect plan anytime.

*Gold*: Eliminate all debt. Again, the idea of a gold medal is that it should be difficult to achieve and accessible to only a relatively small number of people. Believe me, I get the math and understand if you want to keep your low-interest rate mortgage. But I need an objective standard, and I’m going with “eliminate all debt” for gold.

*Silver*: Eliminate all debt with an interest rate of &gt;= 4-5% APY. This is the “moderate interest rate” level debt. In theory, you **might** be able to do better in the market…but in general you should pay this off quickly unless you have a compelling reason to not do so.

*Bronze*: Eliminate all debt with an interest rate of &gt;= 10% APY. Seriously, if you have any debt in this category, you need to post your budget and let us help you. In this range, you will be consumed by your debt unless you attack it with everything you have.

*Olympic Spirit*: There are posts all the time on this sub from people crying out for help. If you don’t have debt (or only have “low interest rate” debt), take some time to help someone else get to where you are.

**Event #2 – Emergency Fund**

My emergency fund is my most valuable “investment”. It is boring. I don’t try and chase the highest checking interest rate on it. It is larger than might be “optimal”. My emergency fund is “f*** you/life money.” It means I never have to worry about when a bill is due. I don’t care if my employer screws up payroll one week. I can buy anything I need in cash immediately. I won’t be mistreated by a boss or a company or tricked by a high pressure offer because long before things get to that point, I can and will bail.

Simply put, **you can’t invest for the long-term if you can’t survive the short-term.**

Money may not buy happiness…but it sure does reduce stress. I’m amazed at the number of problems in life that can be solved by the ability to throw liquid cash at them. Seriously, if you don’t have one, start an emergency fund today!

*Gold*: Have a fully funded emergency fund equal to the greater of $10,000 or six month’s worth of expenses.

*Silver*: Have a fully funded emergency fund equal to the greater of $5,000 or three month’s worth of expenses.

*Bronze*: Have a fully funded emergency fund equal to the greater of $1,000 or one month’s worth of expenses.

**Demonstration Event – General Retirement Planning**

Sorry folks, no medals for this event. In keeping with the Olympic theme, I’ll call this a “demonstration” event. Before you can plan for retirement, you need to know your goal. So, your challenge for this event is simple in concept but incredibly difficult – decide your goal for retirement.

Once you know your goal, calculate your retirement savings goal (your number). I do this with a needlessly complex Excel spreadsheet. Most people would do just fine with an online tool like [this one](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/retirement-plan-calculator.aspx). Your number will change based on tons of assumptions. For what it is worth, here is roughly what I would plug in as assumptions for me (your situation will be different of course). Numbers in the main text represent what I think of as the “mean” of the distribution for me while those in parenthesis represent what I see as conservative inputs (conservative in the sense that they yield a bigger number) out in the right tail of the distribution.

Retirement age: 60 (55)
Expected Yearly Income Increase: 4% (2%)
Income at Retirement:	60% (75%)
Year of Retirement: 30 (40)
Rate of Return Pre-Retirement: 8% (6%)
Rate of Return Post-Retirement: 7% (5%)
Expected Rate of Inflation: 3% (4%)
Include Social Security: yes (yes, but only at 50% of proposed value – manual adjustment in Excel)

Especially if you are FI/RE minded, I don’t like this or most retirement calculators because they express retirement needs as a function of current income rather than current expenses hence why I lean to Excel based scenarios.

**Event #3 – Employer Sponsored Retirement Plans - 401(k), 403(b), 457, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)**

This event has a simple message - **at a minimum, get your employer match**. For those of you that may not know, most employers that offer a 401(k) plan offer to partially match your contributions. They say, for every x% you put in, we will match that at y% up to a maximum of z. **THIS IS FREE MONEY**. Seriously, you should be willing to make major lifestyle changes to get the full amount of your employer match. It is that insanely good.

*Gold*: Fully fund your 401(k); for most people, this means 18k per year.

*Silver*: Fund your 401(k) to the maximum amount needed to get the full employer match.

*Bronze*: Start contributing to your 401(k) plan. Even if you can only do 1% right now, start with something!

LPT: Check and see if your plan has an automatic increase option (aka step up option). It can be scary to jump from 2-3% to 10%+ overnight. A step up option tells your plan to automatically increase your contribution percentage by a small amount every year. This can help you “miss the money less” and contribute more.

Random footnote – if you are self-employed, you have some extra cool options available. Check out [this link](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/4-retirement-plan-options-selfemployed/) for a good guide.

**Event #4 – Additional Employer Benefits – Employer Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)**

Many publicly traded companies offer a special benefit known as an ESPP. This type of plan allows you to take money from your paycheck and periodically buy shares of your company’s stock at a discount (usually 10-15%), often at a price that is *lower* than the current market value.

My strategy here is – invest in the ESPP, but sell the stock as soon as you are able. Some people argue that you should hold out for long term capital gain treatment. I don’t agree. You already work for the company and so have a ton of your personal future income tied to their fortunes. Don’t “un-diversify” yourself any further. Take the sweet 10-15% guaranteed return, and be happy!

*Gold*: Fund your ESPP plan to the maximum (or at least a high level…don’t go too overboard with this idea)!

*Silver*: Enroll in your company’s ESPP plan.

*Bronze*: Find out whether your company offers an ESPP plan.

**Event #5 – Personal Retirement Savings – Individual Retirement Account (IRA)**

IRA’s rock. Most of you should know this. They let you set aside money today for use in the future. I won’t beat you over the head with detail…I’ll just refer you to [Vanguard’s website]( https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/how-to-open-an-ira) for instructions on how to actually open one (it is very easy!)

One more note – you can make contributions for 2016 from January 1, 2016-April 15, 2017. If you believe as I do that **time in the market beats timing the market** try to invest on January 1, 2016 etc…every year. Don’t wait until the last minute – do it today!

*Gold*: Fund 100% of your maximum IRA contribution (likely around $5,500).

*Silver*: Fund 50% of your maximum IRA contribution (likely around $2,750).

*Bronze*: Open an IRA

**Event #6 – Health Savings Account (HSA) – Personal and/or Employer Contributed**

A [Health Savings Account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account) is great if you are eligible for you (you have to have a high deductible health insurance plan). Fortunately (unfortunately?) I don’t qualify so I’m not as familiar with the technical details of an HSA. Still, if you are eligible for one, it is very typically to your advantage to fund one.

*Gold*: Fully fund your HSA.

*Silver*: Open a HSA.

*Bronze*: Determine whether you qualify for an HSA plan (see link above).

**Event #7 – Saving for College – 529 (pre-paid and investment) and UTMA/UGMA plans**

I consider a 529 plan the gold standard for saving for college for my dependents. You can think of a 529 as a Roth IRA that sometimes has state tax benefits. You put money in post-taxes (i.e. from your checking account). Any money invested + gains can be withdrawn tax free assuming it is used to pay for qualifying educational expenses for the beneficiary (i.e. your kid).

The one downside to a 529 is that if you don’t use the money to pay for college, you may owe tax and a penalty on the money to take it out of the plan. Basically, if you are unsure as to whether your kid/beneficiary will go to college, a 529 may not make sense.

Now, before the medals are handed out in this category, I want you to do two things. First, compare different kinds of college savings plans [here]( http://www.savingforcollege.com/compare_savings_options/?assigned_to%5B%5D=0&amp;assigned_to%5B%5D=1&amp;assigned_to%5B%5D=5&amp;hiddenField=vehicles&amp;mode=Submit). Second, calculate the expected cost of college and how much you need to save monthly [here]( https://vanguard.wealthmsi.com/csp.php).

*Gold*: Commit to “pre-funding” your required annual contributions. I.E., rather than make monthly contributions, make an entire year’s worth of contributions in January (note, I’m not saying to delay your current contributions…just that you should make your 2017 contributions for the full year in January 2017). More time in the market will help you out over the long run!

*Silver*: Design a plan to be “on track” in terms of college savings. Use the calculator above to figure out this number, and start contributing it today!

*Bronze*: Open up a 529 plan or other type of college savings plan. Bonus tip, Fidelity offers the ability to start these for about $50 if you aren’t able to hit the Vanguard minimum (typically around $3,000).

I've been trading in the FOREX markets since I was 16, and after I dropped out in May, I went to FOREX trading full-time and I'm making a bit over $2500 every month, sometimes more. Not a great amount, but certainly livable. My dad is so disappointed in me, but I just couldn't do it.

Started with trading in Team Fortress 2 and cashed everything out to start on FOREX (after using a demo). In addition,  I love statistics and graphology, and I read a ton. I enjoy what I am doing currently, however I want to start making big amounts. Again, I've been trading for years, but I switched to doing it full-time recently and I have more than enough saved up to risk.

There's a bank that will finance 100% of the price of a home, albeit at a higher interest rate and only if I'm not older than 34. I'll become 35 on December. All other banks will do at most 80%.

If I get 100% financed right now the interest rate will be **3.9%.**

If I wait a few years, save enough money to pay 20% of the home by myself and get only 80% financed, it will be just **2.3%.** In both cases the interest rate is fixed for the whole duration (could be lower if I choose variable).

My concern is that after 2 or 3 years interest rates may rise again and no longer be this sweet. Home prices are also abnormally low right now and I'm wondering if this buyer's bliss will last.

I have a mix of federal and private loans, have only made minimum payments for the past year and want to know if this plan is my best option:

* Consolidate my private loans (~$80,000) and make aggressive payments towards them

It's a simple plan, but I am not 100% certain that it is the best option. I am hoping someone with a lot of experience can chip in on what I'm doing wrong/right and maybe answer some questions. 

Of all the federal repayment plans available (paye, repaye, ibr, icr, is) I see IBR thrown around here a lot. I have read into the others but do not know what would make them better. Can I even qualify for IBR while making $50k? My salary has a chance to creep up and over $100k before PSLF comes along.

personalfinance,"Income nearly doubling, considering implications to my personal financial priorities","Hi PF,

I've been fortunate enough to land a new job that has much higher compensation than my current job. I'm starting to consider the implications of this to my personal financial priorities, and was hoping you all would be able to verify my current proposed plan. I've got a couple specific questions regarding my situation at the bottom of the post.

**Current Debt**

* $13k student loans at 6.55%
* $12k car loan at 3.9%

**Old Salary**

* $82k

**Old Plan**

Employer contributed 3% to 401k (not a match but a gift). After much research on /r/PF I decided it would be best to focus 100% of my extra income on my student loans. Because the interest rate was over 4%, I even pulled my 401(k) contributions so I could use that money for contributing towards paying off my student loans instead. I had planned to fully pay off the  student loans prior to resuming my retirement contributions (1-1.5 years total).

----

**New Salary**

* 160k 

**Proposed New Plan** 

At first, I had planned on continuing my plan to pay off student loans then resume retirement. But now I'm considering something else. I realize that next year (2017), I will be hitting the 401(k) contribution limit and will still be under the recommended 15-20% retirement savings target. This means I will need to supplement with a brokerage account as all tax-advantaged savings opportunities would be exhausted.

Since I know that I won't be able to fully achieve my retirement savings goals next year with tax-advantaged savings alone, this means that the $18k of 401(k) I have access to in 2016 are much more valuable to me than they were before. I'm now considering switching focus from student loans to 401(k) contributions. The plan is I could defer 45% of my paycheck for the next three months and hit my $18k limit for 2016. Any additional money could still be put into paying off my loans, but it would be slower than if I just targeted the loans like I had previously been doing.

**Questions**

1. Does my plan make sense to consider the opportunity cost of taking advantage of tax-advantaged 401(k) in 2016 rather than continuing to sink everything into my 6.55% student loans? 

2. Even though my car loan is below the 4% threshold that is used to determine whether or not you should pay debts off early or focus on retirement/other savings, is my loan close enough to consider paying this off early too? Or would extra money be better used to save even more for retirement or for big ticket items like saving up a downpayment on a house?

3. With such a large increase in income, are there any other implications I should be aware of? Things to watch out for?

Eventually I'll have to start contributing more but we cannot live in this situation forever. My brother is trying to buy a house with his wife and will eventually make us move out because the banks won't loan him money with our house in his name. My mother has put alot of money into this house over the last 11 years, my brother has done jack shit and even took out equity during the housing boom. Our house loan went from  $235,000 to $320,000 due to negative amortization.

My student loans are in deferment because I am taking classes part time to finish an accounting certificate. This would impact my earning potential in the future.I have $13,000 in federal subsidized loans. At first I wanted to be able to buy this house back from the bank when my brother decides to short sell it, because this has been my childhood home, but with the neighborhood deteriorating, and possibility of being out bid, I am thinking about other housing options.

I've been on Disability for about five years, and I'm almost 40. I'm living below the poverty line, but it's the most stable I've been in my entire life, and since I've gotten Medicare I've gotten the most medical answers than I'd gotten my 30 plus years preceding it. I've got a relatively rare genetic condition, and my health will only get more complicated and need more specialized doctors as I age, so I'm too afraid to let go of Medicare (which is one of the few insurances a number of these fancy specialist doctors take).  Medicare is really important to my survival. Even if it weren't. I'm not capable of keeping the kind of job that would provide me a health plan, and I NEED coverage.
   
Here's the stats:   
   
INCOME:   
 $600 - Social Security Disability (SSD)   
 $200 - Supplemental Security Income (SSI)   
   
ASSISTANCE:   
 $200 - Food Stamp Card (EBT)   
   
HEALTH:   
 80% - Medicare (Federal)    
 20% - Medicaid (State)   
meds - Medicaid (over $1,000 a month)   
   
HOME:   
 $600 - Rent   
 $60 - Electricity   
 $35 - phone   
   
With SSI, for every dollar of income I get, SSI gives me 50 cents less.
 
Where I currently live, if I have an income over $1,367 I will no longer be eligible for Medicaid, which means I'd have to pay all of my medications, which would cost me over $1,000 a month, as well as 20% of my overall medical costs.

Also, if I make more than $810 working income in a month, and do so nine times in ten years, I will no longer receive SSD. I would be allowed to remain on Medicare for seven years of a ""trial work period"", after which time I'd be expected to purchase Medicare out of pocket, which is, last I checked, around $600 a month.

I'm trying to find a way out of this medically induced poverty. I'd like to figure out how much money I'd need to be able to see doctors like I currently do. 

I'm sorry, the one factor I don't have the numbers for is how much my doctor visits cost monthly or annually, but it's probably a few hundred a month (I see specialists at Columbia and the Hospital for Special Surgery). 

I will likely need spine fusion surgery in the future, which I think costs as much as a new car. 

I have been looking into organizations that might help me purchase a home. If I could get myself a multi family dwelling, the mortgage would probably be less than I'm paying in rent, and I could collect revenue from renters. Unearned income, like from investments and properties, does not count against my SSD, which would allow me to not only keep my $600 a month, but my Medicare as well. But again, if I have an income more than $1,367 (no matter the source), I will not receive Medicaid and will have to pay 20% of my medical costs. (Unless I get a Medigap plan? I've not looked into that yet.)

I've been working on my credit, as much as I can with such a crap budget, and I've gotten my Fico score up to 690 from 500 a year an a half ago.

Bitcoin,"""They will prevent it.""--Professor Ken Rogoff on Bitcoin","*Video link (thanks u/MRDAT21): http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000548776 

Harvard professor of Economics and former economist at the IMF and Federal Reserve, Kenneth Rogoff, was on CNBC this morning promoting his latest book 'The Curse of Cash'.  

During the discussion it was mentioned that people could switch to bitcoins if cash were restricted. Rogoff answered that bitcoins aren't widely used for transactions but if their use became more widespread ""they would prevent that"" even though they are currently ""allowing some innovation.""   

Rogoff also explains his view of BTC [in this article](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/dangers-of-paper-currency-by-kenneth-rogoff-2016-09):  ""Yes, new-age crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, if not completely invulnerable to detection, are almost so. But their value sharply fluctuates, and governments have many tools with which they can restrict their use – for example, by preventing them from being tendered at banks or retail stores.""  There is historical precedent for such actions. For example when [FDR made it illegal for Americans to own gold] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102). I can see a future when Bitcoin mining is 'temporarily banned' as it 'threatens the economic stability of our Great Nation'.

Make no mistake, the individuals involved in managing the current monetary system are not dummies. Others like [Larry Summers](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/c9bfe780-12b4-11e6-91da-096d89bd2173.html#axzz485T0t7MZ), [Willem Buiter](http://www.businessinsider.com/willem-buiter-central-banks-need-to-drop-money-from-helicopters-and-perhaps-abolish-currency-completely-2012-5), and [Jaime Dimon](http://fortune.com/2015/11/04/jamie-dimon-virtual-currency-bitcoin/) have made similar statements regarding BTC and cash. They fully understand the threats to the fiat monetary system and will co-ordinate with governments to defend that system at any cost.   

While, I appreciate what some in the Bitcoin community have done in terms of working with regulators and trying to craft 'sensible' regulation, ultimately that avenue will likely be fruitless. There are no significant changes to the system that can be obtained via 'voice'. [The only option is to 'exit'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A) and build systems that are resilient to the attacks that will eventually come.",cryptocurrency,1473166844

My house is in pretty pristine condition as I put in about 10k into it, and my credit score is floating around 620. I plan to get it 40-50 points higher in the next few months by paying off some balances on my credit.


Right now I'm paying about $850 a month and am only paying the interest and not the principle. But this is a 15% interest rate and from what I understand the FHA Loans interest rate float around 5% for a mid-high 600's credit score.

They are both in their early 50's (I'm 24 now), and they just had their annual marketing sales pitch meeting that they go to every year. I decided to tag along because I was curious as to what goes down at these meetings. Holy shit what a insane high-stress experience that was! 

Anyway to keep this short, my parents ended up dropping just under 30k to ""upgrade"" their plan from their deeded fixed week to the points system. (the old company Gold Key got bought up by Diamond which used points). They make a really good living and are financially sound so I'm not too concerned about them being stuck in debt for years. I'm more concerned about what the fuck happens to my brother and I after they die years from now. My millennial mind wants nothing to do with timeshares

They were told at the meeting that with their deeded weeks would be harder for us to to get rid of requiring attorneys and such since it's considered real estate, but under the points, if my brother and I don't want the inherited responsibly we wouldn't have to put our names on the contract, say we don't want end of story.

personalfinance,Trying to pay off my debt the most efficient way possible before my gf and I move across the country next year. Am I doing this right?,"Hi Reddit, first post and long time lurker.  

So my girlfriend (28) and I (28) are planning on moving next August from the east coast out to Colorado.  We are big into the outdoors and climbing/hiking so this is going to be really exciting.  My girlfriend currently has no debt and makes about $35k a year working at a vineyard.  She is saving 6 months of expenses for when we go out there and hoping to get a job doing the same thing.  Then it comes to me.  I have about $20k in student loan debt that I am paying off highest interest rate to lowest.  I am part of the VW buyback and should be getting just under $14k in November when they buy back my car.  The rest of my student loans will be paid off by December.  Then I owe my mother $9500 which I plan to tackle next.  Its interest free but its not right if I pay everything i owe first and leave her hanging so I'm going to get that taken care of and my last payment should be made to her in April of 2017.  Lastly at that point I will only have my truck left, which will be about $17k by that point.  I plan to then put everything i was paying straight to that which by August of next year when we move will leave me with $8k left of debt on the truck.  At that point I will be unemployed and have no more income.  

I have $10,000 saved for our move which should be more than needed for the 6 months but hopefully we both land jobs much more quickly than that.  Additional to my debt payments that I am making (almost every free penny I make) I am saving an additional $200/month just as savings.  Now I have a couple questions.  Should I take that $200 and just keep applying it to my payments to pay off my debt quicker?  If so that would leave me with only $6k come moving time.  Additionally my home is worth about $200k and I currently owe $94k, would it be smart to take out a home equity loan which is currently around 4% and payoff all of my debt?  The average of my interest is about 3.75% and I know the home equity loan would be a higher percentage but then the interest is tax deductible.  I'm not really sure how that works out but it seems like a good idea.  I do realize that I may not sell my house before I move and that I might have some costs for a few months after we move until it sells and I have that already covered in a separate savings.  

I really want to get this all paid off and feel what its like to be in the freedom of no debt but I want to also do it the way that makes the most fiscal sense.  I think that I covered everything.  Thanks for your help!!",finance,1473176129

You may roll over your distribution if all of the following apply:

One of the statements below describes your distribution.
- The distribution is paid to you and the rollover is made within 60 days of receipt of distribution. (Note: After-tax contributions cannot be
rolled over as part of a distribution payable by check to you.)
- The eligible “direct” rollover distribution is paid directly from an eligible retirement plan or traditional IRA to your new eligible retirement
plan. Sample wording for direct rollover: Trustees of (name of plan at and account number), FBO (name of participant and
Social Security number). We will advise you on the exact wording of the plan name and account number, and the types of distributions that
can be rolled over into this plan.

personalfinance,$125k in Under Grad Debt (25y/o) - Need Help!!!!,"Hey Everyone,

I'm in need of some assistance, so I graduated from a private catholic school back in May of 2013 with about $120k in student loan debt (all undergrad). I pretty much financed my entire education through student loans with the help of my parents (whom didn't/don't know much at all about financial planning). 

By the time my Junior year rolled around I took a look at my loans to see that I had already accrued almost 20k in interest with still a year and a half left of school, so I knew my interest rates were high but had nothing to compare them too but now that I'm doing some research I'm finding my rates are WAY too high.

I'm at the point now where I've run out of forbearance for my federal loans and will need to start paying those off in the next 30 days or so which means I need to make some adjustments

I've been paying my private loans on time but primarily at the minimum payment which just under $1,000 a month for the past 3 years or so and the large portion of that goes to paying off interest. Right now my private loans vary between 8.6-11.25% interest rates which again is way too high.

On top of advice when it come to refinancing private loans I was wondering if anyone had advice for me on how to best pay back my federal loans as well. I know there are a few different options but they all seem to be very similar so I'm not sure where to start. As of now it has me paying an additional ~$300 bucks a month which, would really cripple me. 

I currently have a great 9-5 at a well known tech company, as well as work weekends for a catering company which pays alright. Overall I make about 50-55k a years I would say and have lived in my parents basement for the last 3 years without at end in sight. 

Ideally I would love any advice that could potentially help me better my situation. Feel free to ask any questions!!! Thanks everyone!",finance,1473180454

personalfinance,"TIFU by subscribing to Discover's ""Payment Protection Plan""","Hi Reddit, 

I just want to tell you a little story about how I thought I was being fiscally responsible but in fact was getting screwed by my credit card company.  So I got this credit card when I graduated high school.  Figured I would use it to buy gas then pay it off and it would be a good way to build my credit score.  A couple years later I received an email saying that they had a new service, their ""Payment Protection Plan.""  What I thought this was: I would pay a small monthly fee and if I ever messed up and missed a payment, they would waive it.  Months went by, I occasionally noticed a couple dollars pop up on my bill to that effect, never something I bothered to glance at twice. I graduated, I got a job, everything was going pretty well.

I got another email, they had a new offer where I could write a check for a balance and either pay 0% interest for 12 months with a 3% initial fee, or for 18 months 4% interest and no fee.  I was about to move, and needed some furniture.  I also had a few student loans with interest rates around 7%.  I crunched the numbers and figured out that I could write myself a check for a few thousand dollars and as long as I payed it off within the 18 months I would effectively be saving money. (Almost never take the fee up front, if you see this).  
A year later, same basic deal, and I was suddenly in between jobs.  Figured I'd do the same thing, make sure I could eat more than peanut butter for the next month or two until my new job started, use the rest to pay off my higher interest loans a bit quicker.  

At this point, I wasn't really using the card for anything. Just paying a few hundred dollars a month and not really looking at the itemized statements.  Last month, I got really busy looking at apartments and jobs and forgot to make a payment by the due date.  Today I finally looked at my statement a little closer.  Not only did I get charged a $27 late fee, the ""payment protection plan"" fees were over $70 for the last couple months.

So I called Discover to see what was going on.  First, why was I charged a late fee if I was paying for a service to not be charged a late fee?  As the guy on the phone explained it to me, the service that I was actually paying for was in case of some life event like loss of job, death in the family, etc where you might not be able to make payments, you can call in and defer payments for a few months.  Not at all what I thought it was originally.  But the real kicker, the fee isn't a flat fee you pay every month.  For this ""service"" (and I struggle to call it that since it literally did nothing for me) the cost is based on your current balance, promotional transfers included.  Since this is the first time I'd ever carried any significant balance, I didn't notice that before, and they sure didn't make it clear when I signed up.  The fees were more than 2.5x my interest charges.  I complained.  He told me that he could remove the $27 late fee and, if I cancel the ""service"", this month's fee as well.  

So all in all, I ended up paying over $300 for the privilege of calling in to complain and getting a $27 late fee removed from my account.  I don't consider it a wise investment.  Hopefully someone here can learn from my mistakes and keep a closer eye out for these sorts of ""services"" in the future.",finance,1473186379

My dad was always good with money, and despite him having a number of health problems I seemed to think he'd always be there to guide me with my money. So in total he left my brother and I about $1.3 million to split. We kept about $100,000 in a joint account as a safety net due to some legal action against my dad before he died, and ended up with about $600,000 each (tax-free, I believe). I've really been putting off dealing such a large amount of money and just trying to get over losing my favorite person, but I know I need to get things figured out to secure the future that my dad had hopes for.

For some background, I am a 30-year-old female with a husband (who I will describe later...), 3 dogs, 2 cats, and a turtle. I'm a veterinarian, in case you were wondering about the animals. I graduated vet school in 2013 and have been working towards board certification to specialize in small animal surgery, but I'm currently still a resident for 2 more years making around $40,000. I expect to at least start around $140,000 once I'm boarded, but I would like to get started with retirement and saving for children now. Ideally I would not stay in Massachusetts after my residency, I would like to look at what jobs are available and have the option to move anywhere I please. 

The trouble is my husband. I love him to pieces but he's not great with money. He has about $100,000 in student loan debt, $40,000 credit card debt, and a car payment of which I don't know the total (I think $250 a month?). He finally shredded his last two credit cards and deleted them from Amazon so that he can't use them, and is paying $2,000 a month to pay them off. But he's been doing that for about 7 years now and hasn't made much headway. When I first received the insurance money I fulfilled my promise to my dad and paid off my crazy vet school loans ($212,000, up from $186,000 when I graduated...), and paid off my credit card debt ($8,000). I matched my credit card debt with my husband's, but that only made a dent in his and brought him to the $40,000.

So anyway, if you're still following I'm at a current total of about $400,000 that I need to make plans with. I already plan to open up a roth IRA and then wanted to put a good amount of it into some low-risk mutual funds, and plan to meet with a financial advisor regarding those plans soon. I don't have the option of a 401K yet because I'm just a resident but as soon as I have a real job I plan on doing that as well. But I have some other things I need advice on, if you wise financial redditors could please help:

1. I kind of sort of want to buy a house. I hate my current living situation (but it's only $1200 a month with utilities and all that), I have an old yellow lab that is struggling with all of the stairs in the house and stairs to even get down to the yard to go to the bathroom, we only have off-street parking and no in-unit laundry (our absentee landlord doesn't even allow us to install laundry machines, for some reason), and the landlord put the house on the market last year without even telling us so I have a feeling we may need to be able to move out at any time. I would prefer to rent because I would like to have the option to move anywhere for a new job in 2 years, but renting is difficult with the amount of animals I have and the limited money I have to contribute to rent in expensive-ass Massachusetts. My husband is very gung-ho about buying a house, but it is not his $150,000 to put down (so that we can afford mortgage payments). For my dog and I's quality of life I would love to buy a house, but is it a terrible idea if I'm only guaranteed to be here for 2 more years? 

2.  My husband and I talked about me paying off his credit card debt and then him paying me back, to avoid the increasing interest rates, but is this just asking for marital problems? I feel like if I do it or don't, either way it's going to cause a strange rift between us. What I really want is for him to see a therapist and a financial advisor to deal with his own shit, but I also kind of feel like we are a partnership and I should be helping him with what I have. He also has the student loan debt, and he currently works for a non-profit company that after 10 years of working there will lead to loan forgiveness. So leading back to the buying a house thing, we could stay here longer so he can keep his job and get rid of his student loans, I'm just afraid of not finding a job here after my residency is over with.

3. Does anybody have any advice on picking mutual funds, and do I have enough money to set up the roth IRA, put $150,000 down for a mortgage on a house, have about $50,000 saved somewhere as an emergency fund, and then put the rest into a safe mutual fund to keep me from spending it?

Ok sorry this was so long-winded. Just very complicated, for me at least. I still plan on meeting with a financial advisor but any advice that you folks have would be very much appreciated.",finance,1473186721

personalfinance,18 year old with no idea where to head in life (UK),"Hi all, first time posting here as it's the first time I have no idea what I'm doing.

Back story:
I left school at 16, and went Into a software development apprenticeship, completed that, have worked over a year full time at current work location. 

After passing my driving test as 17 I bought a fairly nice car through a personal bank loan of which the total loan was £14000, this was 16%~ interest rate and it sorted my car and a few other things. 

The repayments are about to start which are £329 a month for 60 months, or around 20.5k if I see out the entire loan. 

Now, another part of the story is I've just accepted a 15k (12k after medical bills) settle figure from an insurance claim for when I was hit by a truck 3 years ago. This is due in the next few weeks to be in my bank.

The final part to the story is that I've just been headhunter from my current company, to a new one where my income will be roughly 2k a month take home. I currently live at home and pay 200 a month rent to my family. 

I'm not sure what to do with the 12k, whether to clear the car (mostly) to kill the interest, or to save it so if anything with the new job goes wrong I have 6-7 months pay to live off of, to then invest into a house (either to let out or live in myself) 

I'm all abit overwhelmed as currently all I've had to do with my wages are pay my old car payment and my rent and do whatever else with what I have (spending everything pay check to pay check like an idiotic teenager) 

I currently have an isa where I get 3% upto £3000 in there but it's empty and about 800 in my account.

Any advice would be appreciated!!

personalfinance,Worth it to withhold student loan payments,"I recently changed jobs to a position that pays significantly more. While I was out of work, my student loan payment plan ($56,000 total still owed) came up for recalculation, and since I had no income at the time of the recalculation, my current expected monthly payment for the next 12 months is $0. 

I have roughly $5000 in credit card debt and outstanding personal debt, with an average interest rate of ~23.6%, while the student loans are consolidated at 5.25%. My new position will allow me to continue paying on my student loans at about $500-600 per month and pay the credit cards down at a rate of about $800-900 per month, or I could pay down the credit cards at about $1500/month and have them paid off in 3-4 months, then resume making the student loan payments, probably closer to $1000 per month.

Doing this will prohibit me from putting a significant amount into savings per month, which was slightly depleted from when my last contract ended until I started my new job, but I have enough in there currently to cover my bills and expenses for at least 2 months. Is it worth it to withhold the payments on my student loans while they're not expected?

I did the math and it looks like my student loans are accruing interest at a rate of ~$239 per month, while the credit cards are accruing at a rate of ~$89 per month, and the break even point between the two options would be about 10 months down the road.",finance,1473190179

personalfinance,Save up to pay off loans or ride them out?,"I am planning well in advance but I'm interested in this sub's feedback on my plan. I currently have approximately $35k in student loans. I am on IBR. In addition to my monthly payments, I save $600 a month in a savings account with 1% interest, which will be used to pay off loans in full once I've accumulated enough savings. In January 2019 I will have two student loans left with the following balances and interest rates:

1. $7000 at 1.625%
2. $2600 at 0.07%

Would you:

a) Continue to save $600/month and pay them both off by December 2019?

b) Just ride them out? The interest on these is negligble. By 2019, on the higher loan it will be about $10/month. On the smaller loan it will be $0.15/month. As I noted earlier, my savings account has an interest rate of 1%. There's no way of knowing whether it will be higher or lower in a few years, though.

I'm wondering if it would be better for my credit score to have consistent payments toward a loan instead of being entirely debt free? That seems silly now that I type it out, but I could swear I've heard that advice before. There's also the nice perk of doing something else with $600/month, which after several years of this is very enticing.

It’s through WellsFargo, but I’m not exactly sure what the Expense Ratios are yet for that one.

I’m assuming I calculated this out correctly… 
So… my new job is a 3 year contract, so I will not be in the WellsFargo 401k for too long, not enough to even get fully vested on that piddly match. I still intend to join it but not really expecting much. They offer:


Target date funds | Expense Ratio

I understand that expense ratios are a big factor, but not only factor to take into consideration for the 401k. When looking at historical returns which numbers should I focus on? 3 year because I expect that to be my term of employment? 5 year and “10 year/since inception*” because it’s the longest values? I’m only 28, so I have heard that choose riskier while young since you have time to recover from losing it should you lose it… 

I also intend on opening a Roth IRA. I decided to go with a Roth because I’m an extremely cautious person and like the idea of being able to take out my own contributions if need be (I understand that only applies to the initial contribution and not what I make on it, as well as the fact I should avoid it unless absolutely need be because is for retirement).

For the Roth, can I just do a onetime payment of $5,500 right now and then not worry about it until next year? Or does it act more like a 401k where I have to deal with payments through paycheck and can’t just decide to suddenly dump a bunch in out of bank account? 

In addition to these two investment possibilities, I’ve been putting 500/mo into my mortgage. My mortgage rate is only 4.125%, but feel so much more comfortable about putting money directly into it than investing, so this part is going to stay, even if I end up having to drop how much I can invest into the 401k because of it. I’ll try to max out Roth every year regardless, but 401k might drop to 3% just for match if need be. I know that investing should “expect a rate of around 7% when investing in the long run” and should invest over putting into house, but I’ve already removed 2 years off mortgage from last 11 months of this input, and really like the idea of paying off house sooner than later. Besides, it’s a reliable “return”.


I have 19.1k in the current account. My options are:

* Leave it there for time being, but at .83% expense ratio that doesn’t seem like best course. 

* Rollover to new 401k at WellsFargo when it becomes available in a month

* Rollover to a Roth IRA. How is it taxed? From what I read it appears to be a straight 20%, is this true? I don’t have to worry about state taxes?  I’d also be in the 25% tax bracket, so lower than Federal… So if its at 19,100 now and they keep 20% for taxes it’ll rollover and become 15280? Can I choose to pay taxes on it myself so I keep the 19,100 inside the Roth but pay an additional $3,820~ or whatever so I can have a higher amount invested?
Which Roth provider do you recommend? I see Vanguard mentioned on here all the time, but also see people positive about Fidelity… there are others too and getting slightly overwhelmed with the options and research needed and putting off =/ I’ve been meaning to write a post for last 2 months, and everyday read more and get more and more overwhelmed.

My current thoughts are:

 * 3-10% of salary into the new 401k with 25% Vanguard Total Bond Market Index I Intermediate-Term Bond and 75% WF/BlackRock S&amp;P 500 Index CIT N1 Large Blend. In historical performance for 3-year its 4.04% for the bonds and 11.66% for the BlackRock – this would be a mix of lower risk (bonds) and higher risk (stocks), leaning more towards the higher risk since I’m younger… just a generic guess from half-assed assumptions =/ (I really dislike this whole investing thing…)

* Rollover into the 401k

* 5500/yr into a Roth (thinking Fidelity) with generic target fund,

* And 6k/year into house.

personalfinance,Mortgage questions about lending fees and the bond market,"My wife and I are getting ready to purchase a house. We have had a condo and didn't ask many questions about the mortgage at the time of purchase, but this house is a more expensive purchase and I want to make sure we understand everything properly and make good choices.

Some background information: we are both gainfully employed, have been saving for years and have stable full time jobs. We have very good credit. The home we are purchasing is over $300,000 and we will put 20% down. Within the range of possible rates, we can handle the monthly payments on just one of our salaries without a problem. The payments are not an issue.

Our lender provided us some sample information about potential mortgage rates and lending fees. The lender said that the actual lending fees are dependent on the bond market.

Last week, they told me that a rate of 3.375% would have a lending fee of about $600. The end of the month was last week and they told me today that fees went up as a result of the bond market changing due to numbers on the US jobs numbers and economic position.

Some rates and fees for today were:
3.5%, $50 fee
3.375%, $1,720 fee
2.75%, $11,000 fee

We would not mind paying a reasonable higher fee if we can get a lower monthly payment going forward, but having just seen that very low fee for 3.375%, I did not want to lock-in the mortgage today. We instructed the lender that we'd like to float, and find out about the current rates daily, and that we will jump in when we are ready. 

I had a theory that since markets fluctuate, and it sounds like the fed isn't going to raise rates (and even if they do it'll be a few weeks before the FOMC meets up and anything like that happens) that waiting might help yield a lower fee.

My questions are, does it sound like the lender is speaking the truth about the fees and how the bond market influences them? And more importantly, are my (poor) guesses/assumptions about the market going to bite us, or could there be a chance that I am right? I understand that this is a gamble. The ideal best case scenario is that we get a lower interest rate but still also get the lower lending fee, so that we trim a bit off our already large down payment and other costs, but also pay less in interest over time.

TLDR: I saw a low lending fee last week and a higher one this week. I'm getting a mortgage and think I should wait to lock in in case fees go back down in the next week or two.",finance,1473216933
personalfinance,Looking for advice,"Hi /r/personalfinance 

First of all I've been following this sub for a while now, it's the only default that I sub too and would like to thank this community for teaching me a lot of things that I really had no idea about.

Anyways - what I would like to start with is I am graduating in December 2016 and would like advice on how I can leverage the next few years of my life to set myself up. A little background is I'm a 22 year old in a STEM field and have been offered a really good job in February in an expensive city (Northeast USA).

Basically here is my current financial situation:

1) $34,000 in loans broken down into:

- $24,000 in Federal loans
- $10,000 in private student loans

2) ~$90,000 salary starting in February

3) ~$14,000 to last me until then

4) 724 Credit score with no previous history of credit cards

Things I have done so far:

- Began paying off my expensive private loan (it's 8%)
- Set aside $10,000 in a savings account for an emergency fund, I will need the remaining $4,000 to pay for living until graduation
- Been approved for a credit card to begin building my credit so when I have to begin spending more money I can hopefully find a better card for more rewards.
- Began trying to create a realistic budget for the next year (including moving expenses and possibly a car budget)

I really would love some input though on what you guys have done in your early 20s that allowed you to really get a step ahead financially compared to your peers.

personalfinance,"Buying my first car, specifically for camping adventures. I've done my research, found the right model, but I'd like some different perspective before commit.","Quick background on me: 27yo with a good, stabile job in the tech industry. No credit card debt, and I've never owned a car before because I've never felt like I really needed one. I bike everywhere I need to go on a daily basis. I've recently ('finally', some might say) decided to get a truck so I can get myself out of the city, which led me to optimizing my choice for the trail, rather than the grocery store. 

The car I've landed on is a 2014 or later Toyota 4Runner Trail Premium. It has the features I am looking for, namely reliability, a rear-locking differential, and sunroof (obviously other factors, but those are the defining features). Although older Toyotas are still solid cars, I'm more comfortable getting a newer one as I don't have tools/space/knowledge/patience to maintain an older one. 

I also plan on keeping this truck for 15+ years, and those who I've talk to who have owned a 4Runner for 10+ years say they've been completely satisfied with it the entire time. I realize that is a long time to ""plan"" ahead for, but I can't imagine a scenario where this car wouldn't fit into my life (room for 5 kids!).

The Numbers:
*Cost of car*: $40k, before negotiating  
*Salary*: $83k  
Student Loans: $40k  
Total Monthly Expenses (loans, rent, food, fun): &lt;$2k
Interest Rate from CU: ~2.5%

Although it seems like I can afford this car, I'm afraid that I'm overlooking something important. I've read the ""new car horror stories"" on here, and none of them sound like me. My company is starting a 401k matching program by the end of the year, so part of my income will end up going into that, and I'd like to take a larger chunk out of my student loans, but I've gotten to the point where I would really benefit from having my own car, and I think I've waited long enough.

Anyway, is a $40k car too much for a guy who makes $83k/yr?",finance,1473230170

personalfinance,Potential Banking Overdraft Scam - Check Your Bank Account,"I noticed a new scam my bank was trying to pull over on me today. 

Background: A few years ago the law was changed to prevent banks from automatically enrolling you in overdraft protection. People were getting caught in a cycle of overdrafts and huge reoccurring fees.  The new rules make it so you have to actively enroll in this protection.

Scam: I never signed up for overdraft protection but noticed my bank had enrolled me in an overdraft 'line of credit' with an 11.50% interest rate. Basically if I had overdrafted the bank would have given me a credit on the amount overdrawn and charged me monthly interest until I paid it back. I NEVER signed up for this nor did the bank ever let me know about it. Fortunately I caught it and disabled it.

I've filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as I think the bank is violating the law but I highly recommend you check your account to make sure your bank hasn't automatically enrolled you in this.",finance,1473255773

personalfinance,Sister stole my credit and now I don't know what to do or what's the first step to even take?,"I need help. Sorry if this post goes back and forth. My brain is raddled and I'm new to this.

I am 22 years old female, turning 23 in a couple of months. I was 17 when I found out my sister stole my credit. I was in a hard position. For one, I didn't realize how important credit was being that I was 17. For two, I was still in High School and had no idea what to do. So with that being said, my mom just kind of brushed it under the table. As if it was no big deal at all.

Couple years pass and I try to finance my first car. All I was approved for was a 2002. Not the best car, but it got me from point A to point B. I was also paying 24.9% interest... So after I paid off the car I was paying double for it after my interest rate.

I finally realized how important credit was and that I needed to see what the damage was. I paid for Equifax and one other one? Not sure which one. I had an Entergy bill in my name, opened in 2008. I have a Cox Communication bill in my name, opened in 2008. 3 Capitol One credit cards. 2 or 3 Chase credit cards. And I think that may be it? In 2008 I was 12 years old... Obviously none of the things negatively affecting my credit were from me. Also, my credit score is at a 390... With a paid off car, because of my own doing.

I then briefly spoke to someone who I thought could give me some advise. It was either put my sister in jail, who has adopted a daughter and now married, I let it go and have all of these things on my credit, or file for Bankruptcy. I was told ABSOLUTELY DO NOT FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. I was really confused. My sister is 10 years older than me and the only sibling I have. She pretty much paid for everything as I was growing up, or maybe I did? I looked up to her. I love her. I mean...she's my sister. 

 

Fast fwd a cpl more years I decided after she fucked me over yet again in some sort of way I was going to pursue it and if they investigated enough and found out it was her, shed be going to jail. I was okay with that. I took action and called Chase first, they agreed that it clearly couldn't have been me that opened the credit cards due to public records indicating I was born in 1994. They were going to start the fraud process. They also asked if I would like to get the statements from the credit cards. I said absolutely, I would LOVE to she what she actually used MY money on. So I get excited, call Capitol One, thinking wow this is easier than I expected. Capital One didn't want to hear it. I was told, ""sorry but what you're telling me isn't enough proof that it wasnt you. We have a lot of people open credit cards, run them up and not want to pay them."" I tell them the same thing Chase told me, you can look up public records. Look at my real date of birth, not the one she used. Still I got nothing. Couple weeks pass and I got the statements from Chase. She opened up credit cards just to go shopping. $200 at Champs. $120 getting her hair done. $50 to go buy another pair of shoes. $75 on gas. And it just goes on and on. I mean it would kind of be a diff story if she actually NEEDED the credit cards to help her survive, no. I have pages and pages of what seems to be a mini shopping spree for her. After this, Im completely done. 

I recently then look again and there is a credit card opened in 2014 from Capitol One. I have never in my life applied for a credit card, with that being said, it was her AGAIN. And all my Chase cards are still on my report. 

Just to add the cherry on top, my sister has obviously screwed her credit, my moms, my dads and now mine. Recently went on vacation with me and my boyfriends family, got mad and left. On her way out she stole my boyfriends money out of our end table. Has also used others people children on her taxes obviously without their permission. Steals from every place she steps foot in, LITERALLY. She's an ex stripper who got addicted to the money quick and started sleeping around for more money.. Which whatever, I looked down on her for it, but like I said, she was still my one and only sibling. And no, she actually doesn't do any drugs. AT ALL. 

What I need is some serious advice. WHAT DO I DO TO GET THIS OFF OF MY CREDIT? Do I get a lawyer, which I really cant afford, I live paycheck to paycheck. Make a police report? File bankruptcy? Someone please send me in the right direction. I'm 22 years old and cant do anything until this is gone. Not only is it hard enough to build credit but I'm starting from lower than the bottom.

Thank you guys. And sorry it was so long and all over the place.",finance,1473258887

To preface: Back in May, I made a goal to pay off $22k of student loans off before the end of this year. I make a 90k salary and have to do uber in my spare time to meet this goal. Over the past 4 months, I have done quite well, putting in slightly over $3k a month into the loan. It is now down to about $12k and will be at about $9.5k if I stay on track this month.

The issue is....it's taking a toll on my sanity. Uber is pretty busy in my city, but it is getting boring. I haven't really dated much or socialized. It seems really stupid to most people, but I absolutely hate making goals and not meeting them.

I have found a house, just haggling on price. I'll be using an FHA loan with 3.5% down, so the insurance will be on the loan for the life of the loan. 

The mortgage payment will be about the same as my current rent payment, but the house will give me more space. The house appears move in ready. It's a starter home for me, so I plan on putting in 25 - 30K over the course of five years, where I plan on selling (unless I end up loving it). Interest rate is 3.25% 30 yr fixed. 

I am contributing 15% into my 401K and currently have 2x my annual salary at age 33. I will not have to back off contributions to purchase or to fund the house. It wont wipe out all of my savings, about half of it, so will have to build it back up. PUtting the extra towards the downpayment only saves me like $20 a month, so not worth it. 

I am getting nervous on the purchasing however. Part of me is saying dont do it, keep saving money for a possible down payment in the future. Part is saying it is a starter, I should be able to get more back than I put in, and the insurance wont last forever on the loan as I will be selling. 

Any suggestions? Does buying sound like the better option right now? Any insight? 

Edits because it has been mentioned - after the upfront costs, I would have $10K still in the bank. The 3.5% down it just because I do not plan (right now) being in this house for the rest of my life. Thinking more 5 - 7 years. SO, the 3.5% doesnt make me go fully in up front.",finance,1473270103

**Investments and accounts:**
Checking: About $7,000
Misc Investments: $4,300
401k: $15,500, adding 8% from each check

**Bills**
Rent at grandparents: $225 (don't have to pay utilities)
Car: $325
Car Ins: $180
Phone: $100
Student Loans: $140. I'm on a pay as you earn program. I have 59k in loans so far with a 6.4% interest rate.
Other expenses: Dog food, doggy daycare (when needed), gas, food. This probably equals to $250 per month

**Goals**
Pay off student loans before I'm 100 
Buy a house where a mortgage would be in the ($800 - $1000) range. I also plan to have a buddy live with me and split the payment for a year or two.

I'm a newly enrolled graduate student at a university in Massachusetts. I'm doing an accelerated one year Master's program.  I'm currently living off campus in a house with friends, paying $535 a month plus the cost of utilities. I am unaware of what the utility bill will look like, though I've heard it's marginal with exception to heating in the winter. I have projected that it might raise my monthly rent to $600 some months. My lease is for 9 months and ends in May. 

My tuition is about $15,600 for the year. I applied for, and received a federal unsub loan for $20,500. Since I live off campus, the only ""cost of attendance"" that the ubsub loan is going to is the tuition rate for credits, about $15,600. The remainder I have from the loan is $4741, and I can keep this money by applying for a graduate PLUS loan. I do not think the $4741 will completely cover the cost of rent, which for 9+ months could look something like $5,400. I will also be needing money to spend on groceries and occasional nights out. I have a little over $3,000 saved up, and I'm worried of that running dry with this current situation.

I've been told I can submit an appeal form called Appeal for Cost of Attendance, which would allow me to ask for a larger PLUS loan, however the woman at Financial Services told me I'll be needing to submit the cost of my rent, utilities, transportation in order to receive the appeal. Apparently the cost of my rent and utilities and transportation needs to exceed $3,300 per semester, which is way more money than my rent costs.

I'm not good with money or any of these things, and I was hoping somebody here could point me in the right direction. I don't think I'll have time for a part time job with my accelerated schedule, I should be taking a seminar and 5 graduate level courses each semester.

personalfinance,Job Advice?,"I'm not sure if this is more suited for r/careeradvice but I was looking for some outside perspective on an opportunity that has cropped up unexpectedly.

I began what I consider my first ""big break"" job in my  field back at my current company back in March, making $60,000/year. I am finishing my masters degree in this field this Fall. The average salary rate for the field with a master's degree is $75,000 in my area. 

I was approached by a recruiter via LinkedIn with an opportunity that I align well with that would be in the federal government at an esteemed institution paying $70,000/year.  They want to interview. The commute is very similar. 

My wife and I are paying down credit card debt accrued from our wedding and other life obligations. We also will owe my parents for a loan from a few years back to pay for my degree. We both feel a huge sense of urgency to begin digging out of debt. 

I do like my current role, I like my bosses and I've only been here for 6 months. I've had terrible bosses so I understand the value in that. The company also is well regarded in a city loaded with tech firms. 

Is it a bad idea to jump ship that quickly, and is $10,000 enough to make a switch? The job is in the next state but the income taxes are pretty much the same between the states.

My gut also tells me getting a gig in the government would be a really good thing and I think I would like the subject matter I'd be working on. 

I have about 3 years experience in this field and my original plan was to log a full year at this company and then leverage it to land in the high 70s-low 80s salary range in the spring 2017. 

Does anyone have any advice? Also any perspective on working for the federal government?",finance,1473280870
personalfinance,"Was a student of ITT Tech, which recently got shut down. Just found out I'm not eligible for loan discharge.","I stopped attending ITT Tech earlier in March of this year. The ""education"" they were providing was piss poor, I was learning nothing and did almost no work yet I was passing with A grades. There were almost no tests except for the finals, which you got to skip if you had perfect attendance and if you had to take them they were open book. There were times when I would show up to class and we would literally do nothing but make smalltalk; no work was actually done and after an hour we were all dismissed. Classes started late and ended early, the labs they gave you often involved watching old YouTube videos that were several years old, half of which no longer even existed. The non-YouTube labs often did not even function and in one of the classes I was taking we did not do any of the required labs at all whatsoever because the starter files for the labs were so old that they would not load correctly on the software they had installed in the lab computers. Even the instructors, who I find difficult to actually call ""instructors"" as they did nothing but read verbatim from poor-quality powerpoint slides, complained about the curriculum.

The instructors were so disconnected and uncaring about actually giving their students an education that I tested them; I started renaming old lab files that I had completed in prior sessions and uploading them as if they were the new labs that were due. I received 100% passing grades on them. They don't even grade your work, they just look to see if there's a file there with the correct name and give you a passing grade. The place was a complete and total joke.

I signed up for ITT because I was being pressured by my parents to go to college, and they suggested I give this school a look since there was a local campus nearby and I would supposedly receive a degree in less time than a traditional college. Being young, ignorant, and caring a lot less about my future than I should have, I just sped along through the enrollment process without doing any research. Biggest mistake and regret of my life.

After only one of the four years I was supposed to attend, I got completely fed up with the quality of education I was receiving and dropped out. Luckily I did so just in time, because it turns out that after that first year my federal student loans were already very dangerously close to the federal loan limit (ITT is stupidly expensive, one of many things I would have learned if I did any research at all), and if I were to attend for another semester I would have had to take out private loans to continue my education. They never explained this to me when I was enrolling, they told me that my federal student loans would cover the costs of my education and didn't tell me that a limit to the amount of student aid I could receive even existed.

Shortly after dropping out I also learned that even thought the school claims to be accredited, they are only nationally accredited rather than regionally accredited. Which basically means any credits I earned from ITT are worthless and wont transfer to actually reputable colleges and even if they didn't shut down and I pulled out private loans to continue studying there, the degree I would receive would mean almost nothing to potential employers.

While I admit that I could have avoided this entirely if I bothered to do any amount research about the school, I still feel cheated and am now burdened with a $27,000 debt that I have to start repaying next month. So you can imagine the joy I felt when I learned that ITT was shut down by the government yesterday and that I had the possibility to get my loans discharged. However, I just learned today that because I dropped out in March, I am not eligible because ITT was shut down over 120 days after I stopped attending. So now I'm being punished because I decided to cut my losses and stop attending rather than choosing to continue going to that worthless scam they call a ""school"". If I had stayed there for one more quarter I would be eligible for loan discharge, but because I didn't now I have to pay $27,000.

I am very disappointed with the lack of support that Federal Student Aid has given me. I feel like an idiot for getting myself into this situation and I feel even worse because I dropped out just one quarter too soon to have my loans discharged. What other options do I have? ITT doesn't deserve a single cent but it looks like I'm going to be forced to pay for my mistake for years to come.",finance,1473281009

personalfinance,"I'm (19M) am about to start my second year of college. My financial aid and school loans are inaccessible for an unclear amount of time, and my family and I cannot pay the fees I have been billed","Last year the financial aid my school offers covered my expenses through a large grant and federal loans, each paying for about 50% of my expenses, which are fairly high since I am an out of state student. Throughout the summer I have been working on giving the financial aid office for my school the required documents they need to give me my aid. Problems arose after sending them my mother's tax transcript from the IRS. In 2015 my mom was married, but her husband is from the UK and was unable to work, so she filed as Head of Household for that year. The financial aid office at my school told us that they needed my mom to change her filing status to Married Filing Separately in order to give me my aid. A few weeks ago my mom mailed all of the necessary paperwork to change her filing status to the IRS, and we started to wait. 

We called the IRS a few days ago and found out that this process could take up to 12 weeks. This is an issue because I currently have a balance of $16,911, which does not include food or housing, that must be payed to the school by September 15th. My school has a payment deferment plan option, which I looked into. If we use the payment plan and pay for the expenses out of pocket, instead of using fin aid or loans, the money we spend would be reimbursed back to us as soon as my financial aid is sorted out; however, in order to start this payment plan, we must pay the first payment of $7,618 which would be due September 15th as well. We do not have enough money to pay that amount. 

I contacted my school about not being able to pay this amount, and they extended the due date until October 6th, but it will still be a long shot for us to come up with that money by then. We've looked into getting a home equity line of credit, but my mom is unable to get one. Right now I am thinking about getting a private student loan either through Wells Fargo, or Sallie Mae, and then paying off those loans as soon as I am reimbursed via financial aid, but is there a better option I am not seeing?

If anyone has any advice or suggestions for what path I should take to resolve this issue, I would greatly appreciate the help. I apologize for any errors in this post, I'm a little frantic and stressed right now.",finance,1473283144

personalfinance,~$110K debt student loan debt: what are my options for consolidating/refinancing?,"Okay, reddit - would love your help.

I have about $110K of student loan debt (that is the balance left). I have 2 federal loans (~$16K), a state loan (~$30K), and 4 private loans (~$65K). Right now, my total monthly payments total almost $1,000 - an entire paycheck, basically. Most of these are on aggressive payment plans - 10 years - which is just not feasible with my income (details below).My parents help by paying about half, and I pay the other half ($500/$500)

However, I am trying to cut my parents out of my finances. After going through a difficult health situation last year they took control of all of my finances and while that started out as hugely helpful, as it was something concrete that they could help me with during a difficult time, it has become nearly manipulative. Plus, they insist that I stay on this 10 year payback plan, which is clearly not working.

On top of my loan payments, my monthly expenses are: car payment (250), insurance (unsure, parents have been paying this bundled with theirs for a while, but probably 200ish), rent (700) and utilities (100-150 depending on summer/winter), and my gym membership (40, non-negotiable, necessary for mental health). Plus food, obviously. 

My salary is close to $50K per year, about $2400 gross monthly income. I can't really take on a second job for many reasons that I won't get into, but that would be a very last resort situation. I am currently job searching for something that pays higher (I have good experience, just haven't had any growth in my company), but it may take a while as I am looking to change industries. I also want to get this under control and not rely on a salary to fix it - I want to be able to take the right job, since my current job is soul sucking and miserable. 

I have about $7,000 in other debt (credit cards) that would be so manageable if it weren't for the massive loan payment each month. 

So here are my questions:
1) Can I consolidate all of my loans into one and stretch out the payment plan? Like, can I combine federal with private and make it a longer payment plan?
2) What about an income based payment plan? Would that be an option for me? 
3) Would debt management be a good option for me?

Sorry for the long schpiel, wanted to get as much out there so that hopefully y'all have enough info to help out. 

tl;dr - HELP ME! What are my options for managing $110K of student loan debt, which are a combo of private and federal? 

Note: I looked into working with a financial counselor through an organization near where I live, but it was $100 for the session. And like hi, I'm trying to figure out what to do about all my debt, so I don't really have $100 to spend so someone can tell me how to have $100 to spend! Which is why I'm here :)

personalfinance,"24, 31k in student loan debt with no degree","I went to college straight from high school and couldn't afford it. My parents were bad with money and hadn't filed their taxes in years, so I couldn't fill out FAFSA and get aid. I didn't do too well in high school so I didn't even bother with scholarships. To be able to attend college I took out loans that were cosigned by my grandfather, who is now dead. I took out $31,698 in loans for my first year away at my dream college that stand today as follows:


18,273.19 @ 7.5% $184.26 a month payment

8,755.49 @ 9.5% $155.47 a month payment

2,681.39 @3.15% $34.27 a month payment

1,762.29 @ 6.55% $25.87% a month payment


That's $31,472.36 total, paying $399.87 a month, which my mom takes care of. Last year she paid over 4k in interest alone. 


I have a job that pays $13/hr and I usually work 30 hours a week. After taxes it comes out to about $1,120 every month. I live with my parents and they pay for everything, my expenses are only my cell ($48.77/month) and Netflix ($9.99/month). I used to have around 3k in CC debt that I worked to pay off completely. 


My circumstances are that I only have 14 college credits; most of my credits at the ""dream school"" didn't transfer to the community college I attended after I came to my senses. My ambitions are to finish at the community college, transfer to a cheap state school, then go to graduate school for social work and get an LCSW. I'm not sure if I'll be able to do all of that realistically because I have a serious mental illness that's pulled me down a lot in the past. However I am able to work, while most of the people who have what I do aren't able to work, and I did have top marks in college. I'm not sure that I'd be able to handle the stress of working and going to school, I feel barely able to do one at a time and still manage to pull good grades/not get fired. I'm on Medicaid due to income level, so my ~$900 in meds/psychiatrist visits are covered completely. The cut off for this assistance is $23,400 year. 


My therapist suggested that since I never filled out FAFSA and payed higher as a result I should contact my old school or LegalZoom and see if they can retroactively reduce the total loan amount. I think that's crap advice but I figured I'd mention it anyway.


What do I prioritize here? I want to pay down the highest interest rate loan first, or at least more aggressively than the others. I also want to go back to school but now seems like a bad time. I'm not happy with be saddled with debt, not even having an associate's, and depending on my parents who are getting older and don't have life insurance yet. What do I do?

Please do your own do diligence on any stock before purchasing!

Pepsi’s dividend is extremely safe, and at a 3% yield its worth picking up. We are comfortable with Pepsi’s ability to continue paying its dividend and expect ~7% annual dividend growth over the next few years. Pepsi is expensive on traditional valuation metrics, and like many of the dividend stocks has been bid up by income focused investors and low interest rates. Pepsi’s payout ratio (this is the amount they pay to investors in dividends compared to the amount they actually earn, lower is better) should remain in the 60% range. Pepsi has been raising its dividend for over 25 consecutive years, its a great brand that will still be a great brand when your daughter is 25+.

We also like Macy’s, although it is a bit hairier than Pepsi, the thesis with Macy's is you get a solid growing dividend, and a great real estate portfolio which could be sold for extra valuel. This story partially played somewhat as management announced they would close 100 stores and selloff the excess real estate, the stock moved up about 17% that day. We think there is more upside in the real estate and still see a rising dividend as likely. Macy’s yield is down from the 4.5% yield at the start of August but we still think its attractive at 3.6% as of the end of August. Macy's payout ratio is 45% and has been raising its dividend every year over the past 12 years.

Finally, we like Whole Foods Mart, even though the company has seen investor sentiment turn away from them.Lower earnings and a slowdown in same store sales and store growth has kept investors negative on the name. Still, we think WFM management is strong, and the business is much stronger in terms of margins than its grocery store peers. The dividend is quite low at only 1.7% but we expect this to continue growing. WFM also repurchases a lot of shares, which is another form of capital return.

But...we agree with Warren Buffet, and suggest most investors buy a basket of stocks, which can be purchased via an ETF. Why buy one Dividend stock where a single bad event can impair your capital for a long long time. When you can buy a whole bunch like with the [S&amp;P500 Dividend Aristocrat Index](http://smartdividendstocks.com), this offers diversification, a decent dividend, and the safety of owning 50 of the best stocks in the world.",finance,1473304278

Let me start with some background. My husband has pretty severe PTSD and has no stress management skills.

He works, but only in small increments and barely enough to keep us from the streets. He knew today that we owe last month and this month in rent. He told me just now that the rent check that we wrote will bounce because our insurance company took out our payment (after he already told me that he got ahead of it and told the insurance company that we would have to delay payment and that they were on board with that) so now we will have to figure out how to pay for two months of rent by the end of the month or we are out.

We also have nowhere to go if we get evicted because my parents are Narcissists and his family is as broke as we are with 12 kids. I'm at a loss. 

EDIT: I appreciate all the helpful replies as they've given me some great ideas to figure this out. I don't think it's entirely fair to tear down my husband based on my post. Accusing him of not having PTSD or using his disorder as an excuse is not really helpful to me at all. Also, I don't know if I wasn't clear enough, but I love my husband and I don't plan on leaving him, so please stop sending me PMs to prostitute myself out. I have enough on my plate as it is. 

As for my plan, we talked and he's going to be attending the Stress and Anxiety Management classes at the VA until he can attend the PTSD Basics classes there as well. I also will be setting up some purchasing alerts or confirmation systems to prevent unauthorized purchases.

I also feel like I didn't give him enough credit earlier. He does work as much as he can. He puts in around 2-3 hours a day minimum or a full 10 hours max. He was bringing in around $2K every two weeks, but then we had the baby under emergency conditions and that threw us off financially. We've been trying to recover since May, but with just the two of us and no help from family in regard to the house or the baby, it's very hard. He has been doing so well with things up until this month. This spending started in August and I'm not sure what's going on with that, but we're getting it under control together. 

Thank you to everyone who commented. I'll keep responding and listening to everyone's guidance.",finance,1473323678
personalfinance,Should I pay off my school loan?,"I'm wondering if I should pay off my student loan with my savings. I currently live rent free at home (at 26 years old) and have minimal bills. I also want to start budgeting to be able to move out and live on my own as well. Those options are renting a room ($700-$800) or studio apartments and one bedrooms ($990-$1,300 per month).

I'm technically a year and a half ahead of time for my student loan payments but I really want to pay it off. It was for grad school and I didn't finish so it bothers me to have to pay it every month. 

I just got a new job with a pay cut from my previous job. With advice from family I decided to get the highest insurances my company offers (they take 360 from my pay checks every month) I probably make around: $1,980 per month after taxes and insurance.

I decided to pay 1,000 this month in order to prepare how to learn to budget on a small amount of money (pretending the 1,000 is for rent). But would it be better to just pay off the loan entirely from the money in my money market account? It took me three years to save up this amount money.",finance,1473323850

personalfinance,"Got a very odd collections call today, if any has advice it would be greatly appreciated.","Back in 2010 (six years ago) I was an idiot.  I got myself into a lot of debt, did a lot of stupid things, and ended up taking out a few payday loans to make ends meet.  I realize how insanely foolish that was for a lot of reasons.  I'm in a great financial position now, life is good and I'm on a great path.

In 2010, I got a total of three payday loans for $200, and $250 was automatically taken out of my account the next paycheck.  I requested a fourth through a web form, but decided against it and never signed and returned the documentation that was sent to me.  For some reason, they still deposited $200 in my bank account for the loan I never signed for, and never took out the corresponding $250.  Being young, stupid, and out of options, I never pursued it.

However, I got a very odd phone call yesterday.  The person left the following message:

This is a courtesy call from XXXXXXX, I am a licensed process server that has been retained by Asset Revival Services.  The records here indicate that you have not repaid the payday loan you have received from the respective client.

They are offering you at this point the opportunity to settle this matter for a percentage of what is legally owed.  This is a one time opportunity to settle this matter, so if it is something you would like to settle on a voluntary basis please call Asset Revival Services at XXXXX.

If you would like the opportunity to resolve this situation and avoid litigation altogether, please contact me at XXXXXXXX.  &lt;My name&gt;, you have been legally served.

I know there are people here who are very knowledgeable in debt collections, etc...how much trouble am I in here?

personalfinance,Credit Cards 202: beyond the basics,"Followup from [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51lcoq/so_tell_me_about_credit_cards_already/), here are some more things to know about credit cards, beyond credit and interest rate.

1.  Banks [make money](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/credit-card-companies-money/) from you on interest and fees, including late fees and annual fees.  You can control those; you don't have to pay any interest or fees unless you do something you agreed to.  They make money from merchants on interchange fees of 2 to 4 percent. Merchants do not usually charge more for credit transactions, though [they could](https://www.cardfellow.com/charging-customers-a-credit-card-convenience-fee-at-check-out/)
in some cases.  [Interchange fees are higher](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/11/how-american-express-visa-and-mastercard-set-merch.aspx) if the card is not physically present, if you are getting rewards, and on American Express transactions.

2. Your ongoing rewards come from these interchange fees.  Initial spending bonuses come from the bank as a marketing cost. You can choose [different types](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/help/types-of-credit-cards-6000.php) of rewards: cash, miles, or points that turn into cash or miles.  You have to decide which you want, there's no universally best choice. (Asking someone else what is the best card for you is generally futile, since they won't know what works best for you.)  Cash is, well, cash. Miles/ points can be worth [more than cash](http://viewfromthewing.boardingarea.com/2016/01/19/value-of-miles/), but only if you would spend them anyway. The best initial spending bonuses will be  miles / points.  If you don't mind the impact of getting additional cards and can meet the spending targets, the best rewards percentages come from collecting initial spending bonuses; these can be 10% or more of that initial spending.

3. The very best initial spending bonuses come from cards with annual fees; you have to factor that into the equation, but you still can come out ahead in the same 10% range on initial spend, especially if fees are waived first year. 
You may not want to keep paying annual fees, though, so this is where a [product change](http://creditcardforum.com/blog/credit-card-downgrades-and-product-changes/) comes in.  Before the fee comes due, you can ask to switch to a card with no annual fee, but keep the same card number, credit limit and history.  You don't get an initial spending bonus with the new product, but you would get other benefits.

4. Ask for what you want; some things are negotiable.  You can sometimes get fees like annual fees or late fees
 [waived](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/how-to-get-credit-card-fees-waived-strategies/) as a courtesy if you are otherwise a good customer and they want to retain your busines.  You can almost always get the [statement billing / due dates changed](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/how-to-change-your-credit-card-bill-due-date-1267.php) to something that works better for you, just by asking.  

5. Let's look at some other things you can get with credit cards.  My Chase Sapphire Preferred card provides [these](http://thepointsguy.com/2015/08/lesser-known-sapphire-benefits/), described in a 47 page
booklet full of small print covering details:  a) car rental collision damage waiver, as primary coverage; I can decline the car rental company ""insurance""  without concern; b) various types of purchase protections, including extended warranty coverage, price protection, and return protection; c) trip cancellation / interruption  insurance, due to e.g. accident/sickness, severe weather, or travel company bankruptcy; d) lost luggage,  trip delay and travel accident benefits.  e) This card also provides no fees on transactions in foreign currencies.  Credit cards provide better exchange rates than cash / ATMs.  

6. We alluded to [consumer legal protections](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/5-key-laws-protect-credit-cardholders-1377.php) previously.  The two cases that are most important to you are:  1) if a card is lost or stolen (or, the number breached in any other way, even if the card is not physically involved...), your liability is [legally limited](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/zero-liability-fraudulent-charges-1282.php) to $50, and in practice, is usually zero. You do not have to pay for charges you did not authorize. Note that in this case, you card will be cancelled and re-issued with a new number, but the same credit limit and history.   2)  if a merchant charges you something you disagree with, e.g. overcharge or defective product, you have the right to contest the charge, and the amount in question will be excluded from your bill until the dispute is finalized.  Debit cards do not have to offer these same protections; for example, lost debit card liability can exceed $50 if not reported in 48 hours, and banks do not need to reverse debit card charges during disputes. 

7. Balance transfers can be helpful if you transfer to a 0% promotional rate card, but watch out for [fees](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/balance-transfer-3/).  You may be charged one-time interest of 3% or so.  Cards from banks like Citibank allow you to [transfer balances from student loans and car loans](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-balance-transfer-credit-cards/), too.  Don't get carried away though, since the term of these loans is very limited, and then interest goes up substantially.  Be sure to read the fine print in your credit card disclosure about how balance transfers and new charges interact in terms of how payments are applied, too.  

8. Cash advances from credit cards are [never a good idea](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/cash_advances-cost-rates-1276.php).  Your credit card is not an ATM card. This also applies to so-called ""convenience checks.""  You are typically charged a one-time fee of a few percent, have a higher interest rate, and, most importantly, you get no grace period on these transactions.  Just say no.   

9. If you have self-employment income, you can apply for a [small business card](https://www.creditkarma.com/article/reasons-to-get-separate-card-for-business-81215).
This allows you to keep business expenses distinct from personal expenses, which can be helpful at tax time.  Some small business cards also [do not report against consumer credit bureaus](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/qa-business-credit-cards-affect-personal-credit-score/), which may be a help if you want to minimize the impact of business utilization on your personal credit score.  (But you could not use this to help your consumer credit history.)

10.  Final plug for being responsible.  Only use a credit card as you would use an old-school charge card, where you pay off the balance in full each month. We've already explained that paying the minimum only is a disaster, but then that's exceeded if you become 60 days late on payments, which will invoke not only late fees, but also [penalty interest](http://blog.credit.com/2014/03/penalty-apr-on-my-credit-card-78900/) of 30% for at least six month. This can also result in increased interest rates on cards that you are not late on!",finance,1473341980

personalfinance,Paying Off My House and Using a HELOC to Fund Business,"I wanted to get a couple peoples opinion on the following strategy I have been thinking about over the past couple weeks to see if it makes sense. I am the 100% owner of an S Corporation and have excess cash in the business that I am looking to withdraw. I have about $200K in cash and another $100k in inventory. The 200K is currently doing nothing but at the same time I need to have a large amount of cash available to purchase inventory and to have a strong position with suppliers. For this reason, I don't want to invest this money in any kind of stock, bond or fund where I cannot readily withdraw the money without taking a large penalty.

Here comes my idea. I own a home and owe around $140K with an interest rate of 4.25% on it. I was thinking about dispersing a large amount of the money to my personal account to completely payoff this home loan. I would then apply for an establish a home equity line of credit (HELOC) for $100K. Typical interest rates are the same as my current interest rate on the home loan. I would use this similar to a business line of credit except the interest rate will be much lower, and draw upon this line of credit as I needed it to purchase inventory.

I would have the following benefits from this plan. for each month that I don’t use it I would save at least $450 a month in interest. If I do need to borrow a large amount of money from the HELOC the interest I would pay each month would still be lower than what I am paying now. I would be leaving $50K in the business which would be enough to work with. If extra cash is need immediately I also have access to a business line of credit for a similar amount but the interest is 3x higher.

Please give me feedback on this idea and what issues I might run in to.",finance,1473347194
personalfinance,Debt collector says I owe them over $800 but hasn't shown why,"I had tonsils out in late December. Copay for 2015 had already been met for insurance (I'm still on my parents at 22) since my younger brother broke his arm in fall.

I decided to check my credit last month and saw a debt collection for over $800. I had no idea what it could have been, and hadn't received anything in the mail, e-mail, or phone calls. The name on it matched a previous $50 charge on my bank debit card from a few months prior that I had reported as fraudulent because I never authorized it. I had no idea how that place got my card information, but I assumed it was just a fluke and somehow it goofed.

I decided to send them an e-mail to find out what the collection was for. They called and told me it was for a balance from the surgery center I had my tonsils done at.

I did some digging in my voicemail and found a message left by the surgery center saying that the balance for my surgery was $49 and some change, and that was all that was on my account. I paid that within two weeks. I told the debt collector this, they said it was out of their hands and I had to talk to the surgery center. I have the voicemail saved.

So my mother and I talk to her insurance, we have to do a 3-way call with the surgery center so that they can go over that it should have been covered, yadda yadda. Been waiting to hear back from the surgery center for 2 weeks now about them telling the collection agency they messed up.

I just got a voicemail today from the collector offering to ""possibly settle your account at a lesser amount, between 25 and 75% off and have the account deleted from your credit file.""

personalfinance,How much to budget for a house with large student loans but a solid salary,"I'll be graduating law school in December and will have about $180k in debt (I could have gone to a much cheaper school but made the choice to go to a top school in order to make sure I had a choice of jobs). Consolidated, the federal loans will have around a 6% interest rate, but I'll be able to take care of about half of it (maybe 2/3-3/4) by using my parent's credit line and get that portion down closer to 2.5-3%, so I'll also be making payments on that. If I do this before it capitalizes and consolidates, my interest rate on the federal loans will be lower because I plan on taking out the higher interest loans first.

The loans won't capitalize and leave deferment until August, but I'll be able to start working at my job in March or April. I'll be making $100k a year, but will be leaving that job in September for one year to work for a federal judge at $60k/yr. This is a big drop in salary but is huge for my career in the long run so I know things will be tight for that year. I'll return to the $100k job with a year's credit, so the salary will be a bit higher upon my return.  

Otherwise, I have no other debts. I own my car and plan on keeping it for around 10 years. No credit card debt and my credit score is around 740. I'll have to purchase a life insurance plan if I do the credit line deal with my parents, since they'd still be liable for it in the event I died.

My employer matches half of 401k contributions up to 3% (so if I do 6%, they'll do 3%), so I'm planning on doing at least 6%.

I'd like to pay down the student loans as soon as possible, but I'd also like to purchase a home around the time I start work. I can stay with my parents until I buy, but (for both parties) that is understood to be temporary. I have a few thousand saved up and will be getting an $8000 graduation bonus from my employer so I have a bit available for a small down payment, but my parents have offered to help with an interest free loan to help on the downpayment - although I'd like to avoid this as much as possible given my other debts and their assistance with the credit line. With my credit score and being a first time homebuyer, I think I can get a lower downpayment - although that might mean I'll need to carry mortgage insurance. I'm in a pretty affordable city, so I could get a good home for ~$160,000 that needs minimal work or one that needs more work for ~$130,000. I plan on doing a lot of the work myself, such as painting, drywalling, etc so I'm more inclined to buy a ""fixer-upper"" at the lower price and then building sweat equity. I also have enough furniture and appliances to get started.

How much should I budget for a home (mortgage, taxes, insurance, utilities) given that I want to be as aggressive as possible with my student loans and also have some liquid savings?

I have the money to buy the phone outright currently, but I am 21 almost 22 with no real credit to my name (other than monthly bills) and I was thinking that buying with credit with no interest as long as I pay off the phone, I could start to help myself build a little bit of credit by paying the phone off over time.

I'm doing pretty well for age 26 and Im grateful for this opportunity so far.  

Before I get to the subject line of the post I should explain what ""critically staffed"" means. My facility has been hurting for fully certified controllers for years now. Between the high cost of living area, difficult and busy airspace, and high washout rate (training failures over 50%), it's been tough to recruit people to come. A lot of the older controllers are eligible to retire today and that will only make matters worse. The FAA has been throwing money at people to entice them to come here. People were even taking the incentive money and then purposely withdrawing themselves from training just to return to their previous facility with the extra cash. As a result it's nearly impossible for anyone at my facility to transfer out. The waiting list is in order of seniority so Im basically at the bottom. The one caveat is requesting a hardship transfer to care for a sick spouse/child/parent but I'm fortunately not eligible for that.  

So, am I crazy for wanting to walk away from this situation and move back to the Pacific northwest where Im from? The money doesn't seem worth it to be stagnating in training for the next year or so with high likelihood of failure, or succeed and be stuck in this facility for however many years working the mandatory overtime and being stressed out all the time.  

I want unbiased advice which is why Im not posting in /r/ATC because I know they would say Im insane to give up a career that thousands of people are dying get into.",finance,1473357167
personalfinance,"Part time employer not withholding federal taxes due to ""not enough hours""? How should I proceed to make sure I'm covered at tax time?","Hi all!

I've never ran into this at my past part time jobs so I have no idea why it's a thing at my new PT job but apparently it is. I work two nights a week (around 13-16 hours) at a city owned liquor store/bar. I got my first paycheck and noticed they didn't withhold federal taxes. They said it was because there are not enough hours being worked. I claim 0, no allowances, on my W4 so that's not an issue.

They said I can choose to have a flat rate withheld if I want? How do I do/calculate that? What will happen if I take out too much/too little? Will I just simply owe more or be refunded some? I have a full time job as well, and claim 0 allowances there as well, so my husband and I usually get a decent tax return. So how should I proceed to make sure I don't owe a bunch of money at tax time that eats up my return from my full time job?

Thanks!

personalfinance,Loan Payoff Question about balance and Interest Rate,"I have a refund of $7500 coming in next week and decided it would be smart to apply it to some of my student loans. My question is should I apply it to a loan with higher interest rate, but smaller balance or to a loan with a higher balance, but slightly smaller interest rate. I am still in school, so the interest is not capitalizing. I know the general theory is to pay off higher interest rate first, but the lower rate loan grows faster per day now, since I have started to pay off my loans with internship money. 

Here are the exact details:

1) Principle: $32,500, Accrued Interest: $5,000 Interest Rate: 8.375%
2) Principle: $21,600, Accrued Interest: $80 Interest Rate: 8.5%

personalfinance,Starting with 15k - where to allocate?,"I'm a college senior with 15k sitting in my savings account doing almost nothing. I'll be graduating this December to a job with ~120k salary, with about 27k in loans. 
I'm wondering what to do with my 15k now. I've been told that it's not a good idea to eliminate my loans immediately (which are at a 5% interest rate), but to invest first and start a retirement fund. However (and this may be because I'm somewhat shortsighted), I'm leaning towards using the 15k to start an emergency fund, make a moderately-sized payment on my loans, and maybe invest a little.

What are your thoughts? I'm new to financial management so please call me out on anything wrong.",finance,1473363916

personalfinance,Need a new bank and a new way of financing,"Alright so I'm a college grad and I came out of my three years with absolutely no student loan debt! Yay!

However, I came out of it with personal debt. My bank credit card is almost maxed at 3k, my Amazon rewards card I got for emergencies is at about 800, and I have a stupid kohls charge that's at 300. I honestly made some horrible choices and wasn't making payments on them until recently, and yeah, I know, my credit score is horrible. I know I should have relied on loans because those are easier to pay off, lower interest rates, but my parents were in charge of them and had been terrified by student loan horror stories, leaving all the debt in my own name. 

I have a job now that pays the bills with more to spare, so I'm back to paying every month, doing a little bit more than the minimum. I'm trying to get a better paying job in my field (not easy as I'm an arts major and moved back to my rural hometown because cost of living is so low and personal stuff) to help pay back. 

My Wells Fargo savings account closed today. Didn't get any notice though it had been empty for awhile, as I use another side account from my checking account as my temporary savings. I'm thinking of taking this opportunity to switch banks. I've heard some not great things about Wells Fargo as a business and while it's pretty convenient to me, if there's a bank that's a bit kinder to us poor individuals, that's where I need to be - once again, arts major, I have some realistic expectations of how difficult saving will be.

personalfinance,Loan Questions.... Can I pay student loans using money from a Car sale that I still owe on? How exactly does a loan payment (Student Loans) affect my Principle?,"So like the title suggests, I have a couple questions about loans. First, can I use money from the sale of a car, which I owe about 4K on, to pay off my student loans, which have higher interest rates, or do I need to use the  money from the sale to pay off the car first? Second, how is my monthly payment applied to the principal amount of the loan. I understand it is first used to pay interest accrued, then principle. My question is, does when I paid the loan affect how much interest I am paying off. i.e. If I pay 10 days before the due date, am I paying for less interest than I would be if I pay on the due date (Interest on due date = interest for 30 days, interest 10 days before due date = interest for 20 days??) or is it interest from the month before you are paying by the due date?

Thanks, let me know if you need any clarification of my questions.

personalfinance,Credit score not rebounding,"So some quick background: Two years ago I had some stupid reason that my drivers license was suspended. (Not drinking, but unpaid tickets)  I've never been good at the personal finance side of things, although surprisingly have faired well on the business side. Anyways, during this time I was self-employed and my fiance really needed a car. I knew we were going to have to keep it for awhile to keep from being upside down so we bought a quality vehicle with a bad interest rate but it was with Chrysler capital so i trusted it. My score at the time was ~620 and I was prequalified to buy a house. I decided to forgo buying a house for then because everyone I spoke to at the time told me while there would be an initial dip, it should come back with good payments in a year or so.  Fast forward a year and a half, all payments paid on time and ~20$ over minimum payments, loan is getting paid down, but my credit has not moved one point back up. 
I have 2 defaulted credit cards from 4 years ago and each has a collection charge as well from about 3 years ago. Nothing new since the purchase and with the payments my debt-to-income is 39%.

I was hoping to be back near buying a house or refinancing the auto loan by now and I am seeing no rise.

personalfinance,Mortgage refinance question....,"Hey guys, my husband and I bought our first home last year. Currently our interest rate is at 3.625% lender paid PMI. With the interest rates so low, we were wondering if this is a good time to refinance our mortgage. 
Left over mortgage: 380k
Value of our house: 455k
Current monthly mortgage: 1799
New offered rates: 3.375% with $60 PMI or 3.375% with closing costs rolled into the loan - new loan value of 384k
Estimated savings with PMI is $59/mo, but in a year or so, we will be at a savings of $119/mo.
What do you guys think about us refinancing now? Is this a good time or should we wait?",finance,1473384841
personalfinance,"I have a 2016 Mazda 3 I can't afford. I have an opportunity to trade it, should I?","So I bought a Mazda 3 Sport 2016 back in January when I was making $15/hr and getting 10 hours of overtime a week.  I was 20 years old when I bought it, and ended up paying $23,000 total for it with $4,000 down.

I then had a $19,000 six year loan with an interest rate of 14.5% and a minimum monthly payment of $325 and a monthly insurance payment of $360(1 ticket 20mph+, 2 accidents my fault.  I am aware I'm a terrible driver). I also have $6,000 in credit card debt. I'm now working two jobs.  One is full time making $11/hr, and the other is part time 10-20 hours a week.

I'm trying to save up to move out of my dad's house but it just seems impossible with this car payment/insurance and trying to pay my CC debt off as well.

Recently an opportunity came up to trade my vehicle for my mom's fiance's vehicle which is a 2011 Honda Civic DX(basic) model.  It's been in 2 minor accidents, but it only has 68,000 miles and seems dependable.  She says her car is worth $7,000.  Now I've paid my loan down to $17,500.  She says my car is worth about the same and wants me to give her $7000 total to trade cars.  Now my great grandma has agreed to loan me $3,000 and pay her back $100 a month, and my mom agreed to loan me the other $4,000 at $250 a month.  So my total payment would be $350 in loans and if I got the least, most basic insurance I could, my insurance payment would be $200 a month. I'm not sure this is a good idea, but the insurance would be $325 with a $1,000 deductible so I feel like it's not worth the extra $125 a month that could go to savings/credit card, to pay $1,000 to fix a $7,000 car.

Now I feel like this is a really good deal for me, since I won't have to pay any interest on the loans, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything here.  I really love my mazda, and I've already lost over $6,000 in value, and $818 to interest.  I've thought about waiting a few more months and then trying to refinance.  But I've only had these two jobs for a month and a half and my credit score is only 605.  I doubt I could get a better interest rate making less than I did then.

But overall should I go along with the trade, and if I do, what should I do about insurance?  Any other advice is much appreciated, thank you.",finance,1473386772
gaming,An open letter to gaming publishers.,"Hello, I am a world traveler, I spend a lot of time out of home, I use steam, I have a gaming laptop.  And I'm fed up with the world shrinking in a bad way.

I get a lot of problems while trying to game, sometimes I can't play a game, sometimes steam refuses to let me download a game that I just bought through humble bundle, or even it's own system.  When I ask for a solution I am told that I need to be aware of my new locations international policies and the games publishers constraints for that particular product.

I haven't moved to another region, I am temporarily out of country.  Currently I am working in China I have to use a VPN for everything because china blocks 'a lot' of non-chinese content, I am not a tool of any civilization other than my own and will not accept these political restrictions determinant on my ability to sift through international litigation.

Do you seriously expect me to contact my friends and family ask them to login to my steam account to add things to my account while I travel?  

Do I have to resort to piracy again despite steams great strides to resolve this inequality between big publishers and their customer base.  I haven't pirated a game in years, and now I am having to fill my computer back up with all manner of viruses and chock it up to international litigation and publisher greed.  Or my own ignorance on a better solution?

Based on that ignorance, for those working in this industry I can only assume you don't have the will or the desire to care beyond the end of your next paycheck and could care less about your own company much less this more general problem, much less believe you have the ability to do anything about it without getting fired for not recognizing your place. 

If anything is asinine and appeals to the ignorant masses, nothing has compared to this for the internet in recent times for my memory, though maybe I have a memory problem.

personalfinance,29m just seeking guidance. Salary rougly tripled 3 months ago. Have debt and need a game plan.,"I graduated college and my income roughly tripled. I went from an imaging assistant to an xray technologist. I have 50k in student loan debt, 24k on a car loan, and $1700 left on credit cards. I am maxed out on my company's matching 401a (I put 6% they put 4.5%, which will turn into 6% aftee I've worked here 20years.) I also just started putting 2% pre tax into a 403b which is not matching. It is an SRI through lincoln financial. I'm not too sure about any of the investing stuff other than I don't want to retire poor like my parents. 

Ok so my take home is never less than $1800 every 2 weeks, and sometimes upwards of $2200-2300 depending on my overtime and call shifts worked. I'm putting $300 a month away for emergency fund. My question is after the last of my credit cards are paid off which should I focus on first? Paying my car off, or knocking down my student loans. My student loans are on an IBR currently, with $0 payments because I worked part time making shit money while in school. The IBR is good until April.

I was thinking about paying off the credit cards, then letting my credit score rise a bit, then refinancing the car for a lower apr. The apr on the car is current 7.9%. I was in a bind, no emergency fund, my old car blew up and was beyond repair. Got a really good deal on a brand new camry, just not in the apr because of my credit score. 

If I do that and the apr is low enough, then I'm guessing I need to start paying off the student loans with the highest percentage rate first? They're all through fedloan servicing. Sorry for the wall of text. My friend referred me to this subreddit and it's exactly the place that I need to be to get some guidance regarding my future and becoming debt free.

How much will this affect me?,"Sometime after my 18th birthday (a year ago or so), I went ahead and got approved for a credit card from BofA with a $2,000 credit limit (no cosign). Thought I could handle paying it off fully each month, but suddenly things like parking permits, textbooks, food, and especially poor spending habits kicked in and soon I hit near the credit limit. I've had a static mid 600 FICO rating (according to BofA website) for 4 months now. I've realized how serious this is, and been trying to cut down on a lot of spending trying to get it back to $0. I have three months left on the introductory 0% interest offer, so I do plan on paying it off fully by then. Will this adversely affect my credit score long term (I would assume I could recover it as long as I don't screw up again), and how much do prospective internship employers (software development related) care about credit score, if at all? Would this also affect my chances/interest rates at any private student loans if I apply for them in the future (I'm currently on federal loans, and my parents are fine with cosigning those and have a credit score in the 800s)?",finance,1473394017

I've seen some awesome discussion in this group, and as I was going through my budget this evening I thought it might be interesting to share what it costs for a family to live in Silicon Valley, CA, USA- one of the most expensive places in the country.  I've got some general advice below, and will answer questions and comments if they come up.


Background: Me, my wife, our 3 and 1 year olds live in a rented 1100 square foot 3 bedroom house in Santa Clara with a cute little back yard and a 2 car garage.  Our last landlord in Mountain View raised our rent by 33% ($900) with no warning, so we noped and moved here a year ago.  It's smaller than the last place and less 'cool', but in a great school district and at about our old rent.  Slightly dreading what will happen when the lease renews in December, but whatever. It would take a $400,000 down payment to buy a house. 

 I'm in tech, she works part time from home, but we just put both kids in a decent day care 3 days a week so she can get a break from the kids and start looking to get back to her career. 

Here's the ""necessary expenses"", household things we can't or won't avoid:

Expense | Monthly | Annually
----------|----------|-----------
rent | -2750 |-33000 	
car insurance | -123.06 |-1476.76 	
renters insurance |-22.73 | -272.78 	
city water/trash|-124.24 | -1490.88 	
cable/internet | -130.00 | -1560 	
cell phones | -116 | -1392 	
gas/electric | -125 | -1500 	
part time daycare|-1966.8 | -23601.6 	 
subtotal: | -5357.83 | -64294.02 


Full time day care will be $3278/mo, or $39k/yr.  In my calculation, worth it for my wife to interact with adults again, and the kids to have a social and educational experience outside the home, provided her income offsets a good chunk of that tuition.

Aside from the necessary expenses, My last car died after 10 years so I've got a $340/mo car payment.  Wife owns hers outright, but it's only got a year or two of life left in it.  I want to retire someday and I want my kids to not worry about paying for college, so each month I'm putting away $1300 to a 401k and $350 for each kid into a 529 plan.  Whatever's left over after all that and the 30% federal/state/medicare/social security/unemployment insurance taxes (yikes) goes to food, gasoline, savings/vacation/etc.  A lot of our toys and clothes for the kids come from family and friends whose kids outgrew their stuff, and the kids eat what we eat, so having the kids wasn't that big an impact until day care.  I envy friends with parents and grandparents in the area.

Some advice:  Don't skimp on renters/homeowners insurance.  I had a suitcase stolen off the baggage carousel at SFO a few months ago.  My renters insurance covered the jewelry and expensive eyeglasses that were not covered by the airline. One claim paid for 8 years of renter's insurance.


Why do I stay here?  Opportunity.  I'm learning a lot and love what I do, and if my company IPOs it could mean a very nice bump to the bank account.  I get calls from recruiters constantly for interesting jobs (thanks LinkedIn) even though I'm an old family guy and not a recent Stanford grad.  Maybe the next company will IPO, and the one after that, and... If I ever lose hope on the opportunity, though, I'm taking my marbles and moving -anywhere- else.  It's rough on the ego to have a six figure household income and feel you're just barely getting by instead of prospering.

So yeah, that's what it's like out here.  I hope this is interesting to somebody, I love reading about people's situations in other places.",finance,1473407874

personalfinance,Avalanche Method &amp; 0% intro rates?,"Hey PF-

First off, thank you for all the free advice. This sub is insanely helpful. 

Secondly, I got a Q. I get the difference between the snowball and avalanche methods of paying off debt, but have a question. 

Let's say a person has two maxed out credit cards to pay off. (Yes, I know. But the first part of solving a problem is admitting you have one. The second part is solving it.) The person has kept up with their payments, utilizes their credit well, and is in overall good standing. 

One card has a pretty standard interest rate for credit cards - let's say 15-18%. The other is still in its 0% introductory period. (In this case, I think the person transferred a large balance from a previous card.)

Avalanche method would have me pay off the higher interest card first, but is there any value to simply maintaining that card's minimums while paying off the 0% card, **before** the intro rate runs out? 

Appreciate the help. Feel free to shout with more Qs, if you need clarification.",finance,1473416496

personalfinance,Extra Student Loan Payments vs. Fun,"Hi guys, so I'm trying to figure my finances out here and get some opinions.

So I am going to be graduating from college this year and I will have a little over 90k of student loan debt. 

Fed Loans- around 28k @ 2-4.5% interest

Sallie Mae Loans-

around 24k @ 2.25% interest 
Around 23k @ 5.675% interest
Around 22 @ 5.675% interest 

I have a job lined up at one of the big 4 firms for accounting, starting @56k and will receive a 5k signing bonus. They also said I should have a promotion within my first year and at least one or two more within the first 5 years.

I currently have a 1.5k emergency fund started in an online savings account earning 1% and I have about $1500 in dividend stocks. I have a savings account with $650 I'm thinking of closing and adding to the emergency fund. I also forget, I use the savings website called digit. Which automatically pulls money from your checking account. I have about  $700 in there.

I was wondering how big of an emergency fund I should get before really focusing on my loans. I work during school and make about 600 a month. Of that $600 I pay about $150 towards loans and $50 towards stock. And then I have other misc. Expenses I pay for. 

My friends want to go on spring break or maybe to Europe after graduation and I know it's crazy to think about with the amount of debt I have but I will be receiving half of the signing bonus shortly and was thinking of using that money for the trip and putting any extra on the loans. 

TL;DR- should I grow my emergency fund &gt;1.5k and should I use half of the signing bonus towards a vacation and then any extra put towards a loan?",finance,1473428098
personalfinance,Should I move back in with my parents?,"Hi Redditors of PF!


I am 23 and I work full time with the federal government while also taking classes part time at my local community college. I already have my Bachelor's Degree and am currently working on a Certificate (to be completed in December) for my current job. I have NO college debt for work and my parent's have covered almost all of my tuition. 

I made about $1650 a month and I live in Maryland so the cost of living is a little high. I pay $400 a month for rent. I know in the long run I want to buy a house and live in Maryland for the foreseen future. That is why I am wondering if it would be smarter to move back with my parent's and save for another year or two until I can do so. I have been renting since January so that could have been $3200 I saved rather than spent...

I would save a lot more money and not be struggling. I am currently struggling a little and overwhelmed with medical bills and some issues that my car is having (car is 12 years old). I know it will come at the cost of the loss of some of my freedom. I know my boyfriend won't be allowed to spend the night at my parent's house. I know I can't have people over at all hours of the nights or have random parties. 

My parents are totally cool with it if I do come back and are fine with my bringing me kitty with me. I just worry about moving back and missing the freedom now that I have had it. 

Really not sure what to do here and I need some outsider opinions.

personalfinance,"Desperately want out of my job, should i forego two weeks notice?","Last November I started a job as a Behaviorist at a day program for behavioral developmental disabled adults. I was to supervise one of the three rooms and run the data collection and plan implementation for the 10 consumers in there. 

The majority of the first few months I was on the floor in direct care because of staffing issues. In the spring I started my behavioral duties. The director of behavior services had personal issues with the staff supervisor and program admin; she exacerbated a situation to make it seem like neglect and had them both fired. 

SHE'S since been fired after being investigated by QA. The assistant director quit because of ethical concerns with the agency. A staff of about 11 is now down to 5 leaving us severely under ratio. A staff was put in charge and abuses his power by making us work without lunches or breaks, and manipulates client to staff ratio so he doesn't have to do work. There's supposed to be 1 staff for every 3 consumers yet I'm alone in a room with up to 6 or 7. 

I emailed the executive director of the company politely complaining how I was not hired to be direct care and how I wasn't getting breaks. She replied saying that my behavioral duties are secondary to ratio and I'm expected to be direct care until we're staffed up. Since then she's fired two more staff leaving us MORE understaffed. 

ALSO, there's been three instances when the company couldn't afford to pay us on payday and we had to wait until the following week for paychecks. I was also hired at 40k salaried and was switched to $20.50 hourly. I have an interview today which I'm confident I'll get if the money is good. 

So my question to all of you is, if I get this and they say I can start next week.... Would it be bad for me to send a letter ending my employment without the two weeks notice? The two people who I would need references from have since quit and I don't even technically have a boss. 

tl;dr I work for a horrific company where all leadership was terminated or quit, I don't get paid consistently, and I'm over worked in a position i was not hired for.",finance,1473434674

1. Am I able to deduct anything in regards to taxes? How do I file it and how do I deduct? I travel exactly 112 miles every weekend to drill so it is a lot of gas. No I do not get reimbursed.

2. What is the best way to pay off student loans? I am eligible for a 25k loan from USAA at a 3% interest rate. Should I pay take the loan and pay off my student loan? (I would need to pay the 25k back in 5 years)

3. In regards to my job, I am currently working as an account manager/client service.. The job does get dull but what are my exit opportunities and are there any opportunities for me to grow? What are some valuable skills that I can learn on the side?  

4. I also decided to be stupid and YOLOed, thanks to /wallstreebets. Invested 7k into this stupid stock and lost around 4k since December 2015.

5. My company does not offer 401k so what can I do to start saving for retirements and stuff?

6. Is it possible to find a second job right after my full time job? My job is 9-5:30pm M-F but are there any jobs that I can do on the side to earn extra income? I can't seem to find a part time job from 6pm-11pm.

personalfinance,"I need some help figuring out my federal taxes, recently got promoted from hourly to salary with a raise.","Alright so I work for a call center that has multiple programs that they administer.

I was also working about 10 hours of overtime a week at $15.75. I'm single, have no dependents, not disable or anything; so I don't claim any allowances or deductions on my taxes and have been taxed at 15% since I started working for this company (roughly 6 months).

The promotion I got moved me to another program where their employees are salaried at $26,500 a year, a roughly $4,500 raise from my previous position. I am still working overtime, 10 hours a week, at a flat rate of $15 on the previous program I worked on but they are now taking out 20% instead.

If someone could explain to me why there was a sudden increase in my taxes and help me figure out how much I can expect to take home every month I would greatly appreciate it. I am a strict budgeter and account for every single dollar I earn so this sudden hike in my taxes is effecting my bottom line and forcing me to scramble in my budget to make up the money. I stresses me out and fills me with anxiety regularly so any help would be greatly appreciate.

personalfinance,Need help understanding why I'm being denied for a car loan,"In July I sold my 2006 Saturn Ion to Carmax, getting back $2000. I sold the car because it was unreliable transportation, and I felt it was more beneficial to sell it before anything worse happened to bring down the current value. Currently driving the manual counterpart to my car (2006 Saturn Ion) that belongs to my sister. Driving manual gives me panic attacks, so I'd like to have the ability to purchase my own automatic car ASAP.

In addition to the $2000 received from the sale of my car, I have $2600 in my savings.

I make about $1000 a month.

My expenses are as follows:

Rent: $225 / month

Internet: $46.44 / month

Trash: $13.94 / every 3 months ($4.65 / month)

Gas for car: $26-30 / month

Food: I'll give this a rough estimate of about $200-300 a month. I don't eat out that much anymore due to gastrointestinal issues that require me to eat a plain diet. I also don't eat that much anymore anyway. 

In terms of current debts:

Hospital bill for $283

I'm well aware that I have didley squat, but I'm in a desperate situation here... The mounting fear of getting into the manual car just to drive to work that isn't even a quarter mile from where I live, or just drive to the doctor's office, or downtown to go to the hospital for a consultation... It's becoming too much for me, but I'd like to continue to be a functioning member of society...

Which brings me to my question. I applied for a car loan estimating probably $15,000 over 5 years. I was offered a 2.44% interest rate. My credit is 700+. I've had credit history for at least 2 years.

I was denied due to insufficient credit history or no credit history at all. The bank keeps repeating that over and over again to me, and I'm about ready to lose my freaking mind over it because they can't tell me more than that. I keep trying to call Equifax to get a better idea/explanation and I can't get through to an actual person.

My boyfriend is willing to cosign for me if that's what will get me the loan, but I would like some advice or helpful tips? I'm completely lost here...

Edit: hi! I'm at work now so doing this on mobile... Allow me to clarify some things... I sold my car because it was in permanent limp mode, which means it wouldn't go faster than 5 mph. So, yes, I should have sold my car because the cost to fix that exceeded the value of the car. I agree I should seek therapy, but at this point I am on medication for severe depression. Baby steps. 15k is absolutely out of my price range, but the bank refused to just give me a number that they would approve me for. I was forced to guess. Obviously i made a poor choice.

Edit 2: I'm looking for a car because I'm expecting to get a higher paying job in the near future, but it will be further away. The job I have now is more of an in between job. However, I'd like to use these current numbers in case the new job falls through.",finance,1473438834

personalfinance,Need advice on overwhelming house payments.,"Hello reddit, I'm a 21 year old who inherited the house I grew up roughly a year ago when my grandmother (who raised me) passed away. Unfortunately, the house still has a mortgage on it, though I have been paying it up until about 2 months ago. I recently became unemployed, as did my roommate, and while he was borrowing my car (also inherited) to go to a job in a nearby town, he got into an accident in which someone ran into the back end of the car. The car was not driveable and had to be towed. This has seemingly been the nail in the coffin since we were already 2 months late for mortgage with no money coming in. Insurance was liability only, so that's not an option. I've been applying to jobs like crazy but so far it hasn't been looking great, using both craigslist and indeed. With both of us having bad credit due to being stupid kids who didn't take credit cards seriously, I'm not sure what to do anymore. I don't even know how to get my car to know if it's totaled or not. I've struggled with depression for the last few years and once it seemed I had a hold on it, this creeps up and just seems to drag me back under. The house and mortgage isn't in my name just yet because the will hasn't been executed due to the executor being in Hawaii, though Wells Fargo has been cooperative with me making payments. Does anyone have any advice on how I can keep the house I grew up in? I know that if I can make it through this and next month I can turn this around but with foreclosure looming, I'm not sure what to do. I have roughly 800$ left and it's gonna cost 500 to get my car out of the place that towed it. I'm going to sell everything I can to try to make ends meet but I'm not sure if it's going to be enough.

Edit 1: The cost of the mortgage is only 450 a month, and there is only 18,000 left on the house at an insanely low  interest rate due to my grandfather being the in the military.

personalfinance,My Financial Priority Suggestions?,"Good day Personal Finance people! 

If anyone could help me prioritize / what to attack on aggressively, it'd be greatly appreciated!!

My financial background:
My salary is around $45,000 per year. 
Barely any credit card debt.
Mortgage/Rent: $1350 + $450 (property tax) = about $1800 for monthly payment. 
Around $1500 in checking acct; $500 in savings acct.

What should I need to prioritize / tackle on first?

1. Student Loans (2 of them)?
  a. Consolidated Parent PLUS Loan 
-- Principal: $16,498. 
-- Interest to Accrue: $5,327 
-- Interest Rate: 7.65% 
-- Monthly Payment: $ 249 
-- Final Payment: December, 2023.

-- Principal: $24,483. 
-- Interest to Accrue: $12,578 
-- Interest Rate: 4.375% 
-- Monthly Payment: $ 161 
-- Final Payment: November, 2035.

- If student loan should be my priority, how much should I allocate my monthly payment to be more wiser / save money? Any math geniuses here...? I'm quite bad at interest rates/finances.

2. Building Emergency funds?
-- I only have $500 as emergency funds in my savings account. If I were to prioritize 6-months of allowance, approximately how much should I need to set the goal to? Would this be a priority?

3. 401K.
-- I only have traditional 401K (company matches 5%), so I set it up for 5%.
-- Recently set up Fidelity 401K Roth from 0% to 5% as well. Should I put it back to 0% if this isn't priority or related to IRA Roth?",finance,1473440576
personalfinance,"Borrowing against 401k to pay down Credit Card - Smart, Dumb?","Hi r/personalfinance,

Some background: I got my first CC when I was 21 (I'm now 25, almost 26), mainly to pay for books for college. My goal was to only use it for that purpose, and pay it back ASAP. However, dumb 21-year old me didn't stick to that goal, and now that credit card has a balance around~$2400. I was looking over things, and realized I've paid about $150 in interest *just this year* so far. So on top of paying $50+ a month for the CC payment, another ~$20 per month is being added to my card (even tho I've basically completely stopped using it).


I was only able to start investing in my 401k this January. So far, I only have around $2500.00 in there. I would be able to take out a loan for a little over $1000.00 against it. 

So my question is: Would this be smart? I know you're almost never supposed to borrow against your 401k, but having this balance on my card gives me anxiety. The interest rate on the card is 20%. If I borrow, my rate would be 3.74%, and I'd be paying myself back (albeit it would now be essentially taxed, of course).


So again, I'm 25 and 26 in December. I'm not sure how smart this would be. Any thoughts?

personalfinance,Is buying a home in East Bay California area a good decision for me currently?,"So I've been living in the East Bay area specifically by Walnut Creek and rent has been a drain on my finances. My parents want me to purchase a house/condo/apartment and are providing me $50k for a down payment. I have no credit card bills, and my credit scor on Credit Karma is 750. 

Currently my finances look like this:

Pay is $85k/yr
 
Post tax &amp; after 401k $2028/2weeks take home (Roughly $4060 a month except two months a year where I get an extra pay check so average is $4394 but cant rely on it)

* Emergency fund: $6000, growing at $250/pay check
* Extra Savings : $2000, I only deposit from leftover excess budget
* Checking&amp;Savings: $4400, keep it around for immediate access for month to month expenses
* Post Tax Investment: $4400, just mutual index funds &lt;- I don't contribute to this
* 401K: $3900, only doing company match 4% on my 6%, grows by $296/pay check
* Down payment Gift from parents: $50,000

Known expenses:

* Federal Student Loan ~$26000, min payments $280 paying $300/month
* State Student Loan ~$29640, forgiven but has to be reported as income for Uncle Sam to take from, $6500ish tax bill come April
* Auto lease ~ $6000 left, paying $284/month &lt;- Bad decision I know, 2 years to go

My monthly budget from Mint that I stick to 85% of the time:
Total Spending: $3,126/month

* $1,900 Rent &lt;- About 60% of my monthly spending, and 46% of my take home (using $4060 as monthly take home)
* $284 Auto Payment
* $80 Gas &amp; Fuel  
* $92 Television&amp;Internet  
* $70 Utilities  
* $300 Student Loan  
* $65 Financial Loan (0% so paying min, will pay off balance by this January)
* $175 Groceries  
* $60 Restaurants  
* $100 Shopping  

Looking at my above expenses with the $50k downpayment gift would it be advisable to purchase a place here? Condos are like $300k on Zillow, $400k for a two bedroom. But if I move north towards Concord or even Pittsburg I can find a house for around the same. I was using the mortgage calculator and its estimating around $1600/mo, meaning I save $300, and build equity. Can someone provide me with their input for a potential first time home buyer? 

EDIT:
My reasoning to buy a home is because I'm already dropping so much of my pay just for rent. If I can get a place for $300k I'll have 16.6% equity and will only pay PMI for a small time while keeping costs at $1900/month or less. Also if I get a 2bed or 3bed I can get roommates to pay reduced rent, and basically help pay towards my equity while I maintain $1900/month payments as not to reduce my cost of living and be screwed when they leave.

personalfinance,Investment -- Save $ for down payment into 401k?,"I just got out of a briefing on my firm's 401k plan in which I'm not currently enrolled. 

Given that I plan to buy a second house in the next 5 years to use as a vacation place that I also rent, does it make sense to put my future down payment savings into my firm's 401K plan with the plan of raiding it when I'm ready to buy?

There is no withdrawal penalty if I use for a second house -- I asked. And there's no requirement that the loan be repaid in full if I leave this job -- I just have to make arrangements to continue payment over the loan term (I'm assuming the full 15 years). 

It seems like a good idea to me to utilize the pre tax status of the money vs using after tax dollars to try to save given how awful interest rates are right now. (Loan fees per year are about $25, origination is $220, and repayment interest is prime +2.5%). Am I missing anything significant?

Interest rates are already so low that there's nowhere for them to go but up.

This guy told his viewers to go out and short the bond market.

For the sake of the argument, lets take high levels of inflation off the table.



If the Fed raises rates, it contracts the currency supply and that is deflationary. 

Bonds are much better in deflation because inflation/deflation don't affect the value of underlying bonds, just the trading value. That's not the case with equities, and they'll get cheaper as a result.

And with today's levels of inflation already being very low, policy makers have no choice but to lower interest rates in a bear market even if it's negative yielding. Taking a loss on bonds is better than your debtors defaulting on loans.



Take a look at the the 2% drop in the S&amp;P500 today when the Fed leader of some city said that a rate hike was possible. Do you think this environment is has enough confidence in the economy to not move to Government Bonds when something seriously goes wrong?

personalfinance,Advice On Consolidating Short Term Credit/New Mortgage,"Hello all, I've lurked around here for a while, now posting. I'm looking for advice for those who know the in's and out's more than I ever could so that my fiancee and I can plan our long term financial goals.

History: We have shy of 30K in short term debt spread across 7 credit cards with interests ranging from 18-24%. This came from previous years of irresponsibility (I know), and in the last 2 years we have done due diligence to rein in our lifestyle, but are now spent paying for sins of the past, with no intentions of increasing this debt load.

Living situation is as such, years ago (before we were together) her Father purchased the home in which we live in with her son, and have been paying the mortgage and any costs associated as ""rent"". The mortgage is down to $22,800. Last appraised value was $110,000 for this property.

In short, we have been spending the last year trying to get consolidation loans for the short term debt (current total monthly payments aren't helping to make much progress), but with my credit score at a 640 (high balances, debt to equity ratio) I have been denied several.

We have always looked to transition the ownership of this home into our names and get married, and thought the purchasing of this home would be a good way to finally be in charge of our own domicile as well as take advantages of the financial perks to home ownership (tax write offs, home heating credits, homestead tax exemption, etc. that we currently do not receive).

The question therein lies: Would it be penny-wise to purchase this home at say 15, or 30 years and tying the closing costs (as well as any borrowed money for down payment) into the initial mortgage, then securing a HELOC to consolidate our short term debts at a lower interest rate, and longer term, so that we can have some breathing room in our budget?

I know the first question in the back of the bankers mind will be the tendency to reuse the existing revolving credit to make purchases - but this will not be the case, in fact the plan is to cut up the cards, and keep 1 small limit card for emergency uses only. Looking at a few different models - this tentative plan would open up money in the week to week budget for our living expenses.

The goal is to make the payments until her son is old enough to go to college (less than 4 years), then double down on both debts to pay them off before the term is up.

Are there better ways to do this? Does anyone have any personal experience with something like this? Are there drawbacks, apart from the obvious (longer repayment terms, tendency to relapse into a 'credit' mentality, etc.)? I am confident that we are rehabilitated and won't relapse, and have adjusted our lifestyle completely living 'clean of spending' for a while now.

I forgot to add that my gross income is about $53K a year (claiming 0's for taxes as we aren't married), and my soon to be wife is attending university. 

Any help or thoughts would be appreciated, but please don't flame the debt load (these are only short term debts, not including my existing student loan, or 1 used vehicle loan). Thanks much.",finance,1473462336

investing,Going to school for free. Should I still take advantage of student loans?,"Hey guys and gals, first post here so let's get to it.


I’m young, and painfully aware that I “don’t know everything about everything, or much about anything.” I’m posting this to get feedback from older, more experienced, and smarter investors than I.



I'm wondering if it’s a good idea to take advantage of federal and private student and VA loans that are deferred until 6 - 9 months after you graduate?



I qualify for 100% of my Post 9/11 GI benefits, will be working part-time, etc, etc.



But let's say that on top of that, my freshman year I borrow roughly $50,000.00 in deferred federal student loans (current IR's are about 4.69%) with a grace period of 6 months after graduation.)



The plan is to invest this capital into various opportunities that, after much deliberation and analysis, should grow at about 9 - 12% per year.



But for the sake of the argument let's say that I play it safe and dump it all into an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. Something like SPY.



Historically, The SPY ETF's (and S&amp;P 500) growth rate is roughly 8 -10% per year. We're going to go conservative here and adjust that to a constant 7 – 8.5% just in case. Did I mention that the SPY ETF pays a quarterly dividend? (2.02% or $4.34/share annually) Dividends that I intend to DRIP right back into the SPY to compound this financial momentum.



(Conservative) Estimates of growth from years 1 - 4:



1st year: 50,000 x 8.5% = $54,250.00 + annual dividend payment of $986.00



2nd year: $55,286.00 x 7.6% = $59,487.00 + Dividends of $1,066.00



3rd year $60,552.00 x 8.8% = $65,880 + Dividends of $1,127.00



4th year: $67,007.00 x 7.0% = $71,697.00 + Dividends of $1,215.00



Total: $72,912.00



Repayment option A: Upon graduation I would sell my position and repay the loan before the interest rates or payments were activated. Netting me a cool $22,912.00



Repayment option B: Make monthly payments on the loan with my extra income to widdle it down before graduation. The logic behind this is getting and investing 50k NOW and then paying it off vs. saving and investing 50k over 4 or 5 years. I'm thinking about the Time Value of Money here.



This growth is ONLY from the $50,000.00 loan and does not include my existing position in the SPY ETF or any other investment I am part of.



On top of this, the extra income I make from my GI bill benefits and part time work will be saved and invested (estimated around +$2,500.00/month x 8 school months = $10,000.00 per year) into stocks, options, and other securities that I deem beneficial to my portfolio.



What do you think? What have I not accounted for? What obvious financial truth have I ignored or missed or am simply not aware of? Please leave your feedback below with valid points as to why it’s a good or bad idea as well as other suggestions to wisely invest during my early twenties (Please don’t say TSP.

I contacted my credit union and got a loan for the same 18,000 at 16.74 interest rate for 7 years. They would deposit the money into my account and I use it as I see fit, I also of course do not have to pay the extra 2000 dollar fee.

personalfinance,Advice Needed: Where to invest $ I may need in 10 yrs if PSLF does not work as advertised,"Good Morning PF-


TLDR I am requesting advice on where to put money that me and my spouse may need in 10 years if PSLF does not work as advertised. 


Under PSLF, the recommendation is to submit under an income-based repayment plan (IBR). These payments monthly would not even exceed the interest which is accruing on her loans.


We are committed to this program and seeing it through. The patient population she wishes to work with will keep her in non-profit or government work.


We are concerned that PSLF is not a guarantee (my question is not about the program, I understand that we can file paperwork monthly or yearly to confirm if the payments are accepted). At the end of ten years, we could be left with a balance much higher than current. As such, our plan is to enroll in the PSLF, and on IBR as recommended but sock away the money we would have had to pay towards the balance in a standard repayment option in another account. Possibly a brokerage account?

We are using this as an insurance, and if at the end of 10 years we don't need it, bam, we have a nice chunk of change saved up. 


If I am not clear I want to give an example:


IBR requires payment of $600.00 a month, a standard repayment would require $1,200.00.


We elect to pay the minimum as outlined in IBR of $600.00, but want to invest $600.00 a month elsewhere if we need to withdraw in 10 years if PSLF leaves us with a balance.

A brokerage account maybe?


Thank you for your input. If further information is needed I will happily edit the post.


Additional Info that may or may not be necessary:


Across 12 loans, my fiance has $147,000 of student loan debt with majority of interest rate set at 6.84% Grad Plus. Please note that her Grad Plus loans, and her employer qualify for this program, I understand that we can submit monthly or yearly paperwork to confirm if the payment is accepted under PSLF


She graduated from school with her Doctorate in Physical Therapy, and took her first job at a non-profit hospital this month making $33/hr. She is non-exempt so there is overtime but we will not figure that in. Aside from this debt, she has no other debts. Car is new and paid off in cash.


Her non-profit sector job, and her direct loans are eligible for PSLF.


As we are soon-be-married, I will provide our financial information together.


S1 Monthly After Tax &amp; health, 10% 401K contributions: $3,899

S1 Car Payment: $231.55 ( $8K remaining at 3% interest, 2014 VW Passat)

Going out: $800/mo average


Total Current Expenses ( her loans not factored in for the sake of my question):$3,855


Net After Expenses: $3,368/mo.


In PSLF, the recommendation is to do the IBR (income based option) which is 10% of Gross from my understanding. 


We also have a sufficient emergency fund of $28,000 across two savings accounts.


Any huge glaring issues with PSLF we should be aware of? She is starting on the program in October. Our main concern is the fact that it is not in fact a guarantee once payments are made, so making any reduced payments will allow interest to accrue at a scary rate over the ten years.


Other notes: We want to buy a house in the next 5 years. Will PSLF ruin our chances of securing a favorable mortgage or any at all? (Credit scores are both above 740, no CC debt as indicated previously).

personalfinance,Looking for advice on co-signed Parent PLUS loan,"Hello,

I am 30, married, and both me and my wife earn a good amount of money.  I graduated with around ~$140,000 in personal debt, and currently have that down to ~$35,000.  This remaining amount has a interest rate of 4.5% fixed.

My mother, bless her, took out a Parent PLUS loan when I was in grad school to help me pay for it.  Long story short, my mother is currently in bankruptcy, and there is very little chance she will ever repay this loan.  That's fine, I am the cosigner, I know I have to pay it, but I want a quick option check if you do not mind.  

Her parent PLUS loan (I am a cosigner on it) was originally for $35,000.  It currently has a staggering interest rate of 9.5%.  It is currently around ~$80,000, and in deferment due to her bankruptcy.  I am willing to simply start paying this loan down (my opinion is ignoring it is simply the worst anyone can possibly do), however she seems to believe that once she comes out of bankruptcy she will be able to ""get the interest wiped out"" and the balance bought back down to origination.  

Outside of whether or not this is actually possible, I have doubts they would do it on this particular loan simply due to the fact I am a cosigner, and I am doing well.  She is not out of bankruptcy for another 2 years, and if shes wrong that's around $20,000 additional debt I have.  

Am I correct in my assessment that there is very little chance the provider will give any headway on the interest amount?  And given that assumption is true, my best bet is to let my $35,000 4.5% fixed, in my primary name, sit while I start making larger payments on the $80,000 cosigned?  

Thank you for any opinions you can give!",finance,1473520288
personalfinance,LTV re-fi vs holding current mortgage?,"I'm having a difficult time conceptualizing this for some reason, and I could use some advice from you guys here in PF.

I currently have a 30 year fixed rate mortgage that I re-financed about 18 months ago with a 4% interest rate. Right now, a re-fi in Texas can be locked in at around 3.4%~. The monkey wrench here is that I planned on moving to different area of town sometime this year, but the real estate market has taken a sharp dip over the past 12 months. Now, I am pushing that plan back for another 12-24 months until prices recover here in the Houston area.

With this in mind, would it be advantageous to initiate an 80% LTV re-fi given the current interest rate and real estate environment, or should I wait it out with my current mortgage since I am planning on moving? If I roll the closing costs into the re-fi, I would pay a slight uptick in the interest rate, but the total I pay per month would be less than what I am paying now. When I re-financed the first time, I lock in the re-fi with an appraised value of $310k. I could probably attain the same value today, so the equity portion would be a wash.

Am I missing something here or is re-financing the way to go even though I am planning on moving in the semi-near future?",finance,1473521648
personalfinance,"Graduating in December, student loan repayments will all start to be due around June. I have some questions.","I will be graduating in December (in the US) with a double major in both Spanish and Linguistics. Although it is not exactly my area of study, I am looking to try to get into a sales position. Both my parents are in sales, I am currently in sales, and it's something that I am good at. 

Here are my student loans as of this moment in time organized firstly by interest rate and secondly by balance, all of them are through **Sallie Mae**:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* 16,098.78 @ 10.000%

* 7,204.63  @  9.875%

* 10,862.33 @ 3.625%

* 5,001.00  @  3.625%

* 2,665.48  @  3.625%

Total as of 9/10/2016 : **46,936.09**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

My girlfriend does have **2** student loans, *but her grandmother is paying them in full*. They are only around 2.5k. We are not responsible for that amount.

My girlfriend and I moved in together over the summer and are going to be getting engaged soon, we have a little saved up ($1500 even in about a month). We combined all of our finances so all of our money is pooled, but if either of us wants to take a little something to do something for ourselves or anything, we can. Our reasoning is that even though we pooled our money, we both still make our own. This, however, rarely happens. We agreed to allocated each of us $100 spending money each month if we want to. Neither of us has ever spent up to that amount. I have a car which is not yet paid-off, hers was gifted to her and is paid-off.

Our monthly expenses are as follows, approximately:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Rent: $854

* Groceries: $150-$200

* Gas: ??-100-?? (this is all repayed through expense checks, this entire summer we've never come out negative in having to pay for our own gas)

* Internet: $60

* Energy: $115 average

* Car: $104.65

* Misc: $100

Total (approximately): **$1533.60**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since starting back at school I am no longer able to do my sales job full time, I work on campus instead. My monthly take-home is about $577.50 pre-tax. Taxes are very little on this job because it is a job for the university. My girlfriend's job (the one I do rarely now because I am back at school full time) is 100% commission based with a guaranteed $100 per day. Her take-home ranges from $1500 to over $3000. We worked this job together over the summer and the most we made in a month was a bit over $5000. This job has no guaranteed days, however. There could be some weeks where she has 5 days of work with an open account, there could be some with 3 days, and there could be some with no days. Her family owns a funeral home and services network, so in the event that no work is available for the sales job she goes in and helps them, who pay her $10 per hour, which is untaxed until she hits a certain amount that she will never hit there (I don't remember the number but ballpark of $5000) for some reason I don't understand. Her mother is head of accounting and payroll there so she knows why.

So our total income is as follows (again, approximately, with commissioned sales you can never *know*):

* Me: $577.50
* GF: $1500 - $3000

Total: **$2077.50 - $3577.50**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I personally have two credit cards, a DiscoverIt card and a new one that I just got, BankAmericard Cash Rewards. My total credit line is $1700 combined. **I have no credit card debt**, which is something that I am very proud of.

In recent weeks, I have been beefing up my LinkedIn profile in preparation for graduating. I have 1.5 years of experience in commissioned sales, so I think that will help me get my foot in the door for my first ""real"" job, so to speak.

Regarding my student loans, my plan is to pay off the 10% and 9.875% as aggressively as possible, based on what my income will be, while making minimums on the lower interest rate loans.

As far as my girlfriend's credit goes, she does not have a credit card; she has applied for two cards within the last year, but was declined for both. She has never had a car loan in her name or anything like that, but she did live in apartments for two years while going to school. She has very little credit history, but she needs to get a card to allow her to start building it. Given the fact that she has been declined 2x in one year for basic cards (one store card, one other card I can't remember what it was), I'd venture to guess that a secured card through her bank might be the best option.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


So here are my questions for you, /r/personalfinance:

1) Is the method I talked about realistic for paying off my student loans? I know that they will continue to accrue interest in the coming months and until payments are due so the amounts will be a bit higher, but taking that into account, are these loans that I can realistically pay off within 6-10 years?

2) We both have the ability to continue working the sales job that we have done for as long as we would like, but it is not career oriented for either of us. There is no vertical movement really possible at this job. Our plan is to continue working this job until we each find a full time career job. Realistic?

3) I arbitrarily have guessed based on our income how much we can afford to put into savings based on our current checking account amount and number of paychecks left in the month, as well as how many days she works. The nice thing is that we receive a paycheck at the end of every week, because they are staggered. So for example:

* W1 end: Me
* W2 end: Her
* W3 end: Me
* W4 end: Her

Is there a more methodical approach that I should be taking in regards to saving? Like I said we put $1500 away in a month, but there has to be some way to be a bit more analytical about this to maximize saving.

4) How worried should I be about the student loans? I am an anxious person so I am trying to take as many steps possible to make sure that we are able to afford these loans and our current lifestyle.

5) All the loans are private loans, so I assume that there is no kind of forgiveness or anything like that possible, correct? Is consolidation possible, or ever recommended?

personalfinance,What's a better investment: a house or stock/bonds (UK)?,"I've had my mind set on buying a house for a while now, even when I left school I was very keen to get that house and pay off the mortgage as quick as possible, I have no debt with around £8000, no job at the moment although I am getting there slowly.

I pay around £80 a week in rent, which is good, now I would like to be doing something with my money, I can't afford a house and even with mortgages I don't have the minimum amount to get the mortgage or a job, if I can remember right, they are prepared to loan you 5x your salary, so I would be able to afford something like £110,000 if I were to get a mortgage. I've always kind of viewed buying a house as an investment, even more so than stocks. But realized that if you are paying a 3% interest rate of £100,000 for example that's £3,000 a year, basically £57 a week, but those interest rates are only possible if you have more money to put down. I'm a little bit better off paying the interest to the bank rather than paying rent to my housing association.

Now considering stocks, the average return is supposed to be 7%, but I find stocks to be harder to understand than buying houses, but say if I am to keep paying rent and have stocks with a 7% return or more, I think stocks could be a better investment. The percentage I save in buying my own place I think would be less than a stock investment, that's if I am to put most of my money down. Also over here you can't let out a house if it's your first morgage, you have to buy and live in it, so no return in terms of rent.

On a house does the return compound? On stocks if I am to invest £10,000 with a 9% interest rate, I could double this in 8 years. They say in house investment to make your money going in, so hence why people look for repossessions, then do it up, they can't rely on house price fluctuations for the prices to rise, also this year interest rates will be going up so I think stocks would turn out better, house prices also might crash again.

I see house investment as saving money with rent, but that money saved isn't invested, it's not compounding, the house price going up and buying it at a lower price than it's worth, some houses go like 40% off at repossession.",finance,1473523692
personalfinance,just want opinions/suggestions on how I'm doing (long post),"So I've been perusing this sub for a while and am finally ready show my monthly budget.

So my income: currently making $55k for this year as part of a rotational program with 2 $5000 bonuses. I already received one bonus and will receive the other at the end of my program. So after taxes, my monthly income is about $3450. I also get reimbursed for my cellphone so that's an extra $125. 
Total monthly income = $3575. FICO 705 if that matters.

Now for the fun part, expenses:

* car payment: $384 ($20,359 left over 60 months @ 3.49%)

* car insurance: $422 until December 2016, then will get quoted again

* gas is about $150

* rent: $1100 includes everything

* E-fund: $500 per paycheck ($1000)

* Netflix: $10

* Playstation Network: $5

So I'm not sure how much to account for groceries since I've haven't bought my own yet but was told by my friends to aim for $200.

This leaves me with about: $804 a month.

Now my student loans are coming up and the unbury.us tool has been great for me and I have it bookmarked, thank you to whoever made it! For the payments I couldn't get from my loan details, I estimated using bankrate.com's calculator assuming all my loan terms were 10 years.

My student loans are as follows:

* Perkins: $10,000 @ 5%, $106/month

* Federal: 5 loans totaling $32,655 ranging from low 4% to low 5%. Monthly payments range from $70-$80

* Private #1: $11,522 @ 9.5%, $149/month

* Private #2: $6,169 @ 9.125%, $78/month

* Private #3: $6400 @ 8.875%, $80/month

* Private #4: $5000 @ 7.955%, $60/month

* Private #5: $5600 @ 8.49%, $74/month

All the loans total about $887 per month. Now I won't be paying all of these at the same time until March of next year.

So that leaves me about -$83 in the hole once all the loans hit. I suppose my E-fund contribution will have to lower once all the loans start coming in (provided I don't find a 2nd job which is highly unlikely).

Yes my car insurance is high, don't want to go into detail why. It will lower as I get older and keep a clean record. I bought the car I wanted and plan on keeping it as long as it'll last as I planned for all the vehicles I've bought. 

No I am not contributing to my retirement at the moment, need my full paycheck for now. I'm focusing on building the emergency fund and saving money for myself which is basically just plane tickets to visit my girlfriend.

I read a lot about student loans and talked to my friends and SoFi seems to be the way to go. I'll be refinancing my private students loans after the new year probably. I will also be refinancing my auto loan with my credit union, should lower to about 2.5% or lower.

I am also searching for a second job which I hope to make an extra $500+ a month from. Sooner or later I will be launching my own LLC. I still have to figure out the associated costs and fees.

Short term goals: have money to be able to visit my gf and travel with her. Also will need $225 for an exam to help progress my career which I plan on taking in April 2017.

Long term goals: the usual (eventual house/apartment, vacations with her, save for my future and kid's futures as well). Also want to be able to help my mom with my little brother's student loans and help her move out of our house.

Not that it matters now but salary will increase whether I stay with my current company or not which will up pick up the slack a lot.

personalfinance,21 year old university student: How to budget/save/invest when you have few expenses? (EU),"Beforehand, I would like to thank you for your time and apologise for any mistakes there might be since English is not my first language. I tried to find previous posts in this subreddit with similar questions and reading the guides in the sidebar, but none of them addressed my specific issue, so I’ve decided to create this post and ask for your guidance.    

**Some background information**: I’m 21 years old and working towards finishing my bachelor degree in economics. I live rent free with my parents, since affordable student housing in my city is few and far between (I live/study in a metropolitan European area, where housing and things, in general, are pricey). My family is by no means wealthy, but they live comfortably and have money to spare – My parents insist on me not paying rent or contributing with any meaningful amount towards utilities and groceries, but instead encouraged me to not worry and focus on my studies. I don’t have any debt and things like tuition and health care is taken care of.    

**Issue at hand**:
My monthly disposable income is around 1000 USD stemming from a student grant and working a part time job that is related to my major (I started working there a few months earlier). But since I have relatively few recurring expenses, with textbooks, dental care, public transportation and my cell phone plan being the biggest, I’m usually left with a sizeable discretionary income.    

But since I essentially have a subsidised lifestyle, with few to none real expenses, how should I go about budgeting my income? I do spend some money on myself and having fun (e.g., eating and going out with friends, clothing and other personal items), but it varies from month to month with the monthly average being about 300 USD. I try to save as much as possible every month, but I don’t stick to a particular budget and don’t really keep a close track of my expenditures as I’m never in danger of over drafting. I know this sounds like a quite privileged, first world problem (“I just have too much money, and don’t know what to do…”), but I’m really trying to be as savvy and smart about this situation as possible. Knowing roughly what percentage of my income should be allocated for private consumption and what should be saved, but also how to save/invest would be a big help!    

I have an emergency fund with about 2000 USD placed in a standard savings account, with a really unimpressive interest rate, and I also have about 7500 USD in a low-risk investment fund that mainly consists of bonds and stocks to a lesser degree. I’m not confident/knowledgeable enough to pick and maintain my own stock portfolio, but maybe I should look into other investment funds that might have better expected returns?    

My employer also pays towards my pension, but I’m a bit hazy on the details since this isn’t really a big concern of mine (I’m still young and will probably catch up when I begin working higher paying jobs after attaining my master degree).    

I was thinking of saving as much as possible for maybe a down payment on an apartment after I graduate or studying/living abroad for some time, but I’m really uncertain about my future plans, so it's hard to estimate how much I’ll need to save/invest for the future.    

**The questions**:
How should I budget my income, when my lifestyle is essentially being subsidised with few real expenses?  How much should I roughly spend a month on private consumption and more importantly, how should I save/invest my money? E.g. what type of saving accounts/investment funds should I look for?    

I tried to offer all relevant details regarding my circumstances, but if you have any questions feel free to ask, and I’ll try to answer to my best ability.

personalfinance,Savings Bonds - Cash them in now or wait until fully mature?,"Hello PF, I'm a 22 year old college student and living on my own for the first time. Money is a little tight for the time being, and I could use a little boost. I was recently given some savings bonds and I'm not sure whether it would make the most sense to cash them in now, or wait until they're fully mature. The bonds are as follows:

$50 EE paper bond - issued in 2002, 1.31% interest (maturity date in 2032)

$500 EE paper bond - issued in 2005, 3.5% interest (maturity date in 2035)


My inclination is that I won't miss out on too much if I cash the $50 bond, since the interest rate is pretty low anyways. Is this correct? Also, for the same reason, I'm hesitant about cashing the $500 bond because the interest is higher. Can/will this one day be worth more than the face value of the bond itself? I should note that my situation is not so dire that I NEED this extra cash - but it would go a decent way in helping me rest a little easier at night.

1) Under the ""Price and Performance"" tab on the vanguard website, the returns after taxes on distributions is equivalent to the return before taxes.  This makes sense since there should be no tax.  However, the ""return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares"" is less than the ""return before taxes.""  Are only the distributions tax exempt, but any gains on the fund price are subject to tax?  What exactly is tax exempt?

2) With returns of 4.86% over 10 years, and a &gt;50% marginal tax rate, this would be equivalent to a 9.72% return on taxable earnings. That to me seems very good, and it even beats out VTSAX over 10 years.  So, why would I allocate anything to the stock market if I can get an 9.7% equivalent return on muni bonds that are presumably less risky?  What am I missing here?",finance,1473573362
personalfinance,Should I use most of my saving to pay off half of my student loans?,"Hey everyone!

Long story short, I've saved up a decent amount of money and thinking of paying off half of my student loans. Currently, I have two student loans:

*  Parent Plus Loan ~17.5k @4.5% (under my mom's name) - Paying $800 per month ($400 more than the minimum)

*  Fedloan ~23k @5% (under my name) - Paying  $200 per month (minimum)

I want to use my saving to pay off the Parent Plus loan so it doesn't affect my mom's credit line.  Is this a smart move? I don't know how to invest or deal with stocks so I'm thinking of doing it this way to save myself some interest money. 

I do not have any other debts (credit card..etc.). No rent since I'm a consultant so I travel and live in hotels for work. If I don't travel, then I stay with my parents or crashing at a friend's place.  My car is also paid off.  What you guys think?",finance,1473576988

personalfinance,Negotiating car finance interest percentage,"Afternoon, I am having to replace my car due to it being unreliable and beginning to cost a lot to run (it does below 30mpg and costs £160 per year in tax).

I have found some cars I like, the issue is the finance agreements. I cannot get an interest rate below 9.9% on a pre-owned car!

Now, I know I can get bank loans with lower interest, the issue is my cars MOT is due by the 30th September, after that if it is not done it cannot be driven. It is being tested on Monday, if it passes then happy days I can go down the bank loan option for a lower rate, however if it does not pass I do not want to pay to repair it so I only have until the 30th September to replace the car, not enough time to sort out a loan.

Does anyone have any tips on negotiating this interest down, I have tried just walking away but they do not car - it seems they make their commission from the interest, so it is proving a real fight to get something lower than 9.9%! I'd be happy with a finance loan at 4 or 5%.",finance,1473607451

personalfinance,How much should I budget for dating?,"Hi,

This isn't something I see discussed a whole lot on this sub. Most users say to cut out ""extrenous spending"" to pay off debts. For example:

* Don't go to restaurants.
* Don't drink at bars / clubs / whatever.
* Don't  spend a lot on gifts.

If you do this, that's great. You're probably saving a bunch of money.

But dating requires a bit of spending. Yes, there are free things you can take advantage of (parks, free concernts, beach, etc) but if you always do free / cheap stuff, you're probably going to be seen as cheap, not thrifty. At the same time, you don't have to spend thousands of dollars a month on dating.

I'm wondering what the right balance is. So, couples / married people of reddit, what does your dating budget look like? How much a month (or every other month, if you don't do dates / activities with your SO monthly) do you allocate towards dating / social life?

This is a throw-away account. Here's what my picture looks like:

* 25 years old.
* Male. 
* Single

Life goal: get married. I don't want to be 40 with a stuffed bank account and be alone :(

Financial picture:

* 65k a year, usually 2-4% raises annually.
* 60,000 left in student loans.
* 8,000 left on car payment.

Monthly payments are all fine, I live in a low COL area. Rent is like $500 bucks a month.

**I currently put between 1500 - 2000 a month towards student loans.**  The plan would be to cut this back slightly. Question is: by how much?",finance,1473615690
personalfinance,Should I have my loan forgiveness paid to my lender or to myself? (USA),"I am a second year teacher applying for a state loan forgiveness program and I am running into a few questions. Currently, I have about $11,000 in federal student loans and have been making minimum payments on them. I have been doing this because I am a special education teacher, and there are several loan forgiveness programs that I qualify for now, or that I will qualify for in a few years. I am in the process of applying for one of the programs now and I am unsure of how I want them to pay me.

With this loan forgiveness, I am able to chose whether they pay my lender $4,000, or pay me $4,000. I would have to pay any taxes on the $4,000 if they pay me directly, as the IRS sees it as earned income. 

What makes me unsure of which payment to choose is that I am in the process of applying for my master's degree. Tuition/fees for my program run around $3,258 a semester for 6 credit hours, and that's not counting books, travel, etc. My program is 30 credits. I am married and my husband and I make a decent amount of money (just under $100,000 a year combined) so I likely won't get too much federal aid, but I might get some financial help because I am getting a masters in Special Education. My program takes about 4 years for people to finish their 30 credit hours. This means my total amount of student loans could be around $30,000 if I don't get any non-loan help for my masters and if I take 4 years to finish the program.

**I am wondering if it would be better to have the scholars loan forgiveness pay me directly, so that I can pay for my graduate school with that money, or have them apply that balance to my student loans.** 

I will also be applying for state loan forgiveness this year, which could give me 20% of my loan balance in forgiveness. I can get this forgiveness for a total of 5 years. 


Information on the state scholars forgiveness I am applying for now is located [here.](https://www.iowacollegeaid.gov/teachiowascholar) This would pay me $4,000 (either to my lender or to me) for a maximum of 5 years.


Information on federal loan forgiveness is located [here.](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher) This is the forgiveness program I will apply for in about 4 years, and would pay $17,500 in forgiveness.

Information on my state forgiveness program is located [here.](https://www.iowacollegeaid.gov/content/iowa-teacher-loan-forgiveness-program) This is what I will apply for every year, and pays 20% of my student loan debt (up to resident tuition rates) for a maximum of 5 years.

personalfinance,Help for my friend! Not sure what do say anymore!,"Hello, I'm looking for advice for a friend of mine who is in a tough financial situation and I have tried to offer advice but I don't think I'm getting through. One, my friend is 22 and lives with a friend's family. To quickly summarize that living situation, the friend is absolutely fed up with him for personal reasons and might be kicking him out soon. He currently pays $100 rent there to assist the family, his job pays him $10.25/hr and he is full time. His mom helped him get a car, a 2003 Honda Accord but she agreed to make payments of $350/month as long as he covered the insurance which is $250/month. Recently only 3 months after getting the car, his mom is saying that she is moving to another state and is going to stop paying for the car which I believe is totally unfair since she said she would pay for the car herself and that is why my friend agreed in the first place. Nevertheless, my friend is now completely freaking out because he now needs to make sure he has this month's rent ($100), the car payment ($350), car insurance ($250), phone ($50), and whatever his other expenses are such as gas and food since in the home he lives in everyone has to fend for themselves. I told him that perhaps it's best to turn in the car because I believe $350 a month until it hits $7000 is WAY TOO MUCH for a 2003 Honda Accord, but he insists that he needs to get this to work out. I believe that if he does so he can get rid of $600 of monthly expenses since his insurance would be unnecessary afterwards as well. All advice is appreciated thank you!",finance,1473619662

personalfinance,Did I make a mistake purchasing a home? Starting to feel slight buyer's remorse...,"Recently bought a condo in a highrise, ~8 minute drive from work.  It's a 1 Bed 1 Bath unit, 817 sq. ft. in a building built in 1979.  


Final sales price: $180,000;  Appraisal price before closing was $190,000. 


I paid 20% down, with a Mortgage of $144,000 in a conventional 10-year loan, with interest rate of 2.75%, APR of 2.790%.


Principal + Interest - $1373 per month, with additional $213 in Escrow - for property tax and my home insurance ($150 a year)


HOA Fee: $509 a month, all utilities included.  :(


According to amortization schedule and final estimates, I'll be paying a total finance cost of $21,449.19 over the 10 years for the loan.   :(


Background: Age: 28, Single; been working at my very first real job for a little over 2 years now. Salary: ~$140-145k a year. Take-home pay is ~$6.6k a month after all taxes and the 401k contribution.


401k: Currently ~$40k+, contributing the max ~$18k per year


Debts: previously none, but now I have this $144,000 mortgage for the next 10-years


Traditional IRA from 2 years ago: ~$5k - invested with Vanguard


Roth IRA: Backdoored $5.5k earlier this year - invested with Vanguard


Vanguard mutual funds: ~$10.5k in Total Stock index and Total International index


Savings account with Ally: It was $51k, but I used it for the closing - $36k for 20% downpayment and another $5k for closing costs.  Recently started replenishing it - currently it's at $20k, at 1% interest rate.


Prior to buying, I rented a 1-BED 650 sq. ft, super-dirty, shitty, run-down, mice and cockroach-infested apartment that was a 6-minute walk to work, for $1095 a month.  I liked the cheap price and very good location, but the tradeoff was Quality, which did cause stress/disgust every day for me.


Before that, I was renting a 550 sq ft. studio apartment in a high-rise building for $1356 a month for a year, but moved to the shitty apartment closer to work when the new lease renewal agreement came and I saw they were raising the rent to $1400 a month.


Subtracting the equity that is gained in owning the condo and what I actually pay towards the principal for each month , I'm paying ($21447.19/120) = $178.73 each month to the bank as interest, $213 each month as taxes and insurance, and ($509 - $109 in the utilities I actually use) $400 each month towards the condo HOA, this totals $791.73 each month.  


This $791.73 is the money that's leaving my wallet that gains me no return - no equity from ownership, no utilities (already subtracted from the HOA), and is just a pure loss.  Over 10 years or 120 months, I'll have lost $95,007.


Adding in the closing costs for buying (and perhaps eventually selling), which I'll just estimate as $10,193, I'll come to a total of ~$105,200.  This is roughly $877 a month of pure loss.   



But if I had continued to rent, the rent in the area would have been $1095 for a shitty dirty basement apartment but conveniently-located within walking distance to work, or $1300-1400 for better-quality studios around the area,  or $1500-$1600 for ok-quality 1 Bedroom apartments.  


Did I make a mistake in buying?  Should I have continued to rent? 


Job security - I'm decently-confident (~90%) that I won't be fired in the next 2 years, and somewhat-confident (~60%) that I won't be fired in the next 4-5 years or so.  I'm no star-employee or anything, but I get decent ""Meets-Expectations"" assessments in every midyear and final reviews, and I've gotten my annual bonus each time thus far. 


I would like to stay in this area for as long as I am employed where I currently work.


However, I am concerned with my home, if I do decide to sell say 5-6 years down the line, and with how much of a return that I can actually get.   I've calculated that for if I choose to sell in 5 years, I'll have spent ($792x60 months) + ~$10480 (closing cost fees and moving costs) = $58,000.   Would this mean, I'll need to sell my condo unit at $238,000 ($180,000+58,000) to recuperate any losses from buying?  


Since I highly doubt that condos gain that much in value over 5 years, it's more likely that I'd only be able to sell for $190-210k.  Meaning I'll still have come out with a loss.


This has started to make me question whether or not it was financially-prudent to buy instead of continuing to rent.",finance,1473621878

personalfinance,"23 year old, 50k/yr, 62k of student loans.","Hi. Like the title of this post reads, I am a 23 year old who has been employed for almost a year in a position that pays 50,000 per year. I currently have 62,000 of student debt. All but 15k is financed with federal loans with an average interest rate of 4.5%. The 15k is financed through private loans with a much higher average interest rate of 8%. I currently am set to pay off the federal loans in around 9 years, and should have private loans paid off in 5 years. I am not able to make more than the required payment as of now on the federal loans, but do pay off extra on private debt. I am very aware now that I shouldn't have borrowed that much money for a bachelor's degree in economics, so please do not just say that. 

I currently live alone and rent an apartment that requires me to subscribe to cable and internet. After all utilities and other expenses, I pay 1200/month. I live extremely close to work so I hardly spend any money on gasoline. 

I am currently contributing 2% to my 401k and my company matches. I don't believe I would be able to make any higher of a contribution as of now. The mutual funds have returned 15% so they are doing quite well. 

I also have a small brokerage account where I am invested in another equity mutual fund. This account is serving as a type of additional savings account for intermediate financial goals (engagement ring for long term girlfriend, potential down payment on home purchase). I understand that this is risky, but at this point of my life, I am comfortable with the risk. 

I have no credit card debt, as I pay off my balance each month. I have a savings account with about 800 dollars in it that I do not touch and is strictly for emergencies.  I also like to keep my checking account balance about $200 at all times. My vehicle is paid off, but possibly looking to purchase a different car to allow for better MPG, as i may be moving further away from work to lower my cost of living. 

I don't live as frugally as I could when it comes to food. I tend to eat out often especially with girlfriend so this is something I am not very willing to cut down on because I want to be able to live somewhat of a decent life. 

I also have a dog that costs about $60/month.

I hate the fact that I have this much debt because it is impairing me from accomplishing other financial goals or even saving money at all. I feel as if my emergency reserve is not great enough, but I don't feel as if there is much I can do it about it. I also do not love my job and am considering switching careers but that is a story for another sub.

personalfinance,Paying off student loans while in graduate school?,"Hi all.  Before I begin I would like to thank you in advanced for any advice or thoughts you can share with me. I decided to include some extra information, sorry about that.

Over the course of my education I had to take out about $13,000 in student loans, but it is in my parent's name (PLUS Loan with ~7% interest rate). At this exact moment, I have ~1,700 dollars to my name, but I still need to come up with ~1,000 more in order to pay this semester's tuition (my parents can probably cover this if my current job won't give me the money I need in time). After this semester is over, I will officially have graduated with a BSc in Math, and will hopefully be attending graduate school in Spring 2017 or Fall 2017. I think I will have to start paying back my loans when I graduate, but I honestly have no idea how it works.

I plan to go straight for a PhD (or do an integrated Master-PhD program), so I will most likely be funded either through being a Teaching or Research Assistant. This funding will probably only be given during Fall and Spring Semesters, and the pay will probably be very low (probably close to $20,000 in total for both semesters, but hopefully a bit more). Fortunately I will not have to pay any tuition. 

Is it possible to ""live decently"" and still work towards paying off my student loans from undergrad with this amount of money? Are there any other ways that I can get money as a graduate student? I know fellowships are available, but they seem very competitive nowadays, and I did not go to a very well known undergrad institution. It might be possible to work as a Teaching/Research Assistant during the summer, but once again the pay would probably be fairly low. Are there any other ways for a young 20-something year old with a math degree to get money during the upcoming summer? I have looked into teaching at a community college, but its usually a requirement to have 18 graduate credit hours before you can teach (which is not possible before Summer 2017).

financialindependence,FI Story,"Howdy!

I [managed to retire recently](https://np.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4vlxzl/weekly_fi_monday_milestone_thread_august_01_2016/d5zrpn8), and one of the mods invited me to post something about it. Given the invitation, I thought I would share my story, and maybe spark a discussion or two.  I'm also hoping to bust a few myths: You don't need to have well-off parents. You don't need to [land out of college with a high income job](https://np.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4zpx1r/those_who_are_fire_or_close_ehat_were_your/d6xy3ja) or an in-depth knowledge about personal finance. And, yes, social safety nets really do help people who could use help.

Some background:

* USA. Male, Age: 53.  Married, separate finances, spouse also retired in 2016. 
* Childhood: Urban, working/poor environment. 
* Dad is a Korean war combat veteran (hero) with psychological/PTSD issues. I've never known him to hold a full-time job.  He spent a lot of time in VA hospitals and also swimming in the bottom liquor bottles. Worked as an auto mechanic, handyman, and running errands for people ... but nothing consistently. 
* Mom did whatever clerical work she could find.  Mostly part time or seasonal. 
* I can think of only one adult in my childhood who was a full-time, ""white collar"" professional. 
* I have two older brothers who still work in manufacturing/food processing &amp; distribution plants. 
* Our family, in my childhood, received food stamps and social security because we had shit for income, and because of my dad's psychological condition. 

As a bit of an outlier in my peer group,  I actually enjoyed school. I was curious about the greater world. I liked learning about things outside of my own experience. When I wanted to go to college, my parents were skeptical. Why would anyone *spend money* on college when they could *make money* taking a job?  Everyone was [hustling](https://np.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/3w06r4/im_sorry_guys_i_may_have_given_away_our_secrets/cxsh2be) for a [buck](https://np.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/3mqgbm/low_income_families_spend_6_of_their_salary_on/cvh9czq), and here I was, wanting to spend more than necessary.  Weird.

Anyway, I made my case (being the youngest has its advantages), and I got into university.  Majored in a liberal arts discipline. School was paid for mostly by financial aid from the feds and my state. Parents supplied some, and I took on some minimal loans, work study, and what handyman-type side jobs I could get.

I still lived at home because the university was in my city.  But, I spent all my free time at school, hanging out with friends or in the library.  I loved school.

What I wanted after my college experience was the freedom to schedule most of my time as I wished, like I did as a student. I took on part time work in my field of study (the best I could get and also thanks to a recommendation from a former professor) and saved, hoping for a way to get to graduate school and keep that freedom-feeling going.

This is a good place to interject that the big financial lesson I learned growing up was *if you can't afford it, you can't buy it. Period.* Credit cards were not a part of our family experience for most of my young life.  My mother was the glue that kept our family finances in check. Other people around us took the lesson that bling was the thing, and having something to show off was more important than being responsible in getting it.  But, because of my mom's example, I learned how to live on what money I had and nothing more.

Anyway, to speed up the story:

I spent my 20s living at home or in apartments with roommates, working part time, saving, traveling internationally, preparing for graduate school, being in graduate school (humanities; free ride - more great recommendations), getting married, developing computing skills through more work study jobs and side projects, learning about whatever interested me, and taking the scenic route through life. I didn't save a lot, but I did not go into debt. 

What I say so often in this sub is that people can go a long way towards FI by simply not screwing up. I was very careful about that.

I spent my 30s pretty much abandoning everything I ever studied in school (from a career perspective, but still enjoying it all as an observer or hobbyist), becoming a responsible, married adult, learning how to work full time and continuing to develop career-related skills (IT).  We bought our house (first and only major debt ever) and began to focus on our careers.

I spent my 40s working, advancing, saving, budgeting and investing.  This decade was the engine for my FI accumulation.  Once I became established in a career, the pay increases, along with the confidence and ability to stick with it made it pretty easy to reach my goal (to have more control over my time).  I also made it a point to keep up with old hobbies and to start new ones to keep my ""after work"" life worthwhile. (I also put a bunch of interests on hold, which I am itching to get back to.)

I reached my minimum 4% SWR number at 50, and kept working for padding and to let my spouse become comfortable with the idea of retiring early.  She ended up beating me by three months.

Financially, Mrs. Moose and I have spent our lives living much like we did in graduate school and still live more or less the same way...  I have been saving over 60-70% of my after-tax income for the past several years. I've also been [very, very lucky](https://np.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4yqqbl/would_you_go_back_and_change_your_college_major/d6qj8y4?context=3). I can't stress that enough.

Sorry this is so long ... Any questions, arguments or criticism, please have at it ...

TL;DR: Poor kid does well with government help, good fortune, and by adhering to ingrained, responsible spending habits.

personalfinance,Girlfriend inherited about 100k of money from a deceased relative. She has about 27k of student loans to pay off and we're nearing a turning point in our relationship. What should she/we do?,"So my girlfriend of a little over 2 years has inherited (gifted from estate owners in the family) about 100k from a deceased relative.  She has been gifted the money in 14k increments from different folks in her family to amount to 70k this year and should be expecting a bit more next year so she can avoid taxes.  

Now my question pertains to how she should pay for some things/save/invest.  She currently has 27k in student loans...should she pay the highest interest rates ones off first and just do min payments on the lower interest rates to maintain tax deductions?  Is there a better course of action here?

She's also looking at moving out of her parents place and into her own apt.  We will be living together a year from now, so how should she save her money/invest to minimize taxes?  She currently does not have a 401k or Roth or money market(?) account seeing as she's a teacher that is on a one year contract and is 26 years old. 

She also is interested in getting a new car seeing as hers has required tune ups/fixes at least a few times a year for since we started dating.  Anyone have any advice as the best way to tackle all of this?  I feel like I have a good grasp on budgeting my own finances and giving her tips, but this is a large sum of money I have never dealt with (I'm 24).

SORRY IN ADVANCE FOR SPELLING MISTAKES, IM BAD AT TYPING ON MY TABLET

Just grduated college into a job as a sailing engineer. This job has my salaray being mostly above 100k per year with some very short times being at 59k (a few weeks a year overall).

 I am a federal employee (unfortunatly) with a health plan, TSP (401K), vision plan. I carry ~27k in student loans and 3.6k in credit card debt. Not terrible.

Basically im looking for opinions on what my plan of attack should be on the debt. Right now im in a low-money period (59k/yr) with near zero living expenses. The expenses situation shoulld continue until july. 

For my credit card, im making 300-500 weekly payments depending on the week. Easy enough. 

For the studen loans, whose payments start in december or january, what sh hi uld my plan of attack be? Theyre all federal loans,. I was thinking I would direct my payments in two ways

1. Pay the minimum montly amount on an auto payment cycle, toward the overall 27k and let it put that amiunt toward the overall balance
2. Pay lump sums on the highest interest loans first, then moving to the lower ones.

I thats a soud strategy. I would like to be clear of all debt within this coming year (say by next december). Thoughts?

Second, retirment. My 5 year plan revolves around me upgrading my status via experiance, and moving into the commercial setor. Th union I will be moving into (in approx 3, 3.5 years) has pension plan, another plan which i dont remember, and a 401k (completely funded by me).
My current 401k, the tsp, fetures extremrly low managment somewhere on the order of 0.029%. I have of funds and their performances here ( https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundPerformance/returnSummary.html)

My strategy: im not too sure. I was thinking of picking three of the best performing funds, and one safe fund and dividing my contributions say 30 high risk, 25 medium, 25 medium/high, and 20 low. How does this sound? Which funds, from that chart would you invest in?

Also, taxes. I have the standrard 10k deducion, plus health and vision, plus I will be putting as much money as I can this year and maxing out the Tsp next year. What else can I do to minimize what uncle sam wants from me?

Also, what are good way to start avoiding the retirment withdrawl taxes from my 401k's?

personalfinance,"Should I pay off all student loans at the same rate, or prioritize paying one over the other if the interest is the same?","I have two private loans where up till now I have made the minimum payments, which basically means paying the interest and maybe a few cents of principal each month. I receive pay increases every six months (annual cost of living when a new fiscal year starts, and my performance based increase on my anniversary date) and I plan to increase my payment amount every time I get a pay increase, as well as increase the payment when other payments drop, i.e. my car loan in 11 months. My lender requires that interest be paid off first which is pretty standard so the bulk of my payment goes to that. I have the option to prioritize paying off one loan over the other once the interest is taken out. Given that both loans have the same interest rate (4.5%) and the balance differs by only $600, is there any advantage to designating the remainder of the funds all go to one account once the interest is paid or should I just let the funds be split 50/50?

I would probably pay up front for this, but may look into a solar loan at a local credit union.

-SMA 4000TL-US-22 Inverter w/ Standby Power Supply

Cost of installation: $13,800

Oregon state tax credit: ($6,000) (over 4 years, $1,500 per year max)

Federal tax credit: ($4,140)

Net cost: $3,660

They estimate annual utility savings of $445.

**Questions**

* Does this make financial sense? I've currently got a lot on my plate with the cost of building but I don't want to miss out on tax incentives.
* Is this a good size system for pretty low usage (temperate climate, just one person)?

personalfinance,"Leaving advisor, investing inheritance.Feedback? (xpost boggleheads forum)","HI PF,

I’m getting ready to switch to a (fairly) lazy portfolio, moving as much as I’m able at the moment from under the management of my current adviser.  I’ll try to keep this  as succinct and as clear as possible. My thanks in advance. 

About 5 years ago I inherited what is now just under $3 million. I’m 39. I’ve finally taken the time to educate myself, learning here and reading several books- Boggleheads, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Investor’s Manifesto and Four Pillars, Common Sense Investing and Coffee House. I’m formulating a plan and I’d really appreciate your collective wisdom. 

Of that 3M invested, I’m getting ready to move and invest about 1 million soon, and another 500K within a year.  The rest is split between 1) long position equities that I will pare down strategically over time rather than sell for large gains, and a portfolio of fixed/ bonds, that I haven’t addressed yet. 

My stats:
Emergency Funds: Yes/75k cash
Debt: 160k home loan at 3.3%, 
Job Status: Employed
Tax Filing Status: Single
Income: 150k/yr
Tax rate: federal: 22%
State and city 10%
State of Residence: NY
Age: 39

Current Investments:
Advisor account: $2,850,000
Roth IRA: $65,000
Sep IRA, 10,000

It is a modified coffeehouse portfolio with three changes:
•	I’ve scaled it to 80/20 instead of 60/40. 
•	I removed and redistributed the REIT percentage because I’ve got rental real estate. 
•	Finally I split the international as in a coward’s portfolio.  

I feel pretty ok about 80/20 given that I’m not going to need this any time soon. 

First how does this basic overall goal allocation?
Is removing the REIT portion because of my real estate a good idea? It seems like I’m already pretty exposed to the real estate market.
Any improvements to the individual index funds I’ve selected there? I feel like I could get a lot of advantage out of the low expense ratio of Vanguard Admiral/ETF shares, but I’m reading a lot about how bad the service has gotten, including the issues with cost basis being wrong etc. This is really distressing. What are my best alternatives?

Second, how do I account for the equities I’ve already got? 
Most of what I’ve got now are Large and mid sized growth stocks. Is it best to count them against the “large blend” percentage of my portfolio, or does that leave something important out? If so, how should I compensate?

Finally, Taxable vs Non Taxable. 

I’ve got a SEP and a Roth IRA, and I’m not sure what should go into the tax advantaged accounts. Currently the bonds and corporate fixed income are in taxable accounts. Roth and SEP have mostly internationals. When I clean house here, what is best to put into these tax advantaged accounts. Almost all of my assets are in taxable accounts, so this won’t have a huge impact in the short term, but I do want to set myself up for success in the long term.

I’m going to post a few other more specific questions in separate threads as well, but this I think will cover me through the first big step. Thanks so much. This community has taught me so much.

Edit: adding to clarify from posts below.
I should clarify that tax rate was last year's which was unusually high because we sold off a shared real estate investment that came from the inheritance and so paid a lot of taxes.

I'm self employed. have no 401k
Income listed above includes about 12K/year in rental income. I'm looking to increase that with further rentals.

EDIT: I realized that somehow with the original posting the actual allocations I've planned didn't paste. hopefully this should be more clear!

Before the procedure I payed $325 because they wanted ""my portion"" up front, and the insurance would cover the rest.  I have heard of this arrangement before so no big deal.  BTW I have 2 dental insurances and they will only file with one.
So fast forward 6 months.  I get a bill for $325 more dollars, and a paper showing that they filed 5x with my primary insurance and they only paid a portion of what was estimated.  
My thought was to call them, and either ask them to file with the secondary insurance as well, OR just pay them and I will file with the secondary myself.  And while I had them, ask where they discrepancy was and see what wasn't covered.  
Here's the problem:  I have called everyday since the 7th of September.  It turns out, the surgeon and his entire office, have closed theirs doors permanently.  He broke his hand in a fall and was old anyway so he just retired.
The answering service that now answers his keeps taking my name and number and swears someone will call me back, but no one has.  And today I got a nastier letter threatening to send the bill to collections if I don't remit immediately. 

I'm trying to pay, whether I think should have to or not, I'm attempting to pay them and there is literally no way.  and now I'm about to have collectors after me potentially ruining my spotless credit.

I'm interested in potentially doing a master's in a couple of years so I'm trying to figure out what would be the best choice on how to pay for it based on my situation. 

I'm 22 and I have no student loans for undergrad and I'm completely debt free. I work for the federal government and I have a 401k that I contribute enough so that I get full matching and a pension that's automatically deducted from my paycheck.   I save well and my job has a clear promotion schedule so I've projected that in 3 years I will be making 70k annually and will have about 30k in savings. As stated above, these savings are not my primary form of retirement. 

The master's degree programs I'm interested in doing 3 years from now are about 60k for the whole program, and I can definitely get my job to cover half of it. So my question is: for the 30k that my job isn't covering, would it be better for me to essentially use all of my savings, or would it be more advisable to take out a loan and pay it back slowly?

In 2014 my parents bought me my car in full and I absolutely love it but have figured that if this buyback plan does go through I need to take advantage of it. I should be receiving nearly full purchase price back including the 5-10k on top of the buyback. Around 27k (just rechecked the ss).

My office is very close to where I live 15 min bike ride - so I plan on not buying a new car. However, the new office the company is moving to in late January would be significantly farther away.

I am still covered by my parents insurance plan. I live in a home my parents own and don't pay rent in exchange for being the caretaker of the house (it's over 150 yrs old so it can be a lot of work sometimes).

I have currently saved 11,000 in my emergency fund and just started a Roth IRA with Charles Schwab but have not made any contributions yet. 


Thanks for getting through that-on to the questions!

Should I switch my health insurance now or wait until my parents expires? 

What should I do with the money I receive from VW (My parents won't let me pay them back as it was a gift)? 

Should I buy a beater car on the off chance I will need it when the new office is complete? 

Should I contribute more to my co 401K since they only match 3% or should I increase my personal savings rate?

Gas is a factor as well as I drive about 60 miles round trip each day for work. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Car info:

Current payment- $576.17

Current balance- $29,421.42

Current Interest rate- 1.00%

Current remaining payments- 53

Approximate trade in value- $25,400

Looking at Kia Souls in the $14,000 range.

Would not mind going used but I doubt any bank would let me roll over $4000 on a used $8000 Kia Soul. 

Also a little worried that I will be paying more in interest on the new car as my credit score has gone down a little bit since I bought the truck. 

Is it worth taking the roll over hit to get into a car that is half the price?",finance,1473707534

personalfinance,"Not being paid correct wages, unsure how to proceed","So the title pretty much sums it up. I recently started working for a new company, after weeks and weeks of paperwork and background checks and what have you. I was signed on as a Beverage Server, and the manager had already agreed that I would train to bartend because that's what they needed and what I wanted to do. So. 

First red flag was after finally obtaining my work permit for this specific type of work, which the company paid for, I was then informed I have to pay it back - $50 out of each paycheck for 9 weeks, for a total of $450. Okay, I'm irritated I was not aware of this beforehand, but I'll roll with it. 

Then the real problem - I immediately began picking up shifts as a bartender. Typically once or twice a week. The difference here is that as a server, I make $3.50 hourly along with the tips I make serving customers on the floor. As a bartender, especially during the week, you rarely make any tips because you're not out getting orders - so you are to make minimum wage hourly ($8.35 here). After the first paycheck, noticing I was only getting paid the flat $3.50, I went to my manager who had me sign a ""dual rate"" form, confirming I would make the appropriate amount of hourly wages depending on which job I was doing. This was... let's see, August 10th. I still saw no changes. Finally about two weeks ago, I called HR after hearing rumors that I had to pass my probationary period (six months) before getting paid back for all bar hours, which now total to about 80 - over $400 that I'm owed. HR said that was correct. When I asked to see the paperwork where I was informed of this, he backtracked and said I was only hired as a server and never signed for dual rate. I explained that yes, I had, less than two weeks after starting the job. He said he would look into it and call me back. That was 13 days ago and I haven't heard a word. 

I know that's a long block of text, but I'm completely fed up. I've had many coworkers tell me this happened to them and that they were compensated back for it, but my problem is I NEED that money (single mom, 3 year old) and am floored by the lack of communication and professionalism going on. I am actively looking for a better job, but in the meantime, any advice would be more than welcome for this situation. 

TLDR; Company not paying me the correct wages, have not heard back in two weeks since last contact, not sure what I can do to get the money I'm owed.",finance,1473709494

I have done a little bit of budgeting and found that if I were to keep a nice little salary for myself for expenses, I'll have about 7k left in my savings account. This would be everything I have, so I was thinking about trying to use about 3-5k of it to try to make something more than the stupid low interest rates that my savings account collects.   
I'm not really sure where to start, though. The ELI18 and ELI22 posts do not talk very much about this, and I am following the guidelines that they have set up for someone my age.    
* I have looked into Acorn, but I'm a little worried their fees will make it near impossible to make anything.    
* I've thought about opening a ROTH IRA, but I was thinking that because I am so young, something more aggressive may be better since at this age I can afford to be aggressive and possibly mess up.    
I'm not really sure where the next step for me should be. Should I try to just trade bonds that are on sale if I can find a place to do that? Is there something more I should be doing? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I invest 15% of my money into a 401k (with an additional 8% invested by my employer at 23% total per year). I live a very modest life style at the moment because of my debt and savings.

I'm still getting notices from a collection agency.

Should I just put the remainder of the bill on a credit card and be done with both the hospital and collection agency? My finances are not that great currently.

Seeking advice...,"Using a throwaway account. I apologize if this isn't the proper place but even a point in the right direction would be nice. Let me explain the situation:

I currently work for a small business in the state of Oregon that sells designer 'clothing'. There are two locations and I work at the smaller of the two. This business has been open for about 50 years. I started last February and have never had any complaints about sales or performance. We were officially notified this evening that our store will be closing by October 1st. There are 7 employees at our smaller location that have been offered similar positions at our last and remaining location, lets call the place Br for refence. Well location 'Br' is in another town which can take about 35-65 minutes to get there depending on the day and time. This is 4 times the travel for most of us currently employed at the soon to be closed store. Also, the 'Br' store is fully staffed so not eveyone will be given the same hours as we currently have. Some of us will lose weekday hours and only be able to work weekends because of children, school, and drive times. 

Here's my question:
Is unemployment an option for us workers if we cannot possibly switch the the 'Br' location? My issues are that my husband and I have a child so when he gets home from work we switch off and I head into my job. With this postion being 4 times the travel distance I can no longer make it to the 'Br' location in time for evening shifts. I will miss out on 16-32 hours every week because of this. Also, our job is partially sales so with the location being fully staffed we won't get to help as many customers per consultant, thus meaning we make less commision on our sales. So us girls losing our positions at the closing location and then moving over to the 'Br' location will actually possibly cost us more money than we make (not making it worth our while/losing money). 

If you've made it this far, thank you. It's been hard to get this written out because this could possibly put a very large financial burden on our family when we were just starting to get on our feet again. One of my main issues is the owner said he had been planning this for 6 months and we are just being told now, less than 3 weeks before we are now set to close. Any advice is appreciated.

Yep. That's right. 

So... uh... like... WTF does it even do? 

As illustrated [*here*](https://i.redd.it/ozw4jenus1lx.png), the NX will feature a 3D camera very similar to the one of the 3DS, notably located ***on the back side*** of the system. And for good reason: 

When slid into the Gear-VR-esque NXVR viewer, the 3D camera faces right in the viewing direction of the person using the device. 

This allows the 3D video from the player's real-life environment to be fed through to the VR view one-by-one. 

As a result, the player will have the option to ***seamlessly*** adjust the mix/ratio between real life and virtual reality -- from 100% RL, through AR, to full-bonkers VR immersion! 

This also means that the player can leave the VR game world with a simple press of a button whenever he/she wants -- ***without*** first having to get off the VR headset! Aside from allowing easy-to-set-up ***local VR multiplayer***, it's how Nintendo address the issue of 'VR isolation' and parental worries associated with it. It will even be possible to switch to 'full-RL view' from outside, by using the second detachable controller as a remote for parental control! 
 
That's the idea Nintendo is afraid the competition could steal. Because currently, NO OTHER VR OR AR DEVICE OF NOTE OFFERS SUCH A FEATURE. But copying it wouldn't be hard at all.",technology,1473767142

personalfinance,"Collections 101: You have an account in collections, what now?","Collection agencies exist because businesses cannot let “bad” debt linger on their books for longer than ~180 days. By letting a bill go overdue for this long, you run the risk of your creditor either assigning or selling your debt to a [collection agency/debt collector](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-expect-when-your-debt-goes-collection.html). Before jumping into it, it’s important to know that there is an important difference in how debt is handled if it is assigned or sold:

**Assigned Debt** - Debt that is transferred to a collection agent in order for them to work on getting you to pay. Your original creditor (OC) still owns the debt and the collection agency will receive a percentage of whatever they get you to pay. 

**Sold Debt** - This is debt that has been sold to a debt collector who now legally owns your debt. You now owe nothing to the original creditor but you are still liable for the debt under the terms of the contract you had with the OC. Debt collectors usually buy debt at a deep discount and get to keep everything they get you to pay.

So let’s say you get a letter in the mail/phone call one day from a collection agency saying you owe them money. What’s your best course of action?

1. Call the [original creditor](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/1387/6-what-original-creditor-and-what-difference-between-original-creditor-and-debt-collector.html) - Maybe you let your final utility bill from your old apartment/house go unpaid, which is a relatively common occurrence for debt collectors, you need to give that utility company a call immediately. Their representative can tell you whether or not the communication you received was legitimate (if they did sell or transfer the debt) and what needs to be done in regards to paying it. In most cases, they are going to tell you to pay the debt collector whether it was sold or transferred. Don’t acknowledge the debt is yours, just say you’d like information about who holds it. It doesn’t hurt to ask if they can pull the debt back from the collector if it has been assigned. It’s always best to pay your original creditor, preventing a collection agency from touching your credit report, and keeping the debt as being reported as “charged-off”.

2. Collection agencies that call you before any other contact is made are required by the [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)](http://financeography.com/how-the-fdcpa-protects-consumers/) to send you a letter within five days of that initial phone call. The letter needs to have some basic information regarding the debt and who owns it, as well as a notice about your rights as a consumer. Assuming the debt collector has your correct address, you should receive the letter within about a week. If they do not have your correct address, and your mail isn’t being forwarded, you may never get the letter. Collection agencies can send their notice to your last known address and be alright under the FDCPA. Living at the same address for a long time and not receiving the letter is a violation and you can claim up to $1,000 for it. (More on that later)

3. When you do receive their [notice](http://www.accountingtools.com/questions-and-answers/what-is-a-dunning-letter.html) in the mail, it should have information on it regarding what needs to be done if you dispute the validity of the debt (if it is just a letter saying how much you owe and giving you options to pay, with nothing else, that’s an FDCPA violation). Within 30 days of receiving the letter, you will need to write to them requiring them to validate your debt. These are some good examples of [debt validation letter templates](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/debtcollection/) which cover all of your bases. It is best if you send your letter via [certified mail with a return receipt requested](https://www.usps.com/ship/insurance-extra-services.htm) from the receiver. This acts as proof that they got your validation letter.

4. When they get your validation letter they must immediately stop trying to collect from you until they send you [validation paperwork](http://financeography.com/why-debt-validation-is-so-important/). This means all phone calls must stop, lawsuits must stop, letters must stop, everything must stop EXCEPT they can still update your credit report (there is a caveat here as well). Receiving a letter that was already in the mail by the time they got your validation request does not go against the FDCPA but you don’t have to respond to it. A popular misconception about debt validation is that because you have 30 days to dispute the debt, they have 30 days to respond to it. This is untrue (except in [Texas where state law DOES mandate they have 30 days to validate your debt](http://occc.texas.gov/consumers/debt-collection-practices)), they can take as long as they want to validate it, provided they do not attempt to collect in the meantime. 

5. Perhaps you receive a letter in the mail validating the debt, this lets them restart their attempts to collect from you. They might try calling but if you want, you can withdraw your consent for them to call at anytime. The best way to do this is to either tell them all calls are inconvenient for you when you send the debt validation letter or in a separate letter after you receive validation. Calling you (more than once) after you revoke consent puts them in violation of the FDCPA and [Telephone Consumer Protection Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_Consumer_Protection_Act_of_1991) (TCPA)

6. They’ve validated the debt, you know where the debt is from, you just want it to be off of your credit report. Your first option is to obtain a [Pay-for-Delete](http://ficoforums.myfico.com/t5/Rebuilding-Your-Credit/Pay-For-Delete-Success/td-p/3661442) agreement with the debt collector. In order for this to work, you’ll usually have to make a payment in full, possibly that day but for sure within a short amount of time. This used to be a popular option if you owed money to a collection agency since they would normally be happy to get paid and remove the information. In the past couple of years, credit reporting agencies have clamped down on the practice since it makes their reports “less accurate”. Now, if a certain company starts putting in too many requests to remove an account, they will be flagged for a review. If the credit bureau finds that they are basically agreeing to everyone who wants to pay for a delete, the bureau will stop that company from reporting to them, depriving the collection agency of a very powerful tool to help them collect. Experian and Transunion are much more strict with collection agencies than Equifax, which is why you sometimes see a collection account on only one credit report (usually Equifax). At least you know if you only see the account on one bureau’s report, there is a good chance a Pay-for-Delete agreement will work.

7. Collection agencies will usually let you setup a payment plan to let you pay off your debt over time. After you make the last payment, you will want to get something from them which shows that you have paid what you owed. You can also negotiate how much you’re willing to pay a collection agency, though this works better if you can afford to make a lump sum payment that day. Some agencies or creditors will forgive a certain amount of debt, but if it ends up forgiving more than $600, they will likely give you a [1099-C tax form](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/forgiven-debt-1099C-income-tax-3513.php) for the amount that was forgiven. This will count as income for tax purposes.

8. For debts deemed big enough, there is a chance that the debt collector will [sue you](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/creditor-lawsuits-how-the-case-begins.html). This usually only happens either with very large debts, or if a big debt collector holds your account and you live in an area with many other account owners. You’re probably safe from a lawsuit if you owe $300 and live in an extremely rural area, but you may be at a much higher risk of a suit if you owe $5,000 and live in Los Angeles. If you get served papers, SHOW UP TO COURT, do not let them get a default judgement against you. You can often talk with the attorney to work out a payment plan, or you can attempt to fight the lawsuit. (More on this later)

9. Having a ton of debt and few assets may make [bankruptcy](https://www.hg.org/bankrpt.html) your best bet. This is basically the nuclear option since it can wipe out all of your dischargeable debt (not student loans) but you are going to look super-risky to lenders for the next couple of years. If there are no major purchases (house or car) in the near future, it may be worth looking into. Forgiven debt under a bankruptcy is not counted against you as income under bankruptcy. Chapter 13 bankruptcy reorganizes your debt while and lets you keep most assets while Chapter 7 lets a trustee sell non-exempt assets but wipes debt away completely.

10. After seven years (7 years, 6 months in practice, but it [depends on the state](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/credit-cards/state-statutes-of-limitations-for-old-debts-1.aspx)) from the date of the first delinquency, credit reporting bureaus must remove bad information about you from their reports. At the same time, if you dispute a debt with a credit bureau and they receive no response from the business listed on the account for 30 days, they must remove it from your credit report. Some states have laws that get bad marks off of your credit faster but federal law says seven years. Shady collection agencies might try to tell the credit bureaus that you “made a payment” or “acknowledged the debt”, which will [restart the ~7 year waiting period](http://www.creditinfocenter.com/repair/reaging.shtml). This is a violation of the [Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-credit-reporting-act) and you can collect awards from debt collectors and credit report bureaus breaking this, as well as the FDCPA and TCRA.

It’s sometimes best to wait out the statute of limitations, especially around the 5-6+ year mark if you don’t have any big purchases in the pipeline. What that isn’t feasible, after a couple of years, the impact that negative information has on your report does start to drop off by quite a bit. It’s why you won’t see your credit score rise much, if at all, by having a 7 year old collections debt fall off as opposed to getting a 6 month old collections account deleted.

I commented “more on that later” on a couple of things and that refers to more aggressively cleaning up your credit report. There are companies out there that will gladly charge you tons of money to “clean up your credit” when you can do just about everything yourself for 2% of their fees. I’ll write up something a little more comprehensive about that tomorrow.

**EDIT** - Don't acknowledge that you own a debt if you intend to fight it. Whether it's yours or not, you're only putting yourself in a bad position and it's another thing that can restart the aging process on a debt.

I'm currently in year four of a 10-year graduated plan on federal student loans. I have $52k remaining at 6.8%. My payment is $511/mo
I also make good money at a company that does 50% 401k matching with no limit (2 more years til fully vested). I contribute $500/mo to that. Lastly, I'm currently refinancing my mortgage to 3.375% interest which will immediately free up $200/mo. I'm 30 years old

Issue
I was thinking I'd put the extra money toward my student loans but maybe I'm not doing the best thing for myself by leaving that much retirement money on the table. Should I instead increase my retirement contribution? I don't think paying down my mortgage makes sense. Should I even have my student loans on a ten-year plan? Maybe I should find the lowest payment I can on my student loans by extending the term and/or refinancing so that I can increase my 401k contribution. Etc.",finance,1473779909

personalfinance,First time home-buyer program.. What can I afford?,"Hello everyone! 

I've been getting my feet wet looking into home-buying options, I'm sick of renting. It's over-whelming to say the least. So many options and moving pieces and things to consider. I'd really appreciate some input.. Is this is a good idea? Am I rushing into things, etc? Thanks in advance and sorry if this ends up being a wall of text. 

So first I'll post a link that describes the program I want to take advantage of: http://loans.rhodeislandhousing.org/First-time_homebuyer/

You'll see it includes 100% financing at a decent interest rate, closing cost assistance and the possibility of no PMI and a tax credit. Now, I'm assuming it's unlikely to qualify for every single one of these opportunities. Also, one option for closing cost assistance is a separate low interest loan which I would like to avoid. The income max appears to be 89k which we qualify for.

So my plan is to take the ""homebuyer class"" with my boyfriend and talk to one of the mortgage specialists.. But before I dive in, I need to know if my current financials will even make what I'm looking for in a house plausible:

Right now I make 40k and my boyfriend makes 32k for a total of 72k.. I also make a guaranteed quarterly bonus that averages to about 900 dollars a quarter. Plus, we dog sit which brings in an average of 300 a month (I will be able to expand our services and increase this once we own our own home) and I know this shouldn't be considered but my SO is in a very rigid track to get a raise every six months.. Eventually making 45k in four years. 

Debt:
14k in federal student loans ($60 a month, interest rates between 3.5 and 6% 
14k in private student loans ($330 a month, variable interest rate of 4.5%)
Credit cards: 0, paid off monthly
Cars: owned outright
My boyfriend also has 0 debt. 

My plan is to aggressively pay down the private loan before even applying for a mortgage so that I'm just left with federal. 


We try to keep our bills low: no cable, both our phones are paid for through work, we don't even use our dishwasher and that saves us $50 a month. I spend $120 every two weeks on groceries and drive a very fuel efficient car (and have no commute because I work from home!) 

My credit is pretty good, around 780 and my boyfriends is in the 700s but we don't know the exact number. 

Savings: this is where we lack but kind of the reason I want to take advantage of the program (no down payment) My SO probably has about 6k right now and I have about 3k.. Now we will continue to save for a little while to build this up, and plan on using it for an emergency fund, closing costs, inspection, fees, surprises, etc. 

The house: in our area it's hard to find anything we like under 250k, with our preference falling right at the 350k mark. I feel like this is way too high and I'm worried it's just not doable. I really do not want to do a ""starter"" house as I HATE moving and just don't think it's a good idea.

personalfinance,I (19F) am trying to file as an independent on my taxes to receive more for FAFSA. I pay for everything except 2/3 of Health Insurance. Can my parents still try to file me as a dependent?,"I moved out of the house this August and am interested in filing my taxes for either next year or the year after as an independent, to see if that would effect my FAFSA money I'm receiving.


My parents cosigned for my first loans of $20K, $3K (Private, Federal). They are now not cosigning for anything, so I am paying for a community college tuition with any FAFSA loan money I can get and any scholarships I earn. I had barely enough to pay for 8 credits this semester (it should be lower next semester once I earn in-district tuition).



My mother keeps telling me she can still claim me, but I'm not sure if that is true anymore. I pay my phone, housing, utilities, school, and credit card bills myself. Besides paying for daily living, I also give them $70 a month to pay for a third of my health insurance and pay any copays out of pocket.


The only thing they were technically paying for was my health insurance last year. I lived on campus at a 4-year university last year from Sept-May (which was the $23K in loans), then lived in a sublease from May-July, and stayed at home for a month before moving in with my boyfriend and our roommate (our close friend).


I am mainly concerned about when, or if I can even file as an independent. They make 109K combined income a year- and that doesn't lead to extremely helpful contributions from FAFSA, so I'm just trying to figure out how that will effect it.",finance,1473789223
personalfinance,"I'm 28, 100k in student loan debt, 9k in CC debt, and am about to have a baby. Help.","Hey PF,

To put it bluntly, I'm pretty screwed. When I was 18, the advice I got was ""go to the best school you can and pay it later"". I didn't realize my parents were sending me ""spending money"" that was just more money borrowed against my loans. I came out of school with about 180k, so I'm paying it down at a decent rate.   

They were federal loans mostly around 8.9%, so I had them consolidated into a private loan that's 5.75% about a year ago, so I have none of the cool IBR options.   

I got a stranger pregnant this past January. Begging them not to keep the baby, they insisted they were going to. The baby is due in October. We won't be living together. On a weekly basis do I beg her not to take me to court. Lawyers estimate court will demand about 2,500/mo from me. She says if I send her 1,200/mo she won't take me to court.   

My salary is 85,000/yr, which translated to about 2,200 every two weeks after taxes. I moved into a 2 BR so baby mama could move in and split it with me. She's not coming now. That's 1695/mo. I'm trying to find a roommate.   

Loan payments are 1,200/mo. CC Bills I barely touch as they're 0% Balance until December, when I'm likely to try to open up another 0% card and transfer them over to get another year of breathing room. Internet is FiOS, 60/mo. Electric isn't bad.   
  
There's another 14k in Student loan debt but the interest rate is 2.75% so I pretend that doesn't even exist.  

To summarize:

In: 4,400/mo  
Out: 1,200 loan  
1,200 child support  
1,695 (potentially 847.5) Rent  
59.99 FiOS  
200.00 CC Minimum   
Total: 4355 (3507.49)

So, I basically start my month with no money...I'll need to fly a few times a month so I can try to be a part of the kid's life in some way, so that's an added expense. I have the opportunity to refinance the loans with two options:  
5.21%, 10 years, 1,000/mo.
4.61%, 7 years, 1,400/mo.   
I'd need a cosigner for both. A friend of mine is offering to loan me 400/mo for ONE YEAR to help me get on the second one, but unless I get a big honking raise, that's not sustainable.   

I'm not even really sure what I'm asking. What would you guys do? I'd leave this place, but 1. I'm sure the landlord will sue me for the remnant of the lease and 2. In the Boston area, 850/mo is actually probably about as cheap as things will get. I'm going to be in debt forever, I know that. I know if I ever want a house, my mortgage will doubly ensure that.  I have about 47k in my 401k. Is it time to liquidate that? I'm sure it isn't gaining interest faster than my loans are....  


Thanks for whatever advice you can offer. I'm really on the precipice here.   

Cheers.

personalfinance,Received an inheritance in the form of mutual funds. Tax questions.,"I just received an inheritance in the form of shares in a mutual fund. I've kind of been thrown into the world of finance unexpectedly because now I need to figure out what I'm doing. I have what may be some dumb questions about how the taxes are paid. 

1) The fund that they're currently in is fee-heavy and doesn't grow as much as index funds might, so I'm going to sell it all, use a little bit for immediate expenses, then move the rest into a portfolio for retirement (I'm a recent grad student without any debt). Will the fund automatically take care of the taxes when I sell my shares or will they just pass the information onto the IRS and then I have a tax bill come next year?

2) I'm also a recent grad without a job, so I'm in the bottom tax bracket and probably will still be when I go to sell these shares. Since this fund has been active for 13+ years, are all the capital gains going to be long-term capital gains or still a mix? How do I figure that out? (Since long-term capital gains taxes for the bottom tax bracket are basically nothing at the federal level if I'm correct.)

3) I keep reading about buying and selling mutual fund shares before/after the distribution date. Is the distribution date Jan 1 for all funds or does it depend? Is it true that I should sell these before then and wait until after the new distribution date for the new fund to reinvest them into that fund for tax purposes?

4) After I reinvest the money into better funds, how will the taxes from the economic income of the investment be paid, automatically by the fund from my shares as they accrue or will I again be responsible for taking money directly out of my pocket and giving it to the IRS to pay for those taxes? (I'm looking to invest in Vanguard's stock and bond index funds, if that makes a difference.)

This inheritance kind of came as a surprise and I've head to basically give myself a crash course on how all this works. I'm learning a lot, but I can't seem to figure out how I'll specifically be paying taxes. I'm a recent grad without a job yet, and I don't know what my job situation will be in the immediate future, so I'm just worried about getting hit directly with big tax bills from the IRS.

personalfinance,"17 year old student, planning on having a post-secondary education at a medical school, no knowledge on student loans!","Hey r/personalfinance! I'm writing this on mobile so I apologize in advance for any formatting errors.

As the title states above, I am currently 17 years old and will graduate from a **Canadian** high school in July. I'm confident that I can get accepted into the medical school of my choosing, but that is not the issue!

I am coming from a middle class family you see, with what I roughly estimate is $15,000 in savings for education purposes. 

Medical school will take around 8 years to complete, and the tuition for that period is around $240,000 at a rate of roughly $30,000 a year. 

I will have to live on campus because it is a 1 hour and 30 minute commute from home, which translates into 3 hours eaten up every day of study time, which is just not sustainable when it comes to such a demanding field of education. I estimate living on campus will add an extra $60,000 on to the list of expenses for the 8 years.

This all adds up to ~$300,000 and it doesn't take a mathematician to figure out that $15,000 ≠ $300,000.

I can honestly say that I have no clue how financing and student loans work, which is why I am here, **so my question is: is it realistic or even possible to take out this much money on loan?**

There must be some sort of cap on the amount the university can loan you right? If so, then I would probably be SOL...

I also heard that you can delay payment of your student loans until after you've completed your education, is this true? If this were the case, wouldn't you be victim to an increased interest rate?

I have engineering as my backup career in the case that this doesn't work out, but I would still like to see if it's possible in my situation, regardless of if it's realistic or not seeing as it's my dream career.

Anyways, sorry for rambling so much, any help is appreciated!!

- We would like to move to a nearby city in the next couple of years.  Unfortunately, housing prices are higher in the destination city, so we are likely going to have to buy a more expensive house to be in one of our desired neighborhoods.  
- I am about to receive a bonus at work of roughly $20K (gross, so I will have to pay taxes on it).

Would I be better off:

(1) using the bonus proceeds to pay off one of my higher interest rate student loans (i.e., $14K balance with an 8.5% fixed rate); or

(2) putting the money in savings so that we could put 20% down on the next house when we move?

My understanding is that 20% down will mean no more PMI, and having some equity would also lower our mortgage payment. 

Any thoughts and/or advice on the best use of the bonus money?",finance,1473804994
personalfinance,"(long post, sorry)Moved cross country for grad school and a full time job. Emergency fund, car, student loans, or CC debt first?","Some background:
I'm 22. I graduated and moved to start a career in Student Affairs at a private institution in Central NY while also getting my graduate degree. The institution I'm at offered me a live-on position in one of the dorms (think an RA but higher up) and remitted tuition, which essentially translates into being taxed on part of my tuition. All in all, I don't pay rent, utilities, or laundry costs, so I bring home approximately $1100-1200 a month in semimonthly payments (my university has hella health insurance benefits for pretty cheap, too). Outside of food and filling my apartment (I moved here with very little saved and very little belongings and work in an office with a strict dress code/I also moved from the south to the north and am prepping for winter) my checks have recently gone to things like books and such since the semester is starting. I also just started the position so at this very point in time, I'm not sitting at more than $300 in my combined accts (along for reasons I outline later). An added plus is that I get a meal plan because I work in the dorms, though it covers one meal a day. 

At this point. I'm trying to figure out what to put money into first:

I had to exhaust my emergency fund when I had to get emergency dental work done twice between May-July, so I was looking at rebuilding that. 

A car is something I haven't had yet since late high school. I got a hunk of junk that had its brakes go out and I got into a pretty nasty wreck that left me and everyone else okay, but the car was totaled. Public transit is pretty big around here, but that has its limitations. If I ever do plan to travel back home, I'd probably have to fly considering I'm well over 12 hours away. 

I paid my way through school and came out with 20,000 in loans. Even though I'm a part time student, I get my loans deferred! Grad school is ""technically"" free for me, so I want to make a dent in that debt if at all possible. 

 I had a Discover student CC that I applied for in sophomore year of undergrad and, when I hit a really tight spot senior year, I used it to cover the remainder of my tuition for the semester when the loans weren't cutting it (I know, I *KNOW*). I'm currently carrying a 1,850 debt on it (I forget the interest rate off the top of my head) and am making the minimums as I go along. My credit score is sitting at a 690 right now (it was around 710 before the tuition payment).

I'm coming to reddit because I'm mostly desperate - I grew up in a pretty toxic household where money wasn't something I learned to manage (part of why I've relocated), and I'm playing catch-up. Any wisdom/perspective is appreciated.",finance,1473805313
personalfinance,So I am looking to refinance...,"Hello all,

So I am considering refinancing my home loan for my primary residence. I am considering this because of how low interest rates presently are, and that if I have to rent my condo unit later, I will have more flexibility in what I offer based on my monthly payments dropping. I have a strong credit score. I am looking for advice/thoughts on the subject.

Background: My current loan is 3 a 30 year, conventional fixed loan at 4.625%. I have had it for about 3 years, and have paid more than the original principal, and have only about 60% of the home's value remaining to pay off. I am VA eligible but did not use it on this home, which is my first and only home purchase.

Details of options: The bank I am currently with, ""Bank A,"" is offering a new 30 year, VA fixed rate loan at 3.25%. Via Zillow, I found a mortgage company, Mortgage Company B, which has given me two quotes for a 30 year fixed loan: one for a conventional and one for VA--both of which have a quote of 3.125%, but different closing costs. Mortgage company B is also quoting an estimated lower closing costs.

1. when refinancing, what is the minimum amount of interest rate drop that makes sense, given the previous quotes?
2. What are the risks of going with Mortgage Company B? What is the best way to assess that risk, given that they have a better interest rate. 
3. How is there so much deviation between Bank A and Mortgage Company B in the interest rate and how the VA loan is done? With Bank A, the interest rate of the VA loan is lower than their conventional loan, while with mortgage company B the rates are the same with different closing costs.

personalfinance,Student Loan Question -- IBR (US),"Hey all. I am an attorney who has been in practice for about three years now. I graduated law school with ~ $100k in federally subsidized student loan debt. For obvious reasons, I took the income based repayment option and have been paying ever since. 

Last month I settled my first ""mortgage burner"" case, that will ultimately end up with about $50k in my pocket. The $50k is a bonus on top of a base salary -- the first bonus I have received in this time. 

My question revolves around how this bonus will be treated within my income based repayment plan. I recognize that this is income, however it is nowhere near a consistent source and there is no guarantee that my income will reflect this next year. 

Will this drastically raise my minimum payment amounts through my IBR? If so, would it be more helpful to use the money to pay down the principal amounts on the loans or hold back a certain sum to accommodate the increased payments? Thanks in advance!",finance,1473805931

personalfinance,Anticipating complicated taxes. How early should I start preparing? Can I handle this accurately on my own with $30 software?,"Hi PF!

So it's been a busy year. I'm 25, somewhat recently married, gross income combined probably around $190k and I think our taxes will be particularly... interesting this year. I want to get ahead of any issues and I think I want to hire someone to take a look at these things but I don't really know where to get started. 

Some of the factors complicating taxes this year:

* Bought a house and all the associated closing costs, mortgage info, etc.
* Renting out a room in the house.
* Installed solar panels (expecting federal tax credits to kick in some).
* Change in jobs and healthcare.
* Bought and sold ESPP stock.
* Charitable donations.
* Minor inheritance.

Am I worrying about this too much? Is it likely that a tax professional could avoid mistakes or find more applicable programs / discounts / etc than I would on my own or am I going to get the same results going through Tax Act like I have the last 3 years?

I feel fairly comfortable filling out the software but I always feel like I'm guessing a little on some things.

personalfinance,"Debit card number stolen, Bank of America stopped it, but many questions.","BankOfAmerica texted, emailed, and called my cell phone reporting fraudulent activity on my debit card.  I logged into my account and flagged the fraudulent activity, which exactly matched what they thought was fraudulent.

There were two charges, likely only minutes apart, as shown here :

ATM 09/13 WITHDRWL CARDTRONICS CCS2 LAS VEGAS NV $62.95

ATM 09/13 WITHDRWL CARDTRONICS CCS2 LAS VEGAS NV $402.95

They tried first (I assume) for $60, plus the 2.95 terminal fee, and then a bit later for $400 (or vice versa - it was a bit hard to tell which was first).

So my first question is : did they use my PIN?  I assume that if this got recorded on my account that 1) they spoofed a card with my number on it, and 2) used a correct PIN.  If not, I shouldn't even be able to see those transactions.

Second question : how did they get my PIN?  I am *massively* careful with my ATM card, and it never leaves my hand - ever.  I never swipe it - ever.  I only use it in Chip+PIN situations, and my prior transactions (only ones within the past week) were Home Depot, Target, and a BOA ATM.  Since I believe it is impossible to swipe a card number OR a pin when you insert it into the chip reader - was it a camera that I missed?  A duplicated keypad?  Bad software at Home Depot?

Third question : How did BOA know those were fraudulent?  The three transactions prior (HD, Target, BOA) were all 1000 miles from my home.  BOA didn't flag them as suspicious.  But they DID flag the Las Vegas transactions as fraudulent.  But here's the catch : I go to Vegas a few times a year, and ALWAYS withdraw cash while there - so me withdrawing money in Vegas is absolutely ""quite normal"".  As a matter of fact, I am going there next Monday, and will likely withdraw similar amounts then.

Confusing part : I talked to a BOA fraud person on the phone, and she said that there are so many ways to lose your card number and PIN, and to just not worry about it; it happens.  She said that the chip can be read ""without you even taking it out of your pocket"".  I assume she means RFID which the BOA ATM cards don't have - it is a normal Chip that can't be read that way, but apparently she didn't know that.  I asked to speak to someone technical and was rebuffed.

I have gotten my credit card numbers stolen quite frequently from restaurants - I have one ""disposable"" card solely for this purpose, and it is the ONLY card that ever leaves my hand.  This debit card has never been out of my possession.  And my PIN has never been written down or typed in anywhere other than a chip reading terminal.

TLDR : Someone used a fake card with my debit card number in Vegas; did they have my PIN, and if so, how?",finance,1473809633
personalfinance,Need help deciding how to tackle student loan debt,"My fiance has two federal loans totaling roughly $17,500 with a 6.8% interest rate. They went into default which added another roughly $4,000. We have to make 7 consecutive monthly payments to the loan at which point it will no longer be in default and any remaining fees will be dropped. Any payments to the loan while in default are an 80/20 split between the fees and interest. I figure we can make about $800 a month in payments.    

My fiance is a teacher and will qualify for the $5,000
loan forgiveness in May of 2020. We currently have $6,000 that can be put towards it making the total about $16,000.

So my question is, do I make payments to the loan so that the balance is roughly $5,000 by May of 2020 or do I take out a personal loan with simple interest and pay that back and lose the 5K forgiveness? I have a 700 credit score but I just opened my first line of credit earlier this year so the lowest fixed interest rate I have found is 5.9%. Sorry for the wall of text.

TLDR: Is it cheaper to pay off a loan of $16,000 @ 6.8% interest for 3 years and 9 months and receive $5,000 worth of forgiveness or take out a simple interest loan of around 5.9% and pay that off in a 1.5 to 2 years?",finance,1473812649
personalfinance,"My best friend and I are about to be evicted after not paying rent for the first time. His bank account was garnished $22,000 by a credit card company but nobody at the company had any answers when he called with his bank and they said they could only now talk to him with a lawyer.","Throwaway account.

This happened about a week and a half ago. 

Backstory:

I've been unemployed for 2 months after having a depression break down working as a customer service supervisor. An existential crisis kinda fucked me up about where I'm going with my life so I literally just called out sick and never went back, *highly* uncharacteristic of me.

So I've been living on the last of those funds and had spoken with the landlord (who reports to a leasing company) and he kindly offered to let me pay it off within a reasonable timeframe as long as we both gave what we could. My best friend and roommate was set, even though he had also just recently quit, he had enough to sustain his bills for a couple months. 

Well right before he goes to withdraw his half for rent, his account shows -$14,000, and that was just one of his accounts. He thought it was a mistake and called the bank the next day, and that's when they informed him of the garnishment. They had the card company's information and a phone number to reach them at.

He decided to contact a lawyer first, who when pulling up my friend could only find traffic citations as far as anything legal was concerned, but also told him he could have been sued from out of state. (??) He finished by advising him to get to the bank to speak with them and get all the paperwork regarding why this was done. He did have a discover card at one point, but he has never been served or received any sort of paperwork regarding this incident.

It should also be noted that he and his father share the same name, with no Jr. or Sr. distinctions. So this has already caused a number of issues for them regarding bills and the like in the past, but who knows if that is the root in this case.

Upon going to the bank, the staff tells my friend they've never seen anything like this, and they call the card company together. The woman they speak with apparently had ZERO information about the case and asks if the ""defendant"" is with her and has already spoken to a lawyer...they say yes, and she ends the call with, ""his lawyer will have to contact us from this point.""


So after passing this information on to the landlord, he officially is hands tied since there is no money for rent whatsoever. If we don't come up with something soon, he'll have to serve us a 3 day eviction notice.

So idk what the fuck is going on, I'm broke as shit already, my car is probably about to get repo'd and now we're going to get evicted on top of that. I've been busting my ass doing odd jobs and handy work to even scrape together enough to put a dent in everything I'm behind on, but it looks like I'm coming to the end of the line and I'm not sure what to do.

I've got shit I'm trying to sell that I've inherited from my grandparents, like a few TVs, Xboxes, a cool cocktail arcade machine, and a light up Simpsons Christmas village...the last two of which I'm actually pretty bummed about cuz they're awesome. But c'est la vie...I'm currently on EBT but they've got me on a work program I highly doubt I'll actually participate in, so that's gonna run dry soon. 

Besides that, a family friend has offered us his house for a few months until after Christmas, working for him putting up lights at his accounts - which is great cuz he won't be charging us rent or anything, but that's also temporary. I'm already about $30000 in personal debt myself most of which is student debt and I'm still 18 credits shy with no way to finish....

So I guess I'm looking for advice on behalf of us both because I feel like there are angles to this we may not be seeing or something we don't know or might have missed....but at this point, we're kind of at the end of our wits with the way thing are and we're fed up with this system and tired of playing the game.

We've legitimately been talking about selling everything we own, saying fuck it and starting a year long trip through all 50 states...we're social media savvy enough to make the trip work for us and we think it's a good way to learn a lot and meet a lot of amazing people and make some unforgettable connections. It feels like pretty much the only option outside of the real dirty kind of homeless...or moving back in with family.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

My wife and I are now just entering the repayment period of our student loans, and we are trying to figure out how to best approach said repayment.

Me: 35 y/o public school teacher, $65k/year, $53k in student loan debt (all federal).
Wife: 29 y/o public school counselor, $60k/year, approx. $45k in student loan debt (all federal).

Expenses: $2200/month between rent, food, etc. (we have two children).

Savings: $12k emergency fund, $24k in savings, $14k in IRA, just started putting money into a self-directed 403b fund for each of us.

Because we are both public school educators, we qualify for student loan forgiveness after 10 years (I believe) of payments.

My questions:

- When it comes time to file taxes, are we better off filing separately? If so, it is my understanding that we cannot take advantage of the child credit (would we both file as individuals, or would one of us file as head of household?).

- Would IBR be the best repayment option considering we both will qualify for student loan forgiveness in the future?

- If we should both file separately, how many exemptions / allowances should we both claim on our w-4 without getting hit with having to pay back taxes when filing? I currently have 3, and my wife has 0.

I have contemplated changing careers to software development, as I recently finished up a B.S. in Computer Science. However, I am not sure the immediate bump in salary is worth losing out on my pension. However, that is a story for another post on another day.

We're currently 2 years into a 30 year fixed loan, we've added significant solar to the house, and houses around us (some identical models) have recently sold for $50K more than our purchase price.

We've worked out that we could refinance, while taking some equity out (36K) to pay off higher interest loans (school, car), and still come out $100 less monthly mortgage payment, and still save $55k over the life of the loan.



The dilemma is that we have a very busy schedule in the next month or so, and don't really want to start the refinancing process until we're more available, around the end of October.


So my question is: Historically, do the interest rates rise/fall drastically over a short (6 week) time period? We don't want to start this process yet, but are afraid of losing out on the 3% interest rate.",finance,1473829478

I have worked for 4 years in unrelated fields, mostly on financial software development. I want to go back to college and pursue my dream of having an Economics research career.


**PhD in Economics - Digital currency - Future impacts on economic development, monetary and fiscal policy:** The main focus of my thesis will be the study of this new form of currency, decentralized and not subject to control by any entity, admiting Bitcoins will play a major role in transactions over the next decades. The thesis aims to study to impact of this new currency on the impossibility of governments to make use of monetary policy to influence the amount of currency in circulation as a way to fuel economic growth through lower interest rates (incentivating investment, consumption, borrowing and spending), taxation of Bitcoin tranactions, inflation control by Central Banks, impact of the anonimity of transactions and Bitcoin wallets, among other themes of interest.

I consider the macroeconomic impact of Bitcoin transactions an extremely interesting theme, and also an innovative theme as Bitcoins' relevance in the monetary market is fairly recent, so it's a theme that's not subject to much research so far.

Any suggestions for further themes to analyze related to the economic impact of Bitcoins in modern economies are more than welcome. Any and all articles you may suggest relevant to the study of Bitcoins, economic papers already written analyzing this subject, and all other related media that may help me with the development of my thesis are more than welcome.

Thank you in advance for all the help provided. Cheers.

So far the best articles for a complete beginner I found explaining the mechanics of the sistem were [this one](http://venturebeat.com/2014/02/17/bitcoin-for-idiots-an-introductory-guide/) and [this one](https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works). I find them quite limited though and wish to gain an advanced level of understanding on the mechanics behind the Bitcoin system. If anyone could provide me with a few links from complete beginner level to advanced level on how the bitcoins system works, it would be greatly appreciated.**

EDIT 2: I am waiting for a reply from my MSc Macroeconomic Analysis teacher regarding the proposal of my thesis theme and my request for his guidance of this thesis. I will soon receive a reply to this e-mail and post the reaction of my teacher here. Hopefully we'll all be surprised and he will tell me to go ahead with this theme and that he will supervise it.

EDIT3: My Macroeconomic Analysis teacher just replied he would take a look at my suggestion for a PhD thesis at night and give me an answer regarding his opinion on the subject and his availability to be my thesis supervisor. Only a few hours left until I know if I can blatantly challenge the Acamedia world of Macroeconomics with my thesis.

I have been searching for a job, and tomorrow I am interviewing for a corporate position, based on the phone interview I am confident I will get it.  To be professional I want to give a notice, but I work alone in the office with the owner (5 employees just quit... now it is just us and a part time accounts girl).  I know it will be very uncomfortable if I give a notice, and she may even fire me in anger.  Would it be acceptable to give a one week notice, considering my probation isn't even up yet?  I was given advice to tell the manager I interview with that my paychecks have been bouncing (this is true) and I am looking for a reliable position (also very true). 

What do I do?! Either way, I am going to get out of this place before they officially go bankrupt... but I want to appeal to the new company. 

EDIT: I would like to add that my current boss (owner) is an older woman with A LOT of plastic surgery.  I have had hormonal acne since getting pregnant, it isn't too bad, but I do have some red spots on my face.  To avoid irritating my skin I do not wear a lot of make-up.  I dress professionally, I am in good shape and come to work well groomed (not that my fitness matters, to her it probably does) .  Since my first day working at this office she has commented on my skin almost weekly.  One day she was so rude it brought me to tears and I had to excuse myself from the office.  I have learned to ignore her jabs, but it is very unprofessional and insulting. 

EDIT 2: In addition to the centers being shut down by the state, she neglects to provide them with petty cash.  There was a week straight that my son was fed graham crackers and soy nut butter for lunch because they had no food in the center and she told the staff to use what they had because she was going to the Poconos and would deal with it the next week when she came back. Needless to say, I pack my son food everyday.

personalfinance,Making early payments from day 1 to work through getting rid of PMI?,"Hi all,

My wife and I are about to close on a house end of the month. We put 10% down so will have a PMI to pay. Every month we will have some leftover money after paying all expenses and mortage. Wife suggests using that money to make early payments towards the mortgage every month to gradually get to 20% equity quicker and get rid of PMI quicker. What do you think of that? Would you rather do that, or save that money in some funds to sell back once we have enough money to cover the 20% then pay it all in one shot? Or, would you rather use the money to invest and not pay for early payments to the mortgage?

If it helps, our mortgage is for a loan amount of $616,500 on a 30 year fixed interest rate of 3.375% and an APR of 3.749% including $303 of PMI. We have no other debt.

Edit: it's a conventional loan, we have our emergency fund taken care of and I include saving for the kid's college fund in our monthly expenses.

personalfinance,What are my rights when a dealership called me 2 days after the deal was done (all paperwork was signed and the car was brought home) and told me that I owed them money?,"I was approved by my Credit Union for 20K vehicle loan, and I had brought the draft to a dealership last Sunday to purchase a vehicle. In the finance office I told them I have this preapproved loan and showed them the draft. They looked at the draft and said that the price they agreed to sell the vehicle to me was if I was financing through them. Long story short (including after me preparing to walk away) they said if I financed THROUGH them, with this same CU (they're an approved lender), same term-length &amp; same interest rate, my monthly payment would be approx $11 more per month but they're throwing the GAP insurance in there. For the sake of convenience, I agreed on that. So I signed the paperwork and brought the car home.

2 days later, the finance manager called me and said that I owe them $400+ for the down-payment because the CU refused to extend the whole amount to them (whatever that means). So I called my CU and they explained the discrepancy was from the NADA market value. I don't understand any of that. All I know was that I would have used the draft that I had directly requested/approved (AND printed &amp; brought it with me) but they swayed me to finance through them, NOT telling me that I ""might"" owe them more money in the next few days. I do have the signed RISC that stated clearly the interest rate, $0 down, the term-length, and the monthly payment amount. Not sure if it matters, but the dealership ran my credit and my FICO is over 800.

Now: Day 3 after the dealership visit- After further research I learned that this is what’s called ""Yo-Yo Sales"" in the car buying world. At the back of the RISC form it's stated that the Seller has 30 days to cancel the sale, or I may figure out another financing option. When I mentioned ""…then I want to use the preapproved draft that I had shown you"" to the Finance Manager yesterday (before I even knew it was an option) he said that the draft wouldn’t be enough. I supposed at this point my options are, once the dealership states clearly that they are canceling the contract, to return the car? I’m not even sure yet if I still want to use my draft at this point at this place, considering how shady these people seem – however IF I do want to go this route (because we do like the car, we’re just not so thrilled with the way they do this), is it a safe option for me? Or does doing this open up more ""ways"" for them, somehow, to pull another kind of trick, let say, a week from now? I don’t know what other tricks there are, just like I had no idea that this would happened days after we walked out the dealership that evening thinking everything was a done deal.

In short, what are my options here? I’m in Florida. And I did bring a trade-in (that’s now sitting on their lot &amp; online ready for sale).",finance,1473864460

personalfinance,"Refinance, sell, or do nothing with my rental house","2 years ago I purchased a home in Portland, OR for $435k, a very fair price, with 15% down and a 4.5% fixed 30 year mortgage ($2200/month PITI payment, the PMI is rolled into the life of the loan). Updated the kitchen and did some other work on it.

Since then life has happened, typical. I decided to go back to school which meant moving out of state. I didn't want to sell the place so out of necessity I began renting it through a rental agency. The rent covers the mortgage plus an extra $100ish and I did switch the hazard insurance to a landlords policy to try to cover myself somewhat.

I graduated in May but no jobs in Portland that I wanted so instead I took a position in Monterey, CA making $120k salary and am currently renting but when my lease is up I want to buy a house here. That's not a cheap proposition here unfortunately, &gt;$700k for something I want. That leads to my conundrum: what to do with the house in Portland?

Ideally I would like to keep it in case I ever choose to move back and to also build equity while simultaneously purchasing here.

**My current situation**: $120k/year salary, $10k credit card debt from school (first priority to pay off), in November I will receive $16k (VW diesel settlement, already have a second car to drive), and my current credit score is 740 even w/the credit card debt.

**The Portland house**: principal balance $358k, $2200 PITI payment covered by rent, yearly taxes $3400, hazard insurance $800. Spoken with realtors casually and they estimate current value ~$650k (Zillow says $730k but that a bit rich). The tenants are on month-to-month and I would boot them prior to selling.

I have been watching mortgage rates and see they are lower than when I purchased but have also heard the saber-rattling about rates rising at some point. I won't wade into prognosticating what the fed will *actually* do.

What are some suggestions?

* refinance

* refinance with cash out for a down payment here

* sell the house when I want to buy here

* do nothing and just let it ride as-is

**if** I do refinance I know it would have to be an investment property loan since I don't use that as my primary residence which tend to carry a higher interest rate. Also, the conforming limit for a mortgage for Portland is still $417,000 and from what I've seen jumbo mortgages for investment properties are particularly higher interest rates.

I know the cash-out refinance would be robbing Peter to pay Paul in using the cash for a down-payment here.

Are there any other options I'm missing?

personalfinance,"After repairing my recently flooded house, should I sell or rent? Details inside.","As indicated in the title, my house recently flooded, and I'm currently in the process of repairing it.  This was part of the recent historical rainfall and flooding in Louisiana.  Immediately after repairing the home, I intend on moving to a different state, where I will likely continue working for my current company (remotely), and my housing will be completely paid for.  I'm married with no kids, and the wife will be making more money in the new state.  So now I'm looking to either rent or sell my current house, and am having a hard time comparing the options financially.  We don't know exactly how long we will reside in the new state, but let's say there's a 50/50 chance that we return to Louisiana in 3-5 years.

My current home/mortgage is as follows:

Original amount borrowed: $161,595

Mortgage interest rate: 4.75%

Annual property tax: $576

Annual homeowner's insurance: $1350

(NEW) Annual flood insurance: $450

Home warranty: $540 annually (covers the repair cost of appliances and electrical/plumbing/hvac systems, with a low deductible)

Annual PMI: $465

Amount owed now: $155,170

Appraised value (right before the flood): $185,000

Out of pocket costs to repair the house will be $16,000, with slight updates to the bathrooms (Otherwise the house will effectively be back to how it was before the flood).  I have $4000 in savings to throw at it, and can borrow the other $12,000 @ 3.125% interest rate.

Once the repairs are done, I'm considering two options:

Option 1: If I decide to rent the house, I can refinance my current mortgage.   I would be able to wrap up the origination fees into the new loan (about $2k after lender credit).  So the new loan amount would be about $157,170 @ 3.375%.  The house can bring in $1200 in rental income monthly (with an estimated 5% vacancy rate) after the property management company's cut.

Option 2: I can sell the house, pay off mortgage and new repair bill, and replenish my emergency fund.  Seller's cut for the home sale is 2.5% of the sale price (2.5% of estimated $185,000 is $4625).  Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but I feel like this house might be hard to sell, or have a lower market value, since the flood is still fresh in everyone's mind.  I'm sure that any potential buyer will ask if the house was affected by the flooding, but I'm not sure how it will affect the sales price.

In the next week or so, I'll be coming into a lump sum of $75,000, and I need help with what to do with it.

To give some information on my current situation, I have about $15-16k between my checkings and investments.  I'm not currently working, but I will be getting about a $3,000 tax return, plus a $10,000 living stipend in April-May, so I should have sufficient funds to get me through until I start in September/October 2017.

I will be moving with my long-time girlfriend, so I would not be solely responsible for rent, but I would likely contribute 60-70%.  Apartments I have been looking at fall around $1700/month.  I will be taking the train to/from work so monthly transportation costs will be $100.  Also, my phone bill will be covered through work.

Also, all of my loans are federal:

* $19,606 at 6.31%
* $10,250 at 5.31%
* $20,500 at 5.84%
* $44,846 at 6.84%

* $4,500 (subsidized) at 3.4%
* $2,000 at 6.8%
* $3,500 (subsidized) at 4.5%

My goals (prior to running into this lump sum) when I start working were to max out my 401k contributions, and put $2,500-$3,000/month towards my student loans, along with any bonuses, tax refunds, etc. and hopefully pay off my loans in 5 years.

How should my plans change, if at all, after running into this lump sum?  Should I put the entire sum towards my student loans?  Should I consolidate the higher interest rate loans?

gaming,"Why EB Games, why?","I haven't been in a gaming store for a couple of years as I've switched to buying most of my games digitally. However I recently got an EB Games gift card and so I had a reason to visit their fine establishment.

What the hell did I miss? I swear it wasn't like this 3 years ago. First off, it was next to impossible to find any 'new' games in amongst the shelves and shelves of 'previously loved' ones that were a whopping $5 cheaper. Games several months old, that I could buy for $25 brand new on Amazon, were still $50. There was piles of gaming memorabilia everywhere, posters, mugs, figurines, bobble heads, board games, t-shirts, you name it. It looked like every sad gamers basement apartment you see in movies. 

I picked my game quickly and hurried to the counter, desperate to escape. Apparently the guy working there had other ideas. He wanted to sell me everything under the sun, except the damn game i was trying to buy. Would i like scratch protection? No, I am not a child, I know how to look after my things. How about a membership card? No, i am never coming back. Spare headsets, controllers, pre-orders for other games??? NO! Seriously, how many customers forget they needed an extra $70 controller and impulse purchase one at the counter? Could someone in corporate please run the numbers on this before demanding this poor employee tries to sell me something else?

EB, could you maybe pick one upsell option and try that out?

Your pricing is out of whack and your purchasing experience feels more like an interrogation. You are actively encouraging your customers to shop online. 

At least I have a new game to play. Now if only I had a controller...

gaming,Times Video Game Design Has F-ed You,"You ever get cornered into a position where your game is pretty much ruined because of the way the designers allowed it to go down?

Let me just give an example:
I was just playing Metro: Last Light Redux at the part where you fight the swamp monster after traveling above ground on the surface in the area that was no doubt designed to test your conservation of filters.

But the game regularly saves at intervals and to my knowledge there is no way to go back to a previous save once its saved itself. And, it just so happened to save itself when I had 50 seconds left before I started suffocating.

Multiple times I made the run across the water to the area where you fight in front of the church, multiple times I took out the boss, and every time I choked to death before I could get across and into the church.

There was no way to get across that I could think of. I was pretty sure my entire save file was ruined because of the game mechanic they implemented. I did it repeatedly, like getting as good at it as a speedrunner.

That's when I realized there was a trick though -- Basically, I fought the boss while suffocating. Each moment before I suffocated, I put the gas mask back on, and took it back off. This resets the 10 seconds or so I can use to fight before I have to put it on and take it off again. This cheap way allowed me to bypass this...

But other than that, this mechanic coupled with their autosave nearly ruined me. I would have been so angry. I was so angry. Anyway, wanted to share and though maybe others would have such frustrations to vent, too.

financialindependence,200K Student Loan Payoff!,"My wife and I graduated with a combined student loan debt of 200K. We lived in backwoods GA, barely scratching the 12% interest student loans (no parents with good credit). 


In hindsight, we were totally dumb for going to school at all in those circumstances. But once we realized how screwed we were, we started to get serious. We built ourselves a simple spreadsheet for keeping track of all the loans, and started paying them off like maniacs. We both got full time jobs, then started a bread baking business on the side to pay for food. This covered all our food expenses for over a year. We also worked on a local farm as farm-hands, taking care of animals and tending gardens. This also paid us in food. 

After a bit we realized we couldn't survive earning a combined 42K/year pre-tax with student loan interest payments of over 20K/year. We left all our beloved friends and moved to the big city. We both got much better jobs. We moved in with my American grandmother and did all the cooking, shopping, cleaning, and laundry to pay for rent. (She never did come to like our spicy Latin foods!). 

After a few years, we were paying down loans with almost 90% of our take-home income. When we finally crossed the finish line, we saved up enough for a down payment on an estate sale house that was literally 1/7th of what we could afford (the mortgage guy was flabbergasted you could even BUY a house that cheap in this region).

This is to illustrate that a couple of factors can make all the difference:

* **My wife and I were BOTH willing to move in with family and basically be live-in caretakers.** This alone saved us ~30K a year for several years for what amounted to a few extra hours a week of work (and work we would have done anyway if we were alone.) It was a huge benefit BOTH for us AND for my grandmother. Without her, we would've been paying off loans for at least several more years. I highly recommend seeing if anyone in your family has a spare room and would like to have a live-in caretaker. While potentially stressful, for us it was so worth it to get out of crippling debt sooner.
* **Paying off highest interest rate loans first.** Typically obvious, and probably not a huge deal if you are paying them off quickly, but for our situation, it made big difference.
* **Moving to a ""cheap"" big city.** Even if the COL is higher (it was 2x), our first jobs each made as much as we both made in GA, which meant we were making a lot more total. That 20K/year of student loan interest was proportionally a lot less, so we could put to the principal. 
* **Waiting and buying a good, cheap house.** If I could rewind time, I'd not buy the house, but so far it has averaged out to be about the same price as a 1 bedroom apartment. But it is more hassle with things breaking etc, so less time for other projects. We intend to sell it when we FI/RE because taxes are so high. Thankfully the ""Zwillio price"" indicates the value has almost doubled since we moved in, so we dodged a bullet there, hopefully it stays that way.
* **Auto-draft Savings.** If it's not there, you can't spend it :)
* **Making a fun budget.** We used to ""not spend any fun money"". But in reality we did, it just wasn't well tracked. A year ago we gave ourselves a reasonable and separate ""fun budget"" for each month. Now if we want to eat out or buy some new clothes, we can just subtract it from our personal budget. Easy, fun, and spending doesn't feel guilty!
* **Study for a career.** Both of us studied STEM majors, and so were able to quickly and easily find great jobs. This was invaluable. None of this would have been possible without that.

I am 26 years old making 56k base with yearly bonus of 2-7k (variables are personal and company performance).  After taxes and health/retirement, my monthly take home is approx 3.1k

My CC is at 8k and APR of 12%

I have, roughly, 25k grad school loan debt (roughly 6% interest rate)

At the moment, I am trying to juggle social life/paying down debt/putting some portion away for a house. 

As of now, I contribute 300/month to loan/cc/saving for house, respectively - aka $900 total (I plan to apportion tax return and bonus similarly). 

My question is, is this methodology ludicrous? Any tips or pointers? 

Thanks in advance!",finance,1473883833

I was living with my mom for a while, and right I'm living with my grandma until I can live with my dad. I don't know if I should get a job in the meantime because I won't be here for very long. I could easily, but if they find out that I'm not going to be here for long, they won't hire me.

I've had a lot of doctor's appointments. Those add up, and I can't pay the bills. I thought my parents were going to help me, but they can't right now. They are all in collections and I get so many calls about them. I just made a payment of $36 towards one of those bills, and I still need to pay for food. I'm just using the money I still have from working a few hours a week not too long ago. I just checked my credit report and I'm feeling extremely anxious because it says it's very poor. What if I get a job and need to get an apartment or something?

My school situation is: I dropped out for the time being because I was nonfunctional and I still don't know what to study. On top of that, I was not able to get enough federal loans because my mom and step-dad make too much (but not enough). I applied for income-based repayment, so I get statements for $0 a month, but that doesn't erase the fact that I owe over $7k for school alone. I am hoping, when I'm ready for school, to apply for the fafsa with my dad's income when I live with him and maybe then I can actually go. I don't know though. I've also thought about moving to Canada where I'm a (dual)citizen and tuition is more manageable.

It's a sucky situation and I'm not sure what to do about it. Please don't assume I'm spoiled, lazy, entitled, etc. I am just requesting a bit of guidance from those of you who are more experienced than I.",finance,1473885581

I'm 26 now, but I'd guess about 5 or 6 years ago, my mom was short on money and my step dad was going through a depression bout after he lost his job. He had racked up some hospital dues and mom's a teacher, so not much money coming in. She decided to take out a credit card in my name as I constantly had offers coming in the mail that I would throw away if I was home. I was away at college at the time so I had no idea any of this happened until months down the road when my dad confronted me asking why there were creditors calling everyone in the family (persistent bastards) trying to collect on a credit card debt. Anyways, they eventually get it paid off but I did nothing to dispute it being on my name as I was young and dumb at the time. When I did try to get a credit card later in college, every credit card agency rejected me except the ones with extra high interest rates. I eventually got my first credit card and then a second (Discover It card) through a college email thing Discover kept sending out while I was in college. Fast forward to now, and my FICO score still shows ""serious delinquency"" on me. Is this still from the shenanigans from my mom, or is it some of the debt I have now? My credit score is 673 currently, I have 2 credit cards, student loans, and a car payment. I keep my credit cards paid off and really only use them if I'm strapped for cash (which doesn't happen often anymore) or to buy gas. I know I'm coming up on the 7 year mark when stuff like this gets taken off my credit score (it may have already been 7 by now), but I'm curious if I can still dispute what my mom did to my credit score at this point or if I'll just have to wait another year or two and see what happens.

It's six years later, and it's past the SOL in my state for those cc debts. However, it's not past the 7 years from the date of first delinquency for items to drop off my credit report. I only have 1 more year for that. Aside from those early credit card mistakes in my college days, I have managed to handle the rest of my finances swimmingly and haven't had any other late payments or issues. (aside from Verizon not telling me they charged me for 2 days of service when I changed my accounts and I didn't receive any bills grrrr different story)

My husband and I have the emergency fund taken care of, next step is debt. Unfortunately 2 accounts have illegally re-aged the DOFD when they were sold to another collection agency, setting back the clock a few years. Now, I know that I fe'd-up and it's my fault I have the debt, but I also know that since it only has a year to actually fall off from the actual DOFD, it's better that I let the debts fall off (not here for the moral shaming, but practice advice). We are doing things to simultaneously build up credit (cc's with low balances), but I also need to fix these bad debts that have re-aged illegally.

I have read that you need to maybe do a debt verification letter, but have seen little else on what happens after. I'm not sure where to begin on a verfication letter, and what to expect. I am afraid of writing a letter that implies I own the debt or want to make payments. Also, how likely are those debts to be verified? What if they DO verify I owe the debt, but don't make that date correction? What if they can't verify it, how do I make sure they remove it?

Has anyone (in CA if it matters) successfully removed re-aged debts from their credit reports and can walk me through the process or refer me to some helpful and specific articles? I can't find anything detailed that really walks it though besides ""do a debt verification letter.""

personalfinance,"Advice on how to save, considering my budget","I saw another post where someone shared their budget and got advice on it. So I'd like to do the same here. I'd like advice on two things: 1) Where to put my money that I save and 2) What to put the money towards.

Here's my (and my husband's) combined monthly income and expenses:
Income- 4600
Rent- 1230
Car insurance- 100
Gas- 75
Cell phone- 140
Internet- 50
Utilities- 120
Groceries- 300
Student loan- 700
Savings- 100
Leftover- 3270

We are both grad students. We receive health insurance free to us along with many totally free health services. Three big financial goals for us: 1) Pay off student loans. Our SL can be broken down into private (11% interest rate) and government (3.4-6.8% interest rate). Priority is the private loans (Sallie Mae/Navient, or Satan as I like to call them). At our current monthly payment rate, we will have them paid off in 2022. I'd like to pay them off by 2020 so we'll only have government loans to pay by the time we graduate. I'd love to pay off the private loans sooner so we can start chipping away at the government loans sooner. Private loans currently total $33,500; government loans currently total $114,000.

2) Buying a house. We looked into this briefly, and it looked like if we bought a home, our mortgage payment each month would be less than our rent. But we understand that owning a home comes with a whole other set of maintenance expenses and taxes we don't have to worry about as renters right now. Nonetheless, we'd like to start putting money in savings for an eventual down payment on a house, when the time comes.

3) We are both in our 30s and childless, but we want to start a family soon. We have an age limit we will not have biological children past, and we're both approaching it. We'd like to start in 2 years max, and would like to start putting money aside for this purpose. In addition to our age limit, we also want to take advantage of the great insurance and medical care available to us as grad students, while we're still grad students.

Our credit union offers saving options in the form of: savings account with .15% APY; money market with .30% APY but a $10,000 minimum that we don't currently have. Or share certificates (CD): &lt;1 year, .35% APY; 2 year, .55%; 3 year, .75%, and so on with $500 minimum. Are there other options for me to save money besides these? I don't have enough money to invest in stocks at this time, but is that something I could look into once I have enough saved up in a savings account? Should I just put all my extra money each month toward paying extra on my student loans? Or should I pay only the amount due and just put extra in savings and pay it off all at once?

TL;DR version- I guess I'm thinking of setting up 3 different savings accounts for three different goals: student loan payoff, house down payment, family planning. But maybe just pay bigger payments toward my student loans each month and having 2 savings accounts to save for house and family planning. Need to know if there are options besides savings accounts I'm already aware of.

Side note: we have credit cards, but only use them to pay for our monthly expenses, and pay them off in full each month. It's to build credit score up and reap the rewards from points we earn. We have no other debts besides our student loans. My husband had a good retirement plan going at his last job before starting grad school.",finance,1473899821

This is the cliff notes version of my financial history. I'm currently 21, senior with another year in school, 27k/year tuition, but scholarships, grants and such make it so where my actual loans are about 7k/year. I'll be graduating Fall 2017 with ~30k in debt in a field, where I am, introductory is 45-60K depending on who I know and my portfolio. When I was young, my mom used my credit and I turned 18 with a credit score of 309 or something ridiculous. I have since taken care of it, but my credit score has been abysmal since then. I don't have a car, No assets except my laptop, and I'm broke as heck. 

I make ~$150 a month freelancing sparingly, and receive $400 a month due to a divorce settlement between my mom and dad. I have no insurance, but am healthy for the most part. I live with my fiancé who is a paremedic and makes $35k a year, and he pays rent, his truck and truck related stuff. I pay for Wifi, Electricity, food, school supplies, and Adobe CC totalling roughly $300 a month in expenses. I take the bus which is free via my school. 

**current situation**: I am concerned about *credit card* debt. My credit score is currently 568. I was briefly homeless and had a couple huge emergencies when I lived alone, so I turned to quick credit cards that got near-maxed in the few months I used them, as things were dire. My laptop- which is required for school- shit a brick early January and I was forced to take another CC card thing through Apple. Just a darn mess, I was. Now I pay every bill, never late, and make a smidgen more than I usually do.

* Paypal credit card, 27% interest, $1,153.10, Pay minimums at $35/month
* Chase credit card, 28% interest, $981.67, pay minimums at $25/month
* Apple Rewards credit card, 27% interest, $1,930.55, pay $5 above minimums at $30/month
* **Total CC debt totals to a little under $4,200.00**

I'm paying $90 a month spread across three different credit cards minimums. I know thats friggin terrible, and to be honest I'm stressed the hell out because I am not in a position to get a part time job on top of what I'm currently doing. Please believe me when I say there's a lot of weird factors in my lack of a job, things like no transportation and no jobs where I'm at, so I work from home. 

I'm thinking about getting a $4,500 loan from someone, at an interest rate even at 20% is better than what I'm currently dealing with. I've thought a long time about it, and I'd rather pay $100-$150 a month towards one debt, which would be paying on principle vs making barely-minimums every month. Is that the correct choice? My father and I don't talk, my mom is an irresponsible mess, and I'm otherwise all alone. I don't have any adult guidance.

The loan would be for $5251 at a 9.25% interest rate and a 48 month period. My payments would be $131.30 per month.

I'm guessing that the APR will be around 23-25%)

I know I'm only saving $15 a month, however all my debt will be consolidated, I won't be gaining finance charges on these cards, and I'll have lowered my credit utilization from 50% to less than 5% if you count my one store card that I'm keeping a balance on of $200. 

Overall I've come to the conclusion that this seems to be a fairly good deal for me. I can improve my credit score, have one single payment with a bank that I trust, and save a small amount of money too. I believe that if I continued only doing the minimum payments on these cards with the finance fees I'm getting, it would take me much longer than four years to pay off. I'm hoping that if my raise that my boss discussed giving me in a month comes through, I'll be able to apply an even bigger amount to this loan and wipe it out even faster.

Sorry for the rambling, but I want to be absolutely positive I'm choosing the best course of action here! Thanks in advance for any advice :)",finance,1473948426

personalfinance,"Options for someone with terrible credit, negative cash flow, and $1,000,000 in real estate equity","I own a couple rental properties that have grown valuable over the years. I'm a terrible landlord, though -- screening tenants poorly and failing to get tough when they don't pay. SO I turned management over to a company, which worked very well for a year: 100% occupancy and 100% rent paid!

The company badly failed this rental year, though: 3 of my 4 apartments are empty and my net cash flow is about $2300/month in the negative. I have a condo and a three-family. The three-family has no tenants, an unprecedented disaster.

My credit is poor because I didn't pay the condo mortgage for about 18 months, because of non-paying tenants and being unemployed about half the time. Score: 527. That mortgage was renegotiated and I'm am presently current.

One obvious option is to sell the condo. The three-family house is my retirement plan. I could sell the condo and net something like $400K before taxes. I'm reluctant to do that, though, because it is yielding $1300/month of income and appreciating 30-40K per year. Also, I don't have the cash needed to make improvements on the condo that would have a good ROI like floors, paint, and new kitchen counters and cabinets. I don't want to leave money on the table.

**My big risk is losing the three-family to foreclosure -- which seems crazy to me, since I have about $750K in equity there.** 

If I sell the condo, then I could just about pay *off* the three-decker, at which point it would generate a nice retirement income -- when it has tenants. I'm 64, a software engineer, not as bright as I used to be and facing age discrimination in the job market. The best time to sell around here (Boston) is late spring, though, and it will take a while to sell and get the money.

Question: Is there something I can tell the three-family mortgage company? Hello, I have no tenants, I promise to resume paying the mortgage as soon as I am able?

Question: How quickly do companies move to foreclose? I *cannot* pay the mortgage on the three-family right now. Will they foreclose before next June - August, when I'll have the cash to catch up on the mortgage, if I sell the condo? Will it speed up the foreclosure, if I tell them about my cash-flow problems?

Question: I could stop paying the mortgage on the condo (the mortgage I just renegotiated after not paying it for 18 months) on the theory that they won't foreclose before I sell next spring?There's no guarantee of that, either, though. I imagine they will be quick to foreclose, having already been on the verge of that last April.

Question: It seems like someone in a cash crunch with a lot of equity should be able to get a home equity loan. I have that crappy credit rating, though. Any options there? I don't want to go to loan sharks, but a not-*too*-high interest rate loan would be helpful in the medium run, if I can get one.

This may seem like an idiotic question -- but I'm out of ideas and hoping that y'all have some. 

TL;DR: Cannot pay my mortgage, but I have lots of equity, but I have poor credit. Need options.

Thanks in advance! - WBB

How realistic is a $250,000.00 (+/-50k) to purchase on a 15/30 year loan with the given information.  I expect the down payment for this to be about $50,000.00?  Is this an intelligent decision at this point in my life? I'll be living in this spot at least 6.5 years.

I'm seeing the following from a simple 15 or 30 year loan calculator at the national average interest rate: $1,692.00 for a 15 year loan and $1,116.00 for a 30 year loan.

solar,Can I depreciate 85% of system cost?,"This is an install on a business.  I am told by multiple solar companies that I can depreciate 85% of my system cost, even if I take a 30% fed tax credit and 15% IA state tax credit. Example: System cost = $50k.  Out of pocket cost after fed and state 45% tax credits =$27500.  I am told I can depreciate 85% of the system cost which would = $42500.  The catch is that my accountant says the solar companies are wrong and I can depreciate the remaining amount of the system after the tax credits.  So that would be 55% of system cost ($27500).  

I found this on the SEIA website.  I've looked through the IRS site and can't find anything, but that site is hard to navigate. 

""Qualifying solar energy equipment is eligible for a cost recovery period of five years. For equipment on which an Investment Tax Credit (ITC) or a 1603 Treasury Program grant is claimed, the owner must reduce the project’s depreciable basis by one-half the value of the 30% ITC.

Currently behind the curve a bit with retirement due to the divorce at about $42k (split between IRA, Roth IRA, and 457 plan), $10k in savings, plus an unvested pension that will be worth 10% of my salary when it vests in about 2.5 years (increasing to 60% of my salary after 30 years service, if I stick around that long). Only debts are $6500 in student loans at &lt;4% and a $250k conventional mortgage with no PMI at 4%. I contribute the max ($5500) to my Roth IRA, plus $5200 per year to my 457 plan, plus save $250 per paycheck (biweekly) in my savings account. 

Once my savings hits 3 months expenses (about $13k), I am considering changing my $250 per paycheck savings contribution to an additional 457 contribution. That would make my annual 457 contribution almost $12,000 per year (max is $18k). The reason being that I can withdraw from my 457 upon separation from employment (no minimum age), which at this point is the main reason I would need to dip into savings, i.e getting fired or laid off. I could either keep another 3-6 months in my 457 plan in a money market account, or just invest it all per my current allocation. Thoughts on the benefits or downfalls of this approach? 

The tax benefits of the 457 plan are attractive to me, I’m in the 25% federal tax bracket (no state income tax), so I could potentially save more than $250 per paycheck and still have the same effective pay. Obviously I’d owe the taxes if I take money out, but at the same or lower tax rate. I suppose the standard answer would be why not both?

personalfinance,"I'm drowning in federal student loans, and being constantly harassed by Navient. Need to find a way to shield my husband's assets.","First of all, let me apologize for the wall of text ahead and for the throwaway account. It's a complicated story and I really don't want people I know to read this.  Someone over r/studentloandefaulters suggested that I post this here, so here it goes.


I'm 47 years old and my husband is 70 (I know, weird, but it is what it is and I have no regrets). He's old school, so he wanted me to stay at home when we got married and I didn't see anything wrong with that. He was able to bring home the money and in my mind I still worked, it was just unpaid work. Plus we were happy. Then, things got a bit difficult for my husband, though it wasn't his fault, it was his health. All of the sudden his income dropped to 70k a year, but things were still good. Money was a little tight, and thinking that this could not end well, I went back to school at 42 in hopes of finding a job and help out. He wasn't happy, but I thought I was doing something good, so I went ahead and took out federal loans, lots of it.  Well, that turned out to be the single worst decision I've ever made in my life, and I was very stupid: I decided to get a degree as a Paralegal in a state where they either hire paralegals fresh out of high school and pay them 10 bucks per hour or hire people out of law school who can't pass the bar.  

So now, I am at 47 with no experience whatsoever. To make matters worse, two years ago my husband had to retire and now our income is of 3,500.00 per month. There was a drastic change in our lifestyle and we have 600 dollars left to eat when all the bills and medical expenses are paid, and that's on good months, after we meet our medical insurance co-pay.  

Now, I'm 68K in debt (federal loans) and Navient has been harassing me day and night. They call me everyday, several times a day, I just don't know what to do anymore. I have applied for a job at more than 50 places and was only able to get 2 interviews which were both very unsuccessful because of my lack of experience, even though I was a straight A student and graduated summa cum laude (I can barely stop myself from laughing at my silly, stupid self when I remember how proud I was of that).


Navient's understanding is that from the 500 or 600 bucks we have left to eat, I should pay them almost $300.00 under the pay as you earn program, even though I don't earn anything at all.  Their concept of expandable income doesn't reflect our reality at all, and they're throwing my husband's income in their calculation, even though he is not a co-signer (federal loans don't require a co-signer). We simply can't do that.


We feel that our only options at this point are to get a reverse mortgage on our home, which really breaks our hearts because it is the only thing we have to leave to our son, or to file bankruptcy to get rid of other loans and credit card debt which my husband refuses to do because he is too proud to do that. I don't particularly blame him for not wanting to ruin his good credit because of my mistake, it shouldn't have to be that way.  He says he will get a part time job, but I can't let him do that, his health is not that great anymore. I'm the one who got us into that, and I'm the one who has to take us out, but I simply can't get a job, and I'm beyond desperate at this point.


Ok, so here are my questions:


* What is the worst that Navient can do?


* Can they garnish his retirement monthly income or touch his retirement fund?


*  Can they make us sell the house and put us on the street?


I no longer pick up phone calls from them. For a while, they would grant me forbearance and stop the phone calls for 3 months at a time.  This time I requested forbearance again and the phone calls keep on rolling in. I am absolutely desperate, I don't know what else to do. My husband feels like a total failure, and though people may think of our situation as weird and gross, I love him and he gave me a beautiful life - It just rips my heart to pieces that he is facing this type of stress at 70 years old and that it is all my fault. How do I get out of this hole, and more importantly, how do I protect our assets (our home) and my husband's assets (his retirement fund)? Thank you so much.",finance,1473960189

I've run the numbers on trying to pay it down early and all other scenarios extrapolated out 25 years, and forgiveness is the only option. This is factoring in the federal tax implications of forgiveness.   
  
The federal tax implications are exactly what this post is about. In about 18 years, when I go for forgiveness, I'm going to have a $50-80k tax bill. Rather than wait, I'm going to try and start a wholly separate savings just for the purposes of paying this off. The plan is to invest about $2-3k per year invested in a shifting allocation starting off with just VTSAX and slowly shifting in VBMFX towards the end to hedge the risk as I get closer to having to withdraw all of it.

When I was 22 I offhandedly mentioned to my dad that I was interested in starting some kind of investment for my future (but of course didn't know how to do that) so he set me up with a friend of his who sold life insurance. So now I have an indexed universal life insurance policy that I've been paying into for 4 years at a rate of ~$50/month and as of right now I've paid a bit over $2k total.

The understanding I've come to lately from reading on here and other sites is that as an investment, whole life insurance doesn't make sense for most people and is probably something of a scam. I'm 26 and unmarried with no kids for the foreseeable future, so I don't think I have need for life insurance of any kind right now.

Right now the cash surrender value is $0. I've been looking over the paperwork that was given to me and there are actually 2 sets of projections: one that has that magical interest rate of 7-8% and one that's a guaranteed value at 2.5%. The numbers in the latter projection are tiny bit higher but mostly pretty close to what I've seen so far, so assuming that that's realistic, it doesn't seem like there will ever be a time when the cash surrender value will be greater than the total amount I've put into the premiums.

I'm finishing grad school and live on a stipend of about $27k/year, so the idea of having thrown away $2k doesn't feel great but I understand that in the grand scheme of things it's not really that much money and that people have been suckered for way worse.

So, should I just cut my losses and start putting that money elsewhere (I'm in the middle of setting up a Roth IRA) or is there some reason to stick with the policy? I just want to make sure I'm understanding everything clearly. Any advice welcome, thanks.",finance,1473966483

The worst interest rates I've got are on my student loans, so I know financial long-term it's smarter to pay those off first. The problem is that she's on income based payments, which includes my income, so no matter what I pay off it just ratchets her payment up (not an equal amount to what I'd pay off, but still). Right now we pay so little on her loans they go UP every month.  
My thinking is that if we pay off the smaller accounts, it reduces the payment we HAVE to make each month, giving us breathing room in a bad month while letting us send more money toward remaining debts in good months. It seems like that would get rid of the credit card debt sooner. Then, long term, I'm hoping that opens us up to be able to buy some equipment with a business loan and set up her office so she can make actual money. I guess the question is, what's the best route to get rid of the credit cards, so we can figure out how to get her in her own business, so we can pay off the student loans?  
Also if there's any magic to getting rid of the student loans I would be ecstatic.",finance,1473968961

personalfinance,Living a lifestyle I can't afford,"From Alberta Canada;

Long story short I was making good money at a bar job. Was dumb and thought that would keep flowing forever. Got in over my head and got myself a fancy truck. Now the cash has stopped flowing and I'm screwed. 

Initially I got a truck at a very high interest rate 16% and was paying it for about a year and traded it in to a different dealer. Basically that loan rolled into this current one. 
Value of my current truck sticker was about 20K upon signing. Now I Owe 35000 on the loan @9% paying 600 per month. I've talked to the bank and they have applied for help to lower the payments find out in a week about that. It'll help if payments are cheaper per month no doubt, but that'll obviously just stretch my payments more into the coming years. 

What are some options you guys suggest? I've asked about the voluntary repo, but that option seems terrible as I'll probably get next to nothing from the sale and still be on the hook for the remainder of the balance. So big payments and no truck. Could I go into the dealer and try and see if they've got a cheaper car in their lot and trade my truck in? Possibility that I could get a touch more $ that the repo sale would get me plus I still have wheels. 

Bankruptcy? Not sure how it works just read about it while trying to find answers on the internet. 

I've obviously taken every other step I can. I'm working two jobs. Paying rent, insurance, bills. I've budgeted myself hard and gotten rid of the things I don't need (cable tv, eating out etc) 

I've got no idea how I'm going to live like this for the next 5 years. Impulse decisions have basically stressed me out to the max. Don't want to live in a life of debt",finance,1473971967

personalfinance,0% Balance transfer or P2P Loan to Pay off CC Debt?,"Sorry if this has been answered before, I'm fairly new to this subreddit and couldn't find a good answer to what I'm looking for.  

My wife and I together have about 18k in credit card debt between 3 cards.  We've completely stopped spending on them (don't even carry them with us at all), and make the minimum payments for these cards (totals around $500 each month) right now.  We try to pay more, but don't have the money to do so right now.  I took out a $15k Prosper loan 2.5 years ago to pay off our credit card debt at the time, but then it went back up when we got married (paying for wedding expenses) and then from spending on it while saving up for a down-payment on a house.  I know, not the greatest excuses for racking up CC debt, but that's where we are now.

So we have a $464 Prosper payment each month, in addition to the roughly $500 that we pay on our credit cards.  This also doesn't include student loan debt for each or us, or our 1 auto loan (our other car is fully paid off, and we are going to drive it until it dies.  It's at 199k miles!)

I have been exploring ways for us to be able to pay down our credit card debt and being able to do so without continuing to pay the high interest rates on it.  I've thought about looking into a 0% interest card with a balance transfer (I've seen a 0% balance transfer fee with 0% APR for 15 months, or 3% balance transfer fee with 0% APR for 21 months).  However, I have a few concerns:
1 - I'm not confident that I will be able to get 1 card with a line of credit to cover all $18k of our debt.  According to CreditKarma, my credit score is 710, so not awful, but I don't think I'd get the full $18k.  Currently, my highest CC has a credit limit of $15,500 (and my balance on it is $8,000).  If I can't get a credit limit to cover all of it, I don't know if it's worth it to put some of the debt on the 0% APR, but then still try to pay the rest off?  
2 - I'm not confident that we would be able to pay off the entire balance in 15 or 21 months (would be about $1k a month, which is double what we have been paying lately).

I've heard of people who use the 0% balance transfer, and then when they get close to the end of the promotional period, they transfer it to another card with another 0% balance transfer/APR card.  I am curious how this works, because the only way I can figure it out would be to continuously open new CC accounts, and I don't know if that's a great idea.

Our other option is to take out a personal loan (Prosper, Lending Club, or through our bank) for the $18k.  I'm guessing we'd get a rate of around 7%, which is better than our CC right now, but would probably be locked in to paying it for 3 or so years.  My current Prosper loan ends in July of next year, so adding another one right now might be tough on us. 

My wife just lost her job so money has been a little tighter lately.  She's looking for something new but will probably end up finding something that pays less (she used to be a nanny for a wealthy family that paid well, and they moved...now she's looking at something closer to minimum wage).  We are still getting our bills paid, but don't have much money for anything else, savings, paying off more debt, etc.  So does anyone have any advice on how to approach the best way to pay off this CC debt?",finance,1473973070

# Description
Selective Insurance Group sells insurance to Businesses (77% of sales) to Consumers (14% of sales) and non-standard insurance is the rest. The business division operates in 22 states in the Eastern and Midwestern U.S. and the District of Columbia through approximately 1,100 distribution partners in the standard marketplace.


## Recent financials 

SIGI's had a steady increase in sales, driven by writing more and more insurance business. And the earnings have been stellar, with the business seeing a swing from an underwriting losses 5 years ago to nice underwriting profits today.

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $2.1bn | $2.0bn | $1.9bn | $1.7bn | $1.6bn|
|EPS | $2.85 | $2.47 | $1.87 | $0.68 | $0.40|

If you've no idea what I mean...well insurance companies typically make money in two ways:

* investment income on all the cash they are sitting on
* underwriting: collecting more insurance premiums than they have to pay out in claims

Some companies are willing to lose money on the underwriting... and make it back in the investment income. Though Buffett has long prided himself on profiting in both sides!

## Competition

When it comes to naming the competition they list:  Cincinnati Financial Corporation, Erie Indemnity Company, The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc., United Fire Group, Inc.; The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., Liberty Mutual Holding Company Inc., Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, The Travelers Companies, Inc., and Zurich Insurance Group, Ltd.

They go onto to point out that bigger firms may have a lower cost of capital that SIGI and many others don't have to rely on partners for distribution.

So with that in mind, the lower margin is understandable. And the higher return on equity is a pleasant surprise!

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $41.67 for Selective Insurance Group and their recommendation to clients is _Hold_. That implies an upside of 6% to their target.

So it's as if Wall Street think the stories done, and we can move on!

# Valuation

But looking at the peers, we can see that the valuation is at the low end versus other regional players like CINF and ERIE, and in line with the majors like TRV and ALL. Given the recent track record, it's hard to see the growth of SIGI being worse than the market. In fact they appear to have grown a little faster historically, yes?

# Dividends
Selective Insurance Group is forecast to pay a dividend of $0.62 per share, compared with a historic dividend of $0.59 per share. That is a 5% growth. The forecast dividend of $0.62 compares to a forecast EPS of $2.75. So plenty of room there to boost returns to shareholders.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 6% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of 3%. And looking back 12 months, the price hasn't rocketed ahead of earnings. i.e. valuation's been stable in the 12 to 14x range.

What's surprising to me in the data is that [Wall Street](http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/analyst?symbol=SIGI.O) thinks EPS in 2017 will be lower than in 2016 ($2.59 v $2.75). Though CINF is forecast to see a decline too. Is that really the case? Is it some FED related issue?

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, just 2 brokers turned up. 

&gt; In the first half of 2016, many key metrics across the organization improved and we are ahead of last year’s record pace. As we focus on underwriting and claims improvements as well as achieving rate increases that match or exceed expected claim inflation. Year-to-date our annualized operating return on equity was 11%, 320 basis points above our weighted average cost of capital as net premiums written grew 9% and we delivered 26% increase in operating earnings per share.

It's hard to not like the sound of that! Even if it's insurance speak ;)

Right now, I have just over $41,500 in student loans with varying interest rates starting at 6.9% and some as low as 3%. When I was in college, I had to purchase a car, since I live in a state that doesn't have a viable public transportation system, that car still has a balance of $19,500 at a interest rate of 4.9%. My car is upside-down and I'm well aware of that. The car payment is about $400 and the student loans will be $189 each month. This is just where my major debt is at the moment. No credit cards or delinquent accounts.  

I also live on my own, rent is $960, utilities run about $100 and miscellaneous household expenses are another $225. With that being said, each month I'm paying out (total) about: $1,905. I'm also bringing in a steady paycheck each month of about $2,400 after taxes; which I'm also paying into a 401k at the moment as well (so, I don't have to think about retirement at the moment, its already taken care of). 

My credit is decent, I have had a lot of inquiry's on it, which has impacted it a lot for some reason; these are from the first car purchase and when I wanted to trade in my car the last time. I never traded/sold it.

personalfinance,"26 &amp; about to start saving for retirement. Is this a solid plan, or do I need to contribute more? Help :&lt;","I've just turned 26, and by November of this year, I should finally be done paying off my high-interest student loans. I will have one remaining federal student loan of $5k at 3.5%, and a car loan of $8k at less than 2% interest. I plan to pay the minimum on these since the interest rates are great!
  
Currently, I have a total of about $9,500 saved for retirement. Most of that is in a 2050 target date Roth IRA fund with Vanguard Personal, and the rest is with my employer's 401k. My employer DOES NOT MATCH, but they do a voluntary ""profit-sharing"". This means that every year, they contribute 3% of my previous year's earnings into my employer sponsored account. In another 2.5 years, that money will be 100% vested (takes 5 years to be 100% vested). I'm currently 60% vested, so if I quit/was fired today, I'd only be able to take 60% of what's currently there. I plan to stay another 2.5 years.
   
Right now I'm pushing myself to pay a total of $1400/month to my high interest student loan. I'm hoping that once that loan is gone, I'll put:
  
* $458/month into Vanguard Roth IRA (to hit the $5500/year max)
  
* 118/month into employer 401k
  
I make $26/hr, and my biweekly post-tax paycheck comes to $1449. If I did my math correctly will be saving about 17% of my post-tax salary. My employer will then contribute another 3% each year, bumping me up to a total retirement savings of about 20% post-tax salary per year. 
   
This will only leave me with about $820/month to begin saving for a home. I live in San Diego (where I'd like to stay for good), where the home prices are astronomical. I'm worried that I'm not saving enough for my retirement, or that I'll never be able to afford a condo here :&lt;. Is this a solid plan? Or should I shift those numbers?

personalfinance,I am looking to pull money out of my primary residence to invest in other properties to flip. Need some advice.,"Here's my story. It started when my GF inherited a home. She sold it and came out with about $50,000. We worked that down by paying off some bills, etc. and I got her credit score up considerable (from ~540 to 730 over the past year or so). So we had roughly $40,000 left and we decided to buy a property to flip. 

We are both Realtors. We saw a cheap house come on the market and bought it for $12,000. We sold for $22,000 with 7k down and held a note at 12% with straight payout over 3 years. The reason I am telling that story is because it's what we hope to do again. I work with a lot of investors who buy and flip and hold notes at 12% interest only with 2-3 year balloons. The return is amazing IMO. 

My first question is: any better or easier return for investing in the real estate market that anyone knows about?

NEXT PART: We bought another house for $37k and took out a private loan for $30k for renovations (didn't have good credit at that point) and fixed the house up (ended up sinking more of our own money into it on top of the 30k loan for renovations). We are currently living in it as our primary residence. It will probably appraise at about 145k now. I want to get money out of this place now to go buy some more houses to flip/flip and hold notes/make private loans/buy private mortgages at high interest rates... 
QUESTION: Is cash out financing my best option? I was thinking of getting a 70%LTV cash out loan, pay off the private loan of 30k and take the rest out on the market. Any advice anyone? 

I know that was a lot of reading for two pretty simple questions, but I tend to ramble. My apologies.

Edit: More info: I am currently 29 and make about ~$80k a year. If anyone has other suggestions for investing for long term, I'd appreciate that too. I've read a bit about retirement savings, but definitely not enough. Being a Realtor, I have no sort of retirement plan unless I make one myself.

My concern is that I already cashed the check, since I'm kind of in dire financial straits right now. If/when they realize it's a mistake, will they be able to take the missing tax out of my next paycheck? Or will I have to wait until tax season to pay for it?

personalfinance,2 Dentist income... Lots of student debt.,"My wife and I are both 26 years old. She's a practicing dentist right now, and I'm in my 4th year of school. We will have a combined $750k in student debt when I graduate. Luckily we have both found jobs that pay very well (125k each as a minimum). Our plan is to refinance with a company who gives ADA members a ""discount"" on an interest rate, and pay this beast off in 5-10 years (7 is our actual goal). That said, we intend on moving across the country at the end of the school year. We were pre-approved for a mortgage of $150k, luckily we have some money saved from the wedding/parents/work etc. and will be able to shop for homes in the $175-200 range (in this semi-rural town this can get you a decent ""cookie cutter"" kind of home not terribly far from work). My question for everyone is this: should we try to buy and home that we don't ""love"" and just make it work for 3-5 years? Or rent for a year and try to get approved for a more substantial mortgage down the line?

Also, we drive the POS cars we've driven since college, and intend to keep doing this until the wheels fall off. We're pretty frugal about spending unnecessarily and our biggest expense is definitely groceries (which I'm almost proud of).

Any other tips you can give us?",finance,1473985727
personalfinance,Are Peace Bonds like regular bonds?,"My grandfather passed away recently and we found a piece of paper titled as a peace bond in his scrap book. It says was sold by the national council for the prevention of war.

Mortgage: 93,000
Student Loans: 176,000 (1st generation college students-got bad advice-both went to expensive private colleges)
Credit card debt: 11,000
Car loan: 3700

We make roughly 6,000/month, but are still living paycheck to paycheck. I have been trying to use Dave Ramsey's advice with the snowball affect for almost 3 months now, but don't even have the $1,000 emergency fund set up. I have eliminated what extra expenses I can, but still nothing left over after bills. Questions I have:

1. Will we ever get out of this debt? We are both feeling very overwhelmed and stupid.
2. What options do we have in paying our student loans back?
     A little history: 63,000 of the student loan debt is on a forgiveness program if all payments are made on time (income based, right now we pay $0 because I made no money last year). The remainder of our student loan debt is through private companies and have varying interest rates from 4-10%. Our monthly payments on the rest are $1131. Should we refinance to get our monthly payments down? Or should we keep paying what we are to get them paid off in 10 years?
3. How do we pay/save for a wedding that seems will never come because we can't even save $1000?

I can give more information on what our monthly bills are if needed. Thanks for any advice!

Edit: Our monthly bills:

$1131 to student loans
$840 to mortgage
$500 to house repair loan
$398 to credit cards-making minimum payments
$336 car lease payment
$288 to utilities-gas, water, electricity, trash
$200 to medical bills
$200 to car loan payment
$185 to cellphone ($60 of which is to apple for their phone lease program)
$175 to car insurance
$102 in business related expenses
$36 to entertainment- netflix, google play, etc
Total: 4191-not including groceries, gas, and other variable expenses

Edit: I appreciate the advice. I will get our budget tighter, look into refinancing the student loans, and watch every dollar. I did not expect such negative comments when I was seeking help.

personalfinance,"When it is a good time to buy in Forest Hills (Queens, NYC, USA)?","Hi :)

My SO and I are looking to buy a place. My parents are in Forest Hills (11375) and want me to get a place here, too. I've lived in FH for most of my life and I love the neighborhood. 

My SO lives in MA right now for work and is expecting to be back in a year. We're both saving up for the down payment and currently have a decent amount saved to buy a place now if the time is right.

When we got a pre-approval back in April, we got pre-approved for an amount which also took his current rent payment into account. (I currently live at home and am stocking away just over 50% of my take-home for our down payment.) My parents are providing us with seed money for the down payment (forever grateful!). However, we also wanted to steer away from looking at properties at the full value of our pre-approval amount because it'd be a bit financially tight if we were to go for the full amount. 

Initially, I wanted to look for a condo in Woodside because it would be more affordable for us, but after seeing a number of listings, the HOAs, and taxes, we're also considering houses - more space, outdoor space, and room for our pets and future family. 

For argument's sake, let's say there is a 700K house. How much can we expect the market to move in a year? Would it be better to buy now or in a year's time?

I'm not sure how the current political and economic landscape will affect interest rates and prices. Compared to back when we got a pre-approval in April, interest rates are lower :D

It's also our first time buying real estate and it's such a big financial decision, I don't want to rush into it or make a huge mistake.

Any insight is appreciated! Thank you :)

I clearly couldn't stick to the budget; it was a budget created by my dad, who was basing it off of how he would live.  I feel like I've been stuck at this 10k mark for too long.  I've actually started spending much less, but I recently started dating again so that's not helping.  I have nice enough parents that allow me to live at home completely rent free until I pay off my student debt.  However, I've already overstayed my welcome.

I'm wondering if I should tell him I want to put that towards my student debt instead.  Once my student debt is paid off, I was thinking of staying at home for another month afterwards, then moving out.  A car will be needed so I was thinking of financing a fairly cheap car.

personalfinance,Finally something that I did where I feel I actually made my parents proud.,"In July 2012 I went into my local Honda dealer and decided it was time to trade my old Civic in for something new. At the time, i was working full time, had a great relationship and felt I could afford to treat myself. 

Since I had known the guy that was selling me my car, I was able to get quite a few deals and discounts and ended up getting a really great trade in deal for my old car. 

I financed the car, got a great interest rate, and didn't have to put any money down. 

Now, I had to get my mom to co-sign for it. I didn't have bad credit, but i didn't really have any. I didn't have any credit cards or debts to pay off so my credit score wasn't really established. After some talking to, and convincing, she decided she would help me out. 

Obviously with a parent, or anybody co-signing for you, you NEED to make sure that you make your payments or it goes back on the co-signed. My parents have done very well for themselves and have worked hard on gettin to where they are today. Their credit score is just really, really good. I didn't want to screw that up for them. I knew that I had to make sure that I didn't make any mistakes. 

After a few years, every payment was made on time, I made sure to make sure regardless of how my situation was at the time, I'd make sure that payment was made. 

During 2014 my relationship went down the drain (hurrah for cheaters), and since it was kind of ""our car"", and we both were making payments on it (living together), I thought I was going to get screwed. 

After the break up I knew I had to work my ass off to have the nice things that I want. I constantly picked shifts up at my work, set money aside, and made sure those payments were made. 

At times, I struggled.  I paid my bills and had nothing left over. I thought at times I'd have to go to my parents or family for money, but I managed to make everything work and budget and be able to pay my bills every month. Shit was a huge struggle at times, having to always go to my parents for dinner lol or just go hungry. But it's all worth it now. 

Come next Friday, I will officially have my car paid off. I originally went with a 5 year financing, but being able to put extra money onto the principle every so often, and being able to make an extra payment or two the odd weeks, I'm now almost a full calendar year ahead of my pay off date. 

This makes me feel so much better. I really do feel like I can actually say that I made my parents proud. I remember that day trying to convince them to co-sign, how hesitant they were, and how many different terms we had. It's really an amazing feeling to know that I did that, and come next week, that car is officially mine. It's going to owe $0 and it's honestly one of the big accomplishments so far in my life. I always wondered what it would be like to have it paid off. And I am this close to knowing what it feels like. 

I plan to still ""make payments"". Since i'm doing ""well"" for myself right now, I plan to throw that bi-weekly payment into my savings account, and still have the mindset that i still owe payments. I figure it's one way to save quite a bit of money. 

Anyway. Just wanted to tell someone. It's a great feeling.

they think are doing the rigging. Greed is not the reason for the rigging, nor are any of the other
usual “follow the money” reasons. We cannot make a convenient demon out of Wall Street or the
big banks and investment banking houses. The real culprits are far less sinister and are actually
sincere in their motives, so you won’t see an Oliver Stone movie about the conspiracy to defraud
the middle class and strip them of their hard-earned retirement savings. No, the “bad guys” in the
story are just Nobel laureates, tenured professors, and other honorable members of the economic

personalfinance,Considering buying an apartment with $0 down. (CAN),"I'm living in Mississauga, Ontario and am currently leasing an apartment. My landlord is moving back into the apartment, so I have to move out soon. I've been looking for one bedrooms in the area to rent, but as soon as they pop up, they're immediately rented out. The demand is extremely high for one bedrooms, and it is mainly due to the area. There is a college nearby, as well as many executive buildings, so there are a significant number of students and young professionals. The area is quite upscale and rent is high. I am currently paying $1260 a month for a one bedroom which is unheard of in the new buildings. On average, one bedrooms rent for $1450-$1550 per month, utilities extra.

I came across this ad and never considered buying an apartment until I saw it. (http://www.kijiji.ca/v-2-bedroom-apartments-condos/mississauga-peel-region/buy-your-dream-home-with-0-down-call-for-details/1193138527)

They are boasting that with $0 down, I can purchase a $240k apartment for around $1000/month, plus condo fees and utilities, but I am skeptical. Are interest rates extremely high in cases like this? Does it even make sense to consider something like this?

I am 23 years old and I am making $69,000 per year. My only debt is a vehicle of which I owe about $23,000. I am planning on living in an apartment until I can afford a down payment on a home, but in the Greater Toronto Area that seems very far out of reach for quite a long time from now.

Here is my financial breakdown:

Every two weeks I get paid $1949.95 after my RRSP investment and taxes. I am contributing 2% of my pay to an RRSP of which my employer does a 3x match. So if I invest $100 per month, my employer invests $300 for a total of $400.  

  
My basic living monthly costs are as follows:  
Rent: $1260  
Vehicle: $500  
Auto Insurance: $292 (ouch, I know) 
Utilities: $40  
Gas: $200  
Food: $400  
Cell and Internet are covered by employer  

  
Total: $2692  

  
My average income per month after taxes and RRSP contribution: ~$3898-$4000  

I have $7000 in the bank currently.  

Any advice would be great. Maybe it doesn't make sense for me to purchase right now. I'm even considering just renting a basement apartment somewhere close by to bank as much as I can, but it would be nice to own a property and hopefully make some money on it as the prices appreciate.

I always like thinking long term and I always like to have contingency. If, for example, I purchased something and lost my job a year down the road I really want to make sure that I can sustain myself for at least 2 months without pay (to be safe) while I search for something else.

stocks,2 Reasons Why This Choppy Stock Market Means Nothing To Smart Investors,"The stock market has seen a return of volatility in September. Investors are scambling to figure out if the markets are going back to their all-time highs or collapsing lower. The simple answer? This is chop to take your hard earned money. It is mostly games by the institutions, being headed by top hedge fund managers that want to make money after coming back to work from vacation over the summer and an end to the 3rd quarter.

 

1. It Is Options Expiration Week

 

Understand that it is options expiration and the return to volatility gives institutions an easy way to take money from investors and pad their bottom line. Remember, the summer was dead so they are smelling blood (easy money) in the water. Let me explain how this works. Institutions sell a majority of options (puts/calls) to investors. Investors pay a premium to the seller in order to buy the option. For example, an investor pays $3 for an at the money MSFT call options. Since it is at the money, they are paying a $3 premium. Obviously, it is in the best interest of the institution to have that option contract expire worthless, because they make the entire profit. The week of options expiration is the best week to create ups and downs in the stock market. Mainly because the big boys (institutions) sucker the small investor into making crazy options bets and paying higher premiums. REMEMBER, this is the last options expiration before the 3rd quarter comes to a close. These institutions are padding their quarterly earnings in a major way. Ultimately, until this week passes, don't make too much out of the ups and downs in the stock market.

 

2. The Federal Reserve Gives Their Statement Next Week

 

While the market is shooting up and down wildly over the last week, it ultimately means nothing. Why? Because next Wednesday investors will hear from the Federal Reserve on interest rates. This has been the whole reason the stock market has been worried, therefore it is likely all the ups/downs are junk until we actually get real word from the Federal Reserve. Don't get too worried or excited until next Wednesday at 2pm ET.",finance,1474031588

Currently we are paying $750.00 per month which isn't even coming close to touching the principal on the loan.  The original plan was to pay the minimum for 25 years at which point the loan will be forgiven.

To clarify, these are all federal loans.

The problem is, she has a 7.35% rate so the principal is rapidly rising.  


At this point I'm not sure what the best course of action is.  


1.Keep paying the minimum for 25 years.  I'm concerned about having this huge growing debt hanging over our heads. I would Imagine this would affect our ability to buy a home and get loans in general.

2.  Increase monthly payments to a level where we can start eating away at the principal.  I think this would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $3000 a month.  This is possible for us.  We both make a good salary and we live below our means.  This would be the equivalent of paying another mortgage payment for 30 years though.


3. Tighten our belts for the next 5-10 years and pay every extra penny we make toward the debt.   While she was in school we lived off of my salary.  Since she has started working we have tried not to increase our standard of living, so it would be possible to throw most if not all of her salary at the debt for a few years.

personalfinance,Girlfriend is close to finishing Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) but school is being forced to close within one year. She would graduate in 15 months.,"Guys I have no idea what to do. My girlfriend is so close to finishing her BSN degree at Minnesota School of Business (MSB) and now the school is being forced to close by the state. I know that it is a for profit college and she has way more debt than she should have, but this has the potential to fuck up the next 5 years of our lives if she can't get her BSN on time. She has 50k in fed loans and 30k in private loans. 

Right now, the state has revoked the schools authorization to operate. The school is trying to appeal. The way I understand it, if the school loses the appeal, they will stay open for one year. My girlfriend is supposed to graduate in December 2017. Both the state and the school claim they will help the students who can't finish in that time by coming up with an ""teach out""/articulation agreement with other BSN programs in the area. They won't say which other schools they are talking to and my major concern is that they both are full of hot air and that no ""teach out""/articulation agreement will be reached and therefore no BSN. 

I should add that Minnesota School of Business is actually accredited by the state for nursing. https://mn.gov/boards/nursing/education/approved-professional-nursing-programs/

And that it has a higher NCLEX pass rate than the University of Minnesota. https://mn.gov/boards/assets/Number_Firsttime_Success_Rate_NCLEXRN_MN_2_2016_tcm21-37131.pdf

But MSB is accredited by the ACICS, not the HLC like all the other schools in the area, that's why transferring the actual school credits could be a complete wash.

I know she could have the Fed loans forgiven if she doesn't accept a ""teach out""/articulation agreement but then she is still 30k in the hole and has to restart at a new school for a 4 year degree since potentially none of the MSB credits transfer.

So knowing these things, should she accept or pass on a ""teach out""/articulation agreement if it is reached?

And can the state really just leave the students hanging out to dry if no ""teach out""/articulation agreement can be reached? Is there no legal action that can be taken?",finance,1474037456

My wife has a condo which she has owned in her name since before we were married. It is currently in a 7.4% interest rate loan on a 30 year fixed, 10 years into the mortgage.

Current balance $135k
Value of the property $205k (market value today)
Monthly payment ~$1,500 split as follows:
Taxes &amp; Insurance $400
Principal &amp; Interest $1,100 - this should be ~$645 @ 4.0%!

The loan is held with Ocwen Financial.

Clearly she should refinance. The issue is she keeps missing mortgage payments. Not because we don't have the money, but she just simply does not pay them on time. I can't explain it. On top of that, her credit score is poor (582 per Credit Karma) as a result of these missed payments and a Collections account which she, again, just decided not to pay. I am going to contact the Collections company to try and get that removed from her credit report. Even without that I do not anticipate a high score.

I understand you need 6 months' late free to refinance. I have excellent credit but cannot refinance because of the lates, even when adding my score. Is there another way to do refinance?

I can muster $10-20,000 today without negatively impacting my 1year emergency fund. If I wanted to eat into my emergency fund, I could wipe it out.

Honestly at 7% interest and piece of mind, I wanted to be debt free. 

I attached a [Link To Graph](https://imgur.com/a/cGKsd)

Some interesting points to note:

I started working Late September 2014.

April-June 2015: Got engaged, ring $$$, went through two crap jobs and got reestablished at a decent practice July.

Around January 2016 I realized my new job wasn't going to make enough to pay off loans by 2 years, but rather 3...3 1/2 ish?, so I saved up between Jan-March 2016 and moved to a different state for a better income.

Between April-September 2016, I made a fairly good income, but because I moved to a new state with no friends or anything, I wanted to have a personal emergency fund and therefore didn't dump all the money into loans. But September rolled around, and I do have some extra cash in the savings account, so I decided to do what I wanted to do, finish the loans 2 years later.

Overall, it's nice to be debt free. I do feel a bit burned out, and I would like to travel the world for a bit and quit dentistry for a few months. My next move is buy a dental practice and start my ""career."" Words of wisdom? Make a goal for yourself and go after it. I didn't live a big lifestyle in my beginning professional career as I dumped everything into loans. Even though I brought in anywhere from 7-15k after tax, My goal every month was to be below 1000$ credit card+ rent. I still don't plan on living big, as living below one's means and being debt free is less stressful.",finance,1474047148
investing,Isn't the EE Savings Bond a really good deal?,"As part of the bond portion of a total portfolio.

It sounds more like a pricing mistake + tax incentive than an investment. It's limited to $10k investment per taxpayer per year, and the ""your money doubles at 20 year"" clause seems like an oversight they forgot to repeal in the 2000s.

The one big downside to me is the low liquidity. I won't need the money for 20 years, but you can't sell it in a downturn to rebalance equities, for instance. 

On the other hand, they don't seem very popular. What am I missing?

personalfinance,"$100,000 student loan debt. $70,000 is the dreaded Parent Plus loan. What would be my best plan of attack, and how should i weigh savings vs repayments?","To start with the background, I am 25 and graduated from college 2 years ago, now working full-time. My older siblings are much older and went to college in cheaper times (and didn't go all 4 years), and neither of my parents went to college. So when it came time to pay for mine, we basically had no clue what we were doing and the Parent Plus loan was the only non-private option.   
   
The reasoning behind choosing it (morbid as it may be) was that my father is currently 67, and he said there is no way he will live long enough to see that paid off, and under the Parent Plus Loan if he (or myself) dies the entire thing is discharged and forgotten. So now there are $70,000 in his name that I agreed to pay. Both of them are now retired.      
   
Breakdown of the debt:   
$~70,000 Parent Plus Loan (that is now consolidated)   
$~30,000 in Consolidated Stafford loans that are in my name.   
   
Income: Just over $50,000 a year before tax.   
Works out to about $2670 per month after tax and me putting some into my 403(b) for the company match   
   
Expenses for a standard month:   
Rent: $595 (Cheapest I could find that isn't a slum, and living at home is not an option due to distance)   
Utilities $~95 per month for electric, cable/internet   
Car: $188 per month lease until July 2017   
Food: ~$250 per month   
Current Parent Plus Payment: $479 per month (extended graduated)   
Current Stafford Payment: $205 per month (extended fixed)   
   
I consolidated the loans to slightly lower the interest rate. That also brings Income Contingent Repayment into play (NOT Income-Based for some reason) on the Parent Plus, but as of now my parents have enough social security and retirement that this payment plan would be like $579 a month. The Income Based on the Stafford Loan doesn't consider the Parent Plus and my income is high enough that this plan would be much higher than the $205.   
   
Currently, I find myself living pretty comfortably, but if I were to lose my job or have an unforeseen disaster I am afraid I would be screwed, leaving myself and my parents in a big hole. Basically, I feel like I am doing okay relative to how much debt I am in, but $100,000 is $100,000 so I am still scared. I am slowly building up a savings and retirement, but I don't know if I need to divert some of that attention to the loans. My current plan is to try and save up about $10,000 to hold in a savings account for an emergency fund, then throw every penny I have left after my expenses at the Stafford loan since that is the one in my name.   
   
Does that sound like a good idea? Am I more worried than I should be? Am I screwed? Is there something I am way off on? I have no idea. Any ideas would be awesome.",finance,1474048421

personalfinance,"Burnt out Bail Bondsman, 45k in Debt. Any advice is greatly appreciated.","Throw away account for personal+security reasons. I am 35 in Los Angeles, been in the bail bonds business for about 10 years. I work on a purely commission basis. 

Here's a basic breakdown of my debt before outlaying other key factors:

IRS debts: 2014 tax year: owing 5k (Fed+State) 2015 tax year: owing 23k (Fed+State). Total IRS Debt 28k

My 2014 has been paid down from the original amount owed. I haven't paid a dime (including estimates) on my 2015 taxes.

Credit card debt: 9k at 3% APR for another 15 months. 3.5k at 0% APR for another 12 months. 4k at 12% APR. and 2k at 8% APR. 

Total credit card debt 18.5k at varying APR. 

I am anticipating another 10k (approximately) in IRS debt for my earnings in 2016. I file 1099 and do not pay any quarterly estimates. I know that's not very wise but that's the reality of the situation.

Important factors: Every January 1st I receive a check for 12k from a family ""trust"" (just an informal check, nothing official). I can defer this check to later in the year if that helps in any way. Also: I have 23k saved in what is called a ""buffer account"" related to the bail bonds business. I can cash this in whenever I like be it today or in three years. 

My thoughts: Without a deep understanding of the process I am considering filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy. Now, from my basic understanding of how it works my IRS debt (especially 2014) would not be old enough to be covered under chapter 7. I do have at least 10-15k in credit available still on different cards, and may be able to obtain more. My credit is still in decent shape, high 600's. I think I could come to close to covering all my 2014+2015 (and maybe some 2016) IRS debts on credit cards which would leave all my debt responsibility on credit cards alone, roughly 45k. Then file for bankruptcy. NOTE: I am not trying to do anything in the least bit illegal or shady, I have been an upstanding businessman for over a decade and things have just been slipping away from me financially. I am just looking for the most prudent course of action going forward. I am a total neophyte when it comes to taxes and finance. 

I am trying to figure out essentially if it makes more sense to go to the bankruptcy route (if it can one way or another cover my IRS debts) and hold off on collecting my 12k ""trust"" and 23k ""buffer account"", then using that money to get back on my feet. Or, to use that money (35k or so) to pay down my debts then be left at essentially zero capital but much less debt and no chapter 7. I hope that makes sense.

NOTE: I am not too concerned with the ramifications of a bankruptcy for a couple of reasons. I am not planning on buying a house anytime soon, I have a car, and if need be, I have family members that could help me cosign on other credit issues going forward.

Also, I am planning a pretty drastic change in life going forward. I am sick of the hustle and cost of living in Los Angeles (been here all my life) and am planning a move to the High Desert in Southern California, where I will be able to live a much cheaper (also quieter and more relaxed) life while still being able to generate income from my bail bonds connections.

Income:
I am 28 years old and have been working full time as an engineer for 2.5 years (I was fortunate enough to get a job right out of college), now making about $70,000 annually. My fiance works as a researcher under a grant that has about 1.5 more years and makes about $30,000 annually. It is likely, but not guaranteed, that she will be reassigned after the current project is completed. 

Debt:
My fiance had to start paying back $50,000 in student loans this year. Her interest rates are between 3-7%, and we have already paid off about $10,000 putting extra towards the high-interest loans. My paid-for car died about a month ago, and I now have a $25,000 car loan (4.79% for 75 months).

Savings:
I have been funneling a good bit into my 401k and IRA over the past 2 years, but have recently reduced down to my company 5% match to provide cash for either debt payment or a house down payment. I have $24,000 in my 401k and $17,000 in my IRA that I obviously do not want to touch. I also have about $12,000 between bank accounts and a mutual fund as my emergency savings.

Housing:
My rent is about $800/month. Based on some online estimators, putting $10,000 down on a $185,000 house would land me a similar monthly payment (3.75-4% estimated interest), but that probably does not include PMI or any other fees. As a reference, most of the non-forclosure starter homes I have seen advertised are around $200,000 in my area.

We have no urgent reason to buy a house, but our 1BR/1BA apartment is starting to feel a bit cramped and with a seemingly comparable monthly payment... it seems attractive. On the other hand, I am not thrilled about tacking on that much more debt and I assume we might get a lower interest rate later when there is less debt.

Other income is approximately $100/month from some stock dividends in what is considered a pretty stable company.
I would like to get ideas on investment/returns... I have considered:
•Putting about 80% of it into the same dividend-yielding stock. The last time I crunched those numbers, it's around a 5% annual 'return' if you assume the stock would just stay plateau'd/stable. (I'm not comfortable with the risk on that, (eggs/basket, and not hugely confident in the stock market) Am I being too cautious?

•Buying one rental property. Perhaps two, the second after the first is stable/rented.
This SEEMS to me like the most logical thing to do. I could put down 15%-20% on a decent little town-home in my area (one without a huge HOA this time) and net another ~$200/month per house?  
I guess this idea assumes good renters and a good location, or possibly a property management company that would probably cut any net profit in half...

•A mix of options 1 and 2?
Should I max. out my IRA? Would it help with income tax reduction? It seems like interest rates are so low, I would be better off getting dividend returns from it, but am not sure if that's short-sighted or smart.

I am between jobs at the moment, but not in 'trouble'. Obviously, it would be wise/nice to increase my recurring my monthly recurring income. My ""would be nice"" dream is to create a hacker/maker-space with monthly fees to TRY to mete out a profit, but don't really have the organizational/paperwork skills to approach that idea with much confidence.

It may come up, so I *THINK* my taxes on this will be long-term cap. gains, and my job status for this year has been lacking, so I'll probably pay very little in income taxes. (Single, no dependents. Less than $10k income so far on payroll)

I guess as I type this post, I realize more and more I need to find a financial planner/adviser. What do I watch out for? A guy who makes hourly, or only charges a percentage if I profit (Is that even a thing at this relatively low dollar amount?)

Workers Vanguard No. 1095 9 September 2016

Imprisoned for Spying for Cuba

Free Ana Belén Montes!

For almost 15 years, Ana Belén Montes has languished in a U.S. prison for her active solidarity with the Cuban Revolution. Having been the Pentagon’s number one expert on Cuba since the mid ’80s, Montes pleaded guilty in 2002 to “conspiracy to commit espionage” for the Cuban government. Alleged to have turned over reams of American military and intelligence secrets to the Cuban authorities, including the identities of Washington’s undercover spies, Montes was deemed “one of the most damaging spies” by the U.S. imperialist rulers and gone after with a vengeance. Montes never benefited one penny for passing on classified information. She expressed her motivation during a 2015 interview: “What matters to me is that the Cuban Revolution exists.” It is in the interests of the working class and the oppressed in the U.S. and around the world to demand: Freedom now for Ana Belén Montes!

Born in 1957 to Puerto Rican parents on a U.S. military base in West Germany, Montes was raised and educated in the U.S. During her graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University in the 1980s, Montes became increasingly repulsed by the bloody anti-communist policies of the U.S. in Latin America. Initially landing a job as a clerk typist at the Department of Justice, Montes rose through the ranks to become a senior analyst at the Pentagon’s intelligence arm, the Defense Intelligence Agency, specializing in Latin American and Cuban affairs.

Two weeks after the September 11 attacks in 2001, the FBI arrested Montes and charged her with espionage. She was sentenced to 25 years behind bars. At her sentencing, Montes called U.S. policy towards Cuba “cruel and unfair,” stating: “I felt morally obligated to help the island defend itself from our efforts to impose our values and our political system on it.”

For decades, U.S. imperialism has waged a war against the deformed workers state of Cuba, which emerged with the overthrow of capitalist rule in 1960-61. Among the imperialists’ bloody adventures: the 1961 Playa Girón (Bay of Pigs) invasion; the 1976 bombing of a fully loaded Cubana airliner that killed 73 people (Luis Posada Carriles, the terrorist responsible for that atrocity is still living in Miami); and numerous assassination attempts on Fidel Castro. The U.S. notoriously provides support and money to counterrevolutionaries on the island and, while trade and other commercial relations have increased, maintains its embargo intended to deprive the population of basic goods.

Despite the political rule of a bureaucratic nationalist caste under the Castros (Fidel and now Raúl), the enormous gains for working people made possible by Cuba’s collectivized economy—including the renowned health care and educational systems—exist to this day. Yet such gains remain in the crosshairs of the imperialists as they seek to reconquer Cuba for capitalist exploitation.

In 2015, as part of restoring diplomatic ties, President Obama and President Castro negotiated a spy swap. Obama released the remaining members of the Cuban Five—courageous men who attempted to prevent terrorist acts against Cuba by infiltrating and monitoring counterrevolutionary exile groups in Florida—and Raúl Castro released two American spies, including Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a former CIA operative. Trujillo had provided information leading to the conviction of the Cuban Five and Montes as well as former State Department official Walter Kendall Myers who, along with his wife Gwendolyn, was sentenced to prison for transmitting defense information to Cuba in 2010. (See “Free Walter and Gwendolyn Myers! Free the Cuban Five!” WV No. 963, 27 August 2010.)

Montes is now incarcerated at the Texas Federal Medical Center (FMC) at Carswell Prison. Known as “the hospital of horrors,” the FMC is notorious for violence and rape inflicted on female inmates. Isolated from all the other prisoners in the mental ward, Montes is barred from receiving phone calls and her correspondence is severely restricted. Montes stated, “I live in conditions of extreme psychological pressure. I don’t even have the most minimal contact with the world, except for the one I imagine ideally.” But she refuses to be broken: “I will resist until the end even if it’s difficult.”

Our defense of heroic individuals like Montes and Walter and Gwendolyn Myers is part of our defense of the Cuban Revolution. Isolated and impoverished, the Cuban deformed workers state cannot forever resist the strong economic and military pressures exerted by the U.S. and the imperialist world market. Genuine defense of the Cuban Revolution against imperialism demands a revolutionary internationalist perspective, with its survival ultimately dependent on socialist revolution internationally, especially in the U.S. Such a perspective must be tied to the fight for a proletarian political revolution to oust the Castroite bureaucracy, which excludes the working class from political power and promotes the fallacy of building “socialism” in a single country.

personalfinance,Just found out I have $160k in a CD with a .35% interest rate. Should I withdraw early and switch CDs?,"Hi /r/personalfinance!

I discovered today that, when I was a minor, after my mom died, some of my family members threw together a 36-month CD for me, which has auto-renewed twice now.

My uncle completely forgot about it until going through my (now dementia-laden, sadly) grandfather's mail and finding a statement. I went to the bank and asked about the interest rate, and found out it was .35%. The account just renewed in April 2016 for another 36 months. The penalty to withdraw would be ""1 year's worth of interest"".

I know that CDs for sums of money this large can approach 2% if I look hard enough. Would it be silly of me to withdraw early, face the penalty, and reinvest in a longer term CD with a much higher interest rate? I'm not sure if I'm missing something here. I also have no idea how my family decided 0.35% was worthwhile – I don't think that would ever overcome inflation, even in a good year.

In general, any pointers on top of what's in the sidebar as far as picking a good CD goes would be very much appreciated.

personalfinance,25 and attempting to create a financial plan. How am I doing?,"I'm 25 and started adulting two years ago when I started work as an RN. I'm attempting to make sure I'm on the right track for my finanical plan. Please give me any feedback, advice, etc. My goals are to save for retirement, maybe retire early, eventually buy a house, and to be able to go on a few small trips and/or a bigger vacation during the year. 

**Income**

* My income is variable depending on hours worked. Once in awhile I could work little as 48 hours/2 week pay period. A ""normal"" pay peroid is 72 hours. 

* Gross income is between $6000 - $6500/month, depending on hours worked. Take home is about $4000 - $4500/month. After taxes and deductions. Deductions are for taxes, health insurace ($26/month), and a deposit into my 403b at 8%.

**Spending**

* My expenses are around $2200 of non-negotiable spending on rent, bills, food, gas, etc. In addition to that I spenf money other stuff such as fitness, household items, gifts, hobbies, dining out, saving for vacation, etc. for a total of expenses per month on ~ $3000.
 
**Liquid assets**

* Emergency fund of $12k in Ally savings account, 1% interest rate. That's probably a bit more than what I need for 6 months of expenses if I trimmed down my budget, but I wanted to be on the conservative side. 

* A month's of expenses (plus a bit a buffer) in my local credit union checking account: ~$2500

* Short-term goals (vacation, larger purchases, etc) in credit union savings account:     ~$4000

**Credit**

* Credit score is ~740

* I have one credit card and credit history from paying off student loans and being on car loans my parents took out. I've been considering getting a second credit card. 

* I have no issues with credit card debt. Just pay that shit off every month. 


**Debt**

* Car loan: Bought a new car. Probably shouldnt have bought new, but it's all good. It's a 2016 Honda Civic. It will last me a hell of a long time. $12k left on the loan, 1.9% interest rate. Paying at least $350/month (more than the minimum)
* Student loans are paid off!


**Retirement Accounts**

* Fidelity 401k from previous job: $7500. Target retirement 2055, Expense ratio 0.2565%

* Vanguard 403b through current employer (started in Jan.): $2800. Target Retirement 2055, Expense ratio 0.16%. Auto deposit from paycheck, 8%

* Vanguard Roth IRA : $6700. Target Retirement 2055, Expense ratio 0.16%

 what to do with it. I've been ignoring it.

**Non-budgeted income options** 

I have roughly $1000 - 1500/month above my normal budget that I've been putting towards things like extra money for car payments, vacation, fun stuff, gifts, etc. All of these things  I already have as part of my regular budget, but since I have extra money I've been spending extra on these categories.  I think I could use this money more intelligently instead of just spending it here or there on things I already budget for. Here are the ideas I've come up with so far. 

⦁	Save for house downpayment - I've started saving a bit already in the past couple months. 

⦁	Other retirement options - Regular IRA?

⦁	HSA? Have the option for this through my work 

⦁	Investing? I know NOTHING about this.

Long story short, I started UPS when I was young (18) worked for 25 years, saved a lot of money, left the company and helped open a liquor store.  UPS sent me a notice that they're going to offer a buyout of my pension (I knew this was going to happen - just a gut feeling). Under the plan, I could have started drawing when I was 55.

Couple of questions:  
1) Any idea what the formula might be for the money?   
2) I know if the pension doesn't go RIGHT back into a retirement plan of some sort (IRA) I'll get hit with 20% tax and since I'm not 59.5, another 10% penalty AT LEAST federally... anything I missed there?

personalfinance,Someone talk me out of buying a new car please.,"**Backstory:**  I was driving a 2010 Ford Fusion SE which was totaled when someone rear-ended me in their 94 Ford Pickup.  It completely crunched the back, sent glass shards flying from the back window all the way into the front seat, and left just a tiny dent on the grill of his truck.

**Fast forward to now:**  I owed $3k for the car and his insurance is paying me $8215 for the car, leaving me with $5k to go toward a replacement vehicle.  

**My current financial situation:**  I'm a non-traditional student going back to school for a degree in Computer Science and won't be finished until December 2017.  I currently owe a lot of money on credit card debt accumulated to keep us afloat while I go back to school and can only work part time.  I'm working an internship that pays $17/hour that allows me to work ~25 hours during school and 40 hours a week otherwise.  My wife is currently unemployed while she takes care of our 3 month old son, so that makes finding a used car more difficult for me as well, since I can't get something too small.  

**Why I'm considering an old beater:**  With a cheaper car, I can start using the $300+ a month I'd be paying on a car payment normally toward paying off other debts, starting with what I owe on my phones still on the AT&amp;amp;T Next Plan and moving on toward the higher balance credit card bills.  Insurance would also be cheaper since it'd be a cheap car hardly worth paying anything for if it's totaled so it'd be a double gain.

**Why I'm considering a new car:**  There are several reasons I want a new car (specifically a Honda Civic) which I'll outline below:

* The monthly car payment will be roughly equal to what I was going to be paying on my old car for the next year anyway (Fusion was set to be paid off next August).
* I can get them to knock off quite a bit from the sticker price, so depreciation is less of a concern.  The sticker price of the Honda EX-T with the add-ons they included at the dealership was $25k, and he's able to knock down to $20,660.
* Interest rates are incredibly low right now.  Worst case scenario I'm willing to pay for a new car is 3.99% APR, which is higher than I'd like considering my Fusion was 1.74%, but still much better than the horror stories of 14%+ that Dave Ramsey wrote about in his 1993 edition of financial peace.
* Again on the depreciation thing, that argument doesn't work for multiple reasons for me, such as the car holding its value quite well after the price cuts, plus the fact that barring a car accident, I expect this car to last me 15 years (knock on wood) anyway.  With an old beater, I'd most likely want to get rid of it not too long after finishing school and finding a decent developer job.
* Looking for a used car that's a good deal is incredibly time-consuming and stressful, especially on top of my current course load at school.  

I'm really torn right now on which route I should take.  I'd have peace of mind from both instances, either in the form of one less monthly payment to worry about, or not having to worry about getting a lemon used car that breaks down on me on my way to class/work/elsewhere.

In deferring wealth building to go to professional school etc. it would be nice to finally be able to develop savings for retirement, put money towards college for my two children, pay down my mortgage (which is far less than my student loans), and buy a practice, but there are these massive student loans. 

Throughout the entire educational process everyone was told what a smart investment this education was and that you should have no problem paying down the professional school loans, but the reality seems to be different. Even if I put away no money for savings, it would be a stretch to chip away at the loans at all.

The way it looks with IBR is that I am only going to only be able to make minimum payments that won't pay down the loans even if I begin to earn substantially more money because it will have to be put that towards equity in a practice (another loan, ugh) and other things that make sense for someone just entering the workforce. I am really not sure what good options I have overall. 

I absolutely do not trust those Facebook ads about refinancing. My monthly payment would go up substantially, and I would lose all the protections that I currently have within IBR (such as interest not capitalizing). They look like just another bunch of vultures taking advantage of students and their debt as far as I am concerned.

**Does anyone know what exactly happens at the end of the 20years with the remaining balance?** The IBR website is very vague and it is unclear whether or not the balance is simply forgiven or if it is then treated as taxable income that I am responsible to pay......",finance,1474132154
investing,How do I arbitrage debt in practice?,"I understand keeping debt at a lower interest rate to invest in something with a higher interest rate. But how do you stay liquid enough to pay off your debts? 

For example, say I can get a mortgage loan for 3% on a 300k house. But I know I can pile my money into a Vanguard fund and get on average 5% a year. Great. So obviously I should put minimum down payment on house and get as much money as I can into Vanguard.

But how do I have enough cash on hand to keep paying down my mortgage? If I keep some of it liquid, but it's rotting away in a savings account at 1%, would it just have been better to have that piled into the mortgage instead of sitting in savings waiting for a monthly payment?

I know I'm definitely missing something as this is apparently how wealthy people get wealthy, but I just don't get how it works in practice.",finance,1474136108

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation Help,"I consider myself a fairly financially savvy individual in most respects, but it occurs to me that I know absolutely ZERO about student loan consolidation. It's time for me to admit I could use some advice, because there's too much misleading and scammy type information coming from the companies themselves. Forgive me if I leave out something relevant. I have two different student loans for myself. They are each about $35,000. The first was taken out in 2007, the other in 2012. The interest rate for both is 6.8% (for grad school, both cases). In addition, my wife has a student loan for about $25,000 also at 6.8%. That means we're sitting on about $95k total. In all, we pay $900/mo in student loans, but only because we've spread them over many years. I make a good salary ($150k+) so I'm not concerned about making the payment, but I am concerned that I'm overpaying on the loan. I want to avoid increasing my monthly payment if possible (shorter repayment period), because we're trying to move into a new house. What are the good companies for student debt consolidation? What should I consider? Do I lose any ""rights"" like deferment if I consolidate? What is the likelihood I would get a lower rate?

personalfinance,Recently received an inheritance and ready to apply for a mortgage. Have a non-recent default on my credit. Should I wait to apply til it falls off?,"Hi r/ PF,

I'm a married 30-something in southern California with a combined income of around $90k. I recently received enough of an unexpected inheritance to accelerate our path to home ownership about two years faster than planned. We now have enough to cover down payment and closing costs, which we were slowly saving for.

Here's the issue. Shortly after the recession I defaulted on my federal student loans. I worked with the collections agency to pay them off and my credit is clean since then. I've rebuilt my credit enough that I went from a security-backed credit card in 2010 (""we'll give you a credit line of $500 if you'll keep $500 in a separate account from your regular checking"") to a credit card with a five figure limit today. 

My wife and I had a consultation with a mortgage officer at our bank and believe we can get approved for a mortgage that's within our budget. After the meeting I ran my credit. I mis-remembered my college addresses and was only able to run one report. The default is still on there, but will be removed in early 2017. I didn't pay to see the score, but last time I checked it was above 700. Wife's hovers in the high 700s to low 800s

 The way I see it we've got three options:

* Tell the mortgage officer about the default and apply now, and potentially get lower interest rates and access to a more buyer-friendly market
* Don't tell the mortgage officer why we're holding off and wait til next year to apply
* Ask the mortgage officer's advice

Other debts and info:

* Rent: ~$1900/mo including utilities
* Wife's student loans: ~$170/mo minimum, I don't know the balance off hand
* Car loan (in wife's name): ~$400/mo, &lt;$10k remaining, we're paying more than the minimum to pay it off quicker, but I'm not sure what the minimum is
* Credit: All cards are paid off, we owe less than $1k on furniture but it's at 0% interest for eighteen months so we're chipping away at it and we'll pay off the balance before interest is applied
* Savings: We've got enough for a safety net even before the windfall, we're contributing to our 401k, and I've got vested stock in my company originally valued at $20k, but now worth more.

personalfinance,"What should be done about previously unknown medical debt, some of which has gone to collections?","My wife's parents weren't always fully insured, and subsequently she has medical debt. We realized there was a problem when we took her in for an appointment and they charged us a $50 fee because of her outstanding balance despite our current excellent insurance . Our HMO's patient portal website lists a number of charges around **$2400**.We got two of her credit reports last week, which listed **4 accounts in collections, around $3000**. We got the last credit report today, which shows **two more accounts around $1300**.

She also has a collection of **student loans at about $28,000 with a variety of interest rates from 3-5%**, and a separate one that doesn't show up on her credit reports for **$6000 that has a rate of about 6%**. Minimum payments on her student loans are about $400.

My take home pay is $4000/month. Our rent is $1000. I have no debts myself and I'm contributing to my 401k. She is currently between jobs(with an interview this week!!!). My savings have about $26,000, and hers have about $12,000(I gave her $5000 to help with debts for her birthday).

**What should we attack first(or the most)?** We are already planning to drop a big chuck to try to eliminate accounts, but obviously want to keep emergency savings. **How do we properly deal with collections agencies?** 

Her family has run into issues with their insurance company doing stupid things before. **Is the HMO obligated to provide us with all the information about charges that went to collections?** Currently the patient portal only shows what they have in their current balance and what was fully paid from the beginning of 2015 or so and one of the accounts in collections doesn't jive with what they list. **If we do find weird discrepancies, is there anything that could be done about the things already in collections?**


Last but not least, is there anything else we can do to help fix her credit besides paying these off? She has no credit cards, but I do and I have good credit. Are authorized user cards a good option? We might need to replace one of our cars soon. Would cosigning a loan for a reasonable used car with her be worth it?

financialindependence,Living life vs saving,"Hello all,

I am 24 year old student. I graduated with a BSc degree in business. In my country it's normal to do Masters but I decided I would rather pursue a job I am aiming for. I played poker professionally for a few years and I saved up some money. In total I have $150k, $50k of which are loans with a low interest rate.

Ever since I was little I wanted to be financially independent. I don't know why exactly but I suspect that this drive is mostly driven by fear and anxiety. That being said I am very afraid to spend money because I do not have a job right now and everything I do spend comes directly from my savings. As a result I also still live at home. Furthermore me pursuing a job now instead of doing a masters is also driven by a similar anxiety I suspect.

I would like to move out obviously and start to live life a bit more. Controversially I do live life a lot when I am on holiday, and there I spend way too much money. 

To make an end to this longish and partially irrelevant story, my question to you is how do you psychologically deal with the desire to become financially independent while also at the same time ""live"" a fulfilling life.

As a bonus question I would like to ask for your reasoning for striving financial independence.

personalfinance,Really fucked up at the car dealer this weekend,"Hey guys. First off, I know. I'm not looking for retrospective advice on what I ""should have done.""  I know. I get it. I need advice moving forward and to see what my options are. 

I don't want to get into too specific details, but in thinking about how to cut down my expenses and debt, this week I figured I'd look into trading my car in for a cheaper one to both reduce overall debt as well as monthly payments. 

The car I had going into this had 37,500 left on it. it appraised for 30,500,so I'm upside down (at a dealer) that much. 

I found a cheaper car that I really liked for 34. I told them that it wasn't going to happen being so upside down. So they said they would help with my negative equity and took 6k off the sticker. This is for a new car, so I was very excited. It brought the new car to a purchase price of 28. Great, good progress. 

We started doing the paperwork, and that's when the 7k I'm upside down played in. I know this is my fault entirely, but this is how it plays out. I had an important meeting half hour after paperwork started so I was stressed and not thinking. I should have stopped signing once I saw the final numbers: the new loan would be 1k more than my current, for a car worth less, at twice the interest rate. I'm a goddamn idiot, but not being mentally clear I signed stuff, and then immediately regretted it. I thought I had a couple days to bring it back and reverse the deal (I read a clause in the contract saying I have 2 weeks to bring it back, but it turns out that's it they can't finance me. I dont see that being a problem that I can leverage against...) so I tried taking the new car back today (by the way I still have the older car and it's title in hand, but legally obviously theirs since I signed.) 

Anyway I'm freaking out. As it is, instead of being 4-7k upside down on a car (that I really liked anyway), now I'm double that, with essentially the same amount of debt, for a car worth less. What can I do?? Apparently buyers protection doesn't exist for autos. I really don't want to get rid of my old car, this was just a stressed, pressured, spontaneous, terrible decision. I'm going in Monday to see if the general manager is willing to reverse this, maybe with 500-1k on my end for ""restocking fee"" or something to help sway him. 

Does anyone have any ideas? I feel like absolute shit right now.

My partner and I recently broke up and are left with the following situation.


This year, we took a loan of 180K€ (25 years) and bought a flat (240K€).


We needed 100K€ to get the loan for the overall sum (so, 100K to get the 240K€). My partner contributed to about 80K and I did to 20K (due to personal reasons, I am the one who could get the loan and my partner had the capacity to contribute more).


My partner told me yesterday they wish they never did it and would like to get their 80K back.


It's a bit tricky to sell the flat (taxes, legal issues) but should we manage to sell it (at about the same price we bought it), 240-180 would give us 60K that my partner would get back straight away and we would be left with the loan.

* Is it a good idea to pay off a loan as quickly as possible (it's a 2.2% rate) ? (fees will apply and I don't think you cannot just go to the bank and give the money back that easily)?

As the title says, we have about $20k in a Europe account (he's from there originally). It's been there for about a year and could potentially be there for at least 2 more years. Ultimately we want to buy a house in the US and that money will be used towards the deposit. 

Without going into too much detail, his money is in Euros. The problem is, his country does not have good interest rates for savings right now. It's extremely low and we basically aren't making anything off of that money. 

The exchange rate for the dollar to euro is also really low, and we were thinking we might try and wait it out until the exchange rate gets better (in the Euro favor) so that we can transfer the money then. I'm not sure how much it is to do a wire transfer, but I'm sure with any transfer we'd have to pay a fee and potentially lose some of the money anyway. 

If we did the transfer, I'm not entirely sure what type of account we should use here. I have an ally savings account that earns 1.00% interest, but I'm a little nervous putting it in a CD if we can't touch it for a specific amount of time. Although I am thinking it'll be at least 2 years before we buy, if something comes along earlier we would be willing to buy before 2 years. 

So I guess I'm wondering, should we just leave as is for now, and wait (and hope) the Euro gets better?

Your policy as of August 31, 2016 had a cash surrender value of $40,409.  The monthly cost of insurance over and above your payment is coming out of the cash value.  The internal cost of insurance increases every year, and based upon the policy’s current cost of insurance and the premium that you are paying, it is forecasted that your policy will lapse in ten years time; you would only be Age 72.  You may replace your policy as we have discussed with a new policy for $500,000 with the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company and continue to pay a premium of $190.42 a month and that premium would be able to support the new policy which has lower insurance charges for the next 21 years based upon the policy’s current cost of insurance and illustrated interest rate whereas the current policy is forecasted to lapse in ten years.  The cash value in your current policy would be rolled over to the new policy.  In ten years time you would still have coverage and the cash value.
 
J's policy is also forecasted to lapse in ten years time.  He has been paying a premium of $307.79 a month and his internal cost of insurance is $533.02.  His internal cost of insurance increases each year and the difference between his premium payment and his internal cost of insurance is coming out of his cash value which on August 31, 2016 is $77,538.   His policy is forecast to run out of money in ten years and lapse for no value, no insurance coverage and no cash value.  His policy can be replaced with a new policy to be issued by the AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company and he will continue to pay the same $307.79 a month.  Last night I told you and J that his premium could support the new policy through his Age 92.  I had run that illustration in my office not knowing that he was still a cigarette smoker and the Age 92 was based upon “Preferred Non-Tobacco” rates.  The “Preferred Tobacco” rate’s cost of insurance is higher.  He will be able to support the new policy for 15 years as compared to the 10 years on the present policy.
 
The internal cost of insurance for the new policy is lower than on the existing policy.  In future years he would be able if he so chooses to pay additional premiums to extend the coverage to a more advanced age.  The policy would be significantly less expensive than if he kept the current policy and paying additional premiums in future years.""

While I do not need advice for our added income as my SO and I have already discussed this and come up with a game plan, I don't know much about contract work and was curious if anyone had any insight to it. For example, do I have the opportunity for a raise? Either performance or yearly? Or is my salary set in stone for the length of the contract (2 years)? After the two years is up, IF I am offered a position with the organization directly as a fed employee, should I expect or anticipate a large increase in salary since it is a direct hire? When should I start looking for new jobs when the contract is coming close to ending? Anyone that has any information... I would greatly appreciate it!",finance,1474229677
personalfinance,"Recent graduate, making 39k before tax, living with parents, tiny debt. What would you do in my situation?","Hi PF, I'd like others opinions on what I should do in my situation.

I'm prior military, now out of the military, I went to business school and finished a bachelors in business management. 

I just got hired at a local financial institution making $29,000 a year. 

I also get VA compensation for $600 a month.

After considering my monthly addon sells and bonus I figure I make about 39k a year. 

I'm currently living with parents.

My only debt is a car payment I owe $2900 on at $200 a month. The interest rate is only 3.15.

Other than that, im debt free and I pay my parents $500 a month for rent. 

I have the potential to save 600 a month after expenses. 

My question is, do I seem under paid with a degree? Should I look for higher paying jobs? Should I try to promote asap? Should I just save whatever I can? Invest? Try to move out? What would you all do in my situation.",finance,1474231352

personalfinance,Question about an ira account (posting for my mom),"Good afternoon, as the title says I'm posting this for my mom, well dad really, but anyway, here it goes. I'll try to be as complete as possible but I don't know a lot so please ask any questions you feel needed and I'll get the answer from one of my parents. A while back my father switched companies in his line of work for a job with the same pay but closer to home so less travel. Anyway, his old company had a 401k but the new company didn't have 401k options to rollover the money to a new account. His new employer suggested the IRA account if he was wanting some sort of 401k. My father met with a financial adviser and rolled over all of his 401k to an IRA. It was never much, less than $5000. It was sitting in the IRA for a while just doing nothing and the financial adviser or whatever in charge of it kept calling telling my dad he should be adding more money or whatever. So, long story short, being as my parents aren't in a position to add to the IRA at all right now and the money is slowly dwindling away due to stock price changes, my father decided to withdraw his money and look for other savings options. The questions they both have are these:
#1: the company that cut the check took out exactly 10% for what says federal taxes, is this enough taxes taken out or will my parents have to pay taxes on this money?
#2: if my parents have to pay taxes for the money, when do they do that? Is that done now or at tax time?
#3: is there any other unforeseen thing that can pop up and claim part of this money in any way or are they free to try and invest it further or do whatever they have to with it?
lastly #4: I hear people talk about penalties for early withdraw of an IRA, what are those and is that something they'll have to pay from this?

personalfinance,"College --&gt; Broke --&gt; US Navy --&gt; Finally not living paycheck-to-paycheck, but unsure what to do with my money. (25 y/o, married, ~35k student loan debt)","Hey r/personalfinance! Seems you've done a ton of people good in the bank account, so hoping I can get your two cents as well.

&amp;nbsp;

So... I grew up in a pretty poor household - we got by, but my childhood involved a lot of ramen. Once I was on my own, I took some loans to go to college, because I was raised on ""if you don't want to flip burgers for a living, you need to go to college!"" and never questioned it. Got a bachelor's in Criminal Justice, then learned the hard way that no one in that field seems to care about education, opting for experience... spent the next couple years flipping burgers with my tail between my legs. Wife is pretty much in the same boat. Finally got fed up with our life being on pause, so I enlisted in the US Navy.

&amp;nbsp;

Between the two of us, we have $35,000 in student loan debt, consisting of a combination of private and federal loans ranging from 4% to 6% interest.

&amp;nbsp;

Since enlisting, our cost of living has dropped dramatically, since our rent and food is now covered by military allowances... so we're FINALLY not living paycheck-to-paycheck, and have actually been building our bank account instead of constantly hovering barely above $0.00.

&amp;nbsp;

We now have $10,000 saved up, originally intending to keep that amount on standby as an emergency fund (good choice, or should we not just sit on that much money?). The goal now is to start chomping away at our student loans, starting with the highest interest one and working down. So, if we go above $10k, the extra goes to the loans; if we dip below for whatever reason, back off on the loans until we get back to $10k.

&amp;nbsp;

After taxes, our combined monthly income, minus the spendings we can't really cut (minimum monthly loan payments, utilities, gas) comes out to about $1,800 per month, in the bank. We try to be pretty conservative with out spending - limit ourselves to going out once per week (and usually just split something when we do), and are pretty good about not buying frivolous crap... factoring for the unexpected expenses life throws at us, $1,500 per month is probably a safe estimate.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I've never had this much money to work with, so I was hoping to get some insight on the best thing to do with it. Thinking long term here - is the plan I mentioned about hitting the student loans our best bet, or should we be putting money into an IRA or something, or... I really don't know money. It's still kinda weird to look at my bank info and see a number higher than $1k that doesn't have a negative symbol in front of it.

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR,**

$35k student loan debts ranging from 4% to 6% interest.

$10k in the bank.

$1,500 per month to work with, after unavoidable expenses (utilities etc).

What should I be doing to establish long term financial success?

personalfinance,(AUS) How to help my in-laws?,"So I'm looking at helping my in-laws out with a house. While I've been a long-time lurker here, and recognise that this is usually a recipe for disaster, I think I can set it up such that it's lower risk (both financially, and in terms of our relationships).

**Preliminaries**:

My fiancé (soon to be wife) and I live with my Dad, paying $500 a fortnight (all inclusive; rent, bills, food etc). We can live here for the foreseeable future (at least 6 or 7 more years), and anticipate living here for at least 3. It works well for us, we've already been doing it for 3 years, and there are no real factors here that will change our finances drastically and suddenly. 

I earn about 80k (excluding superannuation). She earns about 60k (also excluding super). I'm interviewing at the moment for jobs nearer 100k. I'm in my mid-20s, thinking kids in the next couple of years. At the moment, my entire income covers bills, rent, and spending money. Her entire income goes in to savings (and after the wedding will be devoted to paying off debt).

We have about 20k debt between us (wedding related, and testament to a previous life where we weren't so finance conscious etc), split between credit cards and a personal loan. We are paying this debt down quite aggressively, starting with the higher interest (credit cards). We also have about 10k in savings, a chunk of which will be going to wedding and honeymoon expenses. In short, we anticipate our debt to be significantly shrinking, rather than growing, over the short and medium term.

We also both have HECS-HELP debts, hers quite substantial, mine about 18 months from being paid off. We aren't too worried about these, given the nature of HECS debts (low interest, payments related to income, etc). 

**Main Story**:

Fiance's parents are both retired, dad on a disability pension. They earn next to nothing, and currently live in social housing, for which they pay some token amount (a few hundred a fortnight). The house they live in is falling apart, mostly due to their inability to contract, or afford, repairs. The housing board are supposed to organise and pay for repairs, but this has been an ongoing fight that has parts of their house literally falling to pieces before anything gets done. 

Fiance and I want to buy a house (debt being especially cheap at the moment in Australia), not to live in, but to begin taking advantage of generous tax incentives (negative gearing especially). We can't really afford to buy where we live, but can definitely afford to buy where her parents live. 

We're looking at buying a house worth approx. $350,000. Mortgage repayments on this would be approx. $1,400 a month on a 30 year mortgage (we would likely get a shorter term, or possibly hybrid mortgage, to allow us to pay more off at the moment, when we can afford to). They could probably afford to pay us $500 a month in rent, leaving $900 a month for us to cover (at the moment, easily, although this will obviously change as we consider kids etc). This amount is tax-deductable in Australia, as loss made from an investment. Stamp duty, maintenance etc are also all tax-deductable. 

I'm going to try to pitch it to them in this way, that it's basically not going to cost me anything, that it's not a gift (I'd need them to still pay rent, because otherwise you can't claim it as a tax deduction), and that they're really just helping us park cash while debt is so cheap (as interest rates are quite low in Australia at the moment). 

I know this isn't r/relationships, so any advice people have regarding the finances? Is there something massive I'm overlooking, or need to consider? Or is there some better way to help them out? It can't feel like us extending ourselves, because they'll refuse to accept it, hence the draw of buying a house for which they will be the tenants.",finance,1474250684

personalfinance,first time in PF; wanting to know if getting a personal loan to pay off existing cc debt is wise,"Hi there! A little more background on me to give you an idea on my current situation: I'm 22, have ADHD that was undiagnosed until last year, currently not attending school (student loans are currently in deferment), started a good paying job a couple of months ago and getting used to not having to scramble so much for money. Parents have been paying most of my bills since I left for school and now I'm a lot more financially separated from them (they're not that great with money either plus dad lost his job). Recently engaged so have to plan/save for wedding. SO's family is in TONS of credit card debt but they won't file for bankruptcy. SO is better at financing and only has 2 cc's that she is great at paying off.

Before we met, though, and before my ADHD was diagnosed and managed, at 18, my parents talked me into getting a credit card at a store so I can get clothes for school (lived on my own, parents lived across the state). That, and my impulsivity due to my unmanaged ADHD, led me to get three other credit cards that now have high balances. In that time since then I also have gotten a used car in my name, got my SO's ring through the store (with a new and fourth credit card), and now have to deal with a debt collection agency to pay off about $500 from dropping out of school due to unmanaged mental illnesses.

I'm a lot better with money now. My high anxiety levels keep me thinking that I never have money (which used to be the case due to shit jobs and bad spending habits). I'm under my own insurance, which means I have access to mental healthcare. My SO and I joined bank accounts, but we've been hit with some emergencies that have had us trying to budget what we can. Having all of these different credit card bills at random times in the month is difficult. 

I have spoken to my SO's mother (who is refusing to do anything about her high cc debt) about possibly applying for a personal loan for debt consolidation. She says they usually have high interest rates and that it was a bad idea. I have spoken to my SO about it multiple times but cant come up with a solution besides trying our best to snowball what we can and stick to our budgets. I'm awful at that because I try to stick to my money as long as I can (bad idea, I know. Anxiety sucks). I just want to pay a certain amount once a month instead of having to pay big amounts four to five times a month.

Here is what I have in regards to debt:

Credit score is in the fair range, around 650ish

- Credit cards: $5676 (all 5 cards have 19.99% interest rate)

- Auto Loan through Credit Union: $7260 left (17.54% rate for 61months, total cost was $8599 @ time of signing) 

- Student Loans: $25,152 left (6.8% rate)

- Debt Collector through school I left last winter: roughly around $500

- Owe roommate for security deposit down payment: $350

-- Currently make about $890-1020/paycheck (work full time 8 hrs/day M-F with pay schedule being twice a month. One pay period could be 88 hours, other pay period could be 96 hours, depends how many days in month).

-- I pay my phone bill, rent, utilities, cc bills, gym membership, netflix, spotify. Only thing parents pay for currently is car and car insurance, but I want to be able to pay that off too if possible.

I use Lending Tree and tried to find a debt consolidation personal loan for about $7000, which I feel like could take care of all of my credit card debt, most of the debt for collection agency, and some for my roommate (if at all possible, she isn't pressing me for money but I don't like owing people). No options showed up. Before, I've seen personal loans up to 25-27% interest rate. I was told that was bad by SO's mom. I've been denied once. Too scared to try again.

SO suggested SoFi but I've never heard of it before and I'm very afraid of getting scammed.

I'm wanting to start over with a clean slate now that I'm going to be getting married and now have a great job with lots of opportunities to move up in the future. We even discussed buying SO's parents house in 5-6 years when they move. I want to stop living paycheck to paycheck. I'm getting a lot better at my spending habits. I'm not impulse buying things unless I'm off my medication. SO is good about keeping me on track. I want to be able to pay most of this off in the next year.

Having a personal loan to pay off all of the credit cards so I can pay just one sum a month sounds like an amazing option, but I don't know anyone with that experience and I really, really suck at snowballing. 

If anyone can give me advice on how to best deal with all my debt or have experience with a similar situation or have dealt with debt consolidation loans would really help me put my mind at ease.

So sorry for the long post/rant! I'm a very nervous person :/",finance,1474253619
personalfinance,"21 years old, $20k in credit card debt, is my plan foolhardy?","Long story short, my mom was diagnosed with cancer and we're very, very poor. Naturally, the expenses piled up and my mom, who became dependent on me -- her only son -- was faced with choices like getting her prescriptions or not. I obliged every time and swiped the card. I don't know if this is right or wrong but I just couldn't see her not get the treatment she deserved.

Fast forward to now, a few months after the diagnoses, and I can't even afford the minimum payments anymore. The bills are piling up around us and my minimum wage job is absolutely worthless in the face of cost of living and medical expenses.

I think what I did was wrong. I feel like a thief in that I applied for every card I could knowing that there might be a time when I couldn't afford even the minimum payments, but it was hard to not do something else when confronted with reality.

I don't know if this is dumb or not, but I plan on paying off my credit card debt with low interest federal student loans that I won't have to pay until I have my degree and I'm making something better than minimum wage.

This is really the only solution I can think of, but I'm not sure if it's totally stupid or legitimate. I've heard things about bankruptcy but I don't know anything about it. It sounds like it would effect me terribly in the future, but the more I think about my situation the more I'm drawn to the conclusion that massive student loan debt might be worse for my future than a bankruptcy (if I even qualify?)",finance,1474260046

personalfinance,Which debts should I focus on first?,"Hi there /r/personalfinance

I am coming to you because I have some questions about which loans/credit cards I should pay off first and how I should plan my budget for the next year or so.

A little background on my situation. In college I was pretty irresponsible with money. I took out student loans I didn't need so I could take vacations, bought a motorcycle on credit, and racked up credit card debt big time. I was depressed and bought stuff to combat that. After a couple years, I dropped out and joined the Coast Guard, hoping that some structure would help me out with my depression and financial troubles. With all of the initial expenses out of the way for getting to my first unit and getting set up with a car and other various expenses, I am left with the following outstanding loans:

* *Credit Card 1*: $4300 interest free for 18 more months

* *Credit Card 2*: $2300 interest free for 8 more months

* *Motorcycle Loan*: $5300 at 4.25%

* *Student Loan 1*: $4500 at 6%

* *Student Loan 2*: $7300 at 4%

My salary after taxes is about $1150/month but I have all of my meals paid for and I live in government housing. I have a bonus and travel reimbursements that total $2350 coming in the next month and about $200 in the bank. I was planning on using this extra cash as an emergency fund before I start paying down my debts. Making the minimum payments on the loans above plus my phone bill, insurance, and only entertainment bill (Netflix), I am left with about $450 extra per month in the bank. I plan on using about $300 per month of that on paying down my debts, but I have no idea where to start. Should I pay the credit cards that will soon be incurring the highest interest rates or should I just start paying down the highest current rates? Should I pay the loan with the biggest payment first (motorcycle) so that I have extra cash to pay to the other loans each month? 

One last thing. I am planning on selling the motorcycle but I am battling with insurance companies because the bike was currently the victim of a hit and run. It probably won't be fixed until after riding season is over up here (southern Washington) so I will probably have to wait until spring to sell.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, as I am starting to feel overwhelmed as I try to turn my financial life around. Thanks!",finance,1474262124
personalfinance,PF What sells when presenting a project?,"Not sure if this belongs here, feel free to move this

I am a senior year student, Bs. M.E. and me and a small group of other students (cross carreers project) developed this project as a part of a course we are in. It's the full idea, from basics to research and construction plus the whole engineering theory  backing we could give it, it's solid and looks good.

We have made small scale polls, social and economical research, we even got a real first client.

My government tries to make small enterpreneurship flourish by giving contests to projects like mine and see what idea would be more viable, profitable, and socially ok, preferrably all (which mine seems pretty ok on these areas) and they'll fund them as small or micro-companies.

The catch here is that there are thousands and thousands of good and not so said projects in competition.

What would you think it's the best area I should focus on when presenting the project to these federal funding program interviewers?

What question could they possibly ask? Being stated that they'll play the part of an investor/bank for this matter. 

PD 
I ask reddit cause I love it's diversity; 
More minds, more points of view.

TLDR me and a bunch of students have developed a project, seems ok, gonna run for a government funding, How can i sell it?

personalfinance,Should I take a loan out on my tsp to pay my credit card debt? What are the pros and cons to this?,"Im 24 and make 45k a year. Im 4k in debt. So I get a tsp that matches 5% I put in it. I have had it for a year and never looked at it. I finally switched it out to the stocks instead of the G fund which made pretty much no money. I have 7k in my tsp. I was thinking about taking 3500 out and paying all my debt which have interest rates averaging about 15%

What are the real disadvantages from this? If im reading this right I take out a loan and pay myself interest. Not only would it cost me less in interest but I pay myself back. Am I missing something?",finance,1474271181
personalfinance,Betterment - A never before asked question (I think!),"First post after a few months of lurking around this board.

My husband and I are saving for our second (and hopefully forever) home.  We plan to invest about $50,000 now and add $80,000 per year over the next 4-5 years.  

I am considering Betterment, and I have read all of the threads in this sub-reddit with the great feedback given on the platform.  My understanding is that the main reason people have given for not using Betterment is that you can achieve the same result by picking a few ETFs and managing it yourself, without paying Betterment's .15% to .35% fee.

I work for a law firm that does work for something like 70-80% of fortune 500 companies (and the equivalent on every major international exchange).  Accordingly, we have a stringent insider trading policy.  Under that policy, if I were to manage my own investments I would need to ask permission from the firm every time I want to make any kind of trade.  This is annoying, time consuming, and given the breadth of our client base means I could in many cases be blocked from trading.  It applies even to trades of index funds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc., as long as you're managing the trades yourself.  

To get around this, the firm allows you to trade if you use a discretionary trading arrangements where you give high level guidance as to how you want your money invested, but the person/entity doing the investing has full discretion as to what investments to pick.  As a practical matter, this means that most of my colleagues use a financial advisor.

I've checked with our conflicts department and they said that Betterment is fine because you don't have any ability to choose which ETFs are part of your portfolio.  In light of the fact that managing my own investments isn't an option, am I better off using something like Betterment and paying their lower fees over using a financial advisor?  We are also in the 39.6% federal income tax bracket, so stand to save some real money with the tax loss harvesting if it works as well as it claims.",finance,1474271694

investing,Should the Fed raise rates?,"I've been debating with several people about the speculative rate hike coming up in September. My opinion, as of the latest economic data coming from China and other countries such as Japan, the Fed should postpone the decision till the beginning of 2017. My arguments are simple and straight forward. Increasing the rate right now will increase the value of the dollar. that will hurt at first our exports which is already in a deficit.(I am aware that if will never be a net or surplus) The recent devaluation of the Yuan is creating a dilemma among the american producers. The devaluation purely means cheaper labor and cheaper product. In today's age the average American is seeking for the most at of his buck, therefore retail companies such as Ross, Tj Max and Marshalls have been showing steady growth so far in areas where Macys has been struggling. To my point, this will lead to a shift of production to China as an example.(I am aware that most of it is already outside the US) Unemployment can take a hit as prices of goods coming from China will drop. Producers in the US will not be able to compete with the low prices, forcing them to lay off their employees. This topic also touches the GDP. Lower prices means lower GDP. The only place where increase in rates can actually be beneficial in the real estate market. Prices might start going down, the foreign investment will drop and making it harder for Chinese investors to invest their cash here.",finance,1474288271
personalfinance,My dad suggested that we amend our taxes to say I paid my own student loans with a personal gift from them.,"I am 26 and from Ohio. My parents in Florida have been wonderful enough to be paying for my student loans ever since I graduated. I even always noticed skipping over the section on my federal taxes asking if I paid money on student loans this year. I personally didn't, so I said no. My dad mentioned that he does not use the tax credit on that because you can only use so much and has other things that take him to the limit before using that. (At least I think this is what he was saying) A while back he suggested I amend my taxes for the past 4, or however many years you can still change them, to say that I paid my student loans myself. This way I could collect the return on them since they cannot and have not. He said since they don't really give me any significant money this could count as a personal gift which would be legal, and actually true for the most part, and that I could potentially get some money back for this. The money was never actually in my bank account, and I am not sure exactly how much it has been over the years, but I can guess it was quite a bit.

personalfinance,Should I take a loan from our 401k? and other questions... I am very bad at this.,"Hello!

So, my husband and I have been admittedly very bad at managing our money. We bought a house two years ago, a week before we had our first baby. We had been using the money we had from the sell of a previous house to help with expenses so I didn't have to work and could stay with the kiddo. Through a series of home improvement issues and expenses, we are quite thoroughly in the hole, but I determined to get us out of this.

So here's the scoop:

Income: **$1617 bi weekly salary**

I am employed very part time- I work for 6 weeks at a time a few time a year (as a swim instructor). My next session is in October, I'll make about $2000 or $3000, which I'll likely throw at some of our debt


Our monthly bills, not including food and gas or credit card bills, total about $1986:

Mortgage: **$1483**

energy: **$160**

trash:**$30**

Home/Auto insurance: **$142**

Phones: **$27**

Internet: **$24**

milk: **$35**


Now here's the part I hate:

Capital one- this is the credit card we use for just about everything. Last month was the first time I wasn't able to pay off the balance in full. We had had a wedding, three birthday parties, and who knows what else. Spending got out of control.

**Current balance is $7442.** Next payment due is $5747 (due tomorrow). Interest is something like 19%. The interest charge last month was $66 when I only paid part of the balance.

We have $1600 in the bank right now, and about $1000 cash I need to deposit. 

I have another credit card that I had used to consolidate some of our previous debt. I did a balance transfer, had 0% interest, but that is **sitting at $3993**. Currently it is 0% interest but that's only through January next year.

I also have a credit line with Home Depot-We got new windows in our house last year. Have about **$3000 left to pay**, am on autopay to pay $300 per month. 0% interest.

We also just had air conditioning installed earlier this year. We have **$2250 left to pay**, are on a payment plan paying $250 per month, 0% interest. 


So, obviously I need to to get another job, and will be working on that. We have a toddler and live in an area where paying for childcare while working basically makes it not worthwhile to work.

My husband does have a 401k that we can take a loan out of. We actually have two loans out on it apparently. One has a balance of $364 and is resulting in a $33.54 deduction from each paycheck. The other has a balance of $503.79 with a $17.82 deduction from each check.

401k balance is $23,466. We could take out a loan of up to $11,299.

There is a 4.5% interest rate, but it says the interest is paid back into the 401k.  There is a $50 fee for taking out a loan.

So I guess my question is- should I take out a loan on our 401k? If so- what should I pay off first? I kind of want to pay off either the AC bill ($2250) or the windows ($3000) because they add up to and extra $500 in bills every month. But logic tells me I should pay off the two credit cards and pay off one of the other bills when I get my money from my next swim session. My husband will also be getting a pay increase and bonuses at the end of the year, and of course tax returns, that should help us get all the debt in check. I just don't want to get so far in a hole waiting for that. Nor do I want to depend on that. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. I have never been great at finances but I really want to try.

Thank you!!


edit to add: I am 30. 

also- it should be noted that my current job as and ISR instructor actually has the potential to be quite profitable. The problem, and reason I was only working six weeks at a time, is that I could not find a pool locally that would allow me to teach(so I had been doing 6 week sessions in other cities). I have finally found a local pool and am doing a ""test session"" in October. If everything goes well, then I will be able to work more consistently starting next spring. It's a highly specialized position that brings in about $500 per week before taxes, working only 1 hour a day. I will also have the option of working 2 or 3 hours per day once I get a client base established.",finance,1474295698

personalfinance,31y/o dealing with debt and upcoming life changes. Need advice.,"First post here on Reddit, joined to post this since the community seems helpful.

I currently live with my fiance in a townhouse that we are renting. I'm 31 and she is 32. I work in sales and make $52k ($25/hr) with on target earnings of $52k on top of that in commission (so $104k total potentially). I have had this job for 1 year. My fiance makes 56k ($27/hr) and has had her job for 6 months. 

I had a career change last year and was out of work for about 5-6 months. In that time, we accrued about $50k in credit card debt. 

We are getting married early next year and are planning on having a kid soon after.

We just moved to where we live now, back in May and we pay $1,600/month under a 1 year contract. In car leases, utilities, groceries, gas, and other monthly bills, we pay about $2,000 on top of the rent. We would like to buy a house asap. Personally, I would like to get one before having a child. 

I need advice in terms of a realistic timeline. Paying this debt off is difficult with the interest adding up every month. We made use of a few balance transfer offers but those promotions don't last forever. Here's the breakdown of our credit cards:

Card 1: $15k balance (19k limit), 11.9% interest  
Card 2: $22k balance (25k limit), 3.9% interest (balance transfer promo rate to expire 10/2017)  
Card 3: $5k (10k limit), 19.9% interest  
Card 4: $9k, 0% interest (balance transfer promo rate will expire 1/2017)  
Card 5: $2k balance (15k limit), 16.9% interest (will be adding upcoming wedding expenses to this card for about $8k additional)  
Fiance's personal loan: $3k

According to Discover, my credit score is 731 and my fiance's score is about the same. I understand my debt to income ratio is an issue, as is my credit utilization. Please note that the cards above are a mix of both mine and my fiance's. 

At this point, we are paying bills and using what we have left to pay towards credit cards. It doesn't seem to be moving much due to wedding expenses. 

Essentially, I'm looking for options to lower my interest rates (personal loan?) and to get some advice on how likely it'd be possible to apply for a mortgage for a house and when would be a good time. Also, I know things change financially after marriage, so I'd like to know if I (or my fiance) should act before or after getting married. 

Thank you!

EDIT: I should clarify on the debt aspect, Prior to moving, we lived in an apartment that was $3k/m that we were locked into until April 2016. I had my own business at the time. Unfortunately, I was caught up in the middle of a lawsuit. While it was never taken to court and I received no legal punishment, I still had to pay a lawyer and this severely affected my business. As a result, my business came to an end in May 2015 after 5 years. Long story short, these things combined lead up to the debt we have now.

That being said, we are good about our spending. Family birthdays, dinners, celebrations, weddings, gifts, etc. we cannot control obviously but that's pretty much what we spend money on other than bills, gas, and groceries.",finance,1474300186

economy,"[Question] PBOC stepped in to boost Hibor, shoring up the yuan - why?","Preliminary apologies for any mistakes - I'm a maths undergrad with an interest in markets.

I was reading [this article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-19/yuan-interbank-rate-surges-in-hong-kong-in-sign-of-intervention) and here is my summary as far as I understand it:

The PBoC encouraged the selling of specific yuan-based derivatives and increased charges on yuan forex. This had the effect of massively boosting Hibor, the rate at which Hong Kong lenders charge overseas borrowers for the yuan.

Their key motives for doing this are:

1. China would prefer that the yuan is strong before the Fed meet later this week, since the chance of a hike is higher due to positive US core inflation data.
2. China would prefer that the yuan is strong when it is added to the basket of IMF reserve currencies later this month.

My question is, in points 1 &amp; 2 above, why do China want a strong currency? Won't including it in the IMF reserve give it a greater overseas demand since it can be used for IMF-related matters, strengthening it? If the rate is hiked then it becomes more expensive to borrow the dollar mainly, so China does not want the yuan to become a cheap alternative? Does increasing Hibor strengthen the yuan by making it more expensive on a global relative scale? Any explanations would be very much appreciated!",finance,1474302405

I do firmly believe that the FED will raise rates eventually. Whether they do it now, 1 week before elections (lol good luck with that) or 1 month after elections - we saw the outcome of the last 0,25% raise. I predict a similar outcome for this one - high volatility, shortlived selloff with a rally afterwards (simply because there are currently no alternatives to stocks). 

Add to that the US elections with Trump actually being a real possibility now - I don't even know how markets are going to react.

All this uncertainty with little visible upside (the current bull market post-Brexit is on very shaky legs - low volume, low volatility). It seems like the big boys are sitting this one out too with hedge funds cash ratio at record highs. 

For me, sitting this one out is the better option - I just don't feel very confident in the market right now with too many uncertainties ahead. 
I would actually buy Nov/Dec puts on SPY if I had the balls.

personalfinance,PF - Talk me off the ledge with this Auto Lease,"So my coworker just leased a 2016 Fiat 500e.  The all electric version of the little Fiat car.  With the current incentives between the Dealership and the State of California the lease ends up being $53 a month with tax.  http://www.ocfiat.com/

A down payment of $2500 is required, but that is returned to the individual via a CA state tax credit.  This credit even applies to leases, not just purchase like the Federal tax credit does.  

I currently live within walking distance to work and have spent the last 9 months living without a car.  I'm not crazy about purchasing one, but would like the convenience of having something to drive on the weekends and to run errands around town.  

Office could be moving next year so depending on if and where that move takes place, I might be moving as well.  Annual mileage limit is 10k. I would continue to walk to work even with the car so the majority of my miles would be driven on the weekends.  Lease would run 3 years. 

My apartments were built last year so they offer electric vehicle charging stations free of charge, though I suspect that would change in the future.  I even saw a Fiat charging on my way to work this morning. There are pay for charging stations across the street from my office. 

I'm not crazy about the Fiat, but would like something economical. A little 'puddle jumper' as I would like to call it.  The used market seems to be relatively inflated around here and I can't seem to see the used car deals so often discussed on this sub.  

Is a Fiat relatively unsafe? Consumer Reports doesn't rate it very highly.  Is this something to consider in the event of an accident? 

There's clearly a reason these cars are being offered so cheap. Part of that is end of the year clearance, part of that is government tax incentive and maybe another part of it is a less desirable car compared to the competition perhaps.  What else am I missing?

Leasing this car is cheaper than home internet service.  I have to be missing something.  Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

personalfinance,"I have a crushing $115k in private student loans, and have exhausted countless resources. What options are reasonably available to me?","Hello all-

Excuse me if I'm in formatting this poorly. I'll try to be brief and answer questions if I leave out crucial information. I'm using a throwaway for this post. 

I must preface this by saying, at no point in the process did I seriously discuss with anyone the repercussions of the loans being taken out, or what they would look like upon graduation. I had a grossly skewed idea of how much these would amount to and what I'd owe, and it is my fault entirely for allowing myself to be in this situation. In reality I thought it was worth it and that it would not be nearly as bad as it is now. 

I graduated from a four-year liberal arts school in 2015 (I am now 23) that provided some financial aid as grants, and left the rest up to us. It was considered ""need-based,"" so no negotiation there. The remainder I took out in private student loans.

At this time the total of all my loans is about $115k, which includes subsidized and unsubsidized government loans. All are on ten year terms with varying interest rates from about 9-11%. The private loans only are about $84k. I have applied to countless refinance companies but consistently am denied. I make about $38k in my current full-time position. 

Unfortunately my parents owe a HUGE amount of money so they do not qualify as good cosigners even though they have better than average credit. The same is true of much of my family. We have been denied by every single bank, credit union, and online company we've reached out to. 

My monthly loan payment is about $1300, which is destructive and near impossible to pay. I live at home and the only other major payment I make is on a car, which I would have not taken out had I known the loan payments would be this high out of college. I do not currently pay for housing, large cell phone bills, utilities, etc. 

At best I'm barely getting by, at worst this is unsustainable and impossible for me to save anything. My financial situation has not improved at all since last year. Realistic options I'm aware of:

- Get a higher paying job
- Get a second job

Short of that, what else is available? Do I have any recourse?

At this point I am just seeing what options I have to relieve the payments and get my financial life back on track. One entire paycheck per month plus part of the other is instantly gone to student loans. I may just be SOL, but do I have any options at all here? Who should I reach out to? What can I do?

So sorry now if I mess something up. Anyway I'll make my story short. I bought a house ten years ago with Someone I was suppose to spend the rest of my life with. Let's call him Shameless. We didn't end up getting married and I moved out less than two years later (together for about 6 years). Let him keep the house and he was suppose to take me off the mortgage. Simple easy break up. He got some paper work together to start the process of removing my name. We were getting along so well... so I thought. Signed the papers and waited. I was so stupid. The papers were what they call a quick deed release.. he took me off the deed. And that was it. I'm still on the mortgage.. Fast forward 8 years. I'm married now (to someone else obviously) and bought another house. I'm not on the mortgage because it would make us have a higher interest rate. Because my credit is crap since shameless doesn't make payments on time. Rewind a bit. He is married now and we offered to help him with paper work and money to refinance. Said he would do it. It has been months since we tried to get him to talk and work this out. No luck. Then I find out yesterday that he has a Lien on his mortgage for not paying his water bill for three years. His excuse was they never sent him a bill.. seriously!!!
Ok so my question is. Can I file bankruptcy to get me off his mortgage? I know it will ruin me for seven years and what not. But at this point I'm never getting off this mortgage anyway. I'm not willing now to give him thousands of dollars. He has bought motorcycles and brand new cars and four wheelers. So he has no intention of refinancing to help me out. It does him no good.

Counting Interest I am totaling in at about 37K all said and done right now. While I know I should tackle the 6.80% guys first, my biggest question is which one? My current plan is to make the minimum payment for each loan individually (~$380/mo in total by the 10yr payment plan) and then pay aggressively on one of the individual 6.80% loans until those are all gone.

But do I:  

 - Pay off the 2010 first or the 2012?
 - Or should I tackle the the 2011 one since it's principle is about $1,000 less?
 - I figured I would pay off the Principle directly and tackle the Interest at the end. Bad/Good idea?

Basically I'm trying to figure out the best approach as in the next 2-3 years I see my life turning to that point of buying a Starter home and getting the ring and all that. While it will be a bit of a stretch, my general plan was to pay (~$500/mo) towards getting these gone, and attempt to be debt-free in 5-ish years when I'm 30.

1. Look for a new job
2. Sell my house, attempt to find something that won't add too much to my financial burden and hope the difference in time available/travel/etc at least helps me break even. 
3. Get an equity loan, consolidate as my student loan rates would likely be lower as well as finish my unfinished basement and get a roommate.
4. Sell my vehicle and (???) for transportation.

1. I have **a LOT** of growth potential here and the over all work-life balance is fantastic. I've only been here for a short while and I'd rather not go back into the job hunt.  I also don't know if I would end up finding more than at most 10k more a year over my current salary and I'll be making close to that by the end of the year, plus my current benefits are outstanding and possibly worth staying in and of themselves now that I have my son full time.

2. I live in Colorado, and while I have seen an outstanding increase in my homes value, moving closer to my son's school, while convenient, looks near impossible to do the way the housing market currently is. 

3. I hate roommates and I currently live in a not-so-good area with very sub-par schools. This is, however the most likely option.

4. I need a car right now, no way around it, this is my dream car and I dun wanna.  I will if I have to but it feels more like a band-aid than a solution.

I have three Parent PLUS loans that my S/O and I are interested are trying to pay off relatively quickly – for no reason other than that we don't want to have to deal with them anymore in my parent's sake. The three loans are as follows:

* $5138 at 6.84%
* $11613 at 7.21%
* $3609.32 at 6.41%


So here's the scoop – I have about $6k in savings that I could comfortably use to pay off some combination of these loans. My S/O also has $9k in a trust fund that she's willing to chip in, just because she wants to see them gone too. The question remains: what's the best order to pay these off?

I imagine you'll say that the highest amount *or* the highest interest rate should be paid off first. Those are conveniently the same loan. 

We think the best course of action is to use her $9k and $2.5k of my savings to pay off the $11k loan right away, then I'll use my remaining savings to pay off the $3.6k loan as well. I could probably recoup my savings and pay off the $5k loan by the end of October.

Does that seem like the best course of action?

personalfinance,"In a ""decent"" spot financially but wanting to improve.","Hello all,

This is my first post on Personal Finance and I am wanting some observations/insight on my current financial situation and how/what to improve. I'm sorry if this gets too lengthy: 

**Background:** 

I'm 25, married (for three years), with a two year old. 2016 has been a massive year of change for my family. I have nearly doubled my income this past year with a new job in the financial sector. My base salary is $72,000 a year and my wife is a stay at home mom but does some tailoring/alterations contract work for $8,000-$10,000 a year. We have $37,000 invested in mutual funds at the moment and about $5,000 in a regular savings for emergency expenses. 

Up until 2016, we had zero debt. We bought our first house this year and were able to put 20% down on a $218,000 house. We had very little credit exposure (read: no credit cards/auto loans) and had a really hard time finding a mortgage. We eventually found a lender that qualified us for a 10/1 ARM. My new job also required that I drive a fair amount and visit clients in the rural northwest. I had an old truck that was a maintenance dump so I decided to buy a newer, used vehicle which I got for a good price and under blue book but I ended up taking out a $16,000 auto loan to buy the truck since we had dumped our cash into the house down payment (due to having no credit score, the lowest auto loan interest rate I could get at the time was 6.99%).  
           
I dropped out of college when I got married so that I could work full time and I was never able to finish my bachelors. My employer recently encouraged me to start working on my bachelors in Business Management so that I'm more eligible to ""climb the corporate ladder"" so to speak. I started attending an online school for $3,000 a semester (which amounts to $1,500 if I take my company's tuition reimbursement award).

**Advice/Concerns:** 

**1.** My biggest problem has been basic budgeting. My wife and I both went through a Dave Ramsey class and, while we learned a lot, we have struggled with actual implementation of a budget. Every time we have re-done our budget, something changes and each month looks different from the last. We both get frustrated and burnt out on the budget and it ends up in oblivion... What can I do to change this? I feel like our budgets get way too detailed and thus are much harder to follow. Is there a simpler method?

**2.** My vehicle is one of the poorest financial decisions I've made. I've contemplated selling it just to not have an auto loan... But it's been great having a nicer, reliable vehicle for transporting clients. I don't think I will feel as guilty once I can refinance it into a lower interest rate. But still, it feels like it was an emotional purchase. 

**3.** I'm concerned about my 10/1 ARM. The 10 year lock is a great rate and we are planning on only keeping the house for a few years (hopefully no longer than 5). But, life happens, and I don't want to get caught in a bad situation if the market goes south. Should I look at refinancing it into a conventional mortgage once I have an established credit? 

**4.** I'm really dreading paying tuition again. I know it's important to have a bachelor's in today's world but it's just a lot of money and I want to make sure I'm paying it off wisely. I am using FASFA for my first Semester to utilize the 0% financing while I'm in school and to give me a bit more flexibility as I figure out how to budget around the new tuition. Should I continue applying for FASFA or should I just budget conservatively and pay my tuition in full each semester?

Thanks in advance for your input/advice! Sorry, again, for the dissertation. I look forward to hearing what y'all have to say. Let me know if I need to clarify anything. 

Tl;dr: Doubled my salary but have also tacked on a lot of additional debts this year and am going to be finishing my degree. I want to be in a better place financially but my wife and I struggle with budgeting. I also want to finish my degree as cheaply and efficiently as possible without getting buried in student debt.",finance,1474322753

personalfinance,Seeking advice on pension plan lump-sum offer,"A defined benefit pension plan from an old job is offering me a buy-out. I’m seeking advice on whether to take it. Here are the facts:

* I am 35 years old, as is my wife. We are both reasonably healthy with no known major medical issues nor family history of major illnesses. I feel like our kids are trying to kill us but that's a different matter. 
* I left this company over 5 years ago and worked there long enough to be vested in their pension plan. 
* Although I have no plans to return to this company, if I do I cannot reenter the pension plan—I would have to enter their “enhanced” 401(k) instead like any other new hire.
* Combined income between my wife and I is about $200k. Our retirement savings not including this pension sits at about $340k. 
* We live in a pretty expensive part of the U.S. and own our house, with a sizable but manageable mortgage. We are saving for our kids' college and have a smaller cash reserve (emergency fund) than I'd like. 


I have essentially three options for this buyout offer:


1. Take a lump sum payment right now of $32,298.17, transferring the money into appropriate tax-deferred accounts to avoid a tax hit (I have a Vanguard Traditional IRA, a Vanguard Roth IRA, and am in the U.S. Federal Government Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), so will move the money appropriately). I invest almost exclusively in index funds with 90/10 stocks to bonds with diversification as you'd probably expect. 

2. Begin taking monthly payments right now of $99.84, which will be taxable, and will transfer to my wife if I pre-decease her. Once we both croak, the payments stop. No cost of living adjustment to this payment, ever. 

3. Remain in the pension plan, and receive $998.38 per month starting when I turn 65 years old, which will be taxable and with no cost of living adjustment at any point. This payment will also transfer to my wife if I predecease her, but again cannot be passed on to anyone else (like our kids). For reasons I won't get into, I'm very confident this pension plan will be around and just fine (still solvent) when I turn 65.


There are actually other options within #2 above, including the “Single Life Annuity” option whereby my wife gets nothing if I die first. But I’m reasonably confident I won’t choose that one because my wife would kill me (but if the money stops, would she…..?).

There is also the unknown and highly uncertain option of choosing #3 now and potentially getting another, perhaps sweeter, buy-out option at some point in the future. But I'm not sure I can count on that. 

There was other data and information that came with the buy-out offer that I can provide if its needed, but I think this is the basic information required to form a judgment. If you absolutely need more information on the offer or our financial situation, ask me and I'll see if I want to post it. 

So—what do you all think? I like figures, charts, tables, etc., so hit me with whatever you got.",finance,1474332045

I was looking through, and three of the loans totaling nearly $60,000 are at 11-12% interest rate.  There are several loans in the 8-10% interest rate, and about $20,000 in the 3-6.5% interest rate range.

She has a decent paying job (~65k/yr) and most of her income goes directly to the loans.  Her credit score is good (~740) which is quite an increase since she initially incurred the debt.
She has about 18 different loans, most in the 2-4,000 dollar range and fairly low interest, and then three big loans for 17k, 22k and 28k at the 11-12% interest rates.
I'm looking for a way for her to refinance the high interest loans into better rates.  Additionally, 67k of the loans are in a Navient consolidated loan so when she pays, it's equally distributed across all of the loans instead of being able to specifically pay more into the high interest rates and minimums into the low rates.

Need advice on where to start.,"I skimmed thru ""student loans"" in this sub to see if this subject was recently breached, but I didn't find anything similar to my questions, so I apologize if this has been answered before!

Hi PF, I just graduated from college in August, but since I took a break in between a few semesters here and there, I have to start paying back my student loans in October. Right now, I work full-time for about $15.50/hr and I am a liquor promotional model making $25/hr as a contractor, typically for 9-12 hours a week. Collectively I make ~$3k a month, but actively looking for a better, post-grad day job.

My two student loans are a federal thru Navient for $4,500 at 6% interest and a private thru Sallie Mae (ugh) for $8,500 at 8%. I want to consolidate my loans into one monthly payment, but I want to make sure I go about it the right way. I know that if I refi thru a financial institution like a bank or a credit union, I lose student loan privileges such as forbearance. 

My question is, which kind of places can I look into for refinancing/consolidating my student loans without losing these privileges? I've hear of SoFi and casually looked into them, but not thoroughly. Not sure if this is relevant, but my credit score is 680 and my dad will help me cosign and he has an 830.

investing,Strategy for 5% net return on borrowed cash (HELOC) - Canadian,"I want to share this strategy for earning &gt;5% return on borrowed money.  Reference links for all numbers used in calculations are at the bottom of the post.
  
Obviously this is not suitable for everyone, but there is a broad range of people for which this will be applicable.  In the description and spreadsheet below I am making the following assumptions:
  
  
ASSUMPTIONS  
- You qualify for a low interest line of credit (HELOC for example)
- You are earning somewhere around $100,000, resulting in marginal tax rate of 44%
- You have room in your TFSA, and a TFSA account capable of holding an ETF
- You have room to contribute to your RRSP
  
  
DESCRIPTION  
The cash from the line of credit is invested in a high dividend ETF inside of a TFSA.  In the example below I have done this with $10,000.  I have chosen a Canadian banks ETF, as I feel this is a very stable investment, I am not interested in growth just yield.  The interest paid is the only expense for this scenario.  The interest paid on the line of credit is tax deductible, this is our first ""income"" source.  The dividend is our second income source.  Finally, the dividend is paid monthly and reinvested in an RRSP, resulting in a second tax break, providing our third income source.
  
  
RISKS  
- Credit risk, depending on personal situation
- Equity risk, underlying value of Canadian banks stock could drop
  
  
BENEFITS  
- Process can be automated
- Essentially zero cash required
- Low risk liquid investment that leverages value of home
- Potential for growth, increasing effective return
  
  
NUMBERS  
Line of Credit Value	$10,000  
LOC interest rate	3.50%  	
Yearly LOC cost	-$350  
Tax return on LOC cost (44% Marginal Tax)	$154  
TFSA return on dividend ETF (ZWB ETF, 5.3%)	$530  
Tax return from RRSP invested dividend	$233  
NET	$567  
NET Return	5.67%

I was told to come here to see if anyone would be interested in joining a competition to find the coolest/most unique gaming setups. It's free for anyone, you don't have to subscribe to my channel if want to make a video of your gear.

**Here's the guidelines:**

Make a video showing off your setup (you don't have to specify your details b/c I'm not going to be judging based on how powerful/expensive your rig is, but feel free to for everyone else watching!)

Must be a brand new video

Once it's uploaded onto your channel send me the link either through Twitter or my channel; preferably Twitter.

Contest will last from today (Sep. 19) to next Monday (Sep. 26).

**UPDATE**

I understand there's been some confusion and what exactly I'm looking for in the submissions. If anyone is having any kind of confusion, please let me know and I'll try to help as much as I can.

B/c I'm a small channel, I don't want to get too nit-picky on the submission guidelines and/or ask for too much, such as song remixes or amazing intros. Maybe I'll do that in another contest if this one goes well.

For now, all I want is a video of you showing me your gear/setup. There needs to be good lighting so I can see clearly and good audio so I can understand you. I really enjoy fancy lighting, unique monitor positions, and the PC itself, whether it's super buffed out or it's hipster where instead of a tower you have your specs working in a mini-fridge. Basically, anything that's different from your basic setup! You can be really silly about it and go crazy, that'll probably give you points.

Hopefully that helps clear any confusion but please message me on any media if you need more!

**P.S.**

I hope this doesn't break any rules on self-promotion and such, I'm just looking for more people who would be interested in a setup competition.",technology,1474350330

At 32, after years of throwing everything at our law school student loans (many grad plus loans at 8.5% interests – gross), we’ve paid them off and are now reassessing our finances to make sure everything is on the right track.  We have a one year old and are thinking about trying for another, and want to make sure we’re in good shape for them and for ourselves down the line.
Any honest critique/advice regarding where we are at is greatly appreciated. I'll try to give a brief breakdown of my financial picture:

**Personal situation:** Both 32 years old, married since 2009.  One son born in August 2015

**Income:** - $315k/year, with an annual bonus that has ranged from $40k-$100k since 2010.  Husband is a stay at home dad.  Take home pay is a little over $13000/month after taxes, health insurance, life insurance, and 401k payment are taken out.

**Assets/Investments:**

* Single-family home with market value of approx. $920k with a $770k mortgage 
* $50,000 in savings/emergency fund
* $60,000 recently moved into an investment fund
* $152k in my 401(k) (no employer match, but I have put in the federal max since graduating from law school in 2008).  
* Husband doesn’t have a retirement account.  When he worked he was an independent contractor, and our combined salary has always been too high to get any of the tax benefits from an IRA.
* Just put $5,000 into a 529 plan for our son
* I have $975k in life insurance through work (double if I die at the office – yay!).  Husband does not have life insurance, but has ideas for several “accidents” that I could suffer at the office.

**Other Assets:**

* Vehicle 1: 2009 Mazda 6 paid off
* Vehicle 2: 2015 Mazda CX-5 paid off

**Liabilities:**

* No school loans, credit card debt, or other debt.  (In 2009 we started out with $280k in student loan debt at an average weighted interest rate of about 6%, which we paid off last year.) We have 5 credit cards, but only use one regularly and pay it off every month.
* Mortgage + property taxes + insurance = $4200/month (mortgage is comprised of approx. $610,000 mortgage at 4.375% and a $130,000 HELOC at 4%)
* We put an additional $1800/month into the mortgage above the payment owed (though I’ve been wondering whether we are better off investing this instead)

**Other monthly expenses:**

* Car insurance and gas: $270
* Cable/internet: $250 (I know we could get cheaper packages, but we splurge here)
* Gas/electric/water: $250
* Cell phones: $150
* Groceries and household necessities (incl. diapers, formula): $1600
* Entertainment and travel fund: $2000
* We put 2500/month in savings + my entire bonus ($25-65k after taxes).  We plan to put $5-10k of my bonus into my son’s 529 each year and the rest into investments.

**Other Notes:**

* We bought our house in mid-2014.  We live in one of the most expensive parts of the country.  House is a renovated 1950s smaller 4 bedroom/3 bath home on a small lot (really it’s an 1800 sq foot 3 bedroom with an office).  Ideally we’d like to upsize to a larger house in the next 5-7 years, especially if we have another kid.  Probably something in the $1.5-$1.8 million range.
* Within the next year we’ll need to start paying for preschool for our son, which will cost around $14,000/year

What do you think?  Should we be making any changes? In particular:

* If we put everything in our investment account towards a more expensive house in 5-6 years, does this screw us for retirement?  After buying the house we intend for all annual savings to go towards retirement/wealth growth, and when we retire we plan to downsize to a smaller house and cheaper area and use any remaining equity as retirement funds.  
* Are we better off continuing to overpay our mortgage, or should I pay the minimum and add an additional $1800/month to our investments?",finance,1474363907

Navient/Sallie Mae has twice now increased my interest rates by .5%, which is fucking crazy ($800 a month is interest is already enough to make a man cry).  I keep seeing ads about sites that refinance/transfer debts for much lower prices than I currently have, and I'm really skeptical, but I figure if there's anyone out there that qualifies, it'd be me.  I've already paid off 19k in 9 months, but I know it'd still save me quite a bit to lower these interest rates. Are there banks/companies that will do this?

personalfinance,Student loan consolidation vs. refinancing,"I currently have four direct loans totaling $28000 (individually in the area of $6500-$7400 each) that I've been paying for a little over a year with a ten year term through Fed Loan Servicing.

Currently that's manageable, but I'm going to be moving soon and I anticipate my rent and related expenses to go up about $250, so I'd like a little more flexibility and hopefully a lower interest rate. It looks like consolidating through Fed Loan Servicing would bring me to about $201 a month with a fixed 6.125% rate.

My mother: 78 years old, good health, great FICO score. I noticed her mortgage statement several months ago. She owes $80k total on her home. She owes $50k on the mortgage at 6% and a little under $30k on a HELOC at 4.25%. 

We call up her mortgage holder and ask about a refi. Initially we wanted a cash out to combine the mortgage and the HELOC but the home only appraised at $82k and didn't satisfy the 20% LTV. So we scratched that idea and told the bank to refinance the mortgage portion only as she is and has been paying that ridiculous 6% interest rate. 

6 months later and FINALLY we get the closing information (after several months of the run around mind you. On a rudimentary 50k mortgage that the same bank holds the mortgage for.)

The real problem is that they are charging her closing costs and refuse to roll the costs in with the loan, like most banks would do.

This is US Bank I'm talking about here. I've been so upset with them and this process. 

Can't we demand that the closing costs be rolled in with the loan?",finance,1474382397

&gt; **Sessions**

Lots of formal verification sessions in the morning. The afternoon was more dev tools. I was excited about Truffle

**Smart contract security**

Showed the 1 line mistake that caused The DAO re-entry attack.
Pro tip: tag your untrusted accounts in the contract. e.g. Name the variable something like _untrusted_account
https://github.com/Consensys/smart-contract-best-practices
https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Safety

Prepare for failure. Be aware that unknown exploits can be found. Put in escape hatches / kill switches
Roll out carefully and test ""The strongest swords are forged by continuously putting them in the fire""
External calls to other contracts: Try to avoid calling untrusted contracts (one written by someone else). It only takes 1 mistake in an external contract to expose you. Either from a bug, or from your external contract then calling another malicious contract.
Use send(), avoid call.value()()
Handle errors in raw calls. Raw calls do not propogate exceptions.  e.g. if(!address.send())
An attacker could construct a call to max out the call stack, so that when your contract tries to make any calls they fail.
Favour PULL over PUSH for payments

**Visualising Security**

https://github.com/Raineorshine/solgraph
How can you spot smart contract vulnerabilities
Static analysis can help analyse the code without executing it (like checking for null, then using a variable anyway). Builds up an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) which can be explored.
Created solgraph to do this
Dynamic analysis is done by running unit tests (e.g. you can use the Ruby test runner from yesterday's presentation)

**Ethereum Security Overview**

Can try to manage risk by reducing the likelihood or impact.
Security concerns include things like wallets, gaming the system, denial of service

End users wallets isolation: Can reduce your impact by using a hot wallet with a small amount in it. Cold wallets to hold more of it securely
There are some hardware based wallets can help secure your wallets
Then frozen wallets to keep them offline.
Ethereum valut by @Arachnid. Multi sig wallets can help reduce the likelihood

Contracts: When calling another contract, if they use randomness WHERE do they source it from? Can it be gamed? Can anyone access it before you?
Sybil attacks (attacker using multiple identities) to game against you
Can anyone rage quit and lock up the contract by not interacting with it any more

DAPPS: 
Use HTTPS, BUT DO NOT USE CDNs
Someone could inject malicious JS that will modify your DAAP and redirect payments to another address.
Have an upgrade path (for both code and data).
Check invariants, use escape hatches / emergency breaks
Many potential contract vulnerabilities (see previous talks)
Favour PULL over PUSH for payments

**Formal verification for Solidity**

Writing code correctly is hard.  It is easy to test for desired behaviour (the happy path). Hard to check absence of undesired behaviour.
Formal verification can help find undesired behaviour.
The specifications are usually compiled down to why3 or f*
Showed a Why3 GUI that shows your code and highlights lines that are not passing (e.g. because a line doesn't satisfy the conditions that it can't integer overflow.

Microsoft released a research paper allowing the conversion of Solidity &amp; EVM code to f*.

**Parity's innovations**

Written in Rust (type safe. Memory safe).
Is modular, you can tweak it or use preset config files.  High transaction throughput. Low latency. Low footprint (suitable for IoT devices).
Unsafe APIs are disabled be default.
Advanced eafutures like state trie pruning (redued disk space) snapshotting, warp sync, private chains including PoA

Imandra Contracts: Formal Verification for Ethereum
Completely tuned out for this. It was very much like a sales pitch, just talking itself up.

**Ether.camp annual summary**

Released Ethereum Studio. Is available on Azure as an easily deployable Virtual Machine https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/templates/ethereum-studio-docker-standalone-ubuntu/
Will help you write unit tests. Spin it up, execute, tear down.
A partnership with Santander. Ethereum Cash. You can tie an Ethereum account to a bank account. More info at http://www.coindesk.com/santander-vies-become-first-bank-issue-digital-cash-blockchain/ 
Created a virtual accelerator hack.ether.camp

**Metamask - Bridging ethereum to browsers**

Ease of adoption is their core goal
User flow. You download, generate a vault (with a deterministic keyphrase).
Enter phone number, credit card details, and you can get Ether directly into your metamask account.
Done 33 releaes. 12k users.
Extension currently runs on chrome. Is ready to be pushed to opera, firefox &amp; Edge
RPC requests to a trusted node. Intercepts the RPC calls within the DAPP to redirect to Metamask
Feature Requests: Multiple account types (e.g. uPort, remote key stores), make the browser a light client

**Building the Light Client Ecosystem**

Quick sync (up to 0k headers/sec) 30 secs - 5mins for a full sync (dependant on CPU)
Low resource requirements (DB &lt;100mb, RAM &lt; 500mb)
RPC interface compatibile with full nodes. Mist already works with it
Because light clients rely on full nodes and put higher workload on them, there are some thoughts about having a basic throttled ""free"" service, and a paid priority system that will give more resources.
There are difficult future concerns around scalability. In a future sharded world, may need multiple full nodes to cover all the shards.
Future work: do complex operations on server side. Define a ""SuperCM"" that can answer any question about the chain. Generalised off chain computing for accessing data.

**Import Geth: Ethereum from Go and beyond**

Geth is one of the 3 origin clients. Evolved throughout the Ethereum prototyping. Needed to include everhtying to develop on top. Followed the Geth -&gt; Mist -&gt; Dapps architecture.
Using Geth as a library isn't a good option at the moment. has started to collect technical debt, from prototypes being rapidly iterated on.
Geth 1.5 is a concentrated effort to make Geth a library. Client side account management, Remote node APIs, native bindings to contracts, in-process ethereum client
Chain exploration, state querying and event subscription over IPC, HTTP or WebSocket.
Native contracts. Can generate a Ethereum ABI GO binding that GO code can use? Can create a solidity wrapper for go?
In process nodes lets you hose a node within your app. Saves you telling someone to ""please go and install an ethereum node"".
What about supporting this on iOS &amp; Android? Geth 1.3 already ran on mobile platforms. Released an embeddable library in Dec 2015, but is really a proof of concept. Mobile in-process nodes. Easier to call API locally now.

**Developing Scalable Decentralized Applications for Swarm &amp; Ethereum**

Web 2.0 has issues around scaling &amp; centralised control.
When moving to Web 3.0 we need a general purpose distributed backend (swarm/bzz). Said there MAY be interoperability with IPFS. They hope that it will share a lot of the underlying principals with IPFS. I HOPE this happens! Well leverage network effects from IPFS.
Logic being pushed to clients (logic in JS in browser, in native mobile 

Swarm high level API.
URL begins with the collection root hash (like IPFS)  bzz://&lt;crypto hash&gt;/imgs/example.jpg
Can do root hash registration to a friendly name (like IPFS's IPNS) bzz://some.friendly.name/imgs/example.jpg
Put static and dynamic data within swarm. Put global state changes onto the blockchain. Local client side only state changes can be stored locally (and optionally backed up to blockchain/swarm)
Execute logic locally, but verify it on chain.

Example Dapp Distributed photo album. Webapp resources &amp; data hosted in swarm. Current root hash of collections published to blockchain.
Optimised image, thumbnails, etc. are generated client side before uploading (just like facebook, etc. do)
Possibility to instead do delegated computation, put the files in swarm, get someone else to process it.

**Dapple Dev Workflow**

https://github.com/nexusdev/dapple
https://github.com/nexusdev/dappsys
Dapple looks like a critical thing to integrate into your development suite! If you are into devops, I definitely recommend watching this vid later to see how you could integrate testing flows.
http://Dapphub.io
EVM Dev Multitool for helping with Dapp developments. Has EVM extensions
Has a shared data model ""Dappfile"". Is a package/dapp descriptor format.
Shared global runtime environment blurs line between code packages &amp; deployed code objects.
Can chain fork, to help you when testing contracts.
Can find dependencies. Custom linker
Test harness to use a contract to test other contracts
Use the chain forking in your tests. Take live chain, fork, insert your test contract, fork before you call each test method.
Deploy: Wallet side scripting. Hijacks call and create, and redirects to side chains. So you can do some dry runs.

**Solidity for Dummies**

Solidity is a higher level language. Looks like Javascript, but with types. Shame they didn't just use TypeScript ;-) Maybe Solidity 2.0 can migrate to using TypeScript.
Solidity is compiled to EVM. Once it is in the EVM it is isloated.
Public functions are callable by anybody. That is your contract public surface area / exposed APIs.
Contract standards are beginning to emerge e.g. ERC20 interface for tokens. Having a standard for token meant that the community can do cool things, like etherscan.io that lets you look up tokens in the block chain, or EtherEx that is a decentralised token exchange.
Lots of IDEs &amp; tools you can use with solidity. Ethereum Studio, Visual Studio, Vim. Solgraph, truffle, dapple, embark.

Getting started guide https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ws9um/rethereum_rules_and_getting_started_guide/


**New and future features of Solidity**

Initial goals of solidity: statically typed. Easily readable. High level. Uses little gas.
What has happened in the last year? Build custom types. Internal library functions. Source mapping via AST, for solidity code to EVM, assists with debugging.
Future: Formal verification. Authenticated sources &amp; binaries via swarm. Templates. Functions as 1st class citizen. New notation for parallel / async programs

**How to create advanced Dapps using embark**

Compatible with any build pipeline
Supports contracts TDD using Javascript
Manages deployed contracts, deploys only when needed (and dependent contracts)
Manages different chanes (e.g. testnet, pribate net, livenet)
Support for both Solidity and Serpent
Contract instances, like inheritence.
Embark 2 goals. Facilitate communication between contracts. A cool dashboard, shows which contracts have been deployed, available services (geth whisper, IPFS)
EmbarkJS futures: promises and named parameters. Automatic type conversion. Communication abstraction, allows you to plug in supported providers like whisper, etc. Storage abstraction provider (swarm, etc.)

**Truffle Development Ecosystem and Future of Ethereum Development Tools** 

http://truffleframework.com/
https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle

Truffle is the most widely used Ethereum development framework. 17k+ downloads
In v1 Compiliation, deployment, bootstrapping, abstractions, unit testing, quick development. In v2 Network management, Migrations, Modularity, Documentation.
Going towards Truffle v3
Ethereumjs-testrpc allows instant mining, account creation, HD wallet support, deterministic. Allows you to fork from any available chain, for a new development chain (sounds like chain forking in Dapple). Take the live chain, fork it, then try developing against contracts in the live net on your dev fork.
Solidity unit testing
Npm integratoin ""npm install my-package"". Import sol contracts.
Webpack integration.
Ether-pudding allows you wo watch for events.
Futures: Solidity 0.4 support, better network management, more integrations, more boilerplate, more tutorials.

**ENS: Ethereum (Domain) Name System**

Why do we need ""yet another name service"". To allow you to name wallets, files, etc on top of Swarm &amp; IPFS.
Existing name servies are ironically centralised within a single place or contract.

What makes a good name service? Separation of concerns, distributed authority, forward compatibility, efficient on-chain resolution.
Components: Registrars, ENS Registry, Resolvers.
ENS Registry maps the name (hack.eth, nick.hack.eth) to the resolver
Resolver is a simple contract that lets you set the address for a name, look up names, etc.
Registrars, let people be in charge of a TLD (.eth) and then allow people to register under them (automatically through a smart contract).
Initially an auction based registration. Only names under .eth are available.

**Making Smart Contracts Smarter: Oyente**

https://github.com/ethereum/oyente
Smart contracts == one-shot programs. Self executed, cannot patch. Solidity is similar but not the same as Javascript.
Original contract code is not always available (but the new solidity feature of putting onto swarm may fix this).
Too many smart contracts to manually decompile EVM and check them all.
Oyente is a new analyzer for smart contracts. Use cymbolic executions. Detects all popular bugs TOD (transaction ordering dependence), Timestamp dependence, re-entrancy, mishandling exceptions.
TOD: Observed state != execution state. The state may change between when you submit a transaction and it is executed. Someone can watch transactions being submitted looking for a critical execution, could quickly snipe and enter your own transaction into the transaction pool as well with a higher fee to try and get yours executed before the other person.
Timestamps: Can be manipulated by miners.
Oyente Symbolic execution. Can build a tree of every branch and possible execution and run over it.
Can detect bugs, test generation, and go over all possible paths.

**Beyond the Bubble**

Overcoming education and adoption challenges for the Blockchain industry.
He is a technical evangelist for blockchain. Last month went and spoke to US gov to advise FBI, CIA, etc.
Wants to help grow the blockchain beyond just us very early adopters.
Fintech is rapidly developing blockchain solutions.
IoT, energy &amp; medical are looking towards adoption.
Longer term, governments &amp; non profits.

Why do normal people care?
Internet still functions off 1970s tech: Our data is sent in plaintext, leaked by companies, our identities are stolen by hackers, our behaviour is mined and monetized by advertisers.
People are beginning to understand the need to have same privacy and security guarantees online as they do offline.
Things should be encrypted by default. ""Own your own data""

**Infura. Ethereum &amp; IPFS infrastructure**

https://infura.io/
How do devs ensure that users have access to Ethereum &amp; IPFS. How to make it easier for users to jump in.
Didn't show anything. Just talked (only had 10 mins). There was a services called Ferryman that can talk to the IPFS/Ethereum network.
Apparently being used by Metamask, uport, regis, truffle.

**Testing Ethereum Consensus**

There are HEAPS of ethereum clients (Geth, Parity, etc). How can we ensure that they all come to the same consensus?
By using a suite of tests. State tests, Blockchain tests,
http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/ethereum-tests/

**CarbonVote: A Gauge for Human Consensus**

http://Carbonvote.com
""Machines serves human. Carbon over silicion. Consensus from community"". (use people to make a decision, not computers). Machine consensus is just a tool for human consensus.

**Sikorka – Ethereum meets the Outdoors**

A system that facilities deploying smart contracts in real world locations.
Enables smart contracts to interface with environment.
Provide ""proof of presence"" that a user is indeed in correct location.
Potential uses: loyalty programs offering discounts to people visiting specific locations.
Proving attendance in a location for official purposes e.g. administrative, corporate, AR games.
Proof or Presence: using mobile phones and software - geolocation data (can be spoofed) use a challenge question (e.g. what is the last word on a monument's plaque). Scannable QR codes, RFID tags, beacons.
Sikorka works  by deploying contracts that follow a specific interface. Interaction with contract only happens after PoP.

**Remix and Other Ethereum Development Tools**

https://github.com/ethereum/remix
smart contract debugging
Is a NPM module. Looks very early stage. Says it can be integrated into other tools like Dapple, truffle, ethereum studio, Visual Studio, etc.).

**Mango: Git Completely Decentralized**

https://Github.com/axic/mango
Git on Ethereum, IPFS &amp; Swarm
Harder to take down a central repo (e.g. Github)
Proof of existence for source coode. Ethereum is a decentralised system. Its source code should be available in a decentralised manner.
Using IPFS or Swarm, the files are chunked up and stored. So if you have a large file that only changes a few bytes, it can de-dupe and only store the chunks with differences.
Git is a merkle tree. IPFS/Swarm directly store as a merkle tree/dag
(There are some good talks by Juan Bennet from IPFS talking about how you can do this)

Naïve implementation, store everything in a contract on a blockchain, would cost 50M ether

Useful implementation, store objects in IPFS or Swarm to store the data off chain. Then map the IPFS identifies to git identifiers. Save those identifiers on the blockchain so you know what to look up.

Hook it up so that a git push updates the commit hash to contract, then pushes to IPFS. Reduces gas cost to 140,000 down from 5m
Every git repo has its own contract.
Future work could let you expose your git repo via ENS (Ethereum Name Service) e.g. solidity.ethereum.mango.eth
Future of Mango: store release notes within git. Store issues within git. Store pull requests. Create user friendly web frontends",cryptocurrency,1474385833
personalfinance,Would it be financially responsible to downgrade my vehicle(s)?,"Hoping for some advice on selling my car.  I was foolish and purchased a newer car back in February, after my previous car was totaled (and I got a good payout from insurance).  I purchased a 2014 Ford Escape and have a monthly payment of about $230.  I am thinking about selling this car so that I can get rid of or lower the monthly payment, but the Kelly Blue Book has it as being worth about as much as I have left on the loan.  I have some savings, but am hesitant to put it all towards a car, even though I could start putting my previous car payment into savings. 

Pretty much in the same boat with my husband's car ($270 monthly loan payment), being worth only what we have left to pay on the loan, possibly less than what's left due to a dented panel.  He's much less interested in trading down his vehicle.

Interest rates on both vehicles are less than 4%.

Also, I have a 1 year old with the likelihood of more children in the future, so safety and reliability are on my mind, as well as a larger size vehicle- preferring a SUV.

What would you do?  Should I overpay the monthly amount and just try and get rid of the loan quicker? How would trading down my vehicle, but not having a loan, affect my car insurance rates? Would I get more money by selling privately vs trading in, or would trading in help me to get a lower priced car without a down payment (not sure how trade-ins work...)?

Thanks for your advice!",finance,1474386094
personalfinance,Help me understand withholding allowances for federal tax overpayments,"My husband and I recently switched jobs. There was a glitch on our W-4s that went unnoticed for a few months where we both paid federal taxes at the single rate, which took significantly more taxes out of our paychecks than we were supposed to pay.

We're back down to married, but in September we've already hit the amount of federal taxes we're supposed to pay this year, so anything else coming out of our paychecks is money out of our pockets and loaned to the federal government.

Some google research leads me to believe that the right thing to do is to claim some withholding allowances that will reduce the tax that comes out of our paycheck, but I can't seem to figure out how these work, or whether claiming them will get us in trouble.

personalfinance,Student Loan Deferment/PSLF Conundrum!,"I started a new job that comes with 2 years of extra grad school classes, which automatically put my student loans into deferment. Which seemed great until I thought about it, and found out payments won't qualify towards PSLF.
I have about 80K in fed loans (about 30K subsidized, 50K unsub, 6.875% interest on both), and am about 4 years into the 10 year PSLF plan.
I can’t wrap my brain around the math between these two options:
1.	Undo deferment, continue accruing interest, but continue to make my $500 income based repayments for 2 more years of qualifying payments toward PSLF?
2.	Stay in deferment, continue making the same payments, saving 2 years of interest on 30K of loans, but be 2 further years away from PSLF?

We have about 50K in reserve and the reno is going to be about 200K.

The interest rate of this loan is going to be a little higher ~ 4% than a conventional mortgage but there is nothing that will keep us from refinancing in the future once the rates make it worthwhile, if that ever happens.

personalfinance,"In a tight spot, need advice (credit card debt)","Hello, Redditors!

Here's my situation - I'm trying to get out of $20k in debt, but my boyfriend has been laid off and without work for about eight months. I'm covering all of the expenses for two adults on $1600 a month, and about a third of my monthly income is going toward the minimum payments on my debts. Money is very, very tight, so much so that I actually make about $200 less a month than I need to in order to break even with bills. I've been pretty much limping from paycheck to paycheck, doing what I can to make sure things are paid on time and selling books and games for extra cash when I can. (I'm also decluttering right now, so that helps!)

As a result, we've been relying on one of my credit cards for gas and grocery money, doctor bills etc. I gave it to him to cover whatever he needs while I'm at work, since he has no income but still has bills. It's a new card (when Costco got rid of Amex they switched my balance to a Citi card) and I didn't actually get a statement for a few months. 

Well, I did get a statement, and found that we went over the credit limit by...a lot. My minimum payment to get it below the limit is $1200. At the same time, I also got audited by the IRS for a tax mistake two years ago and found I owe $900 in back taxes. I got the latter sorted out, other than a $120 admin fee the tax payment is $50 a month so that's not catastrophic as it could be. 

I don't know what to do about my Citi card and that ridiculous payment, though. Of course I intend to pay it back, I spent the money after all and it's my fault for not paying better attention. But... how am I supposed to come up with a thousand dollars out of nowhere? I can't, which leaves calling them and asking for patience and mercy. 

Which brings me to the actual question; what is the best way to phrase this to the creditor? I'm very introverted and not good at talking to people over the phone. I'd like to see if I can do minimum payments of $120 until I get the balance back within the credit limit - That's still more than I can afford, but it's an amount that seems fair to me. What do you guys think?

I can already hear you telling me to cut my spending and make bigger payments - I would love to but really can't, sorry. Our food and gas budget for two people is $50 a week, we don't drink soda, I make my coffee at home or get free at work, my internet is only $40 a month, we don't have TV service, my phone bill isn't going to get any cheaper until I pay off my phone, I take public transit because my job will reimburse part of the cost...and yes, I've already spoken to all of my creditors and asked for a better interest rate. Moving to a cheaper apartment is not really an option right now, either. I have $300 in my emergency fund, but I don't want to use that toward debt because I know it's only a matter of time before I come up short for rent.

Bonus question: Any ideas on how to make extra income when I'm already working full time? I would love to work overtime at my job, but it's only available when someone calls in sick. I'm really struggling to get my feet under me so I can fight this debt, and it's hard not to get discouraged. I know my SO is doing everything he can to find work and nagging him to do more will only hurt our relationship, which in my eyes means that *I* need to find ways to close that gap while we wait. Any ideas are greatly appreciated, I've gone over this in my head so often that I feel stuck in a loop, and I think some outside perspective would be helpful. Sorry for the novel!

Tl;dr: How to ask creditors for a smaller minimum payment when you've gone over your limit? And how to make extra income when I'm working full time?",finance,1474396344
personalfinance,How do you guys go about weighing the following: savings in interest payments vs. investment potential vs. monthly financial burden?,"I've been dickering around with my student loans today, and have arrived at the following set of results:

At current payment rate (cpr), total interest paid on my loans will end up being = $4103.14

1.5x cpr = $2452.62

2.0x cpr = $1756.73

2.5x cpr = $1371.96

3.0x cpr = $1127.75 

My current monthly payment is = $177.02/month

1.5x cpr = $265.53/month

2.0x cpr = $354.04/month

2.5x cpr = $442.55/month

3.0x cpr = $531.06/month

My current monthly expenses are about $1200 (including the monthly student loan payment of $177.02/month), while my monthly income is about $2000/month, leaving me with a surplus of roughly $800/month.

Given this situation, I could handle a tripling in my monthly payments, but that would leave me with $354.04 less ($531.06 - $177.02) per month, or a monthly surplus of $445.96 rather than $800/month.

The interest breakdown above also brings to mind the law of diminishing returns. Doubling my payments has a substantial effect, saving me $2346.41 in interest payments. Tripling them saves me $2975.39 total, which is obviously better, but is it worth shouldering a tripling in my monthly payments if all I'm saving is $628.98 compared to doubling them? 

Would it not be wiser to double the payments and try to invest what I would otherwise spend on the tripling of payments, hopefully making more than $628.98 in the process? 

I'm just struggling to figure out what is the wisest course of action here. Pay off the loans as fast as possible making the maximum payments that I'm capable of? Or stick with a set amount (say, doubling of monthly payments) and try to invest the rest of the money elsewhere?

I realize that the answer to this question might vary from person to person, but your input on how you would go about handling this situation would be much appreciated.

Thanks!

I pay more per month to my father in law but also will end up paying less over time and be done making payments by the time I'm 35-40.  I would be paying a bank less per month and our property tax and homeowners insurance would be included (which would be extremely nice), but be paying longer. Any advice?

Trading,I'm thinking about going long on NUGT... bad idea?,"Last time the fed announced it would not raise rates in July, NUGT bounced pretty high. I'm thinking about going long tomorrow if the news is positive right after the announcement. I'm somewhat of a newb, but I've made dozens of trades over the last few months in high volume, liquid, well known stocks and had some success. NUGT seems a little more exotic than your average stock and what I've been trading, so I'm a little nervous there might be something I'm missing. I obviously plan to manage my downside risk with the appropriate stop loss, it just seems like there's a high probability it will jump if the Fed news is positive. Should I sit on the sidelines before I attempt this trade? Is there anything I should watch out for with this type of security? 

The main things I see is there is a high spread and it's volitile, so you could have extra losses due to slippage. It seems like the type of trade where there is be a lot of upside, but at the same time, you're not going to get out of the trade cheap if it goes south.",finance,1474415081

If this is not the subreddit to be posting in for this situation, or if there is a better one, please let me know and I can post it there instead, thanks!

Hey guys, my name is David. I am an 18-year-old recent high school graduate. I hope that any one of you are able to help me, as any advice right now would probably save me.

I am at a loss for what to do with my life currently. I was working for the majority of this past summer, at a minimum wage job that was only temporary, for the summer season. Well, two Fridays ago, I completed my last day of work, and got my final paycheck, but now I can not find another job no matter where I search. I am upset with myself over not securing another position to be prepared, because I already knew when my job was going to end.

I am now homeless, as my mother is not letting me live with her if I am not paying rent. I got kicked out on Saturday. I am not enrolled in any college classes currently, as I did not want to have to deal with any debt too early in my life, since I'd have to pay all the costs myself. I also only have ideas of what work I'd like to do, but I am not ""100% dead set"" on anything yet. If I become confident in a field of study, I would love to enroll in a college or university. I'd like to be a teacher, especially at a high school; that'd be the career choice I'm most interested in currently.

Well, back to the point of this post. What do you all recommend me to do currently, in my situation? I am homeless, and I currently have with me just $60 in cash, a prepaid smartphone that still has a month of service left, my driver's license and SS card, two backpacks stuffed with basic toiletries, clothes, and a pair of boots (I have another pair which I usually wear, just some running shoes). I have been eating snacks from Dollar Tree, and fast food restaurant's value menus. I have been filling up a gallon of water each day and drinking that, since it's free. I have been sleeping in various secluded areas with no problems, and spending the daytime hours in fast food restaurants, coffee shops, and at the library. 

I am currently thinking my last and only opportunity is the military, and I am completely okay with making the decision of joining if needed. I prefer to join the branch that will get me started the fastest, from joining to actual basic training. From my research, this seems to be the Army or Marines. (?) I have almost no knowledge of the military to be honest, and I am very worried of what a recruiter would think if I told him my situation, so I'd prefer not to do that.  I am not even sure how to explain to him that I don't know why I want to enlist, I just do... as well as that I am living on the streets.

That is all I really have to say, I am going to try to reply to all of the comments, if I get any. Thank you again guys, I hope you can give me advice.",finance,1474416549

MachineLearning,How much of an indicator can machine learning provide in detecting good versus bad market conditions?,"I generally buy and sell weekly as stock prices fluctuate with volatility.

For example, it seems more likely that a market correction may occur (and it is bad to buy) when the S&amp;P 500 is pretty high, VIX is low, and the dollar is high.

Similarly, it seems less likely a market correction may occur (and it is good to buy) when indexes are not extremely high, the VIX is relatively higher, and the dollar is relatively lower.

Here is a compiled list of possible factors an algorithm could use as input:

* Fear/volatility index (VIX)
* GDP or GDP growth
* Current interest rate
* Current unemployment rate
* Current Federal funds interest rate
* Employee pay
* Housing market data
* Gold prices
* Dollar value

personalfinance,Damage Control after Manic Episode,"Hi All,

This is embarrassing, but my anxiety is going crazy and I figured I'd reach out for any advice. I recently had a very bad manic episode (Bipolar, Type II). I literally haven't had a serious episode since I was about 23 (30 now). I'll try to sum up what happened.

Started a job in 2015. Salary is good, about $4,000/mo after taxes. Moved into a nice apartment. Paid off my bar loan in a few months by making huge payments. Built up $7,000 in savings. Working on paying off my federal loans. Then I needed surgery in April of this year. It wiped out my savings completely. I don't know if this triggered the mania or if it was just a build up of a lot of different stresses, but for about a week in May, I bought all the things. I traded in and got a new car (which I actually did need a different car) and instead of getting something practical and used (which was the original plan), I got a $32,000 SUV and now have a $500/mo car payment. I also decided I was absolutely going to get fit and signed up for a $400/mo gym/training plan. Luckily it was only month to month (thank GOD) and come August, when I was emotionally more stable, I got it all cancelled. But that was about $1,200 that had to go on my credit card. I bought like $1,100 of new clothes and jewelry. I partied like crazy. I renewed a 15 month lease at my expensive apartment (even though now I have the $500/mo car payment). I also engaged in just generally dangerous behavior that normally goes along with mania. I am taking full responsibility for it. I'm now seeing a therapist weekly and have been doing much better emotionally. I've been sober for about 45 days (which is big for me--I know it's not really anything impressive). In August, I finally faced the damage I did and started trying to cut down on expenses to pay off the credit card as quickly as possible.

So where I am now. I've paid off most of my credit card, but still have about $1,000 on there. My savings is gone. I have $110,000 in student loans (some from undergrad, most from law school). I'm on IBR and they are being recalculated, so the payment will be going up in November. Here's sort of the breakdown for the month:

Income: $4,100
Rent: $1060
Utilities: $200 (I'm debating getting rid of cable)
Pet: $50 (give or take, I have a yorkie, sometimes there's a lot in one month, sometimes all he needs is a bag of food)
Health Insurance: $380 (employer doesn't pay for it)
Car Insurance: $80
Fed. Loan Payment: $500? (again, not sure until I get the official calculation)
Car Payment: $500
IRA: $100 (I've been paying $0 the last few months to put it toward the CC - on Jan 1, 2017 I can start doing retirement through my employer where they'll match 4%)
Food/Groceries/Going Out/Fun: $500 (I'm trying to majorly cut back here, but it's hard as part of my job is networking, so I often have to go to happy hours/dinners/charity events; I figured $500 would be a worst case scenario)

I'm very lucky that my parents pay for my phone and gas (my dad's theory is that he wants to help out while he's still alive instead of just as an inheritance and since he wants to talk often and see me often, he'll pay for those things -- again, very lucky). 

I'm left with about $700 at the end of the calculations. Maybe more depending on what the IBR calculation ends up being (I only had my job a few months of 2015, so they'll be using $17,000 as my 2015 income). My plan currently is to pay off the rest of the credit card ASAP. 

My question is whether I should aggressively pay off the car (say doing $1000/mo and whatever I have leftover goes to savings) or if I should build up a savings (I've heard 4 months of your current salary, which will take a while to build up) and make minimum payments on everything else. My plan on the student loans, at least for now, is to pay the minimum payment on the IBR. This is what I've been advised by most older attorneys I know, especially given how much debt I have. For now, this will need to be the plan as I figure the car is a more reasonable debt to knock out.

Any thoughts? I know the situation isn't that dire, and I'm lucky to have the income I have. I just can't believe I got myself in this situation compared to where I was in March and I want to get back to a point where I'm living within my means and am comfortable.

I'm looking for the most optimal way to tackle these loans while taking full advantage of tax deductions.

Fun details on how I got into so much debt:
I've been living off of 10k a year just fine(well it was more like 20k, but 10k of that went to tuition), I actually lived very frugally on 7k a year and spent the remaining 3k on a month-long backpacking trip to a random foreign country every year, but I'll save that story for another time. I actually used to ride a bicycle as my main mode of transportation for several years to save money for trips abroad. I spent 12 years of my life in college taking way more classes than I needed. I took the maximum amount of federal student loans every year. I've done odd jobs here and there to survive, but for the most part, my living expenses have come from student loans.",finance,1474446485

personalfinance,I'm buying a house for the first time and I'm in a constant state of uncertainty.,"I've done tons of research and planning, but I feel I could always use more information. What are things you wish you had known before buying (or trying to buy) a house? 

To bring everyone up to speed: I'm looking to buy an $88,000 home. I've saved up about $5,000. I'm not planning on using all of it for a down payment as most of the houses I've looked at don't have appliances. My wife and I have a collective gross income of about $49,000 and each have credit scores of around 760. I qualified for a first time buyer's down payment assistance, but the interest rates jack up from 3.25% to 5%. The lender has a minimum down payment of 3.5%, which is doable with how much I've saved. 

This seems like a reasonable deal if I could get the sellers to pay for closing costs, which I'm told is common practice. 

My real estate agent is super helpful, but I feel the need to dig up as much information as I can before I begin perusing a house.

I'm sorry that I'm asking for answers to a question that I haven't asked, but the truth is, I don't know what I need to know. Any information or experiences that you share will be a great help in my endeavor.

Thank you in advance!!

Hypothetical scenario here, on babypips school it says this...

""Let’s pretend the Fed announces they will raise interest rates. The market quickly starts buying the U.S. dollar across all major currencies….EUR/USD and GBP/USD fall while USD/CHF and USD/JPY rise.""

My question is an easy one, why when a economy raises its interest rates, should i buy that countries currency?

I am having issues understanding why anyone would do this? especially seeing as in an earlier lesson babypips wrote this...

""On the other hand, when interest rates are decreasing, consumers and businesses are more inclined to borrow (because banks ease lending requirements), boosting retail and capital spending, thus helping the economy to grow.""

If an economy grows because of a decreasing interest rate, as mentioned above isn't that better for the USD?

personalfinance,A new baby and a pay cut; we're barely making ends meet and desperately need some advice.,"This is going to be long, but I figure if I'm going to ask, I should probably lay all the info out there.

The background:  My husband (32) and I (31) had our first baby in May.  We've been married 8 years and waited a good while to be financially ready, paying off credit card debt and stashing away at least an emergency fund.  We would have liked the emergency fund to have been bigger, but we want a few kids and we're not getting any younger, so we couldn't wait forever.  We both work for a large private university.  He's been here 9 years, and I've been here 4.  Both jobs are stable, or so we thought.  When I was 8 months pregnant, the leadership in his department changed suddenly, and he was told to start looking for something else.  The new boss wanted to bring in his own guy.  I went into labor (early) shortly after that.  He (wisely) decided to also take 12 weeks of FMLA with me, since he had a ton of vacation/sick time built up, and he spent a lot of that time looking for and interviewing for other jobs.  He was hired by another department within the university, which was great so that he didn't lose his seniority or the awesome benefits the university provides us, but it was a $6k pay cut.  This is a really big hit to our finances, but we knew this was better than waiting for him to be laid off, so he took it.  He's been in this new position for a month.

So, now, a breakdown of our finances...

* My salary is $37,329, of which I take home $920 biweekly, after taxes and benefit deductions (I pay $200 biweekly for health insurance premiums for myself and the baby.  I have some health issues, so I pay more for the low-deductible plan.  She spent a month in the NICU, so I put her on with me, for the lower deductible/out-of-pocket max as well.  I may move her to her daddy's higher deductible plan for next year - not sure what's smart with an infant).
* His salary is $48,535, of which he takes home $1350 biweekly, after taxes and benefit deductions (He pays a measly $40 biweekly for his higher-deductible health insurance premiums.  Lucky healthy bastard.).

So, with 2 pay periods per month, we bring home approximately $4500, on which we must live and pay our bills.

Our monthly bills:

* mortgage w/ escrow  $1200

* daycare  $700

* cell phone bill  $140

* car payment  $354

* electricity  $150 on average

* my student loans  $179

* cable &amp; internet  $145

* car insurance  $290

* water/trash pickup  $65

All of this totals $3223, which leaves us with $1227 for the month.

I use and love Mint.  For our budget, I have the following set, in addition to the above...

* groceries $400 ($100 per week; ""groceries"" is the label, but it encompasses more than just food, as this is our weekly Walmart trip, where we buy groceries, but also household items, toiletries, diapers, etc)

* gas  $200 (we commute from 25 miles away daily;  this obviously fluctuates with the price of gas)

* everything else $400 ($100 per week;  this is the catch-all for miscellaneous spending - eating out (rare), pet supplies (we have an insulin-dependent diabetic dog), oil changes and other vehicle needs, clothing and other shopping (rare), misc baby needs, haircuts, gifts, etc, etc)

Now we're down to $227 for the month.  This is pretty much always sucked up by the ""everything else"" budget, when we inevitably go over.  I should probably just go ahead and adjust the ""everything else"" budget to $600, to reflect reality, but I always tell myself that we'll be super careful, and then unavoidable things come up that prevent that.

As you can see, we are barely breaking even.  Thankfully, the only debt we have (other than our mortgage) is my student loans and his car, ~~both with interest rates around 6%~~.  (I was mistaken.  The student loans are 6%.  The car loan is 4.19% interest;  not sure if this makes a difference regarding the suggestions to refinance...)  If we could pay those off and free ourselves of that $533/month combined burden, it would make a big difference for us.  We'd be able to save more money faster.  The balance on my students loans is $6700 and the balance on his car is $8700.  $15k of debt that, if we could find a way to pay off, would give us a decent amount of breathing room, and allow us to save more, faster.  Maybe even take our little girl on vacation once a year.  Dare to dream!

Other [possibly] relevant info...

* We have $1565 in a savings account, as our emergency fund right now.  Obviously, we'd like to increase that.  It was at $8k before the baby, but we had to pay $2500  for myself and also for the baby, for our hospital bills/out-of-pocket max, and then we had to live without my paycheck for most of my maternity leave.

* The university gives us both 8% contribution to 401k accounts.  We have around $42k combined right now.  After he took the pay cut we stopped our own contributions of $100 per month each, as we knew we had to figure out our new budget first.  But the 8% continues for us both.

* We have an excellent interest rate on our house (3.375 I think), so we don't need to refinance.

* I have setup a savings account for the baby, as I wanted to start early, even if deposits are small.  Right now, I just put in $1 for everyday since she's been born, so at the start of each month, I'll transfer $30 or $31.  Obviously, we'd like to eventually be able to contribute more.

So, there it is.  That's everything I can think of.  I'll give more detail if it's needed, just ask.  If anybody can identify ways we can save, and pay down the 2 debts to free up that money monthly, I'd love to hear it.  The only thing I can identify is possibly cutting cable.  We don't want the baby watching TV for a while anyway, so we're already talking about doing that.  But the $70-80/month still doesn't make enough of a dent.

Thanks in advance for your time, if you made it all the way through this novel.  I know these details aren't exciting.  But it would make such a big difference in our lives if somebody smarter than us took a look and pointed out something we don't know/see.

EDIT:  I can't thank you guys enough for the thoughtful evaluations of our situation and these ideas on ways to save.  In my mind, it's a game now, to see just how much we can reduce our expenses, and I'm all pumped up!

personalfinance,ELI5 I'm buying a condo and I'm not sure if the lender is trying to take advantage of me. Should I get a 30 year fixed rate or 5/7 year ARM?,"My wife and I are purchasing a condo and could use some help determining which type of loan and lender I should go with. The condo we’re looking at is a 3br/2ba located in a thriving neighborhood in downtown San Antonio, TX. We plan on keeping it at least 5 years, but no long term plan in mind yet.

We’re both 27, my salary is $125,000 and hers is $65,000. Both of our credit scores are in the 780s and we don’t have any debt except for a house we’re selling that is under contract and expected to close next month. No kids and not considering them for at least 5 years. Though having an unexpected child in that time would not cause us to sell the place.  

The selling price for the condo is $423,000. I can put down 10%, but I’m leaning to putting down 5% instead, so the loan amount is $401,000.

**Lender 1:**

This company financed the construction and is the preferred lender for this complex. They have a promotion where if I put down 5% they will cover the title insurance closing costs ($2,700) and I will not have to pay PMI. Plus they’ll let me refinance for free at any time. However, the condo is new and non-warrantable yet and this lender cannot currently offer a 30 year mortgage. Here are my options:

5yr ARM @ 3.875%

7yr ARM @ 4.250%

**Lender 2:**

Came personally recommended to me by my agent who is a close family friend. I trust her. I also like the lender as well. They cannot take off PMI, but they can cover most of the title insurance closing costs ($2,700) if I go with a higher interest rate. Here are my options:

If I pay the title insurance closing costs:
30 Year Fixed Rate @ 3.875% + PMI

If they pay the title insurance closing costs:

I have a small business selling stuff online. I noticed that for whatever reason one of my biggest vendors is categorized as Gas/Automotive.

Right now I'm paying everything using my personal capital one credit card that is only used for that. I use my other credit cards for personal things. Capital one gives me 1.5% cash back on everything, but I figured if I could get 3% or more cash back, that's better than 1.5%.

My big three credit scores are all in the 770's (at least according to capital one, discover, and credit karma). Most of the gas cards I find seem to have really low cash back limits or ridiculous requirements (cough cough penfed cough cough). I'll be spending in the area of $8,000-10,000 a month.

My business is a real business with an EIN and all the proper paperwork filed with the state so both business and personal credit cards are an option.

personalfinance,Losing my grip on my dream. Any ideas greatly appreciated! Being a Felon sucks!,"I was a complete knucklehead in my younger years. By the time I was 18 I was addicted to drugs, been convicted of two DUI's (one of which was bad and I got a strike for), and had committed various crimes to support my drug habit. For whatever reason when I turned 19 I was fed up with the choices I had been making and decided to stop using the bad drugs (Opiates and Cocaine). I took off from where I lived with a backpack on my back and a couple of hundred bucks in my pocket and proceeded to have a couple of the best years of my life hitchhiking across the West Coast going to concerts and festivals while supporting myself by obtaining trim jobs in NorCal when I ran out of money. Of course when I returned home to San Diego after almost two years on the road my reality was shattered when I got arrested due to the fact that I had a warrant for some of the stupid crap I had done while using. Because of already having a Strike for a DUI I was convicted and sentenced to 4 years in state prison. The time I spent ""upstate"" as they say was life changing. I learned a lot about myself and a lot about people in general. It really opened my eyes and upon my release all I wanted to do was sail around the world. I got a meaningless job at a Deli and saved up some money and bought a capable sailboat. I then found a good job managing a cell phone repair store which was great until I was let go once they found out about my record. I was out of work for about seven months. During that seven months I couldn't find a job for the life of me. Being a felon really does affect ones job prospects. Luckily I recently found a job doing something I enjoy and making decent money. Unfortunately being without a job left me deep in a hole. My Dream boat is currently locked up due to non payment of my slip fees and every dollar I'm currently making is going towards bills that I accrued while I was out of work. My Credit is terrible and I just feel lost. It would be quite sad to loose the boat I worked so hard for and everything is just feeling somewhat hopeless. Any Ideas?",finance,1474490216

personalfinance,Dealership still hasn't paid off my trade-in,"I recently traded a 2008 Dodge Caliber with about 100,000 miles on it for a 2016 Kia Soul. I know the arguments against getting a new car, but I was able to get a new one with 20 miles rather than a used one with 6,000-12,000 miles for what will amount to $2000 less, when interest rates, trade-in value and rebates are considered. It will be even less if I make payments on an accelerated schedule, which I intend to do.

I owed $5911 at the time of trading it in, and was able to negotiate $4850 in trade for my old car, which is nearly twice the blue book value. I knew ahead of time that I was underwater on my car, and would have to roll the old loan in, and had factored that into my budget.

My payment due dates on the old car were the 20th of each month, and the last payment prior to trading it had been made on August 16th. I purchased the car on September 2nd, and the financing was underwritten on September 3rd, but the previous loan hasn't been paid off yet. The dealer requested and received a 10 day payoff of $5934, so we built an amount of $6000 even in the payoff, with the stipulation that any overage would be applied to principal. I contacted the holder of the new financing and they confirmed that the loan was funded on September 3rd, with funds being received by the dealership on September 6th. I've contacted the dealership's finance department 3 times so far and left messages, but nobody's gotten back to me. I've also left a message for the dealership's general manager, to no avail. I stopped into the dealership after work, and was told that finance and the GM had both already left for the day.

I've made the September payment on the old car to prevent a negative impact to my credit. Does anyone have any advice for next steps to take?

personalfinance,$200k house. How much did it cost me up front?,"I bought a house about 6 weeks ago in the midwest and found this post very helpful: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4rfq8e/here_is_what_buying_a_195k_house_cost_me/

My closing costs, fees, etc. were a bit different albeit in a similar price range so I thought I would share the up front fees associated with my first closing. I hope someone finds this as helpful as the initial post helped me. 

My offer included me paying full closing costs. Our mortgage officer conservatively estimated we would need about $12,000 in order to put down 5%. There was an additional inspection done on the roof by a contracted specialist based on our inspector's findings, but this was paid by the seller. Onto the numbers: 

The house: 
**Sale price: $200,000. 5% conventional loan.**

Total monthly payment for the first 9 years assuming no additional payments are made: $1,200 ($900 principal + interest, $65 for PMI, and $235 for monthly escrow)

Payments made in advance of closing: 

Escrow: $1,000
Inspection: $275

Closing costs: $3,623. Breakdown of closing costs: 

Title fees = $822.

Appraisal = $410.

Credit Report = $66.

Loan amount (0.014%) points = $26.

Mortgage + Deed fees = $66.

Prepaids (12 month insurance premium and prepaid interest) = $1,233
Initial escrow (Homeowner's insurance for 4 months + property taxes + adjustments) = $925.

HOA = $75.

**Cash required closing: $10,225** and change. We received about $1,900 in credits which included a title adjustment and taxes unpaid by the seller.

Edit: to answer a few of your questions and updated formatting a bit since some of the pricing was unclear..

**4% interest rate**

My credit is right around 800.

My credit hovers around 800. My partner and my salaries total about $130,000. No CC debt, but a little less than $100,000 owed in student loans (down from almost $180,000 5 years ago). Goal is to have this paid off in the next 5 years.",finance,1474491806

However, the car I want to trade Kelly Blue books at from $2000 less than what I owe to around the same price I owe on my car. I could roll over the amount of need be. Basically, what I'm really concerned about is if I trade my car in and that loan is closed and a new one is opened up how will this affect my credit.

personalfinance,Refinancing a mortgage - Is this normal?,"I'm trying to figure out of this is normal/okay and I'm being an unreasonable asshole,  or if this is genuinely problematic.  

&amp;nbsp;

I got divorced in July 2016, and remarried a week later.  I got the house in the settlement,  along with the stipulation that my ex-wife pay off a credit card that opened in my name (about $9,000). Specifically,  I get six months to refinance the house,  and get my ex off of the mortgage/deed.  If I can't refinance in six months,  she gets to either attempt to refinance herself,  or force a sale.  If I refinance,  I do not owe her any equity.  

&amp;nbsp;

During the divorce process, I lost my job (2015). I got another job doing the same thing,  and have been working at my current place for just under a year. I now make more than I did previously.  My new wife also lost her job at the end of 2015, and is now employed in the financial services industry (about 6 months).  

&amp;nbsp;

We wanted to use the same bank that wrote the original mortgage, because we assumed it would be less hassle. (In hindsight,  we should have shopped around.)  

&amp;nbsp;

It took more than a week to get the mortgage officer to return our calls and emails, and that only after a branch manager contacted him. He told us what paperwork to submit,  and we faxed him everything he requested.  We stressed that there was a hard time limit on refinancing.  Two weeks later,  he wanted to meet with us.  We set an appointment for the following weekend. At the appointment he told us he had lost all the paperwork we had sent (!!!), and asked us to re-fax. We went over income,  home values,  etc.  We again stressed the time limit. 

&amp;nbsp;

As he was going over or income, debts,  and employment history,  he said that we would likely need a cosigner. Given that the mortgage is currently at $123K, and my wife has $20K in the bank, and our combined income is in the $75K range, that seemed strange.  But we agreed to speak to both of our parents. 

&amp;nbsp;

My wife's mother agreed to co-sign.  

&amp;nbsp;

So, a full *month* after that, he gets our preliminary offer to us to sign and date. My mother in law gets her packet two days later. 

&amp;nbsp;

...And mine is *full* of mistakes.  

* The house address is incorrect: zip code is wrong
* My last name is wrong. (I changed my name after my divorce;  I had provided my updated ID to the mortgage officer.)
* The names that will appear on the title are wrong - my last name is wrong; my mother-in-law's name appears twice, wife's name is missing. 
* My marital status is incorrect (I provided the marriage certificate.)
* My monthly income is incorrect.
* My assets are incorrect.
* My wife's assets/income are not listed at all. 
* My student loan monthly payments are incorrect. 
* Student loans are listed that don't exist. (One lender is listed five different times.)
* My birth date is incorrect. 
* My phone number is incorrect. (HE HAS CALLED ME.)

&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, on my mother-in-law's paperwork-  

* Address incorrect (FedEx figured it out,  because she's the last house on the road)
* Income incorrect
* Non-existent credit card payments are listed (she always pays her card off each month).

&amp;nbsp;

I flipped my shit. I immediately emailed asking WTF was going on.  He said it wasn't a big deal. I responded negatively.  He backtracked, and said it was a preliminary *application*,  not the offer. So, after waiting a total of two and a half months to get to the point of having an application (an application that I could have filled out **correctly** in under two hours), that didn't go over well. I contacted his manager,  and said I wanted a loan officer that wasn't going to drag his feet and fuck up an application. The manager was *reluctant* to assign a different mortgage officer to the case,  and offered to oversee the case himself.  

&amp;nbsp;

Now the manager is saying that all the errors are inconsequential,  and that we should just sign and return the paperwork. He even said specifically that changing my name on the application to my legal name would ""confuse the underwriters"".

&amp;nbsp;

I'm strapped for time now. If I start over with a different lender,  I may not be able to hit my drop-dead date, which means I lose my house. 

&amp;nbsp;

**So,  the questions:**  

Is this amount of foot-dragging typical for refinancing a mortgage?  I started in July,  and they expect my first payment to be **December**, which is the whole six months. 

&amp;nbsp;

Are the number and kinds of mistake in the application typical?  

&amp;nbsp;

Am I being an asshole in expecting that more than two months in,  and these mistakes shouldn't be happening at all?

&amp;nbsp;

Is it reasonable to expect that the manager would assign a different mortgage officer,  given my expressed frustrations with the person I'm currently working with?  

&amp;nbsp;

Last,  what are my options at this point? Could I realistically go to a different mortgage broker and get this done before my six months expires?",finance,1474492682

I will likely be opening it with Vanguard for the lower expense ratios and generally well-performing funds and ETFs they offer. I'd like to steer away from a target date funds, as I'd rather be more hands on with where my money goes.

Should I be more aggressive with my IRA than other investment vehicles? It seems like I should take advantage of the up-front tax.

I've been raised in a family that never had a lot of money and we've been sort of falling into cars that have seen better days, through family members selling their old cars to us or getting cars off Craigslist, etc. Problem is, these cars never really last all that long. I've been through three or four cars in the past 10 years, the last two being from the late 90s. 

My mom is still very into going to Craigslist for my next car, but I'm thinking about breaking the cycle. I have an excellent credit score (749) and I'm part of a credit union that can offer me a 3.4% interest rate, and I can afford a payment of about $150/month and maybe $2000 down.

Now I've heard all of the idioms about how it's expensive to be poor, but I'm kind of afraid of willingly taking on debt. I've got about $20k in student loans and $0 credit card debt and have always taken pride in not having a car payment, but I think that part is starting to bite me in the ass now. 

Is it better to take on a small amount of debt for a better car, and if so, what should I look for?

personalfinance,[Other] 18M Questions about starting life with literally nothing!,"Hey Reddit,
First off thank you for taking the time to give this a read! As you can guess I have some questions about how to get started in life without completely fucking myself over for the next 15 years financially! I just turned 18 a month ago and am working at a shitty retail job I'm leaving to become a bus boy, I am currently living with my mom and I'm starting a new job this week to save money until I go off to college in January! I have about $5 to my name and I'm starting to get scared. My first question is what is the best way to get my college paid for with my mom making $20,000 a year, and my father being deceased. I have no family except for my mom and there is no way I can get an assistance from her for my college costs. I received about $3000 in form of the Pell Grant from Federal Aid but I need more than that. My father died of cancer when I was 12 and unfortunately he had no life insurance or any kind of money put away for me. I need help learning to budget my money for the next few months until I leave for college. I'm going to be a bus boy at a local restaurant and I am going to be working nights. I really don't know anything about anything at this point other than work and save. Even if I save up a good chunk of cash would I use that for spending money to keep me alive throughout my years at college or should I throw it right at the school to try and pay off more of the tuition. Any, and I mean ANY help/information is more than appreciated! 
Extra Info:
I'm white (doesn't help when getting aid for college, at least that is my understanding)
I dabble in photography but have no idea how to sell or advertise any of my work in my current situation.
I drive a car that wouldn't qualify for Uber.
I don't plan on doing anything illegal for money. (so no need to suggest it)

Not really a lurker, and haven't posted here before so bear with me.
I've seen some of these posts in the past and with some varying degrees of advice...as such I've gone from pretty certain I was going to refinance to now thinking maybe not.
My situation: Recent grad with ~$35k in federal student loans.
Gross salary is roughly $75k but I'm also living in the Bay Area, so roughly 50% of that goes directly to rent.  
Almost exactly half of my loans were subsidized with a 3-4% (principals come to about 16k) interest rate and the other half is at either 5.8% or 6.2%.
I've been attacking the larger ones on top of my minimum monthly payments just because I know a little about finance and I also hate looking at 5 figure loan balances.

In your valued and solicited opinions, do you think trying to refinance the 5.8% and 6.2% loans with larger priniciples makes sense to do? 

Also open to refinance all into one chunk, I just would like to hear what others have to say...this is my unborn children's future we're talking about here.

investing,stockAday: keeping the lights on with Vanguard's Utilities ETF? ($VPU),"# Vanguard Utilities Index Fund

Well if looking at ETFs is a snore, how about a real sleeping pill? The Utilities sector!

|Ticker|[VPU](https://stockflare.com/stocks/vpu)
|:---:|:---:|
Sector | Exchange Traded Funds
Latest price | $110.56
Value | $2.2 billion
Daily vol | $20 million

* Website: [vanguard.com](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0960&amp;FundIntExt=INT)

# Description

* Seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of stocks in the utilities sector.
* Includes stocks of companies that distribute electricity, water, or gas, or that operate as independent power producers.

# Strategy *EDIT*

*Added on Thurs morning: cos it's key missing analysis!*

It the age old arguments between: passive investing &amp; active; small cap v large cap; equities v bonds; cyclical stocks v defensives... investing in $VPU is a clear vote to actively allocate your savings to a Defensive Sector.

But in a Yellen World, defensive is *not* what it's performed like. In fact on a 5 or 10 year view, 3 out of 4 defensives have beaten the market, substantially, with the 4th in-line with the market.

|Ticker|Sector| 5 years|10 years|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|$VTI | Total Market | 11% | 8% | 
|Defensives |  |  |  |
|$VDC | Consumer Staples | 15% | 12% | 
|$VHT | Health Care | 17% | 11% | 
|$VOX | Telecom | 11% | 8% | 
|$VPU | Utilities | 14% | 9% | 
|Cyclical |  |  |  |

|$VIS | Industrials | 11% | 7% |

|Other |  |  |  |
|$VDE | Energy | -1% | 4% | 
|$VFH | Financials | 10% | 0% |

So given that [mean reversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reversion_(finance) is probably the most powerful long term force in finance, should we be a little cautious about these highfliers? Especially since we are at the start of the Fed's tightening cycle.

# Efficiency / Fees

So fee's for Vanguard's Utility ETF are best in class compared with iShares and SPDR. Though at a $2bn of assets, it's rather a lot smaller than SPDR's $8bn. 

|Metrics|Expense Ratio| Tracking Error|Uses Derivatives|Stock Lending Fees|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Vanguard's Utility $VPU | 0.10% | -0.05% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|SPDR's $XLU | 0.14% | -0.15% | No | 100% to Fund :) |
|iShares' $IVV | 0.44% | -0.48% | No | 70% to Fund :/ |
|Vanguard's $VT (for a benchmark) | 0.14% | -0.09% | No | 100% to Fund :) |

# Asset Allocation

The asset allocation won't shock you, it's all in Utilities with 60% in Electric Utilities 30% in Utilities that do everything, and virtually no pure play gas, water, renewables firms. To put this in context, the Utilities sector is only 3% of the overall US market...and about as much a minnow as the Basic Materials and Telecom sectors are.

# Valuation

Let's compare Vanguard's Utilities ETF to the SPDRs Utilities ETF and for good measure to Vanguard's Global ETF.

|ETF| VPU | XLU | VT |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|No. of stocks| 80 | 30 | 7,482 |
|Median size| $23bn | $33 bn | $33bn |
|PE ratio| 22x | 18x | 22x |
|Earning growth| 2% | 5% | 7% |
|Dividend yield| 3.3% | 3.3% | 2.8% |
| % foreign| 0% | n/a | 47%|

Vanguard's Utility ETF seems to be a different beast to SPDRs. With SPDR much more concentrated and a little ""cheaper"".

But putting that aside for a minute, what are we trying to achieve by buying this ETF. Okay, you'd think it was a defensive, anti-cyclical business, but is that reflected in the valuation when you compare with the global ETF. Hard to see that!

# Well?

So looking at ETFs, I like to come to think of 3 questions (1) Am I happy with the asset itself? (2) happy with this specific strategy? (3) Happy with the provider of the ETF?

1. Well, this is a equity ETF in the US. And sure, that's a great place to invest, long-term. So no concerns there.

2. But the strategy of just investing in Utilities? Okay, they are boring cashflow businesses, but they are hugely capital intensive. And there doesn't seems to be much of a relative valuation play going on here. Why invest in this very narrow segment? It's tough to see the logic.

3. And finally, what about Vanguard... well it's hard to fault their metrics in terms of cost, efficiency or safety. Seems to be a least as good as SPDR or iShares.

I am an extremely hard worker in everyone's eyes and I'm pretty sure they value me and my work ethics but I don't believe that I am being fairly compensated nor treated well for it. 

The reason I say this is because when I mention the smaller amount of staff here, people have been leaving the company and have hired a new person to replace the position that I was initially hired for in January. However, there was something wrong with her payment stub so she showed me her pay rate and she is getting paid $15.00 base when I was initially getting paid $13.50. Additionally, we were suppose to hire another person because we are still short staffed and we have been for a few months now but since we have been holding up with the work load and such, they decided to delay the hiring process (after a few botched attempts at hiring someone for my old position) until  it hit the busy season again. So I have been pretty much working 2 positions and I want this to end. I don't want to be used up and be walked over anymore. I've been helpful with always trying to stay after work to help finish everything up but my director is telling me that me working overtime is a positive opportunity. I just want to be fairly compensated for the amount of work that I do and I think that now would be a great time because of leverage. I don't really plan on leaving the company because I want to stay long term and possibly transfer or build up a good resume because of how much I have already done for the company. But I have a few questions,

1. Should I ask my coworker who is now getting paid $15.00 about her qualifications for the position to see if there is any reason why she got paid more than I did? I am willing to also reveal to her how much I am making now and how much I made while in her job role.
2. Who do I actually speak to in regards to raising my pay rate? Would it be through HR? The people who actually made the decision to delay hiring another person was the Vice President for the Western Pacific Region and his boss above that. How would I even go about bringing this up and be firm about the amount that I want?
3. Should I considering leaving the company for another one and get experience there? Should I try job searching now and possibly quit (and be unemployed for possibly a few months) if I don't receive the pay that I want? To go off of this, I currently live with my parents so I don't need to pay for food or rent and have a decent amount of savings to hold up.


Thanks! Please let me know if you need any clarification on any of this. Any advice is much appreciated and thank you if you read all the way to this point.

personalfinance,Refinancing student loans - myth or possible?,"Hi All - 
I'm a bit mystified about the concept of refinancing student loans....and I'm wondering if you good people can help me.

Here's what I understand right now - refinancing federal student loans is generally a bad idea because you end up losing any of the federal benefits associated with those loans (ability to defer, income driven payment plans, etc.)

However - what about private student loans?  Can these be refinanced?

Here's why I'm asking:  I have ~$145,000 in student loan debt.  Half federal and half private.  I just recently consolidated my federal loan half in to a Direct loan in order to qualify for the Public Service loan forgiveness program - I am a teacher and this program is the only forgiveness program out there at the moment that does not impose a tax penalty on the amount forgiven in the end.  (I have been paying on my loans for 9 years now and I should have done it years ago, but I only just figured all this stuff out - oh well....it will help in the end regardless as long as the keep the program).  For my federal loans, the interest rate is 6.375%

For my private loans ($70,000) - they are through Navient, although they are private ""Signature student loans"" - a holdover from Sallie Mae.  The interest rates on these loans are basically 6%.  These loans are not eligible for federal benefits nor able to be put in to the PSLF program.

My question is - can I refinance the private loans to save money now and over the life of the loan?  What companies have proven themselves trustworthy?  Is it possible to get a better interest rate than what I have now?  What are the drawbacks?

For completeness - these are loans I used for professional school (where I basically was able to triple my earning power).  I have a stable job and I earn $115,000 from my primary job at the moment and an additional $30,000 on side jobs each year.  They were well worth it - I just want to pay them off rather than have them until I'm 65 (I'm almost 40 now).  Living like a hermit is not possible just to pay off the loans - I have three kids, a house, etc., etc....they are fortunately only one of my many expenses.  I will certainly pay them in full but the less I have to spend, the better.",finance,1474512752
personalfinance,"Starting school at Cal Poly Pomona tomorrow, I decided it's time to budget myself and stop spending recklessly. I'm thinking of closing some credit cards, including WF, how could this affect me?","Like I said, I start tomorrow school after transferring from a community college and I have a lot expenses that I used to not have. I'm paying 700dllrs of rent and I still have to pay electricity. I have a credit card with Wells Fargo, BoA, Discover, and a store credit card with Best Buy. I have a combined credit card debt of $4300~. My school is paid for with grants, and I'm receiving around $4200~ per quarter for the rest of grants and a subsidized loan. I'm currently applying for jobs on campus so I can focus on my Mechanical Engineering degree. The problem is that I never had to budget myself in a big way because when I was at a community college all my classes were paid for by a program their, I had another one that would give me money for books, and I had my pell grant to pay rent and other leisure expenses. I have a good credit score according to Discover I have 760 Fico score, I have never missed a payment, and would usually pay my card in full when I got my financial aid. Now it's a different story, I have more rent to pay, more tuition, etc. So, I decided to use this situation to learn how to budget myself. I decided to close my accounts in some of my banks, but I dont know which. My school has it's own federal credit union and I was thinking of joining them.

personalfinance,Car loan security contract,"Hey Reddit. So to put a long story into an easy to read summary I originally bought my car (2015 Sentra S) with no credit and a 21.12% interest rate. The car payment was insane at 487 a month. I worked on my credit and doing so allowed me to refinance (though underwater) down to a 4.15% rate. When I did the refinance the banker suggested a loan security contract. Basically in short it is supposed to protect me incase of any sort of situation where i am unable to pay such as job loss, being out of work from an injury, etc and would also cover the loan if anything ever happened to me. This contract is supposed to cost 2800 over the remaining term on my car (62 months), so it's being billed at about 53 a month. With it, my car payment sits at 387. Without it, it would be around  335 or so. 
My question today is if this contract is worth it. I don't have a lot of money saved up, but after dropping my payment down already and lowering my insurance in addition to making better decisions I am putting away a decent chunk of money each month. With the car being under already by a good amount I worry that having that extra 2800 on there only makes the situation worse. But the banker I worked with is someone I trust, I'm just not sure if her saying it's totally worth it was a biased opinion so I wanted to see what you guys think.

Thanks in advance for any advice :)",finance,1474517269

personalfinance,"My girlfriend's parents are giving us money to buy a home. We have no idea how to navigate this financially, and it's stressing us out.","Hello /r/personalfinance!

Please bare with me. I feel this is lengthy.

My girlfriend and I are being given a really great opportunity by her parents to buy a home in our city of Seattle. They are giving us up to $600,000 and we are incredibly grateful.

We have been touring homes the past few weeks and are at a crossroads as to what to do. Here are some options we have thought about, but have concerns about the federal interest rising and how that could affect us as home owners and potential renters. 

These are the ideas we have:

1) We found a beautiful home we love but not in a favorable neighborhood for around $560,000. It has 3 bedrooms and 2 bath. The house has two floors and the top floor has both bathrooms and 2 bedrooms. The bottom floor has 1 bedroom and no bathroom. Conveniently, both floors have separate entrances. We love this home and our idea is to live in the master bedroom and rent out the bedroom that is downstairs. We believe we can likely get ~$800/mo in rent for this room. Our goal is to put away the income from the renter and put away ~$800 a month for each of us as well into a joint account that will go towards a future home that we could live in while renting this property out. The estimated property tax for this home is ~$900/ yr.

2) Option 2 is we go with a much smaller and less than ideal home. The home in option 2 is in a better location, and the value of it could rise faster than the home in option 1. The house is a 3 room home. Meaning 3 rooms total. It's almost like a small stand alone apartment in size. We would still put away our $800/mo each into a joint account for our future home together with the plan of eventually renting this property out as well. This home is ~$330,000. The property taxes on it are estimated at $2400/ yr

3) option 3 is to go with the home in option 2 and to also get a condo either at the same time or later on down the road. When we get the condo we would rent out the home immediately.

We are a little stressed out because this is a lot of money to deal with. And with the potential increase in the federal interest rate coming in December, we arent sure if it is better to save the money for buying a home later on, or buying one now and getting the rent income.

We are open to other options too. We have been doing the hunt for about 3 weeks, so we aren't cemented into anything yet.


Please help, /r/personalfinance!


Thank you,

/u/cutethingthrow


Edit:

Please note, the house from option 2 and 3 could be upgraded. We have talked about the potential of adding a second floor to rent out as well. We just aren't sure what permits or costs would be associated with that kind of project.",finance,1474520299

Am I missing something?,"I'm struggling pretty bad financially at the moment, and though it's a big mixture of reasons (bad financial habits in the past, lots of credit cards, etc) the two things that are killing me the most right now are student loans and health insurance. 


I'll be honest: I was stupid when it came to loans. My college (DeVry) just pushed me to take out loan after loan, and looking back now I have no idea what I was paying for or the repercussions. 


At this point, I have ~$50,000 in federal loans. I'm waiting for my IBR to be recertified, but I'm guessing I won't pay any less than $300 per month for the federal loans. On top of that I have private loans with three companies - one for $192 a month, one for $73 a month and one for $45 a month. All in all, I'm paying at least $600 per month for student loans and that's WITH income based repayment. 


For health insurance, I'm paying $487 per month right now to cover both myself and my husband (neither of us get benefits through work). That's with a ~$400 tax credit assistance, which helps. But that's also with a $1200 deductible, so now I find myself drowning in medical bills. Just stepping foot into the doctor cost me nearly $100! 


I'm coming up on the time to renew, so I'm looking at either getting a bare bones health insurance plan for like $250 per month, but then dealing with all the random medical bills, or just shelling out extra money per month (like $700 after assistance) for one with no deductible, just copays. The extra problem here is that I'm on birth control which costs $150 per month, and it looks like those bare bones health insurance plans don't cover that? I'm not sure if they have to? I tried to google it and can't seem to find a concrete answer, though I plan to call the insurance company and ask. 


So that's my situation, not counting the stupid credit card bills. Am I doing something stupid? Am I doing something wrong? Is there different ways I should be handling this stuff, options that I have? Both student loans and health insurance are so overwhelming when I look at options, it's like nothing is in English and I'm wondering if there's some help out there somewhere I'm missing. 


Some basic info: I'm married, my husband has no loans. I can lower the amount dramatically by us filing seperately (which we did up until this year), however if I file seperately from him I'm no longer eligible for financial assistance for health insurance, so I have to pay the full cost out of pocket. We're both employed full time, though I'm technically self employed/contract. We get no benefits, I have to pay taxes quarterly (which I actually have to do for the first time shortly, which terrifies me because I don't think I'll be able to pay). 

I live in NY, USA. Our total income is about $3500 per month after taxes, and our expenses come to about $3700 per month between loans, rent ($830), credit cards ($150- $200 per month if I pay minimums), utilities, groceries, gas etc. Our cell phone bill is extremely low ($60) and we cut out cable and just do Netflix/Hulu which saves us a ton of money. I'm going to talk to my husband about cutting down our spending, but other than that I'm just not sure what to do.",finance,1474558426

I'm trying to do that, but I'm very nervous about doing this wrong, and either continuing to have them withhold too much, or having them not withhold enough, causing us to owe.

The calculator on the IRS website is not helping.  The biggest hassle with the calculator is the specific questions it's asking about salary in 2016.  It's asking how much each of us expect to be paid in 2016, but 2016 is almost over.  Shouldn't that be taken into consideration?  I'm thinking it might be a lot less trouble to wait and adjust the withholdings at the very start of 2017.  My husband changed jobs this year (within the same company) and his salary subsequently changed, and I had an unpaid maternity leave.  These factors affected this year's pay, but I don't think it makes sense to use this year's pay as a way to determine future withholdings.  Right?

I'd greatly appreciate some assistance getting this right.  Perhaps I should abandon the calculator and just follow the instructions on the W-4.  I just really need somebody who knows to tell me that my final number of allowances is correct and appropriate.",finance,1474560349

I've tried to get it fixed at the dealer but they seem to only jimmy-rigging the problems it has and not fixing the real problem. I keep having to go in yo get it fixed. The headlights aren't working, the backup/tail lights aren't working, it's all electrical and too much to fix, it was not safe to drive for Uber/Lyft

I decided to refinance my car at another dealership for a nicer, newer car with a much lower interest rate. I needed something safer to drive, something more reliable. I traded my car in and got a 2016 Dodge Dart. I called my insurance company how much it would cost for insurance, I was quoted $150 a month, because I am under 24 years old, I have to be under my parents insurance or else it'll cost way way more a month.

when I financed my new car, the dealership had me do it all myself, in my name. I didn't need a co-signer. I thought, ""great! My credit must be that good, Sweet"". of course I had my parents still there as I signed the contract, the dealer lowered the price of the car so I could get the car at a great deal, I'm only paying a little bit more than I was paying for my other car and it's much newer. The problem I have is because I am on the title, I can't get insured under my parents insurance, they need to be on the title. My insurance company (I am with AllState) quoted me $150 for the Dodge dart. if I was not on my parents insurance policy I would be paying 400+ a month. I can't get in under my parents insurance because they're not on the title. I tried to go back to the dealer to redo the title, but the guy says he can't do that because it's already been submitted to the banks. 

What do I do? I really can't afford $400+ just for insurance, plus the car payment, that's going to hurt me real bad. I was expecting $150. What should I do? Need some advice here.",finance,1474564235

I just got off the phone with my mother who recently informed me that I have 70k in a savings account that my parents have been keeping for me since I was born. 

It turns out they have just been letting this money sit in a savings account that by my calculation has an interest rate of 0.6%. I'm a bit frustrated that they let a large sum of money sit in a savings account for 25 years rather than investing at least some of it. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely grateful that my parents put aside an account for me that they had been putting all of my gift money into from the time that I was born and I truly appreciate their thinking of me and planning for my future. 

The account is currently in my mother's name and she doesn't know the first thing about investing (nor does she trust the markets which is why she never invested the money). What steps can she take to make better use of this sum of money? I also just found out that she has not saved any money for retirement and since I am fairly well off I would like to gift most of this money to her when the time comes. 

**TL;DR** - Mother has 70k in a savings account for me and hasn't saved at all for her own retirement. Where should we put this money for it to grow the most over the next 10 or so years? Current savings account has interest rate of .6%. 


**Edit:** Thank you so much everyone for the support! I definitely was not expecting this many responses when I posted this this morning. I'm at lunch now and will respond to people individually when I get off work later but here are some answers to questions I am seeing come up. 

The money is primarily from stock that my grandfather purchased for me in my name when I was born. My parents had a falling out with that grandparent and did not trust him with my best interests so my mother requested to take control of the money. She doesn't trust the market so cashed it out and put it in a savings account.

I love my mother to bits and pieces but she wasn't raised with money and doesn't have a good sense in investing or handling money. Her father did not save for retirement so she never felt the need to do so either. My father does have a retirement account but I am unsure how much he has saved. My parents are very humble people who live in a small and affordable town and have no debts. 

My plan is to take control of the money and make it grow over the next 5-10 years and then gift it to them every month to help them live comfortably. I have never invested myself before but know enough to know that I can get more from that money over the next few years. I'd really appreciate your guidance on how to make that happen.",finance,1474564423
personalfinance,"Need advice, and for whatever reason, I'm seeking it from strangers","I'm a 33 yo single mother of four, with a 225k income and 175k in student loans (7.5 years left at variable rate; currently 3.5% thanks to Sofi).  I have a 600k home (235k and 13.5 years remaining on fixed 3.125% mortgage), 125k in the 401k (max out annually), and 125k in cash and equities.  No 529 or Roth yet (I know, I know).  No childcare expenses, and month-to-month, I'm about breaking even as is, so I'd be ok keeping all the debt through their terms if that makes the most sense (it would be more anticlimactic, but I can do that if need be).
My question is this: what's the best use of the 125k cash and equities right now?  Kill the student loan?  I figure I can pay it off within the next year if I focus all on that, but wonder if putting 100k into an index fund will be smarter long-term given (1) the low Sofi interest rate, and (2) that compounding is more meaningful from a larger sum I'd be putting to work.

I've been nursing this macroeconomic theory for a while, and it was well-received in /r/wallstreetdd so I thought I would crosspost to reach a wider audience. If you think I'm wrong, please tell me why so I can adjust my strategy and lose less money! From what I can tell, my perspective is somewhat of a demand-side ""Neo-Keynesian"" model. Also, although this text is my own phrasing, the ideas are mostly parroting pieces of things I have read elsewhere, so don't give me too much credit. I'm just regurgitating it for a reddit audience.

----

With that out of the way... Macro. My favorite part of investing is studying the macroeconomic view. Micro has its place, but it can be very math-heavy, calculating ""beta"", Sharpe ratios, and so on. Macro, on the other hand, is more philosophical. There are many different economic schools, each with different outlooks and explanations. A good macro theory helps to make sense of long-term trends.

Here's my current operating theory: Eight years after the 2008 crash, the stock market has largely recovered. Interest rates have been near-zero for a long time, and the Fed is anxious to start raising them back to ""normal"" levels. They've begun taking baby steps.

But it won't work.

## Thesis: Interest rates will be lower for longer

The primary change that has affected the economy is the massive shift of wealth to the upper class. In the words of Warren Buffet, ""Through the tax code, there has been class warfare waged, and my class has won. It's been a rout.""

Chain-emails about buying beer aside, the ultra-wealthy have extremely low tax rates in the United States. The highest marginal tax rate in the US is 35% (before state tax). But this is a tax on *labor* rather than *capital*. It's a tax on the upper-middle-class, not the true upper class. Take a look at this chart:

[Effective Tax by Income](http://ipr.cua.edu/blogs/assets/content//Average%20Tax%20Rate%20by%20AGI%20Class.jpg)

At the extreme right, effective income tax starts going down because the upper-class makes most of their money through capital investment. They don't pay 40% income tax, they pay 15% capital gains tax. If the chart extended into $100M or $1B, you would see it drop even lower. Warren thinks this is pretty unfair, and has proposed the ""Buffet rule"" which imposes a minimum 30% tax on incomes above one million dollars.

Some wealthy oppose the Buffett rule -- ""I spend less than 1% of my income on living expenses and invest the other 99% on creating new businesses and increasing the productive capacity of existing businesses."" Sounds good in theory. The wealthy mostly invest and spend little. On the other end of the spectrum, the poor spend nearly all of their income and save little.

Okay, so what? ""Fairness"" aside, what are the effects of our current tax scheme?

&gt; In free-market capitalism, capital generates income for the owners of the capital, which in turn is used to create additional capital. This is very good. Sometimes, it can be actually too good. As capital continues to accumulate, its owners find it more and more difficult to deploy it efficiently. The business sector generally must interact with the household sector by selling goods and services or lending to them. When capital accumulates too rapidly, the productive capacity of the business sector can outpace the ability of the household sector to absorb the increasing production.

—[Lance Brofman, ""A Depression With Benefits: The Macro Case For mREITs""](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1543642-a-depression-with-benefits-the-macro-case-for-mreits)

Let's take a simplistic example: Company X pays a dividend of $1/share, and shares are currently listed at $10 each on the stock market. That means a 10% dividend.

As more and more capital accumulates, demand increases for assets like Company X stock. Over time, the stock price rises to $50/share even though the dividend has not changed. Even though the company still pays $1/share, the dividend is now merely 2%! That's the effect of too much capital. Asset prices are outpacing the increase in productive capacity, driving down yields.

You hear a lot of yelling about how financial assets are ""overvalued"" right now. Stocks are too expensive, bonds are too expensive. EVERYTHING is too expensive relative to the past. That's because we have a glut of capital and nothing to do but keep buying assets.

----

Inflation has a shitload of different definitions depending on who you ask. Even when people agree on the general definition, there are several different ways of measuring it. Do you use CPI? PCE? ""core"" inflation, without energy? the price of gold? All of these measures will give you different answers. However there are common trends.

Let's specifically talk about inflation in consumer goods, which is roughly what CPI and PCE measure. If every American was suddenly gifted $10k, that would be inflationary. The vast majority of people would go out and spend it, driving up prices.

But a transfer of wealth to the upper-class is *deflationary*, since they save and invest it rather than spend it. This is exactly what happened with Reaganomics and ""trickle-down"" theory. The 80s had double-digit inflation, so cutting taxes on the wealthy (a deflationary pressure) was a very good idea. But those policies were never reverted.

In 2012, France elected a Socialist president who enacted the most progressive tax system among the 20 largest industrial nations. But if France had the same tax policy in 1969, it would have been the most *regressive* among those same nations.

There is such a buildup of capital around the world, that bonds have negative yield in some countries. It works the same way as my Company X example above. Suppose a 10-year bond is redeemable for $500 at expiry, but bonds are in such demand (due to their safety) that the price rises to $513. That's a -0.25% annual interest rate.

----

So, what's going to happen next? The Federal Reserve is trying to raise interest rates. They desperately want to get back to ""normal"". But the market is fighting them each step of the way.

In 2013 the Fed tried to transition back to normalcy and the market reacted violently, causing the ""taper tantrum"".

On December 16, 2015 the Fed raised the interest rate from 0.25% to 0.50%, and there was a pretty significant mini-crash.

Now the Fed is considering raising rates again. I strongly doubt they'll do it in November, just a week or two before the election. They're likely to hike in December in order to not lose _all_ credibility (remember when four hikes were planned in 2016?) If/when they *do* raise rates again, I expect another mini-crash, which would be a great time to buy into the market.

Until we take steps towards fixing wealth inequality, we're going to remain in a deflationary/low-inflation environment. The Fed might even have to reverse course and *lower* rates again. It would take *huge* political change to shift the economic landscape: raising rates on the wealthy, lowering rates on the middle-class, huge public investments in infrastructure, and so on. With Congress divided as it is, these changes are effectively impossible.

----

How to profit on all this? What sorts of investments do well in a low-interest-rate environment? Lance Brofman is recommending a few funds: MORT, MORL, and CEFL.

MORT https://www.vaneck.com/vaneck-vectors/income-etfs/mort/
This fund borrows money in order to buy mortgages. Since they are constantly taking short-term loans, they profit when interest rates are low (cheap to borrow). They have a pretty massive dividend yield of ~10%. However, as a REIT they are taxed funny. I plan to buy these in a Roth IRA to avoid paying extra taxes.

MORL http://etracs.ubs.com/product/detail/index/ussymbol/MORL
This is basically the same as MORT, but 2x leveraged. That makes them *even more* sensitive to interest rates. Currently yielding a whopping ~20% dividend. Crazy. Most leveraged assets have their leverage reset on a daily basis, which makes them risky to hold on a long-term basis. MORL is reset on a monthly basis, which makes it suitable for longer terms. See also the sister fund MRRL, which is the same thing but less liquid.

CEFL http://etracs.ubs.com/product/detail/index/ussymbol/CEFL
This fund uses 2x leverage to invest in closed-end funds that have high yield. It's pretty diversified, but is interest-rate sensitive due to its leverage. This also yields ~20%.

----

I'm still waiting for a good entry point to buy these, since I expect the Fed to raise rates at least one more time which should cause a significant price drop.

I'm not sure if gold/silver is a good long-term play or not. The market likes gold and silver as a hedge against central bank fuckery, but I don't think that inflation is actually a serious concern at the moment.

In the 90s there was a financial tool called an ""inverse floater"" that profited as interest rates stayed low or dropped. But they fell out of favor and not many brokerages offer them anymore.

I'd love to see your comments/criticisms. Where do you think this idea is wrong? What are other assets that would benefit from this scenario playing out as I envision it?",finance,1474569439

personalfinance,Saving Intelligently (Advice Wanted),"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I’m here to ask for advice. Specifically, the question: “What can I do better?” Let me explain. I’m 21, soon to be 22. I have a full-time job in IT, where I make about $35,000 a year working for a university in my hometown. After taxes and whatnot, I bring home $900 per paycheck, and I’m paid bi-weekly.

I currently live with my parents while I’m getting my Bachelor’s (and then Master’s) in IT. Since I work for the university, I don’t pay for classes, they’re 100% free, so I have no debt, and no bills to pay (my parents are VERY gracious, they even protest when I attempt to help pay for groceries, but I do it anyway).

Anyway, some more information about me is:

* I’m paying into retirement, specifically TRS (Teacher’s Retirement System, which all employees here pay into). I contribute what I believe is a locked rate of 6% with an employer contribution of 14%.

* I am still on my parents' insurance, and am eligible until I'm 24, I believe (My dad is retired Department of Defense, so we have Blue Cross/Blue Shield). I do contribute for deductibles and auto insurance, but my parents are the primary insurance holders.

* I have an Acorns account, and I invest $25 daily. I have had a positive experience with it, and do not have plans to close the account any time in the foreseeable future.

* I have a Discover card, which I use for gas and pay off monthly. My credit score rose to above 775, last I checked.

* I have 2 bank accounts with a local bank, one is a savings account I keep $5000 in at all times, one is a checking account which I use to pay for things (restaurants, groceries, investing, etc.). I also have a Barclays Dream Account in which I invest $1000 (the maximum) monthly, and I have $7000 in, at this time.

* My total net worth is roughly $15,000, though this may be a low estimate.

My question is this: Is there anything I can do better? I want to be as smart as I possibly can with my money, so I’ve been debating lessening my daily contribution to Acorns and opening a Roth IRA through Fidelity, but I’ve had such success with Acorns, I kind of see it as an IRA without the $5500 contribution limit (though I'm well aware that it isn't an IRA, it's just one way I look at it). I have been thinking of CD laddering, but interest rates are currently really low, so I can't see any justifiable reason to start laddering right now (since the Fed decided to stall on rates yesterday).

personalfinance,Are you planning on using 0% interest rate Apple Upgrade Program to get the new iphone 7? There are some tax implications you should consider.,"After carefully pouring over all my available options for upgrading my iphone I have decided the 0% interest in the Apple Upgrade Program is a better option than getting locked into another 2 year contract with my carrier. HOWEVER, Apple has a major flaw in the program and I am going to expose it here for the first time as I cannot find another mention of it anywhere on the web.
When you enter into the upgrade program, your first-month payment includes the taxes on the **full value** of the iphone. IF you decide to upgrade your phone to the newer model after only 12 months of payments, you will be charged the taxes on the **full value** of your new phone on your 13th payment (1st payment of new phone). Apple is NOT CURRENTLY giving rebates on those taxes collected.
Apple theoretically only has to report the taxes they collected on the 1st 12 months of payments which means Apple is pocketing 50% of the taxes they are collecting from you if you use the program and upgrade your phone every 12 months.

I do hope Apple didn't intend on this and that they will start issuing tax rebates based on how many payments you have made. And for now, while they do not offer such rebates you should keep in mind that extra cost of using this program.

Hi everyone. I've dug myself a pretty huge hole through a variety of means, ranging from totally justified (unexpected medical emergencies) to totally dumb (living the wild life in my early 20s on a credit card with a $20k limit). I'm at the point in my life where my monthly debt payment-to-income ratio (and that's with 2 near full-time jobs) is about 0.80... yeah, 80% of my paycheck disappears to creditors before I even see it. I haven't used a credit card or purchased anything unless absolutely necessary (can post a budget if y'all are curious) for the past two years. I've paid extra using a debt snowball method, but there just isn't enough income at the end of the month to make the snowball move. I'm just literally paying minimums (most of it going towards the high interest charges) from month to month.

Question #1:

I'm heavily considering declaring Chapter 7. It would clear up over $45k of revolving debt, leaving about $30k of student loans. Yes, I have a plan to pay off the student loans and they are MUCH more manageable. For reference, currently my revolving debt payments (minimums!!) eat up about $1500 per month; student loans about $350.

Would the Ch 7 make sense in this situation? What are some red flags or alternate suggestions?

(Its free but full time in Germany) A split up family, my mother is the main income in my family, my father is on the brink of homeless and doesn't earn money. My Father lives not in the same house as my mother and me do. The relationship is really bad between all three of us. I'm basically only not homeless because she needs to finance me and keep me under a roof. I am ex Military with 3 months experience in SF. Currently in the application process to have the possibility to get back. I am accepted to a private game development university. I am accepted to a high quality apprenticeship as a bodyguard/Security-asset I am mostly fluent in English. I don't have any debts or big savings(max 300€ savings).

So as you can tell I have more than enough chances to get a good carrier going. As soon as I'm getting 18 at 01.22.17 and she wants to kick me out at max 03.2017 . And even if she doesn't, I am breaking on the relationship between me and her. I just can't live in the bad circumstances. (She is a alcoholic, verbal abusive monster who uses every bit of information she can get to bring me down. It mostly comes back to the divorce which I triggered to the good of my family. My mother would insult my father all day, he was getting highly depressed and was threatening to suicide himself. At the point where both of them started relieving their anger at me i was calling the cops&amp;child support. My father was arrest for growing weed and my mother was charged for domestic violence. I could write all day about my story, I believe it would make a great book. =) )

Fact is: I cant go to my father, as he threatened to kill me/himself multiple times and i believe it would be worse than at my mothers house. And my mother will or will atleast try to sabotage my carrier. I don't have any other reliable familymembers. That's why i have to get away as soon as I am 18.

My best friend and I want to open a 2-person living community. That way we save a good chunk of rent. We have already searched for living spaces and found a good one for around 600$/mth wich makes about 300$/p.c. To be save we expect around 500$ living costs per capita. That would make 800$ for both of us to live in a good condition. maybe less.
The military is a clinical approval needed to get back, which I am not sure to get. this would solve my issue only for ~ 8y if I am not injured. (American Rangers-style unit, only in GER)

Costs and Time consume of each carrier apprenticeship:


Game-developer: 
25,000$ about 3y of apprenticeship ( more than full time, I already asked for possibilities to finance without a debt, maybe weekend jobs possible.) There are special financing options available. 

Security-Asset: 
22,000$ about 2y of apprenticeship ( 8 am to 6 pm , possible to work half time.) There are no tailored financing options available.


In Germany you get a really nice state-driven loan with about 2% interest rate of about 8,000$ with a max span of 2 years. The Game-developer loans who are tailored to me would have all a interest rate of about 10+%. My best friend would help me a little bit out, but he wouldn't feed me. I have done following equations to get an idea on my financial status:



Apprentice ship security:


Apprenticeship basic costs 22,000

Drivers license 2,000

Living/Rent costs for 2 y 20,000

Minijob -20,000

Federal Loan -7,200

Childsupport1 -4,500

childsupport2 -4,750

                         7,550


With all the state support and a 800$/mth half time job I still need around 7,550$ for the time of my apprenticeship. I would need to do a drivers license during my apprenticeship.



Game development


Basic costs 26.000

Life support/rent 20300

Minijob -13050

Federal Loan -7200

Childsupport1 -5220

Childsupport2 -5510

                        15.320


With the limited state support because of the private university and stuff, i would need a additional minimum 16,000$ loan to keep the studies going. It doesn't count in examination fees and additional fees and the debt collected for the only 2y lasting state loan. As a return I would have a much better start into a growing industry and better chances of making a better carrier.

I love doing both and i have honestly no idea how to finance the rest. What precautions should i take until 02.2017? ( Working is really hard, because my mother has full controls over any bank account i make because I am not 18. I don't want to risk loosing all my money. And as I am not 18 its really hard to find any job which is worth the work. (My mother has already stolen the salary from my military carrier (4,000$).

But I cant to anything about it, because she is allowed too, as I am not 18! What should I do in order to have a great start in my own life without this awful family? What should I plan ahead and do before I am legal aged? What should I take with me as soon as I am 18? My mother has this typical alcoholic ""killswitch"" where she is nice at first but then goes to evil in a second. If I manage to get a contract going to make my mother pay for my education, (which she can, she is a rather wealthy psychotherapist) how do I set the contract up?

personalfinance,"I'm a student, $6000 in credit card debt. Looking for options","I am reaching out here for any possible options to my situation. If I leave it be, I'll continue to pay the minimum payments for the next year and a half until I get a job in which I can pay more. Here is my story.

To keep it short I am in a great situation compared to my peers. I am a senior (I do need to take an extra semester as I switched majors) at Champlain College studying Digital Forensics. Champlain specializes in Digital Forensics and is well regarded in the industry. While the job market is rough, and who knows what can happen, I expect to make AT LEAST 45-50k upon graduation. Likely more but I am planning for the worst and hoping for the best. 

  I have an educational trust fund which is covering the entirety of my school expenses. While they aren't wealthy, I have parents who love me and help me out the best they can, they currently pay my rent as well. However, they don't know one thing. I have a gambling problem. I hit rock bottom about a month ago when I wasted $3000 in one night, all on credit. A week or two later I lost another $600. I've seeked help with my gambling and really do believe I am getting better, but am looking for help on my next step, finance wise. You can look at my post history if you want the details of my gambling.   

My income and debt is as follows.

Income: Around $200 / week working part time at a pizza joint

Debt

$4200 - Capital One - min payment $42

$800 Citi - min payment $25

$450 Chase - min payment $25


All of these cards have a 19-24% interest rate

I have around $3000 in remaining available credit which I can make free cash advances on (through an amex serve card) if I am absolutely desperate to pay a min balance. However this doesn't seem necessary as I can pay off a month of minimum payments with a week of work.

Do I have any options? I would love to utilize a balance transfer card to try to negate the interest I will accrue. However I'm afraid my credit score is too low. After I gambled away all my credit, my score lost 80ish points and I now sit at around 630.

Do I have any options for this? Right now my plan is to pay as much as I can, battle the interest and wait until I get a real job. It shouldn't really be a problem paying $92 a month but I'd really like to avoid the extra interest that will accrue. I'm really looking for any and all advice.

personalfinance,"Buying used car, what kind of loan can I get? +lease question","Hey everyone! I've been lurking for awhile now, trying to soak up as much info as I can. So here I am, diving in with my first post!

I've been leasing a 2013 Honda CRV and the lease is up Nov. 3rd. I'm hoping to turn the car in this month and purchase something used — I'm looking at SUV's/Crossovers in the $15K price range. My plan of attack is to visit my bank and/or a credit union to see what kind of loan I would qualify for. According to Discover, my FICO score is 808. I should be able to get a great interest rate.

My question is two-part...

Is it completely lofty and foolish to think I could get a 0% loan to purchase a used vehicle? I only ask because some credit forums I've been reading have led me to believe so. But I have a hunch that's kinda ridiculous unless I'm purchasing new (which I have no intention of doing). My annual income is roughly $70K and I was thinking of going for a 60-month loan to keep the payments low.

Second question, what do I do with the CRV? I have the option to purchase it at $15,173. Its in my price range and is the type of vehicle I'm looking for but I'm not in love with the car anymore and I'm not really that excited to work with the dealership I leased it from. They're a little shady. This is the first time I've leased a car and I don't really know what to do with it. I'll be charged a $350 turn-in-fee and hopefully no other fees. I've kept the mileage under control, etc. The car blue books for $17,000. As I understand it, I can trade the car in anywhere. Should I do that at the same time I'm buying my new vehicle? 

tl;dr

Is it ludicrous to think I can get a 0% apr loan to purchase used car? And should I get the loan from a bank or dealership?

WTH do I with my leased CRV ""worth"" $2K more than my purchase option?",finance,1474626852

personalfinance,A few TSP / General Retirement plan Questions....,"To start, I'm 33 and have not put much thought into my retirement. When I was in my last few years of service I contributed to my TSP account. I later landed a federal job and now have a civilian TSP as well as a military account. 

Some facts:

* Civillian side has about 14k all in the G fund.

* Military side only has 4.5k and is eligible for roll over either into my Civ side or an outside account 

* I have 6 months of EF and I have drastically cut my debts down.

And now for the questions:

1. What is a decent split between the funds available to me through TSP? Dave Ramsey recommended to a viewer 60 to 80 in C, evenly split the rest between S and I funds. I'm a newbie to all of this though. 

2. Should I roll my 4.5k in the military account over to the civilian side? Or roll it into another account?

3. TSP has matching in my current agency of up to 4% should I be matching at 4% and change the additional % I put in to the Roth side? Or should I seek a Roth outside of TSP? If you were to recommend outside accounts, what would be my best options?

4. What is a good book and/or website to read for a newbie like me that might help me make better financial decisions in the future?

I've just started a new role up North and I'm carrying around a fair amount of debt. Some of it I've ignored outright like a fool and some of it I have slowly tried paying back. My landlord stiffed me out of my deposit and has cut off all communication and while it's not a lot I'm still stung by it.

The thing is though at this point at 26 I've been working most my life in dead end jobs and now this is the first time I've ever gotten a salary for a job I KNOW I can do. As a result I'm going to work my hardest and I've kicked my worst habits for a good 45 days now (Drink/drugs). 

I want to maintain this, get my debts cleared, and start saving. I'm on £42,000 a year which absolutely gobsmackingly good for someone without any formal education up in Liverpool. 

I'm currently renting month to month at a place for £490 but I was thinking that maybe I could see if I could find somewhere cheaper to save more.

personalfinance,I'm considering Bankruptcy as a final option,"So I know nobody wants a sob story, so I'll make it quick, but I figured some background information is important.

I'm a 34yo Male from the US. After a few of the worst years of my life I've dug myself into quite the spot and I was hoping for some opinions.

Rewind to 2010, I had just married a great girl, had a great job and we decided to build our own house. Life is Awesome! 3 years later my baby girl is born. Can't get any better! I open my own company, made some ok money but ultimately failed venture. Go to work for another place, making less than my cushy job from before. We're getting by.

1 year later, I find out my wife is having an affair. 8 months after that I'm divorced. Debt is rising trying to pay to live on my own and pay for our marital home while we try to sell it. I keep chasing new jobs looking for more money, jumping from opportunity to opportunity. 2 weeks before Christmas 2015 I end up getting let go from a company. It takes nearly 3 months for unemployment to kick in. My debt is now through the roof, I'm behind on multiple payments. I enroll debt consolidation but it is cancelled after I can't make the payments for 2 months. Nobody is hiring in my field (digital development) so I end up working for peanuts doing landscaping all summer. It's barely enough to keep my daughter fed and clothed let alone enough to pay bills.

Most/all of my bills have gone unpaid for probably 6 months. My credit is completely shot. Every credit card I had is in collections. My leased truck was set to be repoed but I returned it just in time for them not to take it. Phone is ringing all day.

In July of this year I decide bankruptcy or a handgun is pretty much my only option. (I should probably mention I've been dealing with some pretty major depression through all of this, but doing much better now thankfully)

1 month later (August) I end up finding an opportunity that is basically my dream job. Great salary doing the work I love. Awesome, I'll have a good income and I can take out a personal loan to pay off these debts and actually be able to make the payments.

Not so fast. I can't get a loan from anyone, even with a cosigner. I can't say I blame them. Now I'm back to square one.

I'm again thinking bankruptcy, but now I'm wondering if I make too much? I have around $15k in debt, but it's not so much to amount its the fact that all of these people want their money NOW, or yesterday. I make just shy of $60k which is pretty good in my area.

I've contacted an attorney for a consult, but is this the best option? I want to restart my life, but I have problems first of all with the morality of not paying what I owe and also with the fact that bankruptcy will sideline me from any type of financial future for years.

During this time I was assured over and over that my bill would not be sent to collections because the delay in payment was due to their errors. 

LOW AND BEHOLD!! I'm sent to collections and the bill is still not correct. They are over billing me by $1,524.62. This amount was written off by Premera as their contracted in-network provider write off and this company is trying to bill me for that as well as my deductible and co insurance. 

Now, I will state I have worked administration and billing for years both in the hospital and private sector so I am aware how effed up this is. This post is not about those details. 

I contacted the company and since they have sold my debt they can no longer assist me. Understandable. I contact the Collection Agency. There is back and forth, they aren't horrible but clearly irked that I actually know what I'm talking about. I e-mail them the bills and the EOB. There is more back and forth. Finally we do a conference call with collection agency, Premera and myself. Shout out to Premera for laying the smack down on my behalf. 

Anyway, I am asked by the collection agency to call back in one week because due to this new information they will have to reassess the information provided to them by the original billing company. 

Now the real question. When I call back the collection agency I am prepared to pay the amount I actually own in full but not before they agree to not report this on my credit report. I know there is a way to negotiate this but I am not sure the verbiage to use. I know to request their agreement in writing and not pay until I have that document in my hot little hand.

I'm a recent MA graduate (23F) who just got my first stable job, and I want to start thinking about my future. Retirement fund, etc. However, I also want to know if I should be focusing on paying down my Federal student loans, etc.  Here's some info on me:

Yearly salary:                                $35,000
Current savings/checkings balance: $10,200
Federal Student loans outstanding:  $65,000. On deferment til April.
No other outstanding credit. I have one credit card that I use and pay off monthly to build credit.


My MONTHLY expenses, currently=
Car Insurance:        $109      
Cell bill:                  $50
Rent/utilities:          $400
Groceries:               $200

personalfinance,My fiancé has a very high car payment ($625/mo) and we need advice.,"The title pretty much says it all. My fiancé was hit by a drunk driver Oct 26th 2015. Her 2004 Honda Civic was totaled. At the time she still owed around $3,000 as she has just financed the car through a local used dealership just a few months prior. Covered under my uninsured motorist policy (driver at fault did not have insurance) in the state of Texas. We had to pay off the remaining amount on the loan using the very little savings we had. Long story short, we were suckered into financing a new car because of our terrible credit (both mine, and hers). Payments on a new 2015 Jeep Patriot through Chrysler Capital are $624.17 a month. The interest rate is extremely high at 17.90% and the balance remaining is $25,616. We have tried to refinance through multiple companies but have had no success.

We recently received mail from a company called ""OpenRoad Lending"" that is offering to refinance at a rate of 13.99% which would reduce our payments to $533/mo.

I know purchasing this car in the first place was a mistake on our part now, but would appreciate any advice on trying to fix this mistake before it gets any worse for us. Do I have any options or should I attempt to refinance through this company that sent the advertisement to us?

Edit: after a lot of thought and some helpful comments we have decided on a few things:

I am unfortunately working off the books bringing in about $450 a week. She makes about $750 every 2 weeks. My student loan has a remainder of $2000. 

I sat down with her and we went over a quick budget. Our bills amount to $1284 a month. Roughly estimating $100 for gas for the month and $500 for food (we really don't track our food spending which we are going to seriously watch this next month). Leaves us with about $1600 after all things are said and done.  We plan on working through my student loan and fixing my credit as it seems to be the easier of the two to tackle. The vehicle is in her name but I'm willing to transfer to mine and refinance if that is possible. 

We plan to keep the car as selling at a loss right now is not really an option because we don't have the money to purchase another car or cover the balance of what the car would leave.

I plan on trying to join a credit union ASAP in hopes that that will help our future situation as well.

(They have massive CC debt, which worries me that A. they would encourage me to use it to help them and sink myself and B. that they don't really know what they are doing and thus their suggestions are suspect). 

I already understand that I should be paying off the monthly balance fully, and not seeing it has ""having more money"" but rather a different method of using the funds I have available already. I plan on using to pay a couple subscriptions services and pay off the whole balance every cycle. (I may x-post in /r/churning). 

My questions are: 
What cards give me the best benefits? 

What kind of spending limits am I likely to encounter? (Not an issue, since I don't plan to load a lot onto it, just curious)

What companies have given you trouble? or had really good customer service? or just supported you in an awesome way?

What is a reasonable interest rate for a credit newbie? 

If there is a question I am not thinking of, answer it anyway, I really appreciate any and all advice I can get on this. 

Also, I read the Credit briefing in the sidebar, but am more looking for peoples personal experiences with companies, benefits, and balances, then I am the basic info on what they are and how to use them responsibly.",finance,1474653025
personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Tip,"Understand how payments are being applied to your loans. If you have a single loan consisting of multiple, smaller loans with varying interest rates see if it is possible to allocate percentages of the monthly payment to those loans responsible for contributing the greatest monthly interest. One with little financial knowledge may initially think the highest interest rate loan will contribute the highest interest to the total loan but that is not always the case. Imagine your $25,000 loan consists of two smaller loans. One is $20,000 at 4.5% and the other is $5,000 at 5.5%. Although the $20,000 dollar loan has a lower interest rate it will accrue more interest than the $5,000 loan on a monthly basis. Get a handle on how your payments are being applied to your loans and explore if it is possible to reduce monthly interest by re-allocating payments.

personalfinance,"Looking to get rid of my debts, need advice on a game-plan.","Good afternoon, all. Looking to start making a big dent in my debts and wanted to pitch my plan-of-action to you all, see if there's any glaring issues that should be addressed. I'll get started with some background info:

**The Rundown**

* Currently employed 24 y/o making $58,000/yr, salary.
* 401(k) with 6% from me and 3% from the employer, new account. After taxes and deductions I'm taking home about $2600 a month. 
* $1,175/month rent, shared with girlfriend, who contributes $625/month to rent and housing expenses, so my rent comes down to about $550
* After rent, house expenses (like gas, electricity, internet) come to an additional $300/month, not including groceries which add about another $300/month (GF and I alternate weeks of buying the groceries, comes to about $600/month total) All told, my portion of house expenses come to about $1,150/month, give or take.
* Personal Expenses = $100 cell phone bill, $87 storage unit bill, $125 car/renters insurance bill
* Car is paid off and in good working order
* Current savings = $600
* Current student loan debt = 1st loan is $23,000 (federal loan), 2nd loan is $7,000 (private loan)
* Credit card debt = $8,300 (I know, I know... that's the priority right now)
* Personal loan from mother = $5,000 (no interest and have been given an ""open and free"" timetable to repay, would like to give SOMETHING every month)

**The Plan**

The GF and I are planning on moving around May next year, she has a 1.5 hour commute and we need to make a move to get that down to something reasonable. We're working on setting aside some savings to take care of the costs so we won't have to dip back into the already-over-strained credit card. My biggest concern right now is my debts, which take about $350 a month in payments, and are split between two institutions. As I stand right now, I have a little money to play with (not much, but some) to increase a payment. My I'm stuck between two choices: do I just increase the payment amount on both loans? Or would consolidation be prudent? I could probably land a lower rate with a consolidation, but that would leave me with either an increased monthly payment for a shorter term, or re-setting to a 10 year term with a lower payment. After some very brief research, it looks like I can take on a $600 a month payment for a 5 year term, or a $300 for a 10 year term. 

The credit card debt is being attacked aggressively, I'm putting between $200-$300 a month (as bills allow), and it won't start incurring interest until January because the card had a promotional offer. 

I've worked out a budget and have been following it fairly consistently, save for the odd date-night out. 

So... there it is. Any and all advice you could offer would be awesome. And please, don't pull your punches, I know I screwed up incurring the credit card debt, I fell for the classic ""new credit card with high limit"" pitfall. It's currently in a sealed envelope in a lockbox somewhere out of sight and out of mind (well... the debt isn't out of mind).

* I do not currently have the 3k to fix my car

* I only have 1200 dollars in the bank right now

* Would like a new car, but I am not sure if that is the right choice.

* In a new city and know very few people

* Have missed a few days of work due to broken car. Need something reliable

* Should I just repair the buick despite it's age?


Cash

* Make around 4000 a month after taxes

* Owe 30k in student loans, currently paying 300/month

* Rent and all bills add up to about 1500 a month. Leaving me with 2500 give or take 

* Just started this job about a month ago.

* Used first paychecks to pay off smaller debts that I owed.

* Poor Credit. My credit score is a 670, however I have several items in collections from when I was a student that I am in the process of paying off. 


I am planning on visiting several dealerships over the next few days to find a car. But I am having trouble understanding what I can and cannot afford.

personalfinance,I am looking for some advice on high-yield savings accounts.,"I currently have ~$10,000 sitting in my regular savings account, and I want to move it to a high-yield savings account so that it can gather at least some interest. I am using this as strictly an emergency fund (I already contribute 10% to my employer 401K w/ 5% match), and will continue to contribute ~$500/m for now. I have found a few different accounts, but have some questions about which one to go with.

[Option 1: Synchrony High-yield Savings](https://www.synchronybank.com/banking/products/high-yield-saving/?UISCode=0000000)
**Interest Rate: 1.05% APY**
This is the account I am leaning towards getting. As I mentioned, I will have an initial deposit of $10,000, and this is the highest APY I have found that seems fairly stable. Does anybody here have this account? 

[Option 2: Ally Online Savings Account](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/)
**Interest Rate: 1.00% APY**
This was what I was going to go with before I found Synchrony with a slightly higher APY. However, I may still go with this one, as I have heard the user experience and customer service with Ally is fantastic, and I really haven't seen much information about Synchrony. 

[Option 3: Barclay's Dream Account](https://www.banking.barclaysus.com/dream-account.html?refid=BBDGLPSBRAG0512&amp;mkwid=sL3ws4agW%7cdc&amp;pcrid=105232364433&amp;pmt=e&amp;pkw=barclays&amp;ds_kid=43700013669301688&amp;gclid=CLnF7sKLps8CFUaZNwodcOwPyQ&amp;gclsrc=ds)
**Interest Rate: 1.05%**
I thought I had made up my mind on the Synchrony account, and then I found this. It gives the same APY, however it has a $1000/m deposit limit. With that, though, they give a 2.5% bonus on interest earned every consecutive months with a deposit (which I plan on doing), and another 2.5% bonus on interest earned for every 6 consecutive months without a withdrawal (which i don't plan on withdrawing unless of an emergency). 

Although I would be able to effectively get a 5% bonus on interest earned every 6 months with the Barclay's account, I am limited to a $1000/m deposit. 

That being said, any and all advice is much appreciated! Also, if anyone has better suggestions, please let me know! As I said, I plan on using this as my emergency account, so I want it to be extremely safe. Thanks!",finance,1474660880

We also calculated the gas and it's only 3 miles different then our house. Anyway our mortgage is a VA loan through Wells Fargo. We purchased house at 118000 no down payment a little over two years ago. Last time I checked we were at 98000. The mortgage payment use to be $1018 has how risen to $1241.  We don't have a problem making this payment but we are on one income which is my husbands. We use mint and have weekly budget meetings.  I stay at home with our two boys 6 month old and two year old. The interest rate we got then was 4.5 on a 15 year mortgage. After taxes, escrow, principal, etc we would love to just be completely debt free. But the closing costs is about 10% right now after Realtor, taxes, fees. My husband will also be possibly deploying so we're trying to make a decision because I usually go stay with our moms when he leaves. Any suggestions. I see it as a huge monthly savings but IDK after the closing costs and taxes if it's worth selling to reach our goal of debt free and FIRE.

personalfinance,Question regarding paying an extra mortgage payment each month vs spending the same amount extra to pay off student loans.,"I currently have a ~$1700 mortgage payment on a $280k 15 year loan at 3.4% only had a 5% down payment, so PMI is factored into that $1700. I also have roughly $40k in student loan debt that I am paying $350 a month on ranging in interest from 3-8% interest. 

I currently have a job that pays enough for me to be able to make an extra mortgage payment each month, or I can aggressively pay down my student loans. 

My question is, what is more beneficial to pay off first? even at the lower interest rate on the house, because the number is so much larger is it better to make the extra payment? Or should I focus on getting rid of the 40k student loans? Based on some rudimentary math, if I did the student loans, I'd have them all paid off by next October. I'm leaning towards paying off the loans first, but I'd like a second or third opinion before I make the commitment.",finance,1474662514

investing,Looking for a reason to hold out hope for markets..,"i just can't seem to shake the feeling that ""past returns are not indicative of future performance"" has never been more true than it is now. 

i think what has become and will continue to be increasingly difficult for the market to swallow is the fact that there are people that have left and are leaving the work force that will never come back, and more importantly, there are more and more jobs that are going to go the way of the dodo, thanks to technology and cost cutting. less people working means less spending, corporate revenues drop, and the cost cutters and buy-backers ride in on their white horses to save the bottom line. more people lose jobs to cost cutting...rinse and repeat. if i'm not mistaken there is more corporate debt now than there was prior to the financial crisis, and a lot of it has been used to manufacturing earnings via buybacks. that can't go on forever though, unless rates stay near zero forever. on the other hand, how can the Fed raise rates if it will lead to billions in paper losses for fixed-income investors and equity markets freak at the same time? they seem to be painting themselves further and further into a corner. and the longer they do, the further out on the risk curve they will push investors who are desperate for any yield, and the more painful it will be when the band-aid gets ripped off - if it ever does. where does that leave us? we get 1 hike a year, the bottom falls out, and we climb back up the well to face another hike and slip all over again? and so on until rates are more normal but markets have gone nowhere in who knows how long? and that's just in the U.S - forget about the rest of the world with their own problems!

i know what markets have returned historically over various periods of time, and the powers of DCA and compounding - but what if this is a complete paradigm shift? a new normal?

For the past 10 years of my life, despite these things, I seem to have my stuff together for life except finances.

I know how to make a budget, I know how finances work, yet I can't seem to follow.  I have very little in savings and have hardly made a dent in my student loans (about $40k when I graduated, still around that number).  I was able to follow a budget for a little while with some help from my parents being on my ass to pay off that $10k cc debt, but I always seem to revert back to my ways.  


Can anyone give me any tips on how to actually follow my budget for a long period of time?  It's not that I don't know how to make one - actually putting it in action is my weak point.  I've tried only using cash and limiting it to per week (I end up needing my credit card to buy things online).  I don't really want to get rid of credit cards completely, as they're very convenient and offer rewards, and I seem to be able to at least pay off the full balance every month.  The problem is more that I don't save.

80 gym membership

15 radio subscription

My house has a 20 year mortgage on it with 7 years left on the loan.  My current interest rate is 5.65%

If I take out a 15 year mortgage at the current interest rate at rocketmortgage.com, and borrow an extra $15,000 on top what is currently owed on my loan, I can pay off my loan on the roof.

* I pay $140 in mortgage insurance
* My loan allows me to stop paying the mortgage insurance once I pay off 20% of my loan ($97,000), though I need to call and tell them this. I need to make up $24,250 ($97,000-$72,750).

*** Should I sell my Amazon stock in order to 1) stop paying my mortgage insurance, and 2) make a dent in my mortgage?***

Here's what I'm considering: 

* Amazon stock just broke $800 per share, and there is good indication that it will continue to climb. Some of my co-workers warn against selling because our stocks seems like a high yield investment.

* I've heard that it's good to pay more on a loan early because of compounding interest. Putting more money up front now could save me thousands (potentially tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long run). However, others have noted that that is only a factor if I plan to stay in my home for more than 5 years. I have no idea if I'll stay or not, it really depends on life circumstances that I can't predict.

* If I pay off 20% on my loan then, if needed, I can take out a loan against my house. Not ideal, but this does give me comfort should anything come up that my nest egg isn't big enough for. I can't take out a loan until I reach 20%.

After I graduated high school in '08, I did a year at community college, paid for by my parents, and didn't get credit for a single class. 


I took years off to work, but saved nothing. Finally, I get my butt into gear, and do 2 years at community college. Half was paid for by my parents, and about 10k by student loans I took out.


I applied to 10 public universities, and only out of state schools accepted me. Very little financial aid was offered as well. I chose not to do a work-study program because I have difficulty enough as it is with school, and if I could make money, I'd prefer that over attending class any day.


I am now in a 4 year university, working on a BS for Psychology, doing well, and have 2 more semesters that I need to pay for. I currently owe a mix of government and private loans, all with very low interest rates because my parents co-signed. My actual owed amount, before interest, is roughly $70k. Because of living expenses and tuition, I'll be taking out another 30k for the remaining semesters.


I have no doubt in my mind I will find a job that pays enough so that I never default on my loans. I am a very flexible person, and people like me and think I'm intelligent.

personalfinance,"Just bought a ""new"" car, anxiety about the payments just hit. Advise please.","So long story short I just finance a certified pre-owned 2016 Honda accord Sport with 3,800 miles on it. The only ones to own it are the dealer ship. I purchased the gap coverage and the 100,000 mile bump to bumper warranty. Purchased for $23,xxx 75/mo at a 9.89% interest rate only pulled a 633, needed a 650 to get a 7.49%. I'll refinance in February when my score climbs a little bit. I'm trying to rebuild my credit at 26, had a repo at 19 when I lost my job after a year of paying. I've always drove 10-15+ year old cars so this is my first big purchase. I also needed a vehicle good on gas so when I have to commute 45 minutes a day to college. I was driving a 2001 mustang gt got around 15mpg, and a 2000 dodge ram that got around 8mpg and the mustang had a huge repair coming up I could feel the engine getting sluggish while the dodge needed a new transmission. I'll break my budget down below.

$18.65/hr, I'll be getting raises over the next two years topping out at $22.10 been with this company for almost 5 years. 

$2,262 after tax before any overtime
-$644 Rent *28.4% of income
-$437 Car note *19.3% of income
-$170 Insurance (includes car, motorcycle, and renters insurance)
-$200 Food (could be cheaper some months)
-$110 Gas (wont ever be that much but just in case)
-$70 Cellphone

That leaves me with $630 left without any other bills a month, my girlfriend pays the electric and internet bill, and soon to be a little bit of rent. I guess anxiety just hit really hard in the middle of the night about my purchase. Can someone with experience in personal finance tell me I made a good choice, or at least guide me a little bit.

Anything relating to my problem that I've found online has been some other schmuck like me asking why on a forum, and no one seems to be able to offer an answer.  How about /r/personalfinance?

personalfinance,"Opportunity to kill my car loan with my upcoming tax return, then use debt snowballing to eliminate credit card balances - should I do it?","My wife and I have been just staying afloat among something like $15,000 of credit debt (acquired through a combination of my previous credit irresponsibility and when my father started getting sick and we bought a bunch of stuff to help him in his last few months). We currently have a loan on a car that will end in March of 2018 if we continue to make regular payments on it and we're starting to get real serious about killing off some of our credit cards.

I learned about the concept of debt snowballing a few years ago and I'm ready to really start doing this, and my best estimates for our tax return next year shows that we'll get enough back to completely pay off the remainder of the car loan and then some. The car payment is the largest monthly payment we currently make and has a much lower interest rate than any of our credit cards.

Even considering the practice of debt snowballing, does it make sense to take this opportunity to wipe away this loan? After paying it off, I'd be putting what I'd normally pay on the car towards the lowest balance credit cards, then keep ramping up payments as we wiped away cards. Or should I be starting from the bottom up regardless, focusing on my credit cards starting with the lowest balance and working up? 

I figured getting rid of this car loan was a smart idea (especially when my wife agrees with me, and according to her smart ideas from me don't happen too often) but wanted to throw the question out there to the community to confirm.

* Reg. car payment: $230/mo - current bal. $3872 (Edit: Interest at 6.99%)
* Credit Payments: approx. $400/mo (Split up 6 currently with balances, min payments $25, $25, $27, $40, $61, $215 / mo) 
* Other (mortgage, utilities, gas, insurance, etc.) - approx. $1600/mo

* Income @ $51k/yr
* 1 child
* Est. return next year approx. $4-4.5k

TL;DR: Car loan ends in just over a year but we have lots of credit payments too; kill car loan with upcoming tax return then put what would've been the regular car payment towards snowballing payments against credit? Or is this a bad idea?

Edit: Balances and Interest Rates

* Best Buy - $829.99 - 25.24%
* Home Depot - $495.42 - 25.99%
* Care Credit - $394.38 - Currently 0% until August of next year, then up'd to 29%
* Chase - $550 - Currently 0% until April, then up'd to 15%?
* Bank of America - $2,800 - 14.24% (This has been in this state for nearly 10 years :-/ )
* Capital One - $9,508.59 - 14.9%

Edit: Thanks, everyone! /u/wijwijwij provided the exact tool I needed to figure this out. I understand the jist is to kill higher interest cards first, but I've done the math out on this, and here are my findings:

Note: The below assumes this all happens today. I did use the tool to differentiate snowball vs. avalanche payments; the difference, in my situation, was negligible. Technically avalanche will save more on interest, but not by much, and I'm willing to eat the small difference.

**Snowball payments with no special action:**

* Debt eliminated in **37 months**
* $4,473.54 paid in interest
* First balance killed after 10 months

**Snowball payments using tax return to kill lowest balance cards:**

personalfinance,Student Loans previously Paid In Full now showing a balance with My Great Lakes,"I took out 17 federal loans, both subsidized and unsubsidized, which are now serviced through My Great Lakes. I have since paid off 6 of the 17 loans. Early on, MGL grouped all of my 17 loans into one. I requested to have the loan tokens split so that I could easily make payments directed towards one loan - which is how I paid off the first 6. They previously could only split my 17 loans into up to 8 separate groupings. As I paid them off, I would then have them split off another loan. I was excited when I finally had them all split how I wanted (due to some with lower interest rates, I benefited from still having 3 of them grouped together).

I was just looking through my accounts and found that 3 of the loans I had previously paid in full now show a balance. The other loans that they are now grouped with (so to split them off they just put the newly split loan into a group with the previously paid off loan - weird system, but it was working) are showing a decreased balanced. They basically took the balance and spread it out between the 2 loan tokens which are now grouped. Their interest rates are the same.

My concerns are that they are moving money between these loan tokens without consent or reason - the amounts seem arbitrary. I am also concerned because on my last quarterly statement the previously paid off loan tokens did not even appear since they had been paid in full. Will it now look like I took out more loans? Will this negatively impact my credit score? Of course, I'm also disappointed to see loans that were previously 'paid in full' now have a balance, even if my total sum due is the same the psychological aspect of it is frustrating. This also screws with my tracking system for paying them off in excel.

I plan to email my contact at MGL to try to figure out what is going on, but I wonder how this can be legal? Is there any other authority I should inform? Anything else I should be doing?

Update 9/30: As of yesterday, MGL has corrected this error. I was a bit concerned that they needed to ask me if those 3 tokens were the only ones that should have read paid in full (like, shouldn't they keep track of this kind of stuff? Perhaps I should have said that more should have read that? haha). I'm glad to see that they've finally upgraded their system so that it is easier to track where your payments go on grouped loan tokens and to pay on individual tokens that are grouped. This used to not be the case, hence me needing to get them split/ungrouped in the past. Just another reminder that it is good to keep an eye on your finances as things can (and will) get screwed up.

**Factom. Blockchain Technology tools for net gen asset systems**

Most of old asset records are paper based, difficult to update.
Databases are too easy to modify. Blockchain is a happy medium.

They have a way to do document tracking on Blockchain.

**Zcash**

Issue is privacy on the Blockchain. It is a giant shared database, everyone can see what you are transacting. Like trading securities.
Possible solutions: Private chain, restricted read access.

Could try to do it off chain and put hash on chain, but then the blockchain is just a timestamping service.
Encryption can hide the values, but not the people.
Ring encryption can hide the people.

Zero-knowledge security layer. Enables private transactions. Supports ""Selective disclosure"".

What the 2 parties see: Alice sells 1,0000 MSFT to Bob at USD 97.123

What the trade repository aggregator sees (selective disclosure): &lt;blank&gt; sells 1,0000 MSFT to &lt;blank&gt; at USD 97.123 

What everyone else sees: &lt;blank&gt; sells &lt;blank&gt;  to &lt;blank&gt; at &lt;blank&gt;

worldpolitics,How epic Wall Street corruption is destroying the U.S. economy,"The Banking Model from Hell Has Now Killed the IPO Market

By Pam Martens and Russ Martens: September 23, 2016

http://wallstreetonparade.com/2016/09/the-banking-model-from-hell-has-now-killed-the-ipo-market/

The horror stories that continue to spill out about what Wall Street banks are doing behind their cloistered walls have blurred the actual function of Wall Street: to efficiently allocate capital so that new industries can be born and thrive in America, creating new jobs and a rising standard of living for all of our fellow citizens.

In the same week that the U.S. Senate Banking committee was taking testimony that one of the biggest Wall Street banks, Wells Fargo, was opening two million unauthorized customer accounts over at least a four-year span in order to generate fees and meet daily sales quotas, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that just 68 new companies had been listed for public trading this year, a drop of 51 percent from the 138 companies that had gone public by this time last year.

Let’s recap what the public has learned over the past eight years about the Wall Street banking model from hell. (1) The greatest housing collapse since the Great Depression resulted from Wall Street banks muzzling their internal whistleblowers who wrote memos to management and shouted from the rafters that the banks’ mortgage loan departments were ignoring their own compliance rules and buying up tens of thousands of mortgages with wildly overstated incomes by the mortgage holder. (2) The banks then knowingly bundled these toxic mortgages into pools and paid the ratings agencies, Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s, to assign triple-A ratings to the offerings (called securitizations). (3) The banks knew these toxic mortgages would fail but they sold them to their customers as sound investments. (4) The banks also used their insider knowledge that the mortgages were going to fail to place bets (short sales) and reap billions of dollars in profits as the U.S. housing market collapsed and families were thrown into the streets.

Last December, “The Big Short” movie began to play in theatres across America, allowing millions of people to see how the unchecked, insidious greed of Wall Street had destroyed the nation’s economy along with the reputation of Wall Street, the ratings agencies and the revolving door regulators. (See video below.) The movie was based on real-life people on Wall Street and adapted from the book by the same title by author Michael Lewis, an authoritative source through his previous career on Wall Street.

Years before the movie made it to the big screen, thousands of activists around the country created the Occupy Wall Street movement to advocate for a realignment of their democracy and a radical overhaul of what Wall Street had become: a thinly disguised wealth transfer system for the one percent, being propped up by a corrupt political campaign finance system. After commanding news headlines for months and being carefully monitored by government surveillance, a brutal police eviction was orchestrated against Occupy Wall Street, journalists covering the protests and even New York City Council Members attempting to monitor what was happening. Congressman Jerrold Nadler sent a letter on December 6, 2011 to Attorney General Eric Holder at the  U.S. Department of Justice requesting that an investigation be undertaken. Nadler’s description of the events were reminiscent of a police state protecting the criminals:

“In addition to my concerns about police misconduct with respect to OWS protesters, I am especially troubled that during and after the November 15th eviction from Zuccotti Park, the NYPD aggressively blocked journalists from reporting on the incident, and in some cases, targeted journalists for mistreatment. Individuals without press credentials were also blocked from filming events, and were, in some instances, arrested apparently for taking pictures. According to news reports, and a letter from the major daily newspapers and other major news outlets and organizations representing journalists, at least ten reporters and photographers were arrested while trying to report on the incidents at Zuccotti Park. The NYPD forced journalists to leave Zuccotti Park, prevented members of the credentialed press from being present during the eviction, and used intimidation and physical force to prevent reporters and photographers from carrying out their journalistic functions. Many of those arrested were not charged with any offenses. Additionally, the City reportedly closed the airspace above the area in order to prevent news helicopters from recording the actions.”

George Freeman, Assistant General Counsel of the New York Times, wrote to the NYPD about the same events on behalf of The Times and many other newspapers and media groups. Freeman cited many examples of physical brutality against journalists. In one instance, a male photographer was photographing a man the police were carrying out of Zuccotti Park who was covered in blood.  “As he raised his camera to take a picture, two other police officers came running toward him, grabbed a metal barrier and forcefully lunged at him striking the photographer in the chest, knees and shin,” wrote Freeman. “As they did that they screamed that he was not permitted to be taking pictures on the sidewalk — the most traditionally recognized public forum aside from a park,” wrote Freeman.

After the Obama administration attempted to reassure the public that the evils of Wall Street had been remedied through his much-heralded legislation, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Wall Street horror stories actually became more outrageous. The abuses were discovered not by Federal regulators, but by Senators Carl Levin and Elizabeth Warren, or members of the press, or, in the case of JPMorgan Chase, two trial lawyers with the tenacity to write a book.

In a 2012 case that became infamously known as the London Whale, Senator Carl Levin, who chaired the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, did the work the U.S. Justice Department should have done and released a 306-page report on how JPMorgan Chase had used funds from its insured depository bank, Chase, to make hundreds of billions of dollars in wild derivative gambles in London, losing at least $6.2 billion along the way. Those wild gambles happened two years after the Dodd-Frank legislation was supposed to have cleaned up Wall Street. This is how Senator Levin described JPMorgan Chase’s post-reform behavior:  “[the bank] piled on risk, hid losses, disregarded risk limits, manipulated risk models, dodged oversight, and misinformed the public.” That report came out in 2013.

In 2014, JPMorgan Chase was charged with two felony counts (which were deferred from prosecution) by the U.S. Justice Department for aiding and abetting Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. By May 20 of the following year, JPMorgan Chase had to plead guilty to another felony, this time for its involvement in rigging foreign currency trading.

Despite three felony charges, JPMorgan Chase’s Board kept Jamie Dimon in place as Chairman and CEO and actually gave him bonuses. This unprecedented hubris prompted two trial attorneys, Helen Davis Chaitman and Lance Gotthoffer to author the book, JPMadoff: The Unholy Alliance Between America’s Biggest Bank and America’s Biggest Crook, chronicling the history of crimes at the bank which had cost shareholders a staggering $35.7 billion in fines and settlements in just a four-year span. As testimony to how cowered corporate media has become when it comes to Wall Street, earlier this year Bloomberg Markets magazine editor, Joel Weber, fawned over Dimon in a Bloomberg TV interview, pushing the outrageous narrative that Dimon is all about the customer.

And, of course, there is the failed promise of Dodd-Frank to rein in the derivatives that played a pivotal role in blowing up Wall Street in 2008. Citigroup was able to have an amendment slipped into a spending bill and repeal the part of Dodd-Frank that would have forced derivatives out of the banks that are holding insured deposits. As we reported in July, Citigroup now has more derivatives than 4,701 U.S. banks combined. As of March 31, 2016, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley now control $231.4 trillion in derivatives or 93 percent of all derivatives in the entire FDIC banking universe of 6,122 banks and savings associations.

Not only has the Obama administration and Congress failed to rein in risk on Wall Street, but it is now dramatically more concentrated and dangerous to the global banking system. And, this is the first time in history that a major Presidential candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders, has traveled the country repeating the phrase to the thousands attending his rallies that “the business model of Wall Street is fraud.”

As Wall Street scratches its head and attempts to figure out why new companies don’t want to list their shares on a Wall Street stock exchange or hire a Wall Street bank to do their stock underwriting, we have a simple message for Wall Street: “It’s about trust, stupid.”",finance,1474728940

For reference, here is the text from Fidelity:
  	
&gt; PRE-TAX

&gt; The salary amount you can defer, or contribute, into a retirement savings plan before income taxes are calculated on that money. You do not pay any federal income tax nor, in most cases, state income taxes on the amount you defer, up to the annual maximum IRS dollar limit, or on any earnings on this money, until it is withdrawn from your plan account. Your company may match all or a portion of these contributions

&gt; ROTH

&gt; Designated Roth contributions are elective deferrals for which you irrevocably elect special tax treatment. You will pay federal income taxes and, in most cases, state income taxes on the amount that you elect to contribute to the plan, up to the annual maximum IRS dollar limit. At the time of distribution, you may withdraw your contributions and any earnings on this money tax-free, as long as certain withdrawal criteria have been met. Your company may match all or a portion of these contributions.

&gt; AFTER-TAX

&gt; The amount you can contribute to a retirement savings plan, using a portion of your salary that has already been included in your taxable income. Income taxes have already been calculated on the amount contributed. However, any earnings on these contributions can grow tax-deferred. Income taxes are not due on any earnings until they are withdrawn from the plan.  Your company may match all or a portion of your after-tax contributions in order to provide them with the most flexibility regarding taxes. (It may be advantageous for some people to pay taxes on the contributions now, because they would be in a higher tax bracket during retirement).",finance,1474730323

personalfinance,Repo'd car: should I get it back?,"Dear personal finance,     
I come to you hat in my hand because I've done f***ed again and I need your advice. 

In 2015, I bought a car at a ridiculous interest rate because at the time I was working a job with a decent pay and had an hour and a half commute to work. My beater car had died and I couldn't come up with a better solution at the time as my commute and work schedule didn't allow me to properly find another beater. I was also going through a very rough personal time mentally so I really didn't have the wits or energy either. 

Fast forward a year, they repo'd it on Thursday. In this last year, I've lost the great job I had due to a mental break, cycled through a couple of other jobs in a disastrously fashion, was hospitalized for a suicide attempt, and now I am currently unemployed. I've done my best to make extra or catch up payments when I've had money but I've still managed to get behind by a few months. 

The loan company has said that they'll release the car back to me for only $600 (which I really don't have) and work with me to give me an extension for the next two months while I get back on my feet.. Again. The problem is I'm not sure if I want the car back. Here's the numbers:

Cost of vehicle purchased: 13000  
Apr: 27% (don't buy a car when you have horrible credit)    
Current balance: 12375  
Amount needed to get car back: 600  
Nissan leaf, 2012

My current bills:  
Cell phone: 55 (prepaid, so I'll go back to $45 if I don't get a job or ei benefits soon)  
Medication: 80  
Psychiatrist visit monthly: 120  
Food: 150

Other notes; I'm currently staying with friends who are the best support system anyone could have because they understand the mental illness part and don't sugar-coat it or let me wallow. When I do have a job, I contribute 300 to the household monthly. When I don't have a job, I work extra hard to essentially nanny the dogs and keep the household running. That's why I don't have a rent line atm.

personalfinance,Help check my math re: debt consolidation loan,"Hello PF, 



I was offered a debt consolidation loan through American Express, pre-approved for $10,000, max APR of 9.98%. It said there was no hit to my credit to apply to determine what the actual terms of the loan would be, so I did and I think it makes sense but would appreciate the expertise of this community to make sure I'm not missing anything. 



I would be applying for a loan of $5,560 to consolidate my current credit card debt. This does not take into account another card that has a balance of $743 at 17.49% APR; for this loan a requirement was that you transfer a minimum of $1,000 per card. 



Current CC debt breakdown is as follows:



-Barclay Card: $1200 @ 0% APR (balance transfer), $619 @ 21.24% (purchases), $1498 @ 21.24% APR (failed balance transfer)
-Chase Card: $702 @ 0% APR (balance transfer), $1692 @ 23.49% APR (purchases)



My only other debt is federal student loans, a little under $8,000 at an average of 5% interest. 



I have been working on debt consolidation/pay down for the past 2 years, so I trust myself that I'm in a position now where I won't act recklessly once all that space is cleared up on my cards. 


There is no origination fee for the loan, and no prepayment fee. I selected an aggressive pay down time of 12 months; my total payment would be $488.79/month at an APR of 9.87%. My total finance charges for this loan would amount to $301.41. 



I think it is a good deal and will allow me to pay down my debt much faster than I would have otherwise, but again I wanted to see if there was anything I wasn't thinking of here before I commit. I have three days to decide whether to accept the loan terms or not.

investing,"$CLNE, the stock poised for consistent growth through 2018.","Hey r/investing!  I know I've spoken about this security before, I wanted to provide an update for anyone that may have any questions or who would is interested in alternative energy.  

Why do I love this stock? It's simple, they have virtually 0 customer attrition in a growing market place.  CNG is going to continue to grow for large business (Trucking, Metro Bus, Airports, UPS, Fedex, etc...).  There is no alternative on the market that will provide the same power for the price.  It is a no brainier for companies that rely heavily on large machines to lower the operating costs.  

Financial measures, the company has finally got the debt under control.  They have beat estimates consistently over the past 3 quarters and showing no signs of disappointing.  The commodity price will likely to continue to increase only helping top line revenue.  Construction revenue shows no signs of slowing, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if it continued to increase through 2017.  

Consumer market penetration, I see the average commuter to slowly adopt the technology.  On the road right now, there are simply basis points of the population using CNG.  If the tech picks up 1-2% of the market, the stock would be valued 2-3x on that metric alone.  The best part is that this is purely icing on the cake, no one needs the average commuter to adopt, the large vehicle contracts are enough to propel the stock well past $10.  

Most recent close, $4.30.  My Dec 2016 price target, $5.80.  My Dec 2017 price target, $8.10. 

On macro factors,  I think regardless of the election or what happens to i rates, the stock has upward momentum.  Both Trump or Clinton should be energy friendly due to the environmental and economic benefits of CNG (Obama admin has been as well).  If the i rate were to explode and the market took a correction my price targets would be affected. My personal models do not account for an increase to the interest rate.

personalfinance,"$9,000USD left on my car with a 6.99% interest. Should I trade it in?","So, the short story is when I got my first car, a 2008 Jeep Liberty at 65,000 miles, my mother was the real proponent of the decision. Mostly because I had just gotten a year long internship in the midwest and needed a way to get there and commute to work (I was at home in Jersey over break at the time.) and she had a family friend do the negotiation. Well, since I had no established credit at the time, we had to use hers, so I got stuck with 16k after fees (Car was negotiated to 12k) at 7% interest. So my monthly payments are about $280.00. It will be 3 years in January since I bought the car, and as of right now I'm still looking at 9.8k on the bill.

In addition the car has had some notable mechanical issues, the calipers got stuck about 4 or 5 times and needed replacing. Though it has been fine since last fall after someone decided to actually check the tubes instead of just saying they did. So repair wise I've probably spent about 2k-2.5k on this reoccurring issue. :/, which also makes me hesitant to drive the car long distances.

The reason I'm considering all of this is because now that I'm 23 (69k salary)I have to start paying student loans (76k, private university for CS degree). So now I am wondering should I trade the car in, hope to find one with a lower interest rate and amount owed, so I can start right off the bat making the recommend 10 year repayment plan amounts on my student loans, or hold off until the car is paid off. Looking for some input, hopefully some more experienced voices.",finance,1474753077
personalfinance,Whats everyones thoughts on PUBLIC student loans not factoring in COL expenses.,"So I live In NYC currently, grew up in NY. I like many people want to stay where i grew up.

I am a public educator, in engineering a very valued-very understaffed field in education that is so important.

Now I got an associates, bachelors and masters degree and racked up about 48K in student loans.

Now as a teacher I make 57K my second year, I will be making about 68K next year when my masters pay goes into effect.

Sound like a lot?

Teachers union-

Education Foundation

State tax

City tax

Federal tax

Pension

Those are what i pay before tax on my base pay.

My total monthly pay is $2400 after all said and done. However 400 for transport (subway and train to work), then food, then utilities, rent thats $1200.

I put my student loans payments off, until I make more money. But what pissed me off to no end is the fact that COL dont matter. Someone living in NYC with 50K in loan debt is different that someone in Alabama with 50K in loan debt. (I see both sides, 50K is probably a lot harder to pay off in the south, however COL in NYC is shitty.)

I did everything in college to the best of my ability to save money and  I went into an awesome field, but these loans will be the death of me. A % of your income is a shitty system, i understand why but the more money i make, the more they take from me as well, and rent isnt going down...

There will be people who tell me to move here, where I work is just as / more expensive than NYC, and its so much harder to find a roommate. Its like im stuck, luckily in 10 years I will be making awesome money, and If I pay my laons for 120 payments I will get a tax free forgiveness, and i have a pension.

personalfinance,Student loan repayment or refund?,"I am currently in school and have taken out a private loan to pay for my education. I chose the variable interest rate with repayments while I'm still in school. The minimum repayment on it is $25 per month. I can also refund whatever money I don't use at the end of the year and interest won't be charged on it and the amount will be taken off my total loan am (if refund $1000 of a $7000 it's like I only took out $6000). The monthly payments, which I usually pay more than the minimum, pay the interest and decrease how much I  have to pay back once I graduate. My question is will refunding how much I don't use and make just the minimum payments save me more money or just making more than the minimum payments each month save me more money over time?

P.s. my refunding what I don't use i mean that I save how much ever I would pay in addition to the minimum payments each month like if my minimum was $25 and I wanted to pay a $100 I would just save the 75 for each month and refund the  900 at the end of the year.

My wife and I have pretty much been on IBR since graduation from grad school (my wife graduated in 2008, and I graduated in 2012).  We've been watching our spending over the years and were fortunate enough to save up a lot of money over the years given our lower IBR payment.  We've paid for our wedding, vacation each year, purchased a nice home, made home renovations, etc., and still have $100,000 cash in our savings, with no other debt other than student loans and mortgage.  Our monthly IBR payment for both our federal loans is currently $2,114.00  ($1,516.82 for my loans, and $592.68 for my wife), and we pay another $126.49/month for my wife's 1 private student loan.


We net approximately $10,500/month after taxes (my salary is $100k and my wife's is $115k, and we file married filing jointly).  My initial plan was to stay on IBR and make the minimum IBR payments for 25 years, but given the significant money we have managed to save and continue to save each month, I started thinking I might be better off aggressively paying off my loans, targeting the highest interest rates, especially since my $100k is just sitting in a savings account.  We are saving approximately $20k/year.  But I have a few questions before I pull the trigger. 


If I decide to go the pay-off-student-loan route, what’s the best strategy?  Ideally, I’d like to save another $50k to total $150k in savings, and then throw $100k at our loans (leaving a $50k safety net), targeting the loans with the highest interest.  That will pay off approximately half our student loan debt, leaving approximately $117k in debt left.  


But what happens to our IBR payment once I pay $100k?  I know the IBR payment will never be higher than the total 10-year payment for me and my wife's loans (which I THINK is $2,537.32 total, but am not sure).  If my new IBR payment for our reduced $112k student loan debt will be LESS than my current one for our $217k debt ($2,114.00), then I'll be able to save even more money each month which I can use to target the remaining $112k debt even faster.  Can anyone estimate what my new payment will be after I've paid $100k at our current $217 debt?  


Is this a wise idea or am I better off staying on IBR paying ~ $2k/month for 25 years and hope for forgiveness?  I'd prefer to be debt free and keep our $10.5k/month income to ourselves rather than pay Great Lakes/Navient.

personalfinance,"(US/Florida) How to handle ""Identity theft"" without actual monetary loss?","I'm a retired federal employee and was involved in the massive data breach from the OPM last year. 1 month ago my auto insurance carrier allowed a fraudster to open online access to my account information per a phone call because the fraudster knew my name, SSN, birthdate, wife's name, wife's birthdate. The fraudster changed the email address associated with my account, and I was notified (by email to the ""old"", correct email address) of the change so I called and found out about the fraud. Nothing was stolen or taken from me - they could look at my auto insurance policy and pay my bill (they didn't pay it ;(  ).

After that, I put a fraud alert (90 day security alert) at one of the 3 credit bureaus (who said they would contact the other 2). I also contacted all of my financial accounts and informed them of the breach and did whatever they suggested to 'harden' my accounts (2FA, new passwords, new security questions, deleting my SSN from their active records, whatever each one suggested). 

Yesterday I got a letter from a bank that handles PayPal Credit cards -- somebody applied for PayPal credit using my name and address. The application was rejected, per the letter, because ""certain elements of the transaction varied significantly from typical consumer purchase behaviors"".

I'm also enrolled (by the Office of Personnel Management) in a credit and identity monitoring service for ""3 years"". 

After I got the letter from PayPal's bank, I went to the FTC website to fill out an identity theft affidavit -- but it appears to me that this step is pretty much worthless unless you also file a police report (to combine with the affidavit), and I don't think I could file a police report because nothing was actually stolen! The auto insurance carrier (who is a general financial company by the way with credit cards etc) ""fixed"" the problem before any actual theft, and the PayPal bank did not grant the fraudulent credit application.

So what can an identity theft victim do who definitely has had his identity taken, and multiple attempts to commit fraud are known, but none have been successful?  Just wait for an actual episode of theft or loss? Is there anything else that is proactive that one could do?

I'm sure its nothing, but I figured it doesn't hurt to ask.

&amp;nbsp;
 
""Pricing Disclosures: Introductory rate of 0% for 21 months from date of account opening on purchases and an introductory rate of 0% for 21 months from date of first transfer for balance transfers. Balance transfers must be completed within 4 months of account opening. After the introductory period ends, the standard purchase APR will be applied to unpaid introductory balances, new purchases and new balance transfers. The standard variable APR for purchases and cash advances is 13.24%, 16.24%, 19.24%, 21.24% or 23.24%, based on your creditworthiness""   So the part I'm concerned about is ""Balance transfers must be completed within 4 months of account opening.""

That just means that they need to be set up not paid off, correct? This is probably a very stupid question but I just figured its something I should be 100% clear on before committing to a transfer.

Finally, does any one have experience with these cards? Which is more favorable? I have no experience with Citi, just Chase and Discover.

i'm currently living on my own, working full time (also have taken the last 2 semesters off in order to work). i don't make a whole lot, so of course i've been living paycheck to paycheck the last few months. the interest rates for the private loans must've increased or the payments themselves increased since i'm not currently in school and i straight up can't afford them, along with all my other bills. my mom suggested taking out a loan from a bank with a lower interest rate to refinance the amount i currently owe to salliemae. my credit isn't great since i obviously owe a crazy amount in student loans and i know i have a couple of medical bills in collection that i can't afford either (most from years ago that i had no idea existed until i checked my credit report recently). 


i was approved for a capitalone credit card a few months ago that i've been paying off religiously to improve my credit, but honestly i think my mom's idea of me being approved for a refinancing loan is a pipe dream of sorts.

I brought the down payment up to 20% which dropped the rate back down to that at 10% down. The final costs of this house breaks down to, 1.25m at 20% down, 1.48m at 15%, and 1.41m at 10% down. How can I be sure I don’t fall in to this “15%” trap?",finance,1474844021

personalfinance,"Do income-based repayment (IBR) monthly charges increase as one accrues more student debt? Or is it solely dependent on the income, blind to the actual debt amount?","I couldn't find a straight answer from Google, searching this forum, or asking around, or even asking FedLoan and FAFSA directly, so I apologize if there is an obvious answer.

This is coming up particularly in relation to my current student debt situation. I'm starting graduate school this fall, and am depending on federal loans to afford it. I'm 32, $20k in debt from undergrad (graduated '09), and expecting to add $40k more to that debt for the next two years of my grad program. I make ~60k annually and am paying $240/month IBR.

**1) So my primary question (as in the title) is regarding whether my IBR plan through FedLoan will remain at $240/month (assuming my income stays the same), or if I can expect it to triple along with the size of my debt.**

If you're willing to get a little further into the weeds:

It is my intent to make my loan payments monthly in order to utilize Public Service Loan Forgiveness after 10 years. As I understand it, my Undergrad Debt ($20k) will be separate from my New Loans ($40k). So, being 2 years into my Undergrad Debt **now**, if I keep making payments I will receive forgiveness in 8 more years. Starting New Loans **now**, it will be 10 years from when I start making payments where I will receive forgiveness. So my next consideration:

**2) Since they're on different time-tables, will these two sets of loans affect each others' IBR level? (ie, FedLoan will consider them all as one total amount), OR will they be treated entirely separately? (ie, my Undergrad Debt will remain on $240/mo IBR and my New Loans will start at $240/mo or higher separately from the UD)**

...And if you're amazingly *still* with me, and willing to offer an opinion, I'd love to hear about:

3) Heading into Grad School and adding this new $40k of debt, would it benefit me to defer my Undergrad Debt payments for 2 years of grad school so I can hang onto that $240/mo of cash? Or would I be better served by continuing to make the payments so it will be forgiven sooner?

personalfinance,Buy a House or Invest? (Seattle),"Hi All,

Would love some perspective on my finances.  I am at a crossroads and not certain what to do.  I have far to much money in savings and need to either invest or buy a house.  I live in Seattle and the housing market is unique to say the least.

Assets:
401k: 56k 
Company stock: 32k 
Cash in savings: 72k 
Rental property equity: 87k 

Debt:
6k on my car @ 2.9% (475/m)
144k Mortgage on rental property @ 4.1% (1300/m).  House Value = 231k

Income:
$13,250/m Salary (current base + last years bonus. Base is $11,600)
$1450/m Rental Income (Is mostly a net 0 for money flow perspective)

Budget: ($5,100/m)
$1,400/m rent and utilities
$1,300/m Rental Mortgage 
$475 car payment (Could pay off, but value liquid cash)
$525 misc semi-fixed monthly costs
$1,400 food + fun

Investments: ($4,250/m)
$1,500/m 401k (Company matches 50% up to IRS limit)
$1,750/m Employee Stock Program (With intent on immediately flipping for small risk free gain.  Haven't sold in a while because my company's stock is strong right now)
$1,000/m Savings

I currently rent a large house and sublet rooms.  I would do similar if I were to buy a house.

The struggle I am having is that to buy a house that I want would require considerable leveraging.  I am looking in the 800k-1mil range.  Monthly cash flow is not as big of a deal for me, as I would rent out rooms, bringing in $1.5k-$2.5k depending on house.  I also am fine reducing my investments to only 401k.

I have 100k liquid cash, but would want to keep reserves.  I also have up to 23k available in a 401k loan and up to 40k with a HELOC.  Fully leveraged I could have 165k in cash and would be looking at a 80/10/10 loan. Comparing this to a traditional loan with PMI makes me think this is a better route.  I have 810+ credit. 

Mortgage math on a 825k house:
90/10 83k down payment: 4,580/m with $844/m in tax savings and 148k needed to remove PMI (357/m)
80/10/10 165k down payment: $4,332/m with $716/m in tax savings and 76k needed to payback HELOC and 401k.(490/m)

With the Fed signalling prime rate hikes, elections right around the corner, and my general opinion that we will be moving into a recession soon I am torn at what to do.  Seattle is also among the top 5 hottest regions for real estate.  There are signs of it slowing down, and possibly dipping for the first time in a while.  If I buy a house I would attempt to position myself to be ready in 3-6 months.

What would you do in my shoes?  Buy an over leveraged house in a hot market? (~36-41% debt:income).  Invest in the stock market when it's at near all-time high and 8+ years with no recession?  Continue to sit on cash losing to inflation?  Other Options?

I realize my questions have a tinge of speculation applied, but we are in unique times.  Would love to hear others opinions on what my best options are.

Or even as long as the final wallet which made the illegal purchase cannot be proven that it was you who owns it. 

Otherwise, it seems like there would be tons of stories of people who bought bitcoins  facing federal investigation at some point, because somewhere along the line some coins they spent went to someone who then bought something illegal and got caught?

personalfinance,"31 years old, making six figures, and I'm pretty sure I'm screwed. Really need some advice here.","Hey everyone, here is my situation.

I'm 31 working for a large financial institution in the IT space. I've been a contractor for the past 10 years, and I've just accepted my job as a full-time employee at this firm. I'm married, no kids, car, and a mortgage. I feel like I'm drowning here fellas.

Long story short: I screwed up early in my academic career and ended up going to an ITT-like place that ended up making me sign into a bad loan. I had no education on finance or loans at the time, no money, and no scholarships. I worked full time to pay for my community college classes for two years after that when I couldn't find a job. I then went to a private university for my BS and a state university for my MS in my field. However, my job couldn't cover all of it, so I had to take out loans. For context, I graduated my undergrad in 2011 and my graduate program in 2013.

Summary of all that is this: My student loans total $102,062, APR is listed at 7.97%. Right now they are split between my federal loans which I've reconsolidated from my 4+ vendors into one (navient), and AES. My original parent plus loan (for the unaccredited program) is also with Navient, and is technically owned by my mother but I pay it. This brings me up an extra $25,259.00 @ 7.65%. 

Bringing my grand fuckedness from loans to $127,321.00 in the hole.
 
My new base salary is sitting at $110,000 a year, 8% annual bonus at year end. I also have full benefits (vision, dental, medical) and a 401k roth that I contribute 15% of every check into with my employer doing a direct match up to 4%, and then an annual contribution of 6% of my total salary (with bonus). They also have an employee stock purchase plan which I use 2% of my check towards. 
At the end of all this, and all my contributions /taxes my monthly take home comes out to be $5,566.82. 

Now, my bills and my loan payments, maybe a night or two a month out with the wife, total (approximately) around $3291. With loans equating out to be around $1,231.76 a month at minimum payments. 

So if you take my take home and subtract my bills / loans you get: $2,275.82 of liquidity. 

My bank account right now is sitting at $10,000 in savings, $5,250 in checking, and credit score if it matters is 730.

I really have no idea how to put that $2,275 to work, I like to keep it in case of emergencies. I am constantly thinking about those loans and how far in the hole I am, and it makes me struggle with trying to find side gigs, learn something new, etc... but utlimately leaves me depressed.

personalfinance,Is PSLF worth it for me or should I just pay off my loans completely?,"I'm not sure if you guys would be able to help me, I also posted this in the student loan subreddit as well. 




 have 2 student loans, a direct subsidized loan for $12,600 and a direct unsubsidized loan for $3,700. Both loans have a 4.9% interest rate. I am currently in the REPAYE plan (I have been enrolled since April 2015) and my payments are currently $0 a month because at the time when I applied I was working at a job that did not meet the hourly requirements for PSLF and my second job was not eligible at all.




Since then, I have started working full time as a nurse at an eligible not for profit hospital system. I work 36 hours a week and make $30.29 per hour plus $3.55 an hour shift differential. I will have to renew/update my repayment plan in April. After using the loan payment calculator it looks like if I continue in the REPAYE plan my payments will be in the 300-400 range to be paid over 51 months with no loan forgiveness. Or I can go to a standard plan and pay 172 a month for 120 months, also with no loan forgiveness.




In the long run, the REPAYE plan will be cheaper if I make only the minimum monthly payments. I will end up paying 18k total as opposed to 20.6k in the standard plan.




I could probably afford the 300-400 monthly payments under the REPAYE option, but that is only because I still live at home and have minimal bills (car, insurance, phone bill, and credit cards that are paid off in full every month plus any extras that I may need such as clothing or medical things that may pop up). I would like to move out of my mom's house and in with my boyfriend in the near future, which worrisome if I plan on taking on a $300 extra monthly bill.




Here's where I'm not getting it. I thought PSLF was a loan forgiveness plan meaning that whatever is not paid off in 120 months is forgiven. However, on the loan repayment calc no matter what plan I pick, the projected forgiveness is $0. Is this because my loan debt isn't high enough? What plan do you guys think would be the best option? If it helps, my monthly bills are as follows... 




Car lease - 344 


Car insurance - 92 


Phone bill - 42 


Credit cards - 200-300 depending on my spending for the month. 


(I have a Barclay Apple Rewards card that I opened in August 2016 to buy a new laptop. I have 18 month interest free financing. The balance on that card is currently $1,400, I have been paying $200 a month on it and will have it completely paid off in no more than 7 months. I also have a CC though my bank that various small things like Netflix and HBO Now gets charged to plus any incidentals, the balance on that card rarely exceeds $100. This gets paid in full every month)




My last paycheck was a little over $1,600. However, I have since signed up for benefits through my employer and that will deduct about $70 per paycheck. I get paid every other week. My first paycheck of the month covers my bills and the second check of the month goes into my savings. I currently have 8.4k in savings.

My credit score is about 750 (so good not great) and I make 60k a year (take home is $1590 every 2 weeks)

With the interest rates I have now I'm pretty sure I definitely want to consolidate my loans with a lower rate. Are there any downsides to doing this though? (i.e. will my score plummet because I'll be closing out 4-8 loans that haven't been open that long or is that mainly for CC?) 

I looked into SoFi and got pre-approved for **6.49% (Fixed) for 7 years**, **7%(Fixed) for 10 years**, **5.145% (Variable) for 7 years**, and **5.395% (Variable) for 10 years**. There are 15 and 20 year options as well but I really don't want those and shouldn't have a problem affording the 7 or 10 years. For the rate I got approved at I would only consolidate my private loans because the interest rate of the federal is still lower. 

I asked my mom to try and cosign with me to try and lower the rates down but I'm not sure how much lower they would go. But if they were low enough I would like to consolidate all 8 loans so that I have one consistent bill every month (which is why I'd also prefer a fixed rate I think).

personalfinance,How to handle my remaining student loans,"Hi all! Just wanted to mention I originally posted this in the Moronic Monday thread. I received two answers that conflicted each other so I wanted to bring my question to a bigger audience.

Currently, according to Studentloans.gov, I have a total of $10,540 outstanding at a 3.564% rate.

The break out is as follows, all three of them were Direct Subsidized Loans:  
-$3,025, September 2011, 3.4%  
-$3,760, August 2012, 3.4%  
-3,755, September 2013, 3.86%  

Details on my available repayment plans, and my ""total amount paid"" chart are in the following link:

http://imgur.com/a/yn6Fq

My question: Currently I'm paying $500 a month. Per Neltnet, I am on the Standard Repayment Plan, so I've been vastly overpaying each month for quite some time now.

Per Studentloans.gov, in the imgur link, if I followed the ""Revised Pay as You Earn"" payment plan, my monthly payment would range from $352 to $397, and my total amount paid would be $11,042 for a $10,540 loan, so I'd be paying about $502 interest, and it'd take me 33 more months to pay my loans.

My question: Should I lower my monthly payment? I originally was considering dropping some big lump sums on my remaining loan balance (maybe $5k this month) but if I could stretch out this loan over 33 months and only pay $500 in interest, am I better off doing that?

The first answer I got was no, if you can afford to, pay it off asap because that means less debt, which is true, but the other answer (and this was more in line with what is as thinking) was that the cost of dragging what's remaining of my loans out is very low due to the low interest rate, so I should make minimum payments in order to be able to save for something else (more money in IRA, 401k, saving for big purchase, etc)

So, what do you guys think?

Basically, Fidelity won't manage my mutual funds anymore. They had to sell some Fidelity-specific mutual funds, but I was able to keep most of their current mutual funds before they stopped managing them. I can no longer purchase mutual funds, and if I sell the current ones I have, I cannot rebuy them. So now I got a decent amount of cash just sitting in an individual account on Fidelity (along with a bunch of mutual funds). They told me my only options are to purchase stocks or ETF's. I always had a ""set it and forget it"" mentality so doing a lot of research on what to buy isn't really my cup of tea. I'm not very knowledgeable about ETF's either. To my understanding, they're kinda a mix of stocks and mutual funds?

Does anyone have any suggestions on where to go from here? I'm honestly a big amateur when it comes to investments. Always just allowed Fidelity to handle my money. Preferably something I don't have to really worry about, but also not just gaining really poor interest rates from the banks. Thanks!",finance,1474909084
personalfinance,"$400,000 in student loan debt","Greetings PF,

I've done a lot of research regarding my tremendous student loan debt and read a variety of different posts on this sub. There is an overwhelming amount of money owed and various options for repayment. I'm not sure what is in my best interest despite a lot of research. I'd like to ask for some advice on my current situation. I graduated from veterinary school in 2013 and currently working in private practice making $95,000 per year before taxes. After taxes and deductions from my paycheck, I'm making about $4,800 per month. My salary will probably increase 15-20% total over the next few years at my current job. I have no supplemental income, but this is not totally out of the question. I have about $3,000 in personal savings and $15,000 in 401k.

Here is a summary of my situation:

1) Loans:
 
a) Principal balance: ~$350,000
b) Accrued interest: ~$50,000 (since graduating May 2013)
c) Loan types: (1) Direct unsubsidized stafford loan balances (6.8% interest rate) = Total balance: $216,458 + (2) Direct student plus loan (7.9% interest rate) = Total balance: $133,556 (these loans are the sum of about 20 different loans taken out during graduate school)

2) Monthly Expenses (total = $2,850)

a) Rent: $1,000
b) House bills/food: ~$800
c) Car insurance/payment: ~$350
d) Loan payment on IBR: ~$700

3) Current Repayment Plan:

a) Income Based Repayment Plan. My understanding is that the loan balance is forgiven after 25 years on this plan, however I will pay a large amount upon forgiveness as the forgiven amount is taxable income. The problem with the minimum payments required by IBR is that the interest accruing far exceeds what I'm paying each month. I've been throwing extra money each month towards the higher interest loans, but I am not paying them nearly as aggressively as I need to be.

4) Other options to be considered:

a) Public loan student forgiveness: I work part time for two 501(c3) cat rescue organizations as a volunteer veterinarian. The problem here is that eligibility for PLSF requires the rescues to pay me a salary as a full time employee. This program allows 10 year loan forgiveness and exemption from being taxed on the forgiven amount. This option appeals to me for obvious reasons, however I would need to leave private practice, work in non-profit full time and be making significantly less salary (probably between $50,000 and $60,000 per year working for a shelter or rescue). There is also the very concerning consideration that there are no guarantees that the government will keep this program in place for the next 10 years.

b) Refinance/consolidation: Based on my research thus far, consolidating my loans is not in my best interest. Something more promising I've looked into is taking out new loans from a private lender at a lower interest rate to pay down some of my higher interest loans (7.9%). SoFi.com has been mentioned to me by one financial advisor I consulted. I have an excellent credit rating and no credit card debt.",finance,1474911755
personalfinance,Should I take out a personal loan to pay off credit card debt?,"So I have been pretty irresponsible financially lately, and have racked up about 11k in credit card debt.

personalfinance,"I will never buy another house again, hopefully, this will help some of you future home buyers.","Buying a house was the most stressful and worst experiences of my life.  I am SO thankful I was the only person who was signing for the house.

I do not see how on earth owning a home is cheaper.  Except for maybe in retirement but with all the potential money I could have saved I could have just paid rent and been sitting on a couple million by the time I retire.

* Home insurance is $1000 a year vs Renter insurance that is $60 a year. I could invest $940 every year for the rest of my life.
* Mortgage is $450 vs my rent which is $650, however, I am not liable for the water heater, AC, plumbing, or the million other things that can break in a house.  Oh and by the way, the Rental Property Owners will put me in a hotel while they replace/fix water heaters or AC units.  The money I need to have set aside for costly repairs could be invested, instead of sitting around in a low yield account with ease of access.
* I have a free pool, gym, free car wash &amp; vacuum, discounts at local theaters, and other amenities.  Save money on not paying insurance for the pool, by the way.
* Never have to buy a lawn mower, fuel for it (or electricity), or hire someone to do it.  All this money could have been invested instead.
* Never have to worry about losing money due to closing costs and agent commissions.  Please, god let me gain immense equity to cover $5000+ dollars in closing costs.
* Taxes, $1500 a year.  Man, that would be so nice blow on a small vacation.
* Water and Trash are free, now I have to pay $30 dollars a month.
* Upkeep of the house takes a lot more time, which means I spend less time doing the things I like.  Some of the things I like to do earn money!
* Money lost on interest that I will never get back, all of that interest money I could have invested.  It would have been probably a nice 500K in earnings over 40 Years (huge guess, don't quote this).
* Married couples, how do you even live?  All the money you would lose to decorations, changing paint colors, or new furniture because the lady is tired of it or you yourself, bleh.  You can paint a apartment, oh and by the way, the Complex will give you free paint to paint it back to the original color if you move out.
* Have in home networking and audio lines runs, I can do it myself at the house or pay someone to do it.  The cost of paying someone would pay for several nice meals at decent restaurants.
* A temporary hit of 79 points to my credit score, which use to be 804.  Good luck qualifying for 0% interest on anything, anytime soon.
* Moving expenses.  Gas, boxes, gas, truck rental, beer and food for friends who helped.
* Breaking your lease could cost you lots of money, in my case it would have been $845.00, luckily they waived it.

The paper work is insane and outright ludicrous, thank the heavens I am a sole owner.

* FHA loan, get gift money, bank needs Bank Statements from gift lender, if they refuse, no loan for you.
* Oh you want to switch loans because of the previous stipulation because the gift lender doesn't want to fork over the information. We have to re-run your credit.  Oh we see your credit declined 79 points, here is a worse interest rate.
* We see you spent $300 dollars in your bank statement, can you please write a letter explaining this expenditure, maybe it was for the the home inspection required by the loan.... or it was for hookers, who cares I have 20K sitting in my account waiting to give to you, that doesn't even include the other 10K.
* We need a letter explaining why your Check(cheque) address is different than your current address, maybe because I haven't used a check since 2006 and the world has moved on, yet you are still behind.
* We need a letter from your employer explaining why you work off-site and not at the given address, uh again, it's the 21st century, I don't have to work at the office.
* We need 3 pay stubs (not a big deal), 3 bank statements (not a big deal), and the last 3 years of W-2's (not a big deal).
* Sign a million forms saying that you are single and buying this house.
* Give this person $1000 Earnest Money, we need proof it came out of the same account and that the check didn't bounce.  you can't use earnest money towards your down payment.
* We need a letter explaining why you spent $250 dollars, it's called bills, you can see it on the Bank Statement.
* Give out your social security number, bank account numbers, and other personal information to 5 different people whom you've never met.  How do I know you guys are secure?
* We need proof you had a home inspection, pest inspection, and appraisal, the receipt isn't enough, we also need the print out the service that was completed.


If you are looking to buy a house, be prepared to bleed money like someone just cut your arm off.  I'm never buying another home. Never again.

Someone explain to me how owning a house is cheaper?  Insurance and interest alone is worth a nice chunk of change itself, especially if your investment doubles every 7 years.  I do not see how owning home is cheaper, in any city, no matter where you live.  The house I purchased was $160K, a semi safe area with average schools.

personalfinance,"$15k windfall, payoff car loan or CC debt","I just recieved $15k and have $15k left on my 5 year car loan with 4 years left and $15k in  CC debt. 

The interest rates are higher on my credit cards so I figured its a no brainer to pay those off. The car itself is worth $25k if I did it today (theoretically) 


I haven't been very good with my finances however in the past 6 months have curbed my spending and use of credit cards. I don't have a mortgage and live rent free. My car is the only thing of value that I own. 

With all that being said,should i pay off my car loan and own 100%of it or pay off my credit cards. Is it possible to pay off the car, take out a loan against the car for better rate to pay off and consolidate my credit card debt? Is that even a good idea?",finance,1474918751
personalfinance,15k debt solution? (uk),"Im looking for some advice here. I've seen it dished out plentifully before and hoping someone can offer something.

So I'm 15k in debt to 3 credit cards and one credit account.  The cards are very bad interest rates - 30/40% for two (which are 3k each) and the other is reasonable low interest and is 7k.  Credit account is remaining 2k and not too bad interest. 

Im want to get rid of the debt so I've just taken out a loan to pay them off. However, Im a little unsure if I want to just cancel the load and deal with this a different way. 

At this point the debt is costing me just shy of 600 per month pre loan.  The loan will comfortably pay off the debt and but will cost me 370 a month for 5 years - 18.9% apr with my 'good' credit rating. 

I decided to go for the loan because it will leave me with cash left over after i've paid it each month, rather than paying credit cards and having to use them again/watching a good amount of my monthly repayments being taken off as interest - never ending one step forward / two steps back. 

So - in short, my question is - Am I better off this way, for sure? To pay off the cards all at once, get shot of them and just have this higher than i would like payment to make - which is manageable and i feel much better than paying off large credit card bills, which i felt was rather unmanageable and not really getting me anywhere.  

Bonus question - will this have a positive affect of my credit rating?  Losing credit cards for a loan of the same amount??

It might seem like im asking a bit late, as i've already signed for the loan. But it can be cancelled within 14 days (also will this affect my credit rating in a negative way if i did that?)

My sister is wheelchair bound after a botched brain tumor surgery that caused her to have a stroke during surgery (THIS is not the topic for discussion). She and her husband bought the house around 10 years ago. The house has depreciated in value since their purchase which means they cannot take out a loan against the house. Her and her husband are both teachers, which means they don't make a whole lot. ESPECIALLY in Florida.

What I would like to help her with is some info on where to look/who to talk to about assistance to help make the house easier for her to navigate through. Widen the walls in the hallway, make the bathroom more handicap accessible, make the kitchen more accessible to her, etc.
Is there maybe a federal assistance program? State? County? She went to the University of Florida in Gainesville, might your alma mater have something to look into for alumni?

As a matter of why I'm asking this; since I was 20, I've paid for nearly all of my expenses, and I've only recently been able to save money (much of my stocks were inherited and are slowly being transferred to the Roth). My income has been between $30 - $40 since 2010, and my rent has been extremely high ($1000 for a room in a 4BR apartment) because I've lived in an expensive town. Despite the high rent, the apartments haven't been great, and I would like to upgrade my lifestyle a bit, starting with a nicer apartment.

However, I still feel uncomfortable about renting a place at $1600 when I can just as easily find not-so-great apartments for $600 that are sometimes 3BR apartments as opposed to the 2BR I'm currently looking at.

I think I can afford it. But I would like a sanity check, and I welcome any other suggestions for ways to save for retirement and/or invest.

personalfinance,Paid off a chunk of student loan to help CS for auto financing. Yea or nay?,"26yr, EE grad. So I'm planning on buying a new/1yr-used car (&lt;20k w/ large down) so I'm trying to increase my CS to help increase finance options. 

&gt;I know some of you are going to say to just get a beater/used car but I've already read around for that. Currently on a 20mpg car worth less than 2k and is 100% failing CA smog check. I'm still looking around to get the lowest price so I won't be purchasing any time soon anyways (probably not this year even).

My student loan amount is only $3k but I decided to pay $1k of it recently (I can pay it off all at once but I've been told not to). I mainly did this to help increase my credit score since it's been in deferment (federal subsidized/still in school) and BOA is saying that it's holding back my credit score due to the original loan/remaining loan ratio. 

My credit score also dropped from BOA (I just started using their FICO monitoring feature last month) only so I also assumed that since I haven't started paying the loan yet. This dropped before I paid the $1k though. 

* Should I just stick to the normal monthly payments or should I get the ratio down to 1:3 or something to increase my CS?

* Should I pay a large deposit down (I still have a decent safety net) on a 2016/2017 used/new civic so my monthly isn't that high or just stick with a higher loan (assuming low APR) and invest?

Little background about me. College student, make a little over 30k a year on salary, no debt, no car payment. 

I have already talked to a financial advisor just overseeing options with the money. Opened a new bank account with a little higher interest rate nothing great. I've had the money for a solid month now and have touched it at all still living off my paychecks from work. 

I've talked to a few tax professionals and some professional gamblers, but can't seem to get a definite answer on these high of winnings. Im scheduling a appointment with a tax lawyer to talk to someone a bit more educated in the subject. 

I know i have to list this in my income as ""other income"" and i can deduct losses, but i haven't done a very good job at keeping a journal (dumb, i know). I could go to the casinos and get printouts of wins and losses, but they even state that there numbers shouldn't be used for accounting purposes as they are not accurate. I definitely don't want to get in trouble and report wrong losses against my winnings. Now for the questions, can i to bank statements that show withdrawals from casinos and start a journal of wins/losses now?

All i filled out at the casino was my SSN and my signature. They offered to pay me in cash, but i felt more comfortable taking a check. Was this the wrong choice?

Lastly, lets say worst case scenario i cant deduct any losses. How much can i be expected to pay in taxes, 25%?

gaming,Battlefield One discussion.,"Hello there everyone, how goes it on your end?
So, earlier today I preordered the Early Enlister edition and it got me excited. I felt like it was time for a good 'ol Battlefield debate. There's always been such a variety of choices in these games that I've always found great diversity among each playstyle; no soldier plays exactly the same as another. 
Moving back into the Beta earlier this month DICE's new creation feels as moldable as ever.
The map included in the beta was fantastic, the scenery was awesome to look at, the city/desert idea led to some great battles and the flags were actually set up in great spots. Even better, very little server malfunctions! Also, the cavalry unit is absolutely epic. I did find the periodic sandstorms to be beyond annoying; if you were flying a plane you're pretty much fucked. The weapons are very well modeled and I didn't find very many issues with weapon balance personally. I did find the Benet-Mercié to be one of the most incredibly effective LMG's I've ever brought into the online battlefield, but I doubt it was due to balancing issues. The SMG's felt a bit too powerful to me, especially the Automatico Modele 1918. Nothing could beat that firerate.
Now, onto the other side of the debate..
The tanks, the elephant in the room. Now, I don't believe specifically that they're overpowered or should be nerfed. If any tank is driven poorly, you will get smacked faster than you can rotate your turret. I do like the new repair mechanic as you have a greater chance of driving off a certain enemy vehicle for a time and it makes the drivers play smarter. As for being overpowered..I don't think so. If anything add a slight damage boost to the anti tank grenades.
The Landship is very easy to counter, just stay in its blind spot. The Heavy Tank is a different animal, but it has trouble defending itself from a distance, not to mention its sluggish and has a very high silhouette. If any tank were to be overpowered, it is without a doubt the 75mm version of the Light Tank. I couldn't believe how effective it was. Fired fast, reloaded fast, was hard to spot due to the FT-17 being a tiny thing and that splash damage! My god! If I had to balance anything, I'd remove its coaxial machine gun and lower its ammunition capacity. 
I also had great luck in planes, but the fighter is horribly outclassed and undergunned. I shot down more planes with the Attack Plane. Contrary to popular belief, the Bomber is actually an extremely deadly machine and defiently not impossible to use. Just fly out of the cliffs whenever you make an attack run then climb out of there as soon as possible. Use the Barrage Bomber kit. Properly played, you can strike fear into any mechanized unit. 
The artillery truck, however, I didn't get to play more than maybe three times. The gun it runs is practically a mounted version of the wheeled cannons placed around the map (FK-96). Does anyone have any info on how to use this vehicle properly?

What do you think they should change, buff or raise?
Have a great day, everyone. See you on the battlefield.

(Also, I never got to use the Flanker version of the light tank and I'm curious on how it performed. Anyone out there who preferred to pilot this variant?)",technology,1474966818

What next steps can I make to keep this upward trend?","I've worked hard this past summer to pull myself from debt and fix a tarnished credit score years after years of grad school poverty and bad budgeting. I've fixed a lot of things but want to see if anyone has recommendations of where to go now.

* May -- FICO score 590 -- 4 CCs open maxed out at about $3500. Graduated grad school and started my first real career job. Started an emergency fund that will be 3 months worth of my income after a year of saving (can't do much more at my income level of 38k). 

* June -- FICO score 623 -- Paid off **all** my CC debt. I was lucky to receive an extra $3000 at the same time as my first paycheck so I threw it all to CC debt. Also, happened to get an invite to Citi's Double Cash Back card. Took the card and started funneling all expenses through it while paying it off fully once a week. 

* July -- FICO score 657 -- Closed 2/4 of my old CCs that were less than my average length of credit history and had an annual fee. Now left with only Citi Double Cash Back (my main), Discover (for 5% on categories), and Capital One (no benefits. But my oldest card at 7 yrs with no annual fee so I'm keeping it open to keep my average length of credit history up). 

* July -- FICO score 680 -- Refinanced my car from 12% to 5%. Nothing else new here other than after tracking my budget through Mint I realized I spend $800 on food and started working to cut that in half.

* August -- FICO score 692 -- Nothing new. I considered opening an airlines card for a signup bonus to visit home (haven't seen family in a year). But decided I'll stick with Citi Double for now.

* September -- FICO score 705 -- I feel great about where I've come. No CC debt. Receiving monthly rewards of $30. Good credit score for the first time ever. $1000 in savings since May and growing. Also $500 in an HSA. 

Today, other than my regular expenses I have $600 left each month. I'm currently putting $500 into esavings, $100 into HSA, and $100 into travel (again, haven't seen my family in a year).

personalfinance,Help comparing closing costs from different lenders,"Hi everyone - first time home buyer here who just went under contract, and I am trying to pick a lender based on a bunch of quotes/fee sheets, but it does not feel easy to make a comparison. I'm hoping someone can help straighten me out! :)

In terms of the financial aspect (not closing speed or ease of working with the lender), how do you compare them? Is it best to look at the total overall ""closing costs"" on the fee sheets? It seems like some of them are missing certain fees, or have different amounts for 3rd party fees, which I figured would be the same from lender to lender. They also seem to have some variation in calculating pre-paid items.

So, which line items should I specifically focus on to find the actual difference between lenders?

* Interest paid after e.g. 5 years for that interest rate
* Origination/underwriting fee (these are the same, right?)
* Credit report fee
* Closing settlement?
* Recording, escrow, and title insurance fees are all picked by the seller, correct, so should therefore be ignored when comparing lenders?

Because of the severity of my injury, the settlement funds will be put into a 1st party Special Needs Trust (d4A). The SNT allows me to recieve the pi settlement/award without disqualification from public benefits, like SSI or Medicaid. Medicaid is the only form of insurance that will pay for the long term home care that I require. 

The principal PI settlement is tax free. But any income generated through investments in the trust is taxable. UNLESS, that investment vehicle is a structured settlement (annuity). A Structured Settlement annuity provides income that is exempt from federal and state income tax. 

I need help deciding whether to take the lump sum and invest a chunk of it in mutual/index funds, or taking a mixture of both a lump sum and structured settlement (SS). I'm no expert investor but the low rate of return in a SS makes me think id be better off taking the funds that would pay for the SS and invest it through other vehicles and pay taxes.

personalfinance,car refinance conundrum,"So, a bit of background on this common conundrum; I bought a new 2015 some time ago, but due to there being some money left over on the loan from the car I traded in, this car now has upside equity. I have tried to refinance twice: the first time was after a year car of owning the car, and I was told to come back in six months and the equity should be balanced, tried to refinance the car again recently and the equity is still unbalanced so I could not be offered the full loan amount.

Seems a clear cut case of ""too bad, so sad"", but now I find myself wondering what my options are. While I can afford to keep paying the ridiculously high payment (400, yikes), the interest rate is abysmal (10%, double yikes), and my car is... a Chevy Sonic...yeah. I was originally told at the dealership that I could just refinance with GM in a year, only to realize later that GM Financial doesn't actually refinance and I was blatantly lied to (my fault, should of fact checked but let my desperation blind me).   

The amount left on my loan is 18,000. My credit union could only offer me 14,500 but with a much better interest (below 5%) and monthly payment rate. Naturally, however, I don't have 4,000 just laying around to cover the difference, meaning I would have to take out another loan or use a credit card somewhere else. I've only tried two credit unions both times, but I don't want to risk too many hard pulls on my credit by pursuing other banks - am I right in thinking the results will be the same, or is there a chance someone would be willing to refinance the full amount despite the actual value of the car? 

Would it be a better option to just keep chipping away at my car payments (of which I usually add an extra $50 as I was trying to beat the  upside-down equity to begin with), and hope to refinance as a whole soon? Or would it be a better idea with such a high interest rate to refinance what I can and pay off a credit card with the difference? My credit score is average (690-700), and I do have two other lines of credit open, both below $500 left, but I only make 25k a year, so the income to debt ratio the car is causing to begin with is doing me no favors.

I have about $95k in my investment account (made up of mostly Vanguard index funds). Going with traditional loan with 20% down, I'd need to take out ~$60k for the down payment and closing costs. The monthly payment will be about $1,700 a month including property taxes and insurance. This leaves about $35k in my investment account for rainy days.

However, I've found that NASA FCU is offering a 0% down mortgage with no PMI. Going with this option, I can leave my investment account alone but will have a monthly payment of about $2k a month.

Which option makes more sense? I'm leaning more towards 0% down, since with the mortgage rate being so low, I will most likely make more money from the appreciation of my investment than the loan interests. My take home pay is about $4500 a month, so $2k a month is definitely doable. Is there any reason why I should go with the traditional route instead?",finance,1475026767
personalfinance,Would it be better to be debt free or buy a house?,"ok heres the skinny.

I will be graduating next year with 60-70k in debt for a masters degree. I currently could afford to pay it off totally with enough left over only for emergency fund about 2-5k depending where I am. No other debts besides that.

So here is the deal, with federal loans if you have more than 60k you are automatically enrolled in the graduate repayment program which repays the debt over 30 years at a really low monthly (lets say $150). and I think it rises over time and you end up paying a fuck load over 30 years.

However, I am a librarian, work the public sector and or non profits. In this field, or any non profit if you make on time payments for 10 years any remaining balance is forgiven. 

So here is my question, do you pay it off right away at 65k lets say, or tempt fate at the loan forgiveness of $200 a month x 10 years or 24k (being generous)

Basically one way gets you debt free immediately how good would that feel! but the other if everything works saves me at a minimum 40k but I have that burden for at least 10 years.  

What would you do and why? Also I am 27, not a homeowner, I have not decided where I want to land on that yet since I have not finished school and who knows where life will take me.",finance,1475026839

personalfinance,US 23 years old just sold my house what do I do with profit?,"I am 23 years old living in the middle of the country. I had 2 houses, just sold my second one and moved into an apartment. My apartment rent is $1,100/month. The house I sold was purchased for 170k, sold for 212k will have about 40k cash after the transaction. My other house, I have rented out making $1,100 a month and the mortgage is about $950. It was purchased for 123k, I still owe about 110k on it. I have a 2013 F150 which I still owe about 20k on however the loan is 0%. The payment on it is about $650 a month. I have federal student loans that total about 10k at 6.8%, 4.something% and 3.5%. 

My salary is 95k /year which after taxes, insurance, 401k, stock purchase program ends up being about $4,400 /month. My 401k is valued at about 15k. And probably only about 5k in my bank account. No other debts or anything other than what I have mentioned here. 

My question is, what should my next move be? I am thinking I take 10k out of what I make off the house and pay off my student loans since those have interest. This leaves me with about 30k. What should I do with this money? I am not interested in buying another house for myself for at least a couple years so I am fine with renting an apartment. Ultimately I would like to be able to buy a 300k house with 20% down as my family house, however I am pretty far from that. So my biggest question is, what is the smartest thing I can do with 30k to help me get closer to that goal? I have thought about buying another rental property, a townhouse for 100k with 20% down, to build wealth however, the most idealistic return I can see is a profit of 2,500-4k a year on it. This would also leave me with another mortgage and make it harder to buy a house for myself if I needed one. I do have a serious girlfriend that we will probably be married and have kids together in the next 5 years.

personalfinance,Should I pay off credit card or car loan?,"Hello PF! A drunk driver totaled my car with an outstanding loan of $6,500 and a $259 monthly payment with a 6.5% interest rate. 

Their insurance just sent me a check for $4,300.

I also have 2 credit cards; 1 of them, at 23% APR, is almost maxed out at $3,450 and I've been making minimum payments while struggling to bring it down. 

The other CC has an $800 balance with a 12% APR. 

I went through 6 months of unemployment but now I have a job and I'm trying to get back on my feet. I have zero intention on defaulting or being late; I want my score to go up!

The predicament; my car did not have full coverage, therefore I am responsible for the balance. If I put the settlement check towards the car loan principal, I could pay it off much sooner than later, or I could add it to a new (used) car financing. 

I am tempted to use the money to pay off the credit cards and save on all the interest that I'm wracking in. 

My income is about $25,000 a year. If I use the settlement money to pay off the credit cards, I would have to make about $600/month payments to my car loan to pay it off in a year and I'm guessing that would save me interest money too. 

I work from home, so getting by without a car is not a problem. I can use the $10 uber or $35 car rental if needed.

Guide me lords of personal finance!

TL;DR: Got a $4,300 check. I should pay of my auto loan balance and still owe about $2,000 left on it. Or use the money to pay off $4,250 worth of credit cards with high interest rates.",finance,1475033651

&amp;nbsp;

I am a married 26yo who is in that time of my life where finances are starting to weigh heavily on my mind.  My wife and I take home about $92,000 after taxes and 401k/retirement contribution.  We are planning on starting a family within the next few years and want to purchase a house within 3-5 years.  We currently have $18,000 in the bank.  

&amp;nbsp;

I made a mistake of going to a very expensive grad school when I had offers elsewhere thinking that the prestigious nature of a school would help me in the future (don't get me wrong, I have a great job and have had great experiences because of my decision) but now I have about $130,000 in outstanding student loans.  Approximately $50,000 are Federal loans and $80,000 in private loans both around 6% interest.  I'm currently on a 15 year repayment plan making total payments of $1,100 per month ($800 to private, $300 to federal).  Other than that, our only other debt obligations are $340 car payment and $1,800 rent + standard living expenses a month. Our goal monthly is to put $1,000 into savings but we oftentimes fall short - we are working on getting a legitimate budget in place and sticking to it.

&amp;nbsp;

My wife and I have disagreements on how to best move forward with tackling the debt while also prioritizing family and future home purchase. So my questions to you are:

* Is it better to maintain cash flow and make standard payments on student loans and accept the fact that we'll pay a lot in interest?  The goal being that we could save more for a down payment per month
* OR, is it better to try to put all of our money we can each month into the debt and pay it off say in 10 years rather than 15? And understand that we may be without a house for an extra 5 years or so?
* Any other advice for managing a budget for two people who prioritize the above items?",finance,1475065796

personalfinance,Financed through Capital One; can I switch?,"So I ended up going to a dealership for the sole purpose of testing a used car to see if it was something I would be even remotely interested in. Long story short, I ended up buying the car with no prep. 


I ended up buying a used vehicle with 21,000 miles. I rushed into things and ended up tacking on an extended warranty (3 yr/36,000 miles) and dealership maintenance plan (4 years of oil changes...) which I ended up canceling because I realized that they aren't worth it (I have always done all of the work on my vehicles and for some reason the convenience of having someone else doing it seemed appealing to me for a little bit).


Anyways, the total that I ended up financing was about $28,500 (rounded for simplicity). Had I planned on making a purchase, I would have just gone to a local credit union and taken out a loan through them. However, I didn't have time so I let the dealership run their numbers (which included the local credit unions) and the cheapest interest rate that I could get was 4.99%. I told them I wasn't happy with that and was able to have them drop to 3.99%. The financing was done through Capital One as the lowest the Credit unions were offering was 6-7%. 


As stated earlier, I have cancelled the warranty and maintenance plans (which is about $3500.00 total) so that all goes back towards my loan putting my current total at $25,000. After reading a little bit, it seems like Capital One kind of sucks. My first payment is not until the beginning of November. Is there anything I can do NOW to lower my monthly payment? Is it possible to refinance through a different lender? Like, would I be able to go to a local credit union, apply for the loan and transfer it? I imagine when the dealership runs their numbers they have some sort of mark-up.

I've been lurking this sub for a while and have generally been following your advice. AKA built up E-Fund, contributing to 403(b), currently paying off debt in order of highest interest rate - just paid off $4000 in credit card debt!

Anyways, I'm moving on to my car loan (About $10,000 left on loan, $12,500 originally financed, 5 year loan, interest rate 7.45%). I'm in a position where I can put $1200/month towards the car loan and my official monthly payment is $247. I calculated that I would have it paid off in about 7-9 months versus the 4 more years that are on the loan. 

So my question - is it better to put that money aside and then pay off the loan in a bulk payment OR is it better to pay off $1200/month until the loan is done. I guess I'm worried about whether the monthly payment will go to principal or just go towards paying the next months payment and I'll still be paying interest.

The FAQ on CarMax says this: ""Any additional amount is applied to future payments, up to the next 3 payments, unless otherwise required by law. Any remaining amounts will be applied to the principal balance owed on your account."" 

I'm currently already 3 months ahead on payments, so does this mean that all of my current payments are going to principal? Sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm new to all the loan stuff and am dumb and basically purchased this car without doing any research.

gaming,I finally beat Battletoads this morning (and you can too). Tips included.,"Update: Beat it with no warps or continues used. [Pic](http://imgur.com/a/zyDKu).

Recently, I decided to revisit some of the games of my childhood that I couldn't beat. I've beaten plenty of hard games and even one life'd some of them, but there were two games that always kicked my butt: Ghosts N' Goblins &amp; Battletoads. So it was my goal to finally beat them. My NES croaked a few years ago, so I loaded up an emulator.

Ghosts N' Goblins went better than I expected. After about two weeks of solid practice, I beat both loops. I've done it several times since and even beat the first loop on one continue (the second loop is much harder). I attempted loop three but rage quit on stage 2 (the game goes on indefinitely, but you get the ending after the second loop). I do still die a lot, especially on the second loop, but I can beat it. The infinite continues really do help so much.

Since most never get far in either game, it can be hard to judge the relative difficulty of these games, but as someone who has now beaten both, I must say Battletoads is *much* harder than Ghosts N' Goblins. However, I believe even the average gamer can beat it. It just takes practice and planning. I'll try to give some tips to help.

I knew if I was going to do this, I needed to do it as legit as possible. Some would already say I compromised the integrity of the run by playing on an emulator, but at the very least, I decided to avoid save states and other cheats. I don't just mean that I avoided save states for my successful run. I mean I've never used save states, even for practice. This makes it much harder to get the practice in. For example, I was stuck on Level 9 (Terra Tubes) for a while. I knew I could beat it with practice, but it was hard to get the practice in, since I had to get through the other stages first, and since most of the first 8 stages aren't exactly easy, I'd hit Level 9 without many lives/continues left, leaving me only a few shots at practicing before I had to restart again. To reduce frustration, here is my tip: small steps. If you can barely make it to a level, you are not ready to beat that level. First focus on getting there on one continue.

I had a very close run yesterday. I got to the final boss for the first time ever, but I was on my last life of my last continue, and she killed me quickly.

Anyway, here is an overview of this morning's run. I used warps, but I plan on doing a warpless run soon [update: finished the warpless run].

**Level 1 - Ragnarok's Canyon**

Easy peasy. Use it to get used to the controls and mechanics. Do NOT take the warp. The first two stages are great opportunities to load up on extra lives, so you don't want to skip them.

**Level 2 - Wookie Hole**

No deaths. Nabbed a single 1-Up off the birds. Not much to say here. Just don't kill yourself trying to get 1-Ups off the birds. Staying alive is your priority.

**Level 3 - Turbo Tunnel**

Even as a kid, I didn't have big issues with this infamous level. I can often get through it without dying. This run, I died twice, once near the middle, and once near the end. I took the warp at the end.

Bad news: Despite its reputation, it's one of the easiest levels in the game. It only gets worse from here on out.

Good news: You can beat it. People think their reaction time isn't good enough, but from I've seen, they aren't doing the right things too slowly. Rather, they're doing the wrong things.

For the ramps, do not do anything except line yourself up with the ramp. Do not hit A, and do not make mid-air adjustments. If you're lined up, you will land safely every time if you don't press anything. Some people seem to think you have to press A to jump, but the only thing you'll do is risk jumping over the ramp and dying. Also, you can screw up your landing by moving around mid-air. Each and every ramp will take you to safe ground without adjustments, so don't touch the D-pad.

The ""!"" section screws up some people, but it's actually easy. Stay on the left side of the screen and just hit A when you're close to the right side of the platform. Again, attempting mid-air adjustments, or trying to move forward to make your jump longer only increases the risk of dying.

Don't try to weave through the four little ships. There is plenty of room to jump over them. Time your last jump to jump over the last two ships at once (including the fast one that moves left).

The last section is the hardest. It's all about having a good rhythm and not moving any further up and down than you need to. Lightly tap up and down on the D-pad, alternating between each direction, and use the audio to help keep rhythm. Move with every *whoosh* you hear. Also, you can cut it short by taking the warp.

Last piece of advice for this level: Even the taller barriers (not the floating ones) can be jumped over. It's hard to do reliably, but it's good to know in desperate situations. For example, if you feel like you are about to die in the last section, just hit the jump button. It probably won't save you, but sometimes you'll get lucky.

**Level 4 - Arctic Caverns**

Skipped via warp.

**Level 5 - Surf City**

This was as far as I got when I was a kid, but it's really not that bad with good technique and lots of practice. On this run, I died once, but I can sometimes do it deathless. I missed the first 1-Up but got the second one (twice, once before dying and once after).

Stay near the middle for the first three logs. Move just enough to avoid them. Move too far, and you will not have room to avoid the next one.

The next four are easy to avoid if you know where to be. Staying on the far left of the screen, stay at the top for the first log, at the bottom for the next two, and at the top again for the fourth log.

The next two logs move quickly. Go to the top and quickly move right when you see an opening.

The beat 'em up section is pretty straightforward. The mid-stage boss can be cheesed by nailing him with your weapon when he is at the side of the screen, so get him over there. Once there, just mash B repeatedly until he dies.

The mines at the end are what give players problems. They are completely random, so you can't memorize it all like you can with Turbo Tunnel. The trick I've found is to only pay attention to the part of the screen you need to. Move all the way up or all the way down. Then only focus your attention on the narrow band in front of you. The number of mines can be overwhelming and make you flustered, but if you focus on that narrow band at the very top or bottom of the screen, ignoring all the stuff that has no chance of hitting you, it's easier to maintain concentration. The hit boxes for the mines aren't too bad, so unless you will clearly hit the mine, you probably won't. Anyway, switch between the top and bottom as needed. So if you are at the top and a mine is heading your way, move all the way to the bottom. Occasionally, you may have to move toward the middle, as sometimes mines will appear on both extremes of the river at the same time.

The 1-up is easy to grab. Hit the ramp, move down just a tiny bit, and move most of the way to the right side of the screen. Once, grabbed, quickly move back left so you can see the mines in time.

**Level 6 - Karnath's Lair**

I barely saw this stage, since I took the warp near the beginning. Note that to get to the warp, you don't have to jump. When on top of the snake (with the spikes toward the right and down), hold right. You don't even need to double-tap. You'll miss the spikes, and as long as you do it quickly enough, you'll be at the warp.

**Level 7 - Volkmire's Inferno**

Skipped via warp.

**Level 8 - Intruder Excluder**

Died once in the middle and twice against the boss. Got the first 1-Up.

This stage is hell at first, but it's not bad with practice. For the robot that shoot lasers, note that you can duck to avoid the lasers. Duck, move closer, duck, move closer, duck, move closer, slam the bot into oblivion.

The fans can be destroyed if you have the weapon. Without it, you just need to time your path. Jump so that the fans are still running but almost done running when you are level with the lower one. Do the same for the second set of fans. Don't even try getting the 1-Up by the fans. It's possible, but chances are you'll just be enticed into your death.

The final boss fires whenever he lands. So start ducking right before he lands. Stay on your toes so he doesn't land on you. Early on, ram him. When he moves quicker, you may have to rely more on punches, hitting him after he lands right next to you (and after the firing/ducking routine, of course). You can ram him when he's mid-air, but it's risky. Half the time he just squashes me, so I don't usually bother. Be patient.

**Level 9 - Terra Tubes**

Died a bunch but got the 1-Ups. First I got squashed by a gear. Then I was eaten by sharks. Then I was squashed by another gear. After the last checkpoint, I died about 10 times, mostly to ducks, but there's a 1-Up right after that checkpoint, so you effectively have unlimited tries for that section.

Here's where the game gets really hard. Firstly, there are the robots. Duck to avoid the lasers. When they approach, start mashing B. If you don't attack quick enough, he'll run into you and instantly kill you, but you don't have to be that precise, so just button mash.

The first set of gears are mainly memorization. One is really quick, and you have barely enough time. Make sure to double-tap to run left during the first part of that gear (it's the third gear, I think). When in water, keep jumping to increase speed. Jump up into waterfalls (don't know why it doesn't slow you down, but that's the way it is). After the first jump, you'll see two steps toward the right. Skip the first one and jump straight onto the second ledge. Thinking I wouldn't make that jump and jumping twice instead of once is what used to kill me here.

The water section. Not fun. Anyway, try to avoid sharks and fish when possible. Hit and run when needed. Make sure to quickly move through the part where eels come out of the hole. You want to be long gone when they begin spawning. For the part with the fish that hammer you, jump left into the water, and then take the lower path below the spikes toward the opening at the bottom. You're less likely to run into fish using that route.

The underwater gear chase section is not easy. The one thing I will say is that if you have a good lead, hang around the barrier before dropping toward the spikes. Hit A right before you hit the spikes. If you wait for the gear to get close first, you'll only have to do this once. There is a way you can hang out against the wall by punching...it makes it easier, I suppose, but it feels cheap, so I don't do it.

The last section is the worst, but because of the 1-Up right after the checkpoint, you can try as many times as you like, provided you don't die before grabbing the 1-Up (I have done that...fucking shark).

Okay...ducks. Fuck a duck. These guys will 1-hit kill you, and the only strategy for beating them is to hit them first, which is easier said than done. Fortunately, you can avoid all but one. Wait for the first duck and jump over him. Do a light jump (tap A...don't hold it). If you hold A, you'll get killed by the spikes above. The hitbox on the spikes is very forgiving, so if you do a light jump, you'll survive even though it looks like you should be killed.  After jumping down, wait for the second duck to come closer and jump over it. The third duck you have no choice but to attack. I just button mash and hope I hit him first. I die more often than not here, but again, you effectively have unlimited tries for this section, so it's no big deal. After hitting him once, he'll turn around. I'll follow and then jump over him when I can.

Now, for the fish and the shark. Be patient with the fish. Hit him if you have to, but usually he'll just swim off harmlessly if you wait long enough. Now race to the top left, ignoring the shark. Work your way down and right. Attack any shark/fish that comes by. Now race to the top and wait for the duck to move back left. Then jump toward the final stretch.

Stay close to the middle and just weave left and right. Stage complete.

Note on the big spikes: The hitbox seems to lie in the upper half of the spikes. So if you're weaving around spikes, focus on avoiding their tops. You can graze the bottom of spikes safely.

**Level 10 - Rat Race**

**FUCK THIS LEVEL!!!**

For me, Rat Race is about tied with Level 12 as the hardest in the game.

Okay, the idea is that you have to participate in three races. In each, you have to race against a rat down to the bottom and kick a bomb before the rat gets to it and sets it off. The first two are easy. Consider them practice sections. The third is terribly hard. If that's not enough, you have to fight a boss at the end, because fuck you.

For the third race in particular, **hit the rat**. I can't stress how important this is. Yes, I realize it's technically possible to win the race without hitting him, but it's really, really, really fucking hard. Anyway, don't turn to hit him. It slows you down, and I always miss anyway. Instead, just keeping running until he catches up with you and then hit him as he passes. Only do this is if you're at least halfway across the screen toward where you are heading. If you are far enough over, the rat will bounce off the wall and run the wrong way for a brief moment, buying you precious time.

If you're at the point where you will just barely beat the rat down to the next level, slow down for a second to let him catch up and then hit him as you normally would. If you just drop down to the next level and then hit him as he passes, he won't be far enough over to bounce off the wall, so you're just giving him a boost. As counter-intuitive as it seems, slowing down when this happens buys you time.

When dropping down and switching directions, press the new direction a little early. Your momentum will carry you over, and hitting the new direction early will help you get through quicker. Every second counts.

The final boss is a joke. Headbutt him to get him to face the other way. Then hit him in the back until he moves. Then just jump over him and hit him in the back when you can. Once he speeds up quite a bit, stick to one of the walls. Jump as he comes close and hit him in the back when he lands.

On this particular run, I got lucky. I won the third race on my second try and made it through everything else without dying.

**Level 11: Clinger Winger**

Just hold the D-pad in the right direction. Easy, right?

This level is the dictionary definition of ""harder than it looks."" Supposedly it's easier on a real NES controller. I can't say, because I never got this far during my NES's life, but I can see why. A NES D-pad allows for smooth transitions, I'd imagine. On a keyboard (what I'm using) or even just the wrong gamepad, it's awkward as hell. The only reason I survived this is through liberal use of pausing. I try to pause right at the corner, and I adjust my direction before unpausing. Even so, I still die sometimes.

The boss...I usually prefer ram/headbutt attacks, but I find simple punches to be more reliable against this guy. With a punch, I know I can hit him. With a headbutt, I might hit him, or I might get zapped. Headbutts seem relatively safe when he's in the air, but on level ground, watch out. Anyway, try to get him in a corner and just punch away at him. Sometimes you'll pick him up. Move a little away from the side (so you don't get squashed), throw him back toward the side of the screen, and return to boxing him. This same technique applies to his second phase (where he leaps off screen) as well. If you're aggressive enough, you won't even notice when he enters his second phase.

**Level 12 - The Revolution**

I had two spare lives left on this stage. I finished it with no spare lives (but I had all my continues!). It's a hard level, and there is no simple trick. You just have to do it. However, I have a few tips for some different spots in the stage.

At parts of the tower, you will jump between small platforms/springs, which alternate between rotating and stationary (relative to the tower). Before jumping, always figure out if the one above you is stationary relative to the tower or not. If it is stationary, jump when it is right above you. If it is not stationary, jump early. Once I had this figured out, I died a lot less often.

The yellow rhino guys...they look identical, but there are actually two different versions. The first three are easy. The next two are much more aggressive (and take one more hit to kill). Don't get thrown off guard. Once you have killed the first three, expect a more aggressive battle and adjust your strategy according (namely, avoid his charge and hit him right after his charge is complete).

The spot with the two red clouds that spit bubbles that instantly kill you...just hurry the fuck up. Don't get tied up with fancy footwork or waiting for the perfect opportunity. The quicker you get up to the next platform, the less likely you will die.

The last section is the worst. You have to go up a series of small platforms with an invincible cloud trying to blow you off. Two tips: firstly, you can lure the cloud where you want it. Try to get it away from the platforms. Secondly, once the cloud is where you want it, hurry the hell up. Even if you get the cloud away from you, he'll catch up quickly, so you really do need to hurry.

**Level 13 - Armageddon**

Yes, Battletoads has 13 levels, not 12. Some people think it's just the end of level 12, because there's no cutscene between the levels, but if you use a continue, you'll see that the final boss is its own level.

The problem I have here is lack of experience. This is the second time I've ever fought the Dark Queen, and the first time was over very quickly (not in my favor).

I was on my last life, but I hadn't used any continues. Would I really beat the game on one continue?!! Nope. She killed me almost instantly.

Not only that, but she killed me four more times, eating through my second continue.

Then she killed me three more times. What?! I made it to the final boss on one continue, and I'm still going to lose to this bitch?! No, I finally got her. Last life, but with one continue remaining.

I don't have great advice for this fight, since I'm still a novice here. The best I can say is: when she is on the ground, it doesn't seem safe to attack if she is facing you. Also, you can headbutt her mid-air if you catch her right at the bottom of her feet.

Well, that's it. Now to do it warpless.

**Update: Just finished a warpless run!**

Surprisingly, it ended exactly how the above-described run did: 0 spare lives + 1 continue remaining. Most of the run went splendidly, up until Level 12. I made it there without using continues, and I had four spare lives (so, five lives total), but then that level ate up two of my continues. After the second continue, I beat the stage dying only once (on that continue), leaving me with three lives and one continue to fight the Dark Queen. She killed me twice before she fell.

I take back what I said about Rat Race. The Revolution (Level 12) is definitely harder.

Went better than usual: Beat the flying section of Volkmire's Inferno without dying (but died to a rat rocket prior to the flying section). Died only once in Terra Tubes. Beat the third rat race on my first try.

Went worse than usual: General Slaughter, one of the easiest bosses in the game, killed me three times. Died once in Level 2.

Note that it wasn't my first time playing through the stages that I skipped in my first successful run. I've played Arctic Caverns, Karnath's Lair, and Volkmire's Inferno plenty of times.

**Update 2: Beat it with no warps or continues used.** Almost maxed out the score.",technology,1475080019
personalfinance,Paying off a loan with an IRA?,"I have 49,000 in student loan debt through Wells Fargo. My interest rate is 9.7% and I am paying about $530 a month. About $300 of this is going towards interest. I have tried on multiple occasions to make extra payments on the principal but WF continues to use those payment for interest pre-payment, even if I specify I want it all on principal. In 2 years, I've paid 13,000 and my loan have only been reduced by 4,500. Needless to say, I'm done with WF. 

About a year ago, my husbands grandmother died and left us a $60,000 inheritance. We didn't know what to do with it so we met with Chase and they advised us to put it in and IRA. Since then, it has gained 3,000. Their reasoning was that, at the end of the year, we could take out whatever we have gained in interest and apply it to my loans, while keeping the base 60,000 invested. 

I've talked to a number of people and they agree that this is what I should do. Take out the full 60,000. Use 49,000 to pay off my loans, and save the reminder for withdrawal taxes and penalties (I'm not sure how much this will be yet, can anyone give me an estimate?). If anything is leftover, reinvest. Doing this, I will save in WF interest and with the excess money from not paying monthly I can hit my other government loans much harder and save more money for the future. 

Which is the better option? Personally I'm leaning towards withdrawing the full amount. I would prefer to start at zero (so to speak) and be able to save faster and pay down debt faster than wait and wait and wait for smaller payments off the lump sum.",finance,1475082049

personalfinance,Help with Student Loan Repayments,"I'm a recent graduate of law school, I have loans that will go into repayment this November, 2016, they are approximately 120k. I'm currently employed at a small law firm making approximately 50k a year before taxes. My rent is approximately 420 a month, and includes cable/utilities. I would prefer to pay as much as possible toward these student loan amounts as I can. I have no cell phone bills, car bills, or health insurance bills monthly. I spoke with my loan provider Greatlakes, as to how the monthly amount paid gets allocated. They said that the monthly amount gets divided among all outstanding loans and applied prorated to each account in the following: interest off each and then the underlying principals. My loans are separated into several different individual accounts. The provider also mentioned that any additional amounts that are paid on top of the monthly amount due is applied to the highest interest account first. 
I need advice. If I applied for a 10 year repayment plan the amount due each month is approximately 1,350. However, I was wondering if it is wiser for me to apply for a 25 year repayment thereby reducing the amount due each month, allow this smaller amount to be prorated as required, and then use the difference of the two amounts toward the account(s) with the highest interest rate. 
The way I figure, I will personally still be paying the equivalent of the 10 year monthly amount, per month, but by having less ""due"" each month, more of my money will be directed to higher earning interest accounts and less will be prorated to all outstanding accounts.

personalfinance,"Refinance cashout at same interest rate, to perform major repairs?","We have a 100+ year old rowhouse, bought in 2013, which is in fairly good shape except for the electricity, which is still mostly knob and tube. Redoing the electric, including replacing the panel and service drop, will probably run .... say, about $15-20k.

We do not have the money for this right now. We have a baby in day care and some other debt; we're getting by fine, but not fine enough to drop that kind of cash without figuring something out.

The house was $172,500 on a short sale, we borrowed $167,750 (put down 3%). We currently owe just under $152,000 on the mortgage, and are still paying PMI at $114/mo.  We have a 3.75% rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage.

Here's the key piece of information: we live in a neighborhood in which prices are increasing (east passyunk in south philadelphia). For example, the house three doors down from us, which is admittedly in better shape, sold for $325k just last week after being on the market less than a month.  I'm guessing ours is probably worth $250k at this point, in its current condition.

We spoke to our mortgage guy about a refinance, hoping to use the appraisal to eliminate PMI and get a HELOAN or a HELOC to pay for this electric thing, but they're only offering 3.5% right now, so it's not really worth it. However he offered a cashout loan, which would allow us to borrow up to about $28k extra, on another 30-year fixed at the same 3.75% rate we currently have - loan costs rolled into the loan itself.

This seems like a good plan to me, and here's why:

Looking at the mortgage payment, it's about $775 for our current mortgage, plus $114 PM for a total of $889.

If we borrow $176k (the $152 we owe, plus $20k, plus about $4k in loan costs), the payment would be $815.  So overall our monthly costs would go down a little. And we'd have the cash to do the electricity, which would increase the value of our house and making selling it easier if we need to do that.

What we'd be losing in the process is the loan cost of course.  But since that's rolled into the mortgage I'm not really as concerned about it -- it's long term debt and i'm more concerned with getting the electricity in shape and reducing our immediate monthly costs than I am about paying off a few thousand over 30 years.

Our credit union is offering HELOAN at 3.25% with a payoff of up to 20 years or an HELOC up to 15 years -- I don't know what the loan costs on them are, but calculating out the monthly payment, it would be higher.

personalfinance,Should I pay back life insurance loan?,"This is kind of a ""bank on yourself"" type life insurance question, so bear with me. Basically, I had whole life insurance policy purchased for me when I was born(1987) that I decided to take a loan out from to help pay college tuition. I borrowed about 25,000 from the policy. Currently the interest on the loan is about 5%, but the financial adviser informed me that the original cash value (total cash value, regardless of the fact that I took out a loan against it) continues to grow at a guaranteed 4%, making it basically 1% interest (as long as I pay back the loan). The current surrender value is about 6K. The adviser also told me that something about the policy, since it was fairly an old policy now, is not allowed anymore for some reason, not sure if this is true. 

I am wondering if it is worth it for me to pay this back or not. I in general disagree with the bank on yourself thing, but in my case I did not pay for any of the upfront costs which typically make the bank on yourself thing a bad idea. I am otherwise comfortable with my ongoing contribution to my Roth IRA and 403b, but I could always put more in the latter. I otherwise have paid my federal student loans down and am slowly continuing to do so. I guess I am saying I am not really in sore need elsewhere, which would make it an easier idea to just surrender. My main question though is should I still just surrender anyway and invest that amount, or would it be beneficial to pay back this whole life policy, and possibly have it available to take future loans out against if I pay it back.

personalfinance,"I am currently a contract employee, however I think I may have the opportune time to leverage a full-time employee position from the company and make it extremely beneficial to me. Should I pursue this? How should I approach it if so?","For almost 2 years I have been a contract employee in the IT PMO for a Fortune 500 company in one of their large satellite offices. This location is also a major tech hub and is a much lower cost than most of their other offices (NYC, London, Tokyo, etc.), however they have only been maintaining contract employees. Originally we had 4 total employees (3 contractors, 1 FTE) and 2 open hires, but as of today I am now the only person left of the original 4 and we have 1 new employee, who won’t be fully up to speed by the time my contract is up.  They should know that I am also looking,  since I will be unable to be renewed after March (federal regulation), so my plan is to approach my direct manager and give them the choice to make me a permanent employee.

I am curious of how aggressive I should be with the salary demands, if asked, when I make my pitch. I currently make $35/hr as a contractor and I know one of my former co-workers (also contractor) made $65/hr for the same job (albeit he has about 10 years more experience). I also have 2 years more experience than when I started and will hopefully have my PMP within the next month. I am hoping to negotiate better benefits (vacation) along with pay increase, so I am thinking about starting at $50/hr and working down. 

Is that too aggressive? Are there any unforeseen consequences of this proposal?",finance,1475119160

Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm in my mid twenties, I have decent credit (690ish fico score). I have about $10,000 dollars in credit card debt and an additional $50,000 in federal student loans. My loans are currently in income based repayment where I have a zero dollar payment. Recently my hours were cut at my job, and despite efforts to find other full time work, I'm at the point where I will not be able to pay my credit card bills this month if I want to afford rent, utilities, food, gas, and other real necessities. I am considering contacting a debt management agency, but how will this affect my credit? If I'm in good standing on all my accounts, are there other less damaging alternatives to lower my payments? 

Thanks in advance!",finance,1475122075
personalfinance,"Pre-IPO Stock Options; company went public, I need cash to buy within 30 days","I recently left a company with a very good amount of pre-ipo stock options.  The company has since gone public and the stock is so far doing well and a lot higher than my strike price.  I still have about 30 days to exercise.  It would cost $60k to buy all the options.  I am required to wait 180 days before able to sell.

I don't have $60k in cash, I have about $20k.  My credit score is a very healthy 810+.  My current salary is above $150k a year.

I want to borrow $60k (I don't want to touch my existing cash) to buy my options, wait six months, then sell (assuming the stock hasn't tanked).

I have two options that I see:

1. get a personal loan (not sure if I can get the full $60k though).  Seems like I can get interest rates around 5-8%

2. Take a loan out against my 401k

I plan to sell my stock after the six month period (assuming a reasonable stock price) so my loan is for 6 months in an ideal world.  There is a chance I don't sell at 6 months due to a low stock price, so I will continue paying off the loan and eating the interest payments. As with all stock, I could maybe never make back my $60k, but am willing to take that risk.

Question:  Is it better to get a personal loan or take a loan against my 401k?  Is there a 3rd option I've missed?",finance,1475122678
personalfinance,Why is it so uncommon for people to pay credit cards off in full?,"Ok so I work at a bank and I see a bunch of people's accounts every day. Probably 90-95% of them pay either the minimum payment or just a portion of the full balance. Some of these balances are 10-20k which surprised me.

That means if your balance is $10000 and you have a 15% Apr, you're paying $1500 in interest alone every year. 

For emergencies like a job loss or car repairs I understand, but with so many people with these balances, that can't be the case every time. So is there something I'm not seeing here or are people just irresponsible with their spending? How do people see the value of paying that high interest rate for something that isn't a necessity? 

 I have 4 credit cards and pay them off in full every time my statement cycle renews. I splurge every now and then on something I want and go out to eat and hang out with my friends but I never buy anything I cannot afford on my cards.

solar,The cost of solar dropped fast recently. Here's why.,"I've been in residential solar sales for about 8 years. I watched modules (panels) drop from $4 per watt to $1 per watt in the first few years. Then inch their way down to 90c, then 80c, then 70c and hold right about 70c. We've held there for about 18 months. Now keep in mind, this is rough average of what we (a retailer) are paying for modules, a few pallets at a time, for an established manufacturer.  

In the last few weeks we are getting wicked cheap prices. Sub 50c per watt prices. CRAYZAY prices. At this price solar would be very close to [sunshot](http://www.uspvmc.org/about_PVMC_sunshot.html) levels. At this price solar will compete well without subsidies.  However, this price is not sustainable. Not yet. Right now, the dirty little secret the US solar industry does not want you to know is solar sales are down. WHAT? Yeah, in the shitter. Compared to where everyone thought they would be for the second half of 2016. The last year of the 30% federal tax rebate. For the last 7 years everyone has thought 2016 was going to be a gangbuster year. Everyone would be a mad rush to get their projects in before the end of the tax credit.  

Well guess what. The [tax credit was extended](http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/solar-itc-extension-approved-in-the-us-senate_100022519/#axzz4Ld3yfHk2) in December of last year. This is great news for the industry! We get another 5 years of subsidies which is obviously a good thing. What is not so obvious is what that means for the investments made in marketing and production capacity for the second half of 2016. Now that customers are not under pressure to get projects in before expiration of the tax credit, sales are soft. Not terrible, but not great. Many manufacturers built factories that are under utilized because the 2016 year end demand did not materialize. Many installers spent big dollars on marketing to build awareness this not lead to sales. I expect a few bad announcements from some of the weaker players. But ultimately the industry will come back stronger.

The next 3-6 months is a great time to buy solar.  There is PLENTY of stock available at the lowest prices anyone has ever seen.",energy,1475136648
stocks,How to negotiate commissions with a broker?,"Hello all.

I'm not allowed to open an account with a firm if it's not locally registered with our country's SEC directly, so pretty much every company is out of the question, I either have to go with Saxo or move to Europe. I currently trade in a stock market where daily volume is ~$1.5 billion, so it's a little illiquid. (10 stocks get the $1.3 billion and the rest is shared among 350 stocks)

I'll start with $250K and I qualify for Saxo's active trader criteria.

For US stocks, they charge $6 flat fee if you buy less than 1000 shares and $0.007 per share if you buy more than 1000 once. This is already a good deal for me, but there's no harm trying to lower my costs.

This would work great while trading stocks like Apple and Cisco in huge quantities, but if I buy 300 shares of a $8 stock I'd be paying $6 for $2400 worth of trade. That's a lot in terms of percentages.

Saxo also charges 3.5% CFD financing fee for all markets while IB charges 1.9% for US (they charge A LOT LESS than 1.9% if your volume is big) and a lot less for some other markets, like EU countries. As far as I know, their costs are pretty much the same on this (don't they all borrow at the FED rates?), but it doesn't mean Saxo will get close to 1.9% if I push hard enough. Still...

Elder Lawd here, this wee project was supposed to be finished and cleared up a wee while ago, however problems hit me in life and I couldn't proceed, a few months later things are back on track! And Since the whole community seemed to be mega Hyped about it! So Any Feedback is Welcome! Thank you for reading this far guys it's much appreciated :)

____________________________________

**Why am I doing this?**

Answer - Well as you know Fallout 4 is extremely dense with locations and buildings that take hours to explore and loot fully, although that's just scratching the surface, these Secondary Locations aren't on the map, (as in with an icon), however there are loads of them! The want to do this stems from my pervious experience with New Vegas and Fallout 3, finding these hidden gems where always such a joy, in the middle of nowhere (bar Deathclaw island in New Vegas, though the armour was pretty handy). 

____________________________________

**Who's this For?**


Answer - Well... anyone really, veterans who have sank hundreds of hours into the game so far appreciate my effort, all the way to people who have just stepped out of the Vault, it's all for fun, some of the places have a cool name and perhaps a nice item such as a easy Nuka Cola Quantum (1.17), Nuka Cherry (1.03), Cooking Stations (1.21), Safes (1.23), Terminals (1.30), Protectrons (2.02), even Melons (2.04) There are also Radioactive Swords (13.02)!

____________________________________


**What could you find at these locations?** 

I'll have to admit some places have just ammo or meds, a nasty enemy or two, although with that said every location has a story, which is one of the main reasons I love to explore them! So yeah, thanks for reading this far! Below is a link to several of my episodes; be to sure tell us what you think!

personalfinance,Savings ideas,"So I've been looking for ways to increase my savings. I currently have a savings account with Bank of America. I have a little over 4K. However, Bank of America has an interest rate of 0.01% on savings accounts, which is shit.

I've been thinking about closing my savings account and open a savings account with SECU because their interest rate is 0.75%, which is much better in my opinion. Theoretically, if I have 4K in my savings account for the year, I should gain about $120 a year, right?

Obviously I'm not planning on only having 4K because I'm constantly adding money to my savings account. But I was wondering if anyone has any other ideas. But first, I'd like to know what I should do about my Bank of America savings account, how can I transfer the money out of that account and into a SECU savings account? Will Bank of America charge me for closing my account? Also, I get direct deposit in my Bank of America checking account, can I transfer money to my savings account in SECU without being charged?

Any help will greatly be appreciated!",finance,1475159045
financialindependence,"Major expense due: low-interest loan + investing, or cash upfront?","I have a large, mostly unavoidable expense coming up and thought it might make more sense to finance it, particularly considering my plans for early retirement.

My CU offers ""share-secured loans"", which offer interest rates of around 2.5% for up to 60 months. This rate is possible by offering part of your savings account as collateral. Needless to say, this means I already have the cash to pay it upfront.

The reason I am considering borrowing this amount is that it appears to allow me to continue saving and investing aggressively for early retirement. Additionally, dividends continue to accrue on the collateral. Rather than blackholing this expense immediately, it seems as if I can spread this expense over 60 months, invest new income minus the minimum payment per month, and come out ahead in market returns from the difference in interest rates. But I'm still unsure if an investment return rate and a loan interest rate can be directly compared like this.

I am already doing something similar with low interest student debt, although moreso because they are federal loans and have favorable terms that let me defer them if I lose my job. I didn't really consider whether I come out ahead or not, although of course I have continued to invest the amount saved less the monthly minimum.

So, knowing I wish to save + invest and must make this payment anyway, does it make sense to take the secured loan instead of cash?",finance,1475161105

gaming,"The Hype Effect, Bias, and the Coupling of Reverse Psychology and Reactance: An Empirical Observation Behind the Rise and Fall of Games Like PokémonGo and No Man's Sky.","**TL;DR** : Both PokémonGo and No Man's Sky saw a massive hype-train fueled on the coal of dreams, thus massive amounts of people played the games right out of the gate. The developers underestimated the prospective player base. Guaranteed features that did not make it through development and through the main release window... 

**The effect?**  
Disappointed (to put it very very lightly) player base and rapidly depleted unique active users ultimately damning the long term play-ability and lifetime of the games.

**Intro[-ish]:**

Both PokémonGo (**PoGo**) and No Man's Sky (**NMS**) were highly anticipated games with rather new takes on gameplay that has not been fleshed out in previous generations of gaming to the degree that was promised by PoGo or NMS. Many features were/are planned for each game as part of ""gameplay-extension"", but many features were also removed/debuffed/oversold to the point that the games were not what they were expected to be (at some point or another within the weeks that had followed their respective releases). This readjustment of the bar or expectation for the games disappointing users, cost the companies money and caused continual distrust in their respective communities in which is a very community driven ecosystem that gamers have come to know and love. 

Hype has a place and is a great concept in the world of economics and as a metric for sales (although many other measurements are out there, but I am doing this from a fan's perspective not an analyst's) and the generation fun a game may dole out to its player-base. This hype is what generated expectations from both PoGo and NMS. Without hype or the already large fan base of previous games within the genre (PoGo games over the last 20 years for example), these games would have not done nearly as well and would possibly not have had such a backlash as they received. At most if hype and anticipation based on what was already known [and not speculation] were the only factors given the advertisements for each game, it's possible these games would have been considered successful for their indie development rather than their features (Yet this is convoluted and technically many factors would change the way games would be portrayed if Hype was at ""moderate levels"").

The Hype put these games on almost untouchable pedestals, dropping the likelihood of success from a non financial standpoint. I digress, because the next huge concern that these games have brought up is much larger and somehow linked to this idea of overhyped game releases and the gaming communities natural tendency to want interaction with the developers.

**Reactance:**

 Due to the nature of gaming communities growing into this interactive and somewhat influential part of a developers creative process post-release, such as the communities around games like Binding of Isaac and Minecraft, there is this mild to radical expectation for developers in our world of social media to respond to questions, suggestions, or just general updates and banter surrounding their games. I surmise that this is the very reason games can flounder and flap around like a fish out of water. 

Take PoGo for example... It can be argued that (if we ignore server issues at the beginning of the game's release) the ignorance or lack of open-ears to their community both pre- and post- full release of the game in July, Niantic may have been able to raise the predicted plateau that hit the game  (as all games possess at one time or another), and stay the eventual active player decrease (and revenue drop) that has hit the game recently. The same can be said for NMS, which has decreased so quickly in active online players in such a short time that it is most definitely a logistical developmental nightmare. Specifically PoGo would have greatly benefited from directly interacting with their community in order to implement both new features and those that would further balance the current gameplay and enhance the narrative or meta of the game. For example, the biggest ""whoopsie"" Niantic has performed is the general gameplay inhibition. Removing a scanner from the game so now incentive to adventure is decreased. When a workaround was found and incentive stabilized they removed the ability and effectiveness of the workaround (regardless if they were in the right to do so or not), lastly (and more subtly with the most recent migrations) they randomized nests, which decreased the guaranteed spawn of certain pokemon that kept a consistency in the current game that allowed players that don't live in San Fran to play and have goals that would allow continual game play even if some pokémon were un-catchable at the time. 

This may be nitpicky in some regards but simple corroboration with the biggest part of your game ( the player base) is essential to large online gaming. In games like PoGo, you essentially have a super beta testing community nowadays with the innovations that are brought by modding and social media. You literally can derive how a game actually plays in every environment. Yet, if you do not listen to your player base and do the opposite of their interests, you and a game dev find a chain of events towards eventual self destruction. This leaves players with a broken play through and a loss of interest and distaste for your idea of gaming.  

This is a general opinion piece and if I had much more time I would explain the psychology and observations that are as plain as day. I would detail how the types of approaches made by the developers to (most likely) actively diverge from the communities wishes and reasons for initial interest in a game are examples of a form of [reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)) and somewhat similar to reverse psychology-like phenomena. A phenomena or anecdotal reaction to many things humans do is: if we wish for someone to do something or continue to tell/ask them to do something a certain way, the person will want to do the opposite, not necessarily out of spite, but on a psychological resistance level.

personalfinance,Should I even carry health care? +rant about buying health care in MA,"I'm a healthy, 30-year-old guy who is completely fed up with the health care industry. Is it crazy not to carry health insurance and just pay doctors directly?  The way I figure it, with a $300/mo plan and $2,000 deductible, that frees up $3,800/year. As long as I don't get into an accident or get a terminal illness, I'll actually save money by just paying doctors directly.

For a couple years now I've been self-employed. For most people in MA, health care is an after-thought if you're an employee somewhere. For people like me, you have go go through their home-brewed website, mahealthconnector.org. In other states, you can go through the ObamaCare website, https://www.healthcare.gov.  I keep reading that ObamaCare/etc sees Massachusetts as a shining example of health care reform. From my experience that couldn't be further from the truth. 

Today I decided to log onto the website and cancel my dental plan. Reason being, I'm paying $28/mo for the plan, but with the deductibles and crappy co-payments, I'm better off just paying my dentist directly for bi-annual cleanings. I logged on, clicked on My Enrollments. Next to both plans were little red ""remove"" buttons. So I clicked the one next to the dental plan. I went back to the enrollments screen, and sure enough, both my health care and dental plans were marked cancelled. 

I called the 800 number, thinking this is just an entry in a database and should be fixable. Nope. I was told it can't be undone, that my plan is cancelled, and I have to enroll into a new one. I was a bit upset, but said I'd just setup a new one I guess. The issue, though, is that my existing plan which was $287/mo is now $450/mo. Because of this website user interface blunder, I now have to pony up another $163/mo AND reboot my deductible ($2,000) which I've already paid $1,500 into this year. 

The customer service rep apparently ""made a case"" with the IT team and they're going to get back to me in the next 4-5 days. In the meantime, I officially have no health care coverage. I have little confidence it'll be fixed. 

At the end of 2015 I had a similar experience with health care in MA. I setup a new plan in Nov 2015, only to find out they stopped deducting from my checking account in Feb 2016 and ""cancelled"" my plan because I didn't go through their enrollment process for the new year (even though I had just setup my plan ~60 days prior). I had to send all sorts of letters and make tons of phone calls just for the privilege of paying for health care. A year before that, a similar thing happened with their billing system and my plan was cancelled (even though it was no fault of my own).

I'm planning on trying to reduce my taxable income for 2017 through traditional retirement contributions.

My employer has a deferred comp plan that will allow me to withhold up to 18,000 each year to invest in fidelity or vanguard funds.

My gross income in 2017 will be 57,387. The federal tax bracket (in 2016) has anything over 37,650 taxed at 25%, up from 15% in the bracket below. My gross income minus18k contribution puts my new gross at 39,387.

Subtract the standard deduction and my taxable income is 33,087, so I think all of that would be taxed below the 25% bracket.

I was mystified as there's no possible way I could owe any taxes at all, and called the IRS.Turns out, it was a court judgment from NY state as I apparently never filed a 2011 return.

However, now, I have no idea how to file that return in order to null out that balance and get my refund.

I made it from 4"" PVC piping capped at one end with test caps so I can access for cleaning.  The drain tubes go nearly to the top so the pipes fill as much as possible before draining through a little drain hole at the base.  It fills in 2-3 minutes and drains over about a half an hour.  I controlled slope with turnbuckles.  I have a 10 gallon reservoir and the system holds about 3 1/2 gallons when full.  I have a 3' flexible aerator in the reservoir.  

It is hanging in a south facing window, but I do plan on hanging 2' T5s on each layer to supplement light.

The top row is Black Seeded Simpson Lettuce transplanted from the garden center since no one around here seems to carry seeds at this time of year.  The second row is Spanish Cilantro started from seed in rockwool.  The third row is Sweet Basil and Italien Plain-Leafed Parsley, both transplanted from containers outside, and a Dukat Leafy Dill started from seed in rockwool.

I am currently using Dyna-Gro Grow at about 400ppm as suggested by a local hydroponic gardening store but this store seems mostly cannabis focused.  I have since found another hydroponics store that is less cannabis focused and they have recommended I switch to a two part Cyco branded nutrient mix for its pharmaceutical grade components and ability to control the mixture compared to a one part mix.  It's also a little bit cheaper for the base mixes than the General Hydroponics brand.

My water supply, according to a brewing forum, last tested at 
Calcium 34
Magnesium 9
Sodium 70.4
Chloride 61.5
Sulfate 116
Alkalinity 49
pH 7.75
They also state these numbers have stayed pretty consistent over the last few years.  Since we aren't growing any cash crops I don't think we will be investing in an RO system.  Currently I am flooding the garden every 3 hours while the sun is up for a total of 4 floods per day.

Wow, I think that's it.  Sorry if TLDR.

Any tips, tricks or advice would be appreciated.  The only specific question I have at this moment is about supplements.  I was considering adding something.  I have read that Cal/Mag, Silica, B vitamins, beneficial bacteria and a few other things are pretty commonly suggested.  The guy at the hydroponic store did not recommend Silica for this garden and I think I will wait on Cal/Mag to see if I notice deficiencies but I was kinda leaning toward maybe a B vitamin supplement.  I don't know.  

edit: Oh, and I'm using the General Hydroponics PH drops and an HM TDS-3 to test water.

The 8 yo is in 3rd grade, 6 yo is in 1st grade and 3 yo is in daycare full time. 27 yo works full time and in the process of asking for a raise that meets state average salary and their skills. 26 yo works full time but also has a chronic pain disorder that could change workable hours.

Since the first post family dynamics have changed. The 26 yo sister (29 yo) is now separating from her husband and is in a deep deep *deep* spiral. We have taken temporary to permanent custody of her two young children else they would end up with the abusive father or in foster care. Their ages are 3 yo and 1 yo. They are also now if full time daycare. The mom (29 yo) was a stay at home mom and is now in the process of trying to find a job and get state assistance. However, we are not relying on that as it is a very big unknown how she will end up with her emotional state of mind. The dad is on disability and receives approx. $750/month, total. We will not be getting any child support from him (unless we really want to take his $6/month).

We also refinanced our house to get rid of all the high interest rate debt. The 27 yo was in a car accident in June 2016 which totaled our vehicle. Since the last three cars have all been in totaled accidents (not at fault for all of them) we decided we needed a newer and safer car for our family. We were also able to cancel Netflix, Amazon FreeTime, and dance classes.

Income is $43,050 salary and $21.72/hour 40 hours/week ($45,177.60) for a combined yearly income of $88,227.60. Again, the 27 yo is asking for a raise that is long overdue. 26 yo is set to receive an annual cost of living wage (retroactive to Oct. 1 once the amount is determined).

Taxes right now are $320.80 (combined bi-weekly) and this will be enough to cover any tax liability for 2016 (due April 2017) with child tax credit, school credit, daycare expenses, etc.

$98.08/paycheck (26 yo) for FSA for medical expenses. $286.58/paycheck (26 yo) for medical and dental insurance. $110.06 (26 yo) for short term disability for 27 and 26 yo, hospital confinement, term life insurance, and accident insurance for the whole family.

We also have a cafeteria plan for childcare ($5000/year) that is taken from the paycheck but then reimbursed to our checking account. This reduces our taxes in the immediate. I will include the total daycare expense below but have not taken it from the income so there is no double dipping with expenses.

With all the deductions that are not reimbursed the monthly net is $5,585.34.

Expenses:

* $1,033.60 Mortgage (This includes p&amp;i)

* $151.23 Property Tax (Put into savings each month until it's due)

* $51.32 Hazard Insurance (Put into savings each month until it's due)

* $45.00 Gas (same payment every month with any differences adjusted annually)

* $90.00 Electricity (same payment system as Gas)

* $28.00 Water, Sewer (average monthly, but changes slightly)

* $14.75 Garbage, Recycling ($44.25 billed quarterly)

* $62.09 Cell Phone (2 lines - Tmobile)

* $74.57 Internet (Comcast)

* $151.67 Car Gas ($35/week - monthly average)

* $69.78 Car Insurance (Geico, 2 cars, 2 drivers $1000 deductible, comp &amp; collision included - good coverage, great driving records)

* $294.00 Honda

* $341.09 VW

* $45.00 Parking (both work downtown, recently increased)

* $27.00 Registration (for both cars, paid annually but save monthly in a savings account)

* $50.00 Supplies (toilet paper, diapers, toothpaste, etc.)

* $541.67 Food ($125 weekly, average monthly)

* $25.63 Dog Food (Costco)

* $60.00 School Lunch (8 yo, 6 yo)

* $1,150.00 Daycare (3 yo, 3 yo, 1 yo)

* $87.50 Medical (We take the difference of our family max out of pocket, $3600, and the FSA, $2550, and divide that monthly then we put it in our savings account. Yes, we will definitely meet the family max out of pocket - and if not we just saved $1050)

* $254.47 Student Loan (26 yo, on IBR)

* $513.00 Credit Cards (various, detail list below)

* $75.00 Clothing (put in savings account until this is needed for the whole family - if it's not used it will then be savings)

* $20 Family Entertainment (mostly dollar movie outing each month)

* $16.67 Gifts (20 gifts each year at $10 each - not removing)

* $8.25 AmazonPrime (We get faster delivery and cheaper than Netflix regarding Amazon Video)

* $50.00 Home Repairs (Not much, but put into savings until needed)

* $50.00 Car Repairs (Again, not much, but put into savings)

* $30.00 Savings ($10/each for the kids)

* $43.33 Date ($10/week for parents to do a lunch date without the kids because of how stressed we are)

* $130 WooHoo ($15/week each for 27 yo and 26 yo - this is our play money)

Wow, that was a lot of information, again.

We were doing better after the mortgage refinance but then we took in the two extra kids (and one adult) which increased the daycare expense $600/month. Unless we receive state assistance (or the mom/sister does) we will not be able to get that back any time soon.

We were able to add a few more categories also, like home and car repair so that eats into our monthly net (though those charges are no longer getting put onto a CC unnecessarily).

We have had to increase our weekly food budget because we have 2 extra people in the household, and more times than not, 3 because the sister is staying at the house.

The account with RC Willey was unexpected but with 2 extra kids in the house we needed to get extra furniture for them in a new bedroom (also replacing a couch/sleeper for the mom). Only did it b/c of the 0%, 18 month no interest.

So, with as much information as I can think of to give, can I get some suggestions on how to increase income or decrease expenses? What are some other frugal ways to save money without being cheap?

personalfinance,"What would you do if you were me? 35, not married, self employed, no kids and 3 properties.","Bachelor here who wants to eventually get married and settle down but since that isn't happening right now I am planning for 2017. I am self employed and gross $200+ and usually have $100-$150k of taxable income at the end of the year. My family is very uneducated in finance/business so I figured I would give this a shot. I have always been very responsible and worked my ass off since I was 16. 

Assets:

Primary Residence: I purchased in 2009, owe $182k at 4.25%, and could sell it for $350k after I did a $50k remodel last fall. I like the house but I lived here with an ex and I kinda have mixed feelings on it since it reminds me a lot of her even now since we fixed it up together. Payment is $1412 with PITI. 

Rental: I purchased a rental home Dec 2015 and have it rented until April 2017 for $1800 a month and mortgage is $1577 with PITI. I paid $240k (good deal worth $265k), owe $224k at 4.25% + MI and I could sell it for $300k now that values are up. It was built in 1994, has a new roof, hardiplank siding, new HVAC, and is a rock solid one level home perfect for a rental. 

Land deal: I purchased a 3rd property (land) this June 2016 for $75k that was such a good deal I couldn't pass it up. It was a little bit of a stretch for me financially. I am having it logged in the next couple weeks ($15-$20k profit) and then will list for $175k once cleared. Before buying in June I had $40k in savings and I took out a loan on my paid off vehicle to cover the remaining $35k+ title fees. I am selling this one asap to get cash back in savings. 

Roth IRA: I have $60k in a Roth and $3k in a Sep IRA. 

Cash: I have $10k in checking and expect to have $35-$40k in checking once the land is logged and biz stays strong. 

I have no debt or student loans except for the $40k auto loan (that will be paid off when I sell the land) and the two mortgages mentioned above. I have roughly $2500 a month in total bills (work and personal) and gas/food/bs adds another $2000 so my bills run $4500-$5500 a month for everything depending on how much I eat out. Net worth is currently $475k. 

There is a lot of talk about the real estate market shifting and it has me concerned. Values are up 10% here locally ytd and I will barf if my equity goes away like it did to people in 2008 due to a terrorist attack or a major drop in the economy. I feel like now MAY be the time to unload, toss all that money in savings, and wait for the market to shift again and buy. But then some people say to hold real estate for 10+ years. I feel like my gains are somewhat insane though in the last 4-5 years. 

I am thinking one of 3 plans: 

1. Sell all 3 properties, stay with a friend temporarily, and buy a modest property to live in, while interest rates are low, that will make a good rental someday. I would not know what to do the with cash sitting in my back account though and don't trust my financial adviser so open to thoughts on where to invest the proceeds. 

2. Sell the land but keep the primary residence and rental. 

3. Sell the rental and land and payoff my primary residence and be 100% debt free with $50-$75k in the bank.  

What are your thoughts PF? I really don't know what to do and feel like selling all 3 may be the best option. The end goal is to have the ability to retire (but probably won't) and have $7500 of monthly income coming in from investments and rentals. Thank you!",finance,1475193687

I completed graduate school in August and started my first job as an elementary teacher ($40,500/year salary) a few weeks ago. Now that I have a full-time job, I would like to start chipping away at my loans asap, but I feel like deciding how to go about doing it is a big decision and I don’t want to screw it up. My loan balance is currently $57,229 ($49,734 + $7,495 in outstanding interest).

**other**

* Federal Perkins $500 ($0 outstanding interest) 

Just in case I’m ever not working, I think that IBR makes the most sense for me to agree to. However, I plan on paying more than the minimum (if that is the right thing to do). I am considering consolidating my loans, but I am unsure which ones I should consolidate. I’m not sure if I should a) consolidate all but the federal perkins loan and the higher interest % loans and pay them off separately asap, or b) consolidate all but the federal perkins loan and the two lower % interest loans, or if c) I should consolidate all of the loans except for the federal perkins. 

Lastly, I know that as a teacher that once I make 120 monthly payments while working full-time the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program will forgive the remaining balance on my Direct Loans. My question about this is once I commit to consolidation and IBR, should I just pay the exact amount for each IBR loan payment, or should I try to pay off everything sooner by making bigger payments than required of me? If my loans will be paid off in 10 working years, is it worth making bigger payments now, or should I just make the minimum payments? Since I do not currently have a car payment, I could afford to pay more each month than the minimum will be. Unfortunately, teacher loan forgiveness isn’t applicable to me since I work in a “nice” district. 

Thanks in advance for you help! I cannot wait to wipe my hands clean of these loans.",finance,1475201952
personalfinance,Is it normal for my current mortgage company to offer to lower my current interest rate at no cost to me?,"So this is kind of a weird question and I'm not sure where else to go with it.  The short is in the title, a little bit more detailed information is below.  I included probably a bit more information than needed because I'm not sure what's relevant.

My wife and I bought our house a little over 2 years ago.  We went with a local bank had an 30 year 80/10/10 mortgage (10% down, 10% HELOC, 80% mortgage).  The mortgage is at a fixed 4.65% apr, the HELOC started at 0% for the first three months and then was transferred to a loan through the bank at a 4% fixed interest to be paid over 50 months.  We're well ahead of schedule on paying the HELOC off (and we've also thrown a few hundred extra at the mortgage, but that's peanuts).  

About three months ago a new mortgage company bought our mortgage and things have been going well.  Today I had a missed call from a number I recognized to be there, I called back a bit later, gave them my name, and was transferred to someone else in the company.  She told me they were calling with an offer to lower my interest rate.  Now normally I just end it there but today I decided to listen to her spiel.

Well the call was to offer us the opportunity to lower our current interest rate.  She would need to run our credit and the numbers first, but if everything looked good she hoped to offer us something closer to 4%.  She further explained that this would still be a fixed rate and still for the exact same term (the slightly less than 28 years left).  They would cover the cost of the appraiser and closing cost to refinance.  I flat out asked, what's the catch? and her explanation was that they were being proactive about customer retention rather than waiting for me to be dissatisfied and leave before they have the opportunity.  While that does make sense in a way, I still very suspicious of any company in this day and age doing that kind of thing.

Lastly (and probably not relevant) I remember my bank telling my that because I went with the 80/10/10 my current APR (4.65%) is about .5% higher than it would have been if we had 20% down.  I also know my house has appraised at around 10% higher than what we purchased it for and that my town has consistent increases in housing prices.

So I guess ultimately my question is, is this a normal practice?  Is there some sort of catch that I'm not seeing?  Or did I luck out in having a decent company buy my mortgage.  

I'm getting a call back tomorrow after they run my credit and doublecheck our debt/income ratio, and obviously I won't agree to anything without reading through everything well, but is there anything else I should be aware of?

TL;DR: My mortgage company is offering to lower my interest rate at no cost to myself (and keep every other detail exactly the same) and I can't find the catch.",finance,1475207506

I am running the Linux 64 version of both Ethereum and Mist (non-deb on Fedora 24). Both startup fine and start downloading blocks, but both say that I have no accounts. I checked the keystore and all files are there, but they are not seeing them for some reason. As soon as I reverted back to 0.8.2, the accounts showed back up. 0.8.2 no longer gets stuck on a block as it did about a week ago, but it is VERY slow, and it seems to be consuming a lot of resources (RAM and CPU).

I am stuck on poor performing 0.8.2 for now. Other that the missing accounts, the performance of 0.8.4 seemed to be a lot better: lower resource usage. 

Another FYI, it appears that Ethereum wallet executable name was changed.  I clicked on my old 0.8.2 launcher icon, an it failed to launch.  I looked at the executable: for the last several releases, it was named ""Ethereum-Wallet"".  In the 0.8.4 release, it was changed (inadvertently?) to ""Ethereum Wallet.""  I changed it back to the old name and everything worked fine. Final bug: I tried to create a new account with 0.8.4, and the account creation failed.

My theory: 

- The last crisis was autumn 2008 (the end of US President Bush's 8-year reign).

- A crisis could now hit in autumn 2016 (the end of US President Obama's 8-year reign).

- ie: ""they sweep the dirt under the rug for 8 years - but then the shit hits the fan when the rats jump the ship, every 8 years""

- The central bankers have used up all their ammunition already (QE, NIRP) trying to solve the 2008 crisis - and now their options are very restricted - and Deutsche Bank is 2x the size of Lehman Brothers!

Could the $14 billion fine from the US DoJ be the straw that could break the camel's back?

- Deutsche Bank has the highest derivatives exposure of any financial institution in the world: **$52 Trillion** (nominal)

- Deutsche Bank current market cap is only **$15.7 Billion** (only about 2x Bitcoin!!!)

- The US DoJ is hitting Deutsche Bank with a **$14 Billion** fine right now for mortgage fraud (along with several other banks).

- $15.7 Billion minus $14 Billion ... doesn't leave a lot of ""cash on hand""

personalfinance,"Gift from parents, looking for advice. Sorry for the long post.","Im 27 and make 1700$/month net as a new law grad, but will jump to approx. 50k when I start articling in February and then bigger jumps when I start working at the firm as an associate.  I work at a great firm who has committed to hiring me as articling student as well as an associate when I’m done.  It is a niche market and a small firm so remuneration will be much better than other non-big law firms.  


Debt:

91k student debt @ 2.7% interest- on my parents line of credit  ($207/month interests which parents are helping with, but don't want to take advantage of their generosity for too long) I can also dip into this in a worst-case scenario.

Equity:

-40k in tax free savings investment account making about 4-5% from dividends in BCE and RBC. Return on these has been great in terms of stock price increase since I bought them (10-12%).
-30k gift from parents



Expenses per month:

$50-gym
$70- cell phone (very cheap for what I get, can't be altered)
$50- transportation
$250- going out/entertainment
$400- tutoring for exams (for the next 3 months)

Total= 820$

Remaining funds: $880

Bank quoted a mortgage rate of 2.34% with parents co-signing. 

Goal is to own property in the near future. I live in Toronto which has been on the verge of a ""bubble burst"" for the past 5 years but prices on condos and houses seem to keep going up. Average house price is close to $1 million so condo is obviously the first step to property ownership. Lots of condos being built constantly which is also a worry in regards to supply/demand. I intend to live in this condo in 2 years when I have a more solid career standing, so fluctuations in the market wouldn't be great, but not as big a concern since it will be a place I live in and can ride out a dip in the market. Everyone says condos will be hit the hardest when interest rates go up (many opinions whether this will be in 3 years or 5 or 10).   My rational for stretching myself now is to get property asap to avoid even small increase in prices and also to have a tenant rent the property for 2 years and contribute to my mortgage payments.  I may have to subsidize the payments to cover the difference between rent and actual mortgage payments (approx. $200-$250) but I fell like it would be worth it.  Also, there is talk of a foreign ownership tax being implemented soon which helps my case of prices going up soon.  The big question I have as well is whether the interest rate hike that is forecasted will ruin me, even though I could dip into the credit line for help if absolutely necessary.

I also know renting is a hassle, but I think with a new enough place and a good vetting of the tenant, I should be ok.  I have lots of friends who are real estate agents or who rent properties so I have fairly good resources in this area.

Wondering if better to:



1. Put all 70k towards debt and pay it off aggressively until it's paid off (based on percentage of what I'm making at different points of career for the next 2 or so years). Would have to start saving for condo from scratch which would be another 2.5 years of saving (give or take) after debt repayment and prices might be higher, but could coincide with a bubble burst and be lower. 4.5 years is a long time to wait to enter the market, and I’m inclined to think that having a tenant for 2 years (while my salary is at its lowest) is beneficial.

2. Put some towards credit line debt, keep some in my savings/investments and budget to put savings towards debt and saving for downpayment. If so for how long?

3. Buy a condo for between 300k-350k and rent it out for 2 years. Calculated mortgage/maintenance fee/property tax payments to be about $2000/month and could rent it for about $1800 and would have to subsidize the remainder. 

4. Change up investment strategy (GIC, index funds etc.) for the next few years with the full 70k or split it up another way to maximize potential. 

5. Any other options you guys might come up with.




I really don’t want to avoid entering the market for 4+ years, but if it is recommended to wait until I’m more prepared, regardless of whether the market dips or goes up, I’m not interested in leveraging myself too much. I also have supportive parents who don’t mind me living at home, but let’s be honest, I’d rather be self-sufficient sooner than later.

Thank you very much for your advice.",finance,1475241908
personalfinance,Seller Financing?,"We have an opportunity to sell our house doing seller-financing. We haven't worked out specific terms yet, but here is what is being discussed:

Mr. X is a young entrepreneur who I used to work for. Mr X recently sold Wildly Successful New Restaurant and is flush with cash. He needs the majority of that cash to open up a new restaurant sometime in the next two years. In the meanwhile, he says he's earning good money consulting with other restaurants and caterers. However, the banks he has sought a mortgage loan from have all said they can't issue one without at least 12 months of demonstrated income from his new status of being self-employed. As a result he says to do seller-financing to sell the house with us. 

I've outlined how I understand it will work below. Those details have been shared with my seller's agent and a title company for their review to confirm my understanding. However, I wanted to share these terms with /r/PF to ensure that it makes financial sense to do this. Sales price of the house is $187,000

* We set up a promissory note (agreement that he owes us money) between Mr. X and the two of us (I'm thinking we would use Parker's firm for this).
* He puts a down payment of, say, 25%. That would mean we'd get $46,750 cash.
* We would then give our agent five of those percentage points for your 5% commission on the sale of the house ($9,350).
 * That would leave us with $37,400 in cash in-hand when Mr. X takes occupancy.
* Mr. X would further pay us a monthly sum for no more than a set period of time as determined by the promissory note. Let's say it's $1,500 at 8% interest for 24 months.
* * If 8% seems high, remember that we are paying 3.75% on our loan each month. To make this deal reasonable for us, we have to charge more than that to cover our costs and then whatever interest is fair to charge him on top of that to compensate for our risk exposure.
* At the end of that period, he would then pay for the rest of the house.
 * With the figures listed above, that would be $125,597.75.
* If at any point Mr. X fails to make a payment or ultimately reneges on the contract to buy the house after 24 months, we can evict him and keep everything he's paid, including his $46,750 down payment and all promissory payments, which will have included $21,347.75 in cumulative interest
 * Though this will be discounted by the cumulative interest we will have paid on our mortgage in the meanwhile, which will be about $11,400, so we come out about $10K ahead if he waits the full 24 months to buy outright.
* During the 24 months, he can at any time pay for the remaining principal in-full, transferring ownership to himself and avoiding paying our high interest rate.
* During the 24 months, we can write the contract so that Mr. X is responsible for the upkeep of the house and for any repairs or replacements that are necessary. For example, if they air conditioner breaks, he will be responsible for fixing it. If he wants to redo the kitchen, he can do it. However, we keep possession of those improvements if he breaks the contract (misses payments, fails to purchase after 24 months, etc.).
 * The legal team will need to put special attention on this. If Mr. X replaces the HVAC system but then doesn't buy, this could be considered unjust enrichment, and we might end up having to reimburse him if the contract is poorly written. I want to make sure the legal team that draws this up makes sure that doesn't happen.

Obviously we would want proof of income and he would need to pay the fees associated with setting this all up with the title company, but does this all sound right? Is this a good idea assuming I think he's good for the money and trustworthy? The house has been on the market since July.

**Edit**: Heard back from my guy at the title company.

&gt; Unfortunately, this won't exactly work like this.

&gt; This is more of a lease-to-own or bond-for-deed concept, which conceptually works fine, but in practice often results in confusion as to who owns and owes what when the contract eventually falls through. (People move into houses thinking it'll suit their needs forever, but typically want to move in 3-7; when the would-be-buyer goes to break these contracts, they always feel like they're owed something even though they've acquired no equity.)

&gt; I'll explain more later, but under a owner finance situation, you would be giving Mr. X title. You'd need to own the property free and clear or at least be able to pay off your mortgage with the proceeds of the sale. You would not be able to evict, because it's his house; what you'd get as holder of the mortgage is the opportunity to foreclose, and you wouldn't want to do that unless you were liquid enough to buy the property at sheriff sale if it came to that. Again, I can make this clear later, but since it doesn't sound feasible, I figure I should give you cause to pump the brakes as soon as possible.

&gt; My immediate thought is: Would this guy rent month-to-month or sign a short-term lease and allow you to keep the house listed? If he can get his own financing together, he could always make you an offer. Obviously this loses the cash-in-hand benefit of the sale, but you'd get monthly income off of it. I'm pretty sure Phyllis could take care of your property management if you decided to be landlords.

&gt; I'll follow up soon. Sorry to be a buzzkill.",finance,1475244053

personalfinance,"I accidentally marked exempt on my W4 form, and worked for three years before noticing. What do I do about it now?","Good morning Reddit, long-time lurker here, who seems to have found himself in a predicament.

In 2014 I started a seasonal job, March through June, and I returned to that job in 2015, and again in 2016(Though this year it extended to September). It was my first job, so I knew nothing about taxes back then(And only barely know anything now). I didn't file taxes or tax returns for 2014 or 15, because it seemed to be taken automatically out of the pay and I was told I didn't have to pay anything if I made less than 10,000, which I did until 2016.

I did/do look at every pay stub I receive. But I'd never shared it with anyone, nor had I ever looked at anyone else's, so I didn't realize there was a mistake until my sister(Who works for the same company) and I received our final paychecks this year, and for an unrelated reason, compared stubs for the first time. We were rather shocked to find that she payed over double what I did in taxes, despite earning just over half what I did(She's part time, I'm full). That's when I noticed I was exempt from State and Federal Withholding, and she was not. After some research, I found that I should not be either.

I don't know if this was my screwup or my boss' screwup, and I don't care, it was three years ago. I did some googling, and found that other folks have made the same mistake, but I'm posting here anyway because I've not found anyone that worked for so long before noticing. I guess I'm just a special kind of clueless.

Having waited so long, I'm a little worried the IRS is going to hit me with a fine. I have the savings necessary to pay what should have been withheld, barring a fine or massive interest, so my ultimate question is, what's my next move? Do I need to do anything before filing taxes(Which I've never done before) to let them know there was a mistake, and I'm not intentionally evading taxes?

**TL;DR:** Worked a seasonal job for 3 years, never filed taxes, just now realized that I've been exempt from Federal and State Withholding all this time. What do?

Thanks in advance!

**EDIT:** After some more research and talking with you all, it seems the bigger screwup was not filing taxes for 2014 and 2015. [As I understand it](http://www.efile.com/what-are-the-penalties-for-not-filing-a-tax-return-or-not-to-pay-taxes-IRS-penalty-list/), I'm late enough that I'll pay the max late-filing penalty($205) and the max late-payment penalty(25%), twice, once for each year. Ouch, but it's manageable - my new question is, how does my accidental exemption effect this? Do I just file anyway, accept the fees, trust them to sort the exemption out, and file a new W4 for next year's work? Or do I need to let the IRS know of the mistake somehow - And if so, how do I go about that?

**EDIT 2:** Between you all and google I've learned a lot about taxes today, and don't actually seem to be in any immediate trouble. Thank you for your responses and your patience!

I am wondering if you can all help me decide if staying at home is really worth the “savings.” Some background information: 
I’m giving a bit of an income statement to show you how I would compare the two scenarios.  http://imgur.com/a/xb1TU The biggest assumption here is that if I stay home, I can put more towards the loans. To be perfectly honest, as much as I know getting the debt out of the way is crucial, the added interest doesn’t particularly scare me if it means I can have a better quality of life in the city. I’m also aware I don’t have utilities in there, which I don’t think would put too much of a dent in my scenario so hopefully someone can point out something I’m missing. 

I also would like an opinion on whether I should consolidate my loans or not. This is the breakdown:

- Unsub Stafford		20,500 @ 5.84%

- Sub Stafford		5,500 @ 4.66%

- Sub Stafford		5,500 @ 3.86%

- Sub Stafford		4,500 @ 3.4%

- Unsub Stafford		2,000 @ 6.8%

- Unsub Stafford		5,500 @ 6.8%

Right now I’m looking at about 46k which isn’t insurmountable but obviously is a little more than I would like. My rationale would be that if I consolidated, got a lower minimum payment and blended interest rate, and paid it off as if IT WASN’T consolidated, it would make things go faster.

However, reading through Carmax Financing's FAQ, I find this statement: 

&gt; Any additional amount is applied to future payments, up to the next 3 payments, unless otherwise required by law. Any remaining amounts will be applied to the principal balance owed on your account.
&gt; 
&gt; If you have a $100 payment due February 1st, and you send in $500 on February 1st, your payment will satisfy your February 1st $100 payment, your March 1st $100 payment, your April 1st $100 payment, and your May 1 $100 payment.

Here's the rundown (numbers rounded for convenience):

* My gross pay is $7,100 a month.

* Rent is $2100.

* Transportation to and from work is $90 (and I might actually be able to get my employer to pay for this).

* Insurance (health, auto, etc.) is $290.

* 401 k (maxing matching) is $210.

* Phone and internet is $130.

* Student loans are $230.

* Utilities are roughly $100 (estimated from comparable properties and averaged over the year).

* A rough estimate of taxes (state and fed) is $2,000.

* Assume $1,200 in food and other expenses (I'm pretty frugal and according to my spending per month, this is an overestimate).

* Parking spot is $250.

This puts my net at $500 a month, which gives me flexibility to build back up my savings (security deposits are expensive) and to hopefully start investing once I'm stable.

All I had when I left prison was the support of my two sisters, my grandmother, aunts and uncles.  Without them, I would not be where I am today.

It has been a year and a half since I left prison.  I am grateful and fortunate for what I have.  I have a car. I have my own apartment and I was recently promoted to supervisor at my work. I know how fortunate I am to have these because I know firsthand so many do not make the transition from prison life successfully.

With my promotion, I make 13.50 hourly.  I am currently on a 6 day weekly schedule which I am loving because the overtime is 20.25. I work 10 to 12 hours a day on top of a 1 hour drive to work/home one way.  So, I am beat when I get home.  This overtime will not last though.  Most likely until the xmas holiday is over.  We are severely short staffed.  Once we get more people, overtime will go away.

Since I got this job, (and it took me forever after I was released to get hired) it has been a constant worry in the back of my mind how can I possibly handle my debts?  I’ve been terrified to even try to find out how much my student loan payments are because there is no way I can make the payments.  I owe 45k in student loans.
The last week and a half a collection agency has been calling about the lease that was broken when I was incarcerated.  My wife (now ex) moved out of the house we were renting when I was first incarcerated.

I always pay my monthly expenses first and consider myself lucky if I have an extra 50 to 100 left just for myself.

Will I be responsible to pay the entire amount of whatever they are demanding? Should my ex not be responsible for half of the amount?  My credit is shit but I was considering trying to apply for a small loan (if any bank would loan to me) to pay off the lease amount. The benefits of that, I was thinking, was 1: it takes care of that problem and 2: it will help me reestablish and rebuild my credit.

Given my two incomes, I’m not even sure what my AGI is, so I’m having a hard time estimating quarterly taxes. Is my AGI what I anticipate my pre-tax (or post-tax?)

*About us:* We're recently married, both 28, have a combined income of $130K, no credit card debt, and great credit. I have $100K in stock (mostly blue chips with a few gambles), $50K in funds, and $50K in a 403b.  She has some stock through her company ($5K maybe) and $30K in a 401k.  

*The loans:* They total $86K with an 80/20 split between private and federal loans, respectively, and rates ranging from 5% to 11.7%. 

Ideally I just want to get the monkey off our backs but at the same time I'm thinking about what that $85K would be in 35 years.  I think my two options are below but if you see additional options or a different way to attack the problem, I'm all ears:

1. Cash out the stock, pay the taxes, pay off loans 
 * Even with this option my wife has every intention of paying me back the $86K so it's more of an interest free loan.
 * In an ideal world, after ~8 years all $86K would be back in the stock market but I could also see some of this going towards a down payment on a house or additional mortgage payments. 

1. Reconsolidate with a student loan company, pay more than the monthly minimum, and slowly (but quicker than before) pay off the loans
 * With this option any advice on the student loan company?  I was thinking SoFi.
 * Is there such a thing as using the stock as collateral to get a lower rate?
 * How much more should we be paying towards this? I'm guessing as much as possible?  
 * What about cashing out $5K in stock here and there to bring down the loan faster? 

I'm open to any and all feedback, new or creative ideas, or stories from anyone who has done something similar.  Thanks!",finance,1475265937

personalfinance,"Came into some money 6 months after buying a house, thinking of refinancing for 15 year loan, smart or should I wait?","So basically I put 10% down on a house in February. The payment is manageable even if one of us lost our job (we'd have to sell cars but wouldnt lose house)

Last month I received a lawsuit settlement and my husband also got a nice raise. I was paying our entire mortgage but with his raise I have asked him to contribute at least a couple hundred a month to help out.

I plan to pay it down to the 20% equity line to get rid of the PMI. When I was looking into this I ran by a calculator and just messing around input what our payment would be if we refinanced to 15 years after paying another 10% into the principal. It was about $300 more than what we pay now with a lower interest rate (we both have 760+ credit scores). 

This, however, would mean it would be tough to float for long if someone lost a job but we have a 6 month+ nest egg in savings so Im not too worried about that longterm as we both are engineers who could find employment without too much trouble. Might have to take pay cut but highly doubtful either of us would be unemployed more than 6 months and thats covered. Plus we can cut back on dining out, name brand clothes, and some of the other frivolous spending we do.

Question is, we just paid closing costs in february. I have no idea how much sense it makes to refinance so soon after buying. I plan to talk to a mortgage guy but until Im sure about it I dont want to have them bugging me regularly again. I would definitely prefer a 15 year loan over 30 and would love to have a lower rate.

personalfinance,Why do so many college students not have jobs?,"Preface: I'm a European from a country with free college education, so this is all completely different for me, I'm just trying to make sense of this.

So the federal minimum wage is $7.25. The average yearly cost of college is $9,139 (that's in-state tuition). Let's say that the person in question has a small number of scholarships and grants, brining the number down to a round $8,000.

That means a person needs to work for 1,104 hours a year to pay for tuition, or 27 weeks full-time.

However, of course college students can't work full time and study. So if they worked all year round, minus 2 weeks of visiting their family and stuff, that brings us down to 22 hours a week. It might be a little high, but that shows that even ten hours a week can halve someone's college loans!

Then why do I hear American friends of mine complain how they're going to graduate massively in debt? Surely there's something I'm missing? I'm not pretending like ""jobs"" is such a novel idea that no one's ever had it, so what's the actual reason?",finance,1475268166

personalfinance,Personal loan or personal line of credit,I am looking to borrow 5k from the bank to do some repairs on my home.  Before anyone asks - my house does not have enough equity built into it to get a home loan.  My dilemma is I don't know if I should get a personal loan or a line of credit.  The interest rates are similar but of course the personal loan has a fix rate while the line of credit does not.  I plan to pay the balance off in a year.  My fear with a line of credit is that once I pay it off that will effect me getting a car loan in 3 years because the line is open.  My fear with the loan is that I plan to do more repairs to my house in 3-4 years and asking for loan so soon after this one will get denied.  Can someone considering my situation please advise me what the best option is ?,finance,1475269479
personalfinance,Better to put one-time lump in IRA or pay down new mortgage (5% down)?,"My wife and I bought our first house this year with 5% down on a 3.5% interest rate (30 year fixed). We pay ~$70 in PMI, which can be canceled after 2 years IF we have reached 20% equity. Last year we contributed 11K to our Roth IRAs (5.5K limit each) in a lump sum at the end of the year. As we approach year-end with a similar amount of extra sitting in savings (above our emergency fund), would we be better to dump another 11K into our Roths, or would that money be better used to make lump sum progress on the principal of our mortgage? We are in our early/mid 30's, BTW.

I do worry about a market correction in the next year or so, which has me inclined to pay off existing debts rather than expect growth on anything I invested in the market right now. Plus I like the thought of a payment going to straight principal - it just feels clean. 

Am I in the right frame of mind here, or is there something I'm not considering?   Thanks!",finance,1475271337

personalfinance,Going back to school and need suggestions,"I've recently been accepted to an accelerated nursing program (1 year) the total cost will be around 34k....these are my current debts:

*  7.2k loan- Worked out a deal to only pay half my monthly fee for the year.
* 9k - Credit cards with various interest rates ( 18-25%) 

I've never dealt with student loans before so I'm not sure if it would be smart to request/ accept a little extra to pay off some of my high-interest CC? Does anyone have any suggestions on which route i should go in dealing with this situation.",finance,1475277819
