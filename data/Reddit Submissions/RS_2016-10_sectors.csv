personalfinance,[Planning] Landed the dream job. Now what?,"Hello Everyone!

I recently landed my dream job. It has come with a lot of perks in a field that I am very passionate about. It is a nonprofit and has a pension after five years. It also comes with a 403b plan that they match 2% after 4% invested (not quite sure what this means). Other perks include healthcare / dental plan, payed jury duty, paid sick leave etc. 

I am 20k in debt from student loans, and make 1600 a month before taxes with yearly raises depending on my performance. My monthly bills total roughly 1k. This is mostly due to a new car needed for my commute and living expenses. My new car interest rate is roughly 19% (I KNOW, but my credit was my own fault; now I am trying to build it up). My company will allot 1500 for tuition per semester for my bachelors but it will more than likely not effect my pay unless I use the BA to apply to a higher position.  

Should I focus on student loans? Save any cash? Begin my 403b? I would be happy to provide information just looking for some help to not put myself back into the hole I just dug myself out of (recently paid off the rest of my CC debt totaling 3k).",finance,1475289814
gaming,The Tremendous Tragedy of Waluigi,"Waluigi carries with him a tragic backstory…
During the great war of the battle of the Mushroom Kingdom, Waluigi was born. His face was distorted and his body appeared frail. He was considered worthless to the Mushroom Kingdom as he was neither useful nor handsome. As a baby, Waluigi was abandoned by his parents and thrown into a local toxic waste dumpster. Luckily, Waluigi was saved by a gang of walking Piranha Plants. The gang, called the Piranha Plant Posse, raised Waluigi in the deep, dark forest. He learned various survival skills from the Plants including: hunting for food, making a fire, and how to lurk within the shadows. Over time, Waluigi became stronger and eventually grew into an awkward looking man. As the young man matured he eventually realized that he was not like the Piranha Plants. Poor Waluigi doubted his self-worth, he wondered if he would ever become a valuable member of society. Waluigi’s emotions were scattered, his thoughts littered with doubt. He ran away from the forest and dwelt in a cave where his diet consisted strictly of poison mushrooms. Waluigi was depressed with his life. He began to search for something that could ease his pain. Poor Waluigi began to smoke weed, and cut himself as he was discontented with himself. Eventually, he pondered hanging himself, until one day a mysterious man reached out to him. The mysterious man claimed he could turn Waluigi’s life around, but it would be at a cost. Waluigi was desperate for answers and guidance in his life. He nodded his head and looked confidently into the mysterious man’s eye. Waluigi opened his mouth and screeched, “Wah!” in agreement. For the next several years Waluigi became more devious, he became a slave owner and worked his slaves to death, crafting his masterpiece, Wallywood. Wallywood, was a magnificent city with a theme park at its center. The theme park attracted guests from all over the Kingdoms. Wallywood become a tourist destination for many, but it was ultimately an inspiration for the masses.
 	Because of the war, both Goomba’s and Koopas alike began to travel to Wallywood. The travelers came to Wallywood to create a new life for themselves apart from the horrid war within the Mushroom Kingdom.  All was looking good for Waluigi and his dream of Wallywood. Everything was seen as perfect in Waluigi’s eyes except for one thing. The mysterious man was actually Wallywood’s governor and Waluigi had developed a grudge against the governor.
 One night, while children were sleeping in their warm beds, murder occurred. The streets sounded with the screeches of Waluigi saying, “Wah!” and the crack of his whip. Waluigi, blinded by his lust for power, lost his sanity. He started a mass murder within Wallywood that started with the mysterious man. The mysterious man was dead, Waluigi was set for success. Yet, he believed he could gain more control and power if he instilled fear into Wallywood’s citizens. Waluigi hired a militia of Shy Guys to round up innocent citizens. Then, one by one, Waluigi slayed hundreds of Wallywood’s citizens by the crack of his whip. Wallywood would never be the same. 
That night, an airship came rushing into Wallywood. It floated over the city in search of the cause of chaos. Eventually the airship and its crew of Toads spotted Waluigi carrying out his devilish acts. The Toads shined a large, brilliant light upon Waluigi. A high pitch sound came from a megaphone on the airship, “Sir, put the weapon down!” Waluigi was too determined however, he refused to submit to the authority of the Mushroom Kingdom. Captain Toad looked Waluigi straight in the eyes from his airship. Captain Toad held up the megaphone again, “Put an end to all this madness or we will!” Walugi met Captain Toad’s stare with disgust, he responded with an angry, “WAAAAAAH!” At that moment, Captain Toad knew what he had to do. He ordered one of his crewman to load a rifle and bring it to him. Captain Toad held up the megaphone on last time and said to Waluigi, “LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME! I AM THE CAPTAIN NOW!” Captain Toad then grabbed the rifle from the crewman, steadied his aim at Waluigi’s head and pulled the trigger. 
The sudden *BANG* crackled throughout the now-ravaged world of Wallywood. Silence fell upon the land for several moments, with nothing but the incessant hum of the airship hovering over Waluigi’s body. He laid flat upon the ground, whip beside him, and face bloodied. The citizens of Wallywood took this opportunity to throw him off the cliff of Wallywood into the tropical jungle 1700 feet below. His lifeless body tumbled down for 3 minutes and 42 seconds until falling into a thorn bush. The prickly thorns tore his mustache into a sharp point, with a steep curve upwards, as if creeping along his jawbone. Days passed before he gained consciousness. By a miraculous feat, Waluigi had survived the gunshot by the skin of his teeth. Well, in his case, his nose. The unusually durable cartilage in his nose stopped the impact of the bullet. However, his nose was completely destroyed in the collision. During the time he laid passed out, skin grew around the bullet, eventually enveloping it whole. He now had a new, even bigger nose with a fresh layer of pink-toned skin. This bullet made his nose even more durable, and supplied him with an eternal whiff of charred gunpowder. Enraged, he grabbed his whip to lash at everything in sight, but his whip was gone. Then, noticing the hundreds of cuts covering his body, an idea occurred to him. With a newfound hatred inside of him, he sought out to make an even deadlier whip to take revenge amongst Captain Toad and the scumbags of Wallywood. He tied together vines and tree bark to make a durable whip, then dragged it through every thorn bush he could find in the jungle. His end product was a magnificent thorn-coated whip. With a devilish grin upon his face, he thought about lashing and cutting his victims, he let out through a shrill scream: “WAHHHH!” in excitement. He spent a week in the jungle recovering from his injuries, and patching up his face, which was even more hideous than before. He knew he would need reinforcements to bring Wallywood to ashes, and he knew just where to go. 
He trekked back to the cave which was once his home. Inside, deep within the cave, was a warp pipe he had discovered when he lived there once before. With a quick “SHLOOP” he slunk down the pipe and plopped into a world of utter darkness. It was the Mushroom Kingdom Black Market. Feeling his way along the walls he stumbled upon the central market. Following the dimly lit paths he happened upon a stand offering weapons. Waluigi requested two sub machine guns with extra clips, and a small army of Koopa Thugs. The merchant looked him up and down with his monocle. Satisfied with the evil emanating from his aura, the man brought him a contract to sign. Since Waluigi had no cash to sign he had to give the merchant his soul in exchange, Waluigi had nothing left to lose so he sacrificed it without hesitation. 
At the crack of dawn he exited the cave, strapped with machine guns and munching on his favorite poison mushrooms. Following behind him were 12 Koopa Thugs equipped with thorny whips. They spent the day trekking across Mushroom Kingdom, reaching the entrance of Wallywood at sunset. Shivering with delight, Waluigi walked up to the entrance and screamed: “WAHHHHHH!” The Koopa Thugs yelled in agreement and charged through the entrance in unison. Terror and death spread throughout the town like wildfire and Koopa Thugs whipped citizens to death and dragged their bodies into the street. Waluigi walked through the streets blasting rounds of bullets through people’s homes as he munched on his mushrooms. He reached the top of his town where the sign “Wallywood” stood. He slowly placed a cigar in his mouth, lit it at the end, took one deep breath, and puffed out the smoke as he flung the lighter onto the sign. He looked down upon the town, the citizens scampering around like ants with no home. He laughed in delight until something caught his eye. In the distance a battalion of airships came flying towards him. Infuriated, he hid behind the burning sign to ambush them. Over the course of 14 minutes, the airships launched 170 bullet bills into Wallywood, completely incinerating all life, whether it be innocent or evil. 
Burning, black ash coated the once-lively town, then Captain Toad stepped onto the battlefield. His troops carried personal fire extinguishers as they wandered throughout the land putting out dying flames. Captain Toad wandered over to the burning sign of Wallywood. Upon reaching the base of it he aimed his hose at the flames. Immediately a crack echoed throughout the flames and a whip flew around Captain Toad’s neck. Shocked, he dropped his hose and gripped his neck for dear life as the thorns tore into his windpipe. Captain Toad gasped for air and kicked the ground as he was being pulled closer and closer into the flames. Slowly a deformed face with a gigantic nose creeped out of the darkness with a villainous grin. Waluigi pulled Captain Toad into the flames with a vicious “WAH!” Captain Toad’s face was now being roasted in a pile of flames as Waluigi kicked his burning body. Immediately Captain Toad pulled out his hunters knife and slashed it clean through Waluigi’s knee cap. Waluigi screamed out “WAH!” as he collapsed into the fire too. With a vicious struggle for survival amongst the falling rubble of a flaming sign, the two whipped and cut each other while rolling around the burning debris. Blinded by the heat and losing oxygen quickly, they scuttled out of the flames and gasped for air. Staggering to their feet the two faced off once again. Waluigi went with a low throw of his whip, knocking Captain Toad off his feet and ripping his left foot off. Captain Toad whipped out his sawed off shotgun and blasted Waluigi’s left knee cap clean off, which was already loose from the knife wound. Waluigi let out a tremendous “WAH!” as he flung himself onto Captain Toad and wrapped the rope around his throat. Captain Toad reached for his fire extinguisher and slammed it directly into Waluigi’s face, shattering the left side of his jawbone. Waluigi retaliated with a loud “WAH!” and punched Captain Toad directly in the throat, sending the thorns deeper into his windpipe. Distracted with Captain Toad’s screeching, he did not notice him reloading his sawed off shotgun for a finishing blow. Waluigi knew what that would mean at point blank range. He tumbled backwards with his remaining leg and had to let go of his whip to create distance. Captain Toad coughed up blood as he stood up on his one good leg. Waluigi crawled away in fear, knowing he was at a disadvantage without his weapon. Toad hobbled forward and aimed the barrel directly at Waluigi’s face. Just before pulling the trigger a burning letter from the Wallywood sign collapsed onto Toad, burying him in flaming debris. Waluigi saw this as his chance to escape, and crawled to the edge of the cliff he was once thrown off of, and flung himself into the jungle below while laughing maniacally with a “wahahahahah!” Again he tumbled down for 3 minutes 42 seconds before slamming into solid ground. Bleeding out he tourniquetted his own leg with a make-shift thorny whip in order to stop the blood flow. Screaming in pain he passed out for three more days. 
Once he came to, he realized he was still in the jungle. He realized he had not been captured and was once again miraculously given a third chance at life, and second chance at revenge. With gun powder secreting from his distorted nose, he vowed upon the life of his fallen leg, that this attempt would not end like the others.",technology,1475291685
personalfinance,Need advice for what I should be doing with my current savings account and extra income at this point given my current loans.,"I'm making $17.50/hour (roughly $27,000/year post-taxes). After rent, car payment, bills, I have roughly $300/month to save. I have a small Roth IRA going ($4,000) and my company just started up a 401K that I hopped on.  

Meanwhile, I have $7,500 in a savings account... I owe $10,500 in student loans. I pay 4.5% on $3,000 of that and 5.84% on $7,500 of it.  I also screwed up and managed to rack up $4,000 in CC debt. My CC interest isn't that bad, like 1%, and I'm no longer making purchases on that.

I hear you should keep 6-9 months of earnings in savings in case of emergency, so thats already more than I have in there.  But I'm getting slammed with those student loan interest hits. At this rate, I'll pay $14K to pay off my $10K loans. 

Should I a) keep everything as I have it now and just invest my $300/month to student loans and pay the minimum on my CC?

b) move some of my savings to my student loans to lower the interest hits, but reducing my emergency funds?

c) move some of my savings to my CC to free up emergency funds on my CC, while eliminating that 1% of interest?

Any other suggestions/ideas are greatly appreciated. Edit* - I am going to speak to my bank about possibly having them take over my loans at a lower interest rate.  Or my bosses. They're cool like that.",finance,1475296555

And what companies should i potentially look into/avoid?



Edit: Thanks to those who responded to this. I guess for starters i should say i was a bit ignorant to how apr worked ect. Which is why i asked. The card will basically just be used to pay for things i'd pay for with cash or debit anyways (was told by a buddy with good credit thats a good way to use it). So if its only an issue if i dont keep up with payments on a purchase then i guess its not really an issue.

personalfinance,Is this something I can do with a mortgage?,"This is probably a dumb question, so just bear with me.

Say I purchase a house for $600k.  After my down payment, I have a mortgage for $480k, at 3.4 or so interest, resulting in monthly payments of $2,129.

I make payments as scheduled for a couple of months, then for whatever reason I come into a windfall of money, say $300k.

I know I could take that money and make a large lump payment against the principle (assuming no pre-payment penalties), which will vastly shorten the length of the loan, but my monthly payments will remain unchanged.
  
Is it possible to do the opposite?  Basically keep the length of the loan the same, but vastly lower the monthly payment?  If I take $300k off the top of the $480k, that would leave me with $180k left, which would work out to about $800 a month.

Originally the dental office charged the entire treatment plan (nearly 5,000$) onto the Care Credit card she acquired for this purpose. Later on, she decided against doing the entire treatment plan and asked to be credited back most of the original charge leaving roughly only a 700$ + charge on the card. So far she has made 3 payments one in July, one in August and one in September. The decision against the remaining treatment was made in August resulting in a 4151$ charge being removed from the card.

Apparently this company is notorious for insanely high interest rates to the point where if you make only the minimal payments, 80% of them are going solely to interest, leaving the charge to fester for as much interest as possible. 

Is there a way to recoup the interest charges previously paid into for when there was a 4,500$+ charge on the card or is it sunk?

Fast forward to present today, none of the other two will give the report if requested via mail, and if I try the annualcreditreport.com website the bureaus each ask they own questions to try to identify me in combination with my info like name address and SSN. Most of the questions are silly like who did I get my mortgage with 5 years ago and the monthly payments. I don't have a mortgage or bought any cars 5 years ago. When I answer these question appropriately and choose the right answers I mysterious get a message saying that there website is malfunctioning and I have to mail in copies of my drivers license, a utility bill, and SSN card - which I never do because that's crazy.

I was amazingly surprised because they ask the exact same questions like on annualcreditreport.com but yet I am able to get my reports, if I pay for them that is! I come to the conclusion that while annualcreditreport.com is government mandated, these bureaus only it as a way to gather more data and to upsell you the report by denying your request when you use that website. They want you to pay for some that by law they should give on request once per year. They may say they deny the request because they can't prove your identity if you use the website. That is bullshit because they don't ask for a copy if your drivers license, utility bill and SSN card if you go to each of there websites and buy your credit report which they of course bundle in with a credit score.

I am a trained ESOL instructor and plan on getting back into the workforce in the next few years and possibly during the summers even earlier. My federal loans are consolidated, and I am currently in IBR, with a $0 required monthly payment. 

My husband just finished his doctorate and has ~$90k in debt. He is currently working a full time job unrelated to his field and adjuncting at two colleges as well, earning ~$58k a year in total. He is still in his grace period, but when he begins paying back his loans, he will be eligible for the PSLF program.

He is going to get a raise at work soon, and we're planning on living at the same means we are now and putting the money towards savings or debt, which leads me to my question-

Given our current situation, would it be better to aggressively pay down our debt or do IBR for both of us? If we do pay it down, whose should we pay down first? If he's going to PSLF anyway, would it be wasteful to aggressively pay down his debt?

* First and foremost money are created by central bank out of thin air and granted to the economy in the form of the loan.  Let's say in the initial phase the economy requires $100 to trade, develop and operate.  Federal reserve provides the economy with $100 in a form of a loan at the rate of 3%. (Loan is not backed by anything, just an entry in the ledger but that's not the point).  At the end of the year, the economy needs to repay the loan + the interest.  Wait!  But economy only has $100 to begin with.  Where should it get extra money to repay the interest?  That is right, it has to borrow again to repay that interest.  So you get my point - with current system design, one has to continue to borrow to repay the interest - indefinitely.   But this only part of the point.

* the second part of the point is the fact that interest on the loan is calculated using compound formula, while economy grow at the simple rate.  The high school math tells us that the rate of growth of compound formula is much faster than simple rate. Eventually everything that is owned gets turned into a debt - and then what's next?
 
The most I am upset about is that there is this army of scholars and  economists and why they cannot figure this out?  My only explanation is that at one point the fact that the speed of one object is only relevant to the speed of another did not come obvious to the world until the Einstein came around with theory of relativity.

Tl;dr I want to understand how the interest rate on my savings account can help me (and potentially hurt me, if it can).

Here's a bit of background:
I graduated in May, and opened a savings account to start putting money away to repay loans. I don't have a full time job yet (though I do have a decently paying part time job), but I am actively looking. I also do not have any credit cards besides a store credit card - I know it's important to start building credit, but I've never had enough of a steady income to make payments on anything but my store credit card until now (I.e the majority of my money earned throughout college went toward rent and utilities). 

My current savings account only has an interest rate of 0.05%. I have been putting away a lot of money, and I really want it to grow. If I choose a bank with a better rate, can that hurt me due to transfer fees or minimums, or will it only help?",finance,1475411328

My wife and I are looking to buy our first home in the next year, and while I've done a bit of research, I'm still iffy on a few things.

I've been told by some that it's best to use a mortgage lender / broker like Prospect Mortgage since it's our first go-round. However, I wasn't sure if that would involve more fees?

What would be the better option: using a mortgage lender, or securing a loan through a credit union like Pentagon Federal Credit Union?

About how early should we go through the process? We are looking to buy between June and August, as we have a child in school, and I'd rather not deal with him having to change schools mid-year. 

My wife has somewhat of a need for a new car, though we are trying to hold off. She currently has a 2001 Civic with 100k miles, but she would greatly benefit from an AWD vehicle given her commute. At this point, we are looking to get some repairs done on the vehicle and get some snow tires for the winter. However, I was wondering: 

How much a new car loan would impact the potential mortgage rates that we would receive?

Ideally in buying a home, we'd like to put down between 10 and 12%... the closer to 20% the better, but we also want to make sure we have enough of a slush / emergency fund in place. We have 2 kids, and it is more advantageous to buy at this point than rent, as 3BR rentals are few and far between, and cost a ton.

I have roughly two years until I graduate and can start looking for a job so I can tackle my debt properly.

My rent, food, and tuition are paid by my parents but I know they can't and won't help me here.

personalfinance,Effect of paying off auto loan early on future mortgage?,"Hi PersonalFinance,

I was wondering how the choice to pay off a car loan early may affect our mortgage in the near future. At our current rate of savings, we're anticipating being able to save a 20% down payment for a home in 1.5 years. Meanwhile, we have an auto loan at 1.99% that will, at our current payment schedule, be paid off in 2.2 years. Paying off the car loan right now would take about 20% of our current savings. There is no penalty from the bank for early pay-off.

Since the interest rate is relatively low, there is not much savings in interest to be had from paying it off early, but I was wondering about other potential beneficial/detrimental effects. Would paying off that debt before starting a mortgage be likely to give us better interest rates on the mortgage? We don't use our credit card much at the moment, so these car payments are one of the few things building our credit rating; would it make sense to keep paying the regular payments to continue to build our credit rating? Could paying off the car loan significantly reduce our car insurance payments (the car is worth less than $10k)?

I just repaired the transmission  ($650) and right after my idle air control valve went out ($300). I was almost unable to register it because it was out for a month for the tranny repair, and the IAC meant it wouldn't pass smog. Now, the clutch is making tons of noise, there's another vacuum leak, and it isn't shifting smooth. I'm taking it back to my mechanic, and I'm going to make him fix it, but the car is just too unreliable. I usually have to throw $1500 a year at it just to make it run. Plastic is starting to break everywhere, there's rust on it because mitsubishi thought it would be a grand idea not to prime the undercarriage once it left the factory, it has high miles (160k), the timing belt will need to be done in 20k. 
I keep having to use ubera, bum rides from friends, borrow company vehicles, etc just to getc around. I need a reliable car as I'm on call pretty often at my job, it's a requirement. 
I've been shopping around and think I'm going to get a kia. The invoice price is 21k, Im going to try to get it to 19k. It's everything I need. Spacious, takes regular gas, not too expensive to insure, zippy, and it has an AMAZING warranty. The problem, though, it that I've lent too much money to family and have very little liquid cash currently. 
I do, however, have a 5k credit card with no interest financing till February of next year. I'd also get cash back too. I want to get my loan down to 16k, that would make my payments from 250-270 a month. 
I currently bring home about 2k a month after taxes. My rent is 300 a month, Internet is 40, I probably spend about 200 a month on food, 60 a month on gas (this wouldn't change much if at all, the MLGS are similar), 70 a month on insurance  (this would double. I could go 120 a month for full coverage, with 1k deductibles though), 30 to do laundry, and I try to put at least $100 a month into savings  (just my credit unions savings account, I don't have an Ira) have no debt, and a good credit score (740 according to discovers credit score card).
I'll get my tax return back before February next year, and I usually get about 1k returned. My birthday is also in January, and I usually just ask for cash. The interest rate will go 13.49% in March next year, which scares me. I don't think I'll be able to put anymore than 1k down without using it though (I would be suprised if I sold my car for 1k right now aswell).

When I was hired at my current job, I was only to work as a barista/cashier. At the interview I agreed to work 10/HR and in a month I'd work for 11/HR. Since then, I have picked up having to work on the Deli Slicer(cutting meats and cheeses) when my co-worker is at his other job, and I count the inventory every week when required. Soon, I will need to count down the register at the end of my shift. I have offered to do all of these things in hope of my boss saying I want to teach you my job(which, the only thing he really does now that I don't is actually order the food online). People I work with have been there for years without raises, and I do more then they do in the 3 months I've been working here, but I do make more an hour they do. I've been here for 3 months now, and still only making the 10/HR. I have been looking passively for a job for about a month now, which is now turning into more then passive. I don't feel comfortable asking for the 11/HR because my boss is just sour with anything monetary related. Was a week where everybody got paid half of what they were supposed to and he didn't give a shit.

Anyway, I am 26, no college education, married to the best woman ever, we don't have any kids( we aren't trying), we just took out a loan for a new car (12,500 at a 3.1% interest rate because of our co-signer). I don't drive, as we have always shared a vehicle.(I have a permit, and I'm learning to drive day by day).

I have roughly 6 months of kitchen experience. I have knife skills. I'm the cook at home.
I have roughly 2 months of farm experience working on a hydroponic farm. 
I've taught myself basic accounting last week, but there is a glass ceiling to this knowledge without having to gone to school. 
I also own stocks through Robinhood(current portfolio worth is 5.5K) and just opened a Roth IRA(yet to put my $1,000 in my IRA, so I know bits and pieces about the stock market.
I have an interest in gold, silver, coins, and collectibles. I used to make a few bucks here and there selling and buying wheat pennies.

I've been one of those on the bottom workers for a while now(26 y/o, married, no kids, making 10/HR)

I feel I am undervalued for several reasons, and the only way to maybe make a better wage is become an assistant manager or manager. I can't ask my boss to train me in what he does, because well he doesn't want to lose me as an employee(I make his life a lot easier).

how does one jump from my position to higher position without college experience or managerial experience ? what can I do to help out my situation ?

are we in a day of age where the employer won't even look at you without a degree ?

I do believe in there is no such thing as a free lunch, but is there something I can learn in a particular field that would make me valuable ?

However over a couple beers yesterday a good friend of mine told me he had applied and been accepted to the [Turing School of Software &amp; Design](https://www.turing.io/) here in Denver. It is a 7 month ""bootcamp"" type school that covers exactly what I want to be doing without the need for unnecessary classes and the unreasonable amount of Calculus classes I would be stuck in with the traditional 4 year degree route. However it is 5 days/week all day classes with a pretty heavy workload. I would need to quit my job in order to have the time and energy required to fully commit to the program. With that said, the school costs $20,000 with a refundable $1,000 deposit once you are accepted. On top of the tuition loan, I would need to take out a cost of living loan as well. I currently have a car loan from my Credit Union at $5,800 that I pay $150/month for on a ~4% interest rate, and about $600 in remaining bills each month. And roughly $2,500 in savings in a Betterment account that I would prefer not to touch.

Question 1: Turing offers loans through Climb and Skills fund see [here](https://www.turing.io/tuition) with seemingly high interest rates and payments. But the payments are differed until graduation. Would it be more beneficial to take out a loan from my Credit Union at a lower rate, but with immediate payments?

Question 2: If I were to take the loan out from my Credit Union, would I just tack on the estimated cost of living?

If any other info would be helpful please let me know. It seems to me like a no brainer as opposed to 3 or more years of school for a CS degree, as degrees are becoming less valuable.

1A. how do i minimize the presence of my MIL? shes very busy. coordinating these times between the MIL whos signing, the FIL who works out deals because he has previous car salesmen experience, and me who is buying is extremely hard. minimizing just one person really makes this process easier.

1B. do we go to her credit union first and get pre-approved with me? people suggest getting pre-approved for a loan and keeping it secret to a dealership until the end of the deal, because their finance/interest rates is where they try to get you, and holding out on them that you are already pre-approved means youll get a better deal (i guess??) basically, do i need to go to all these dealerships, find cars i like, say ""sorry i cant buy today"" and hope the car is still there and get both parent in laws to come in at the same time? and then facing the fact i just wasted both parents times, and we may not even buy that day because numbers are no good? or do we need to go to the bank first, get approved, and then i can waltz in there knowing what i can/cant do, and just bring FIL in, doing the business, bring in the bank loan check, and wash the hands?

2 . i read an extensive reddit report about salesmen tricks. this is what one person had said: **We are purchasing a $25,000 car. Let’s say we go in wanting to pay $22,000. The salesman comes out and says you can choose from a payment of $460 or $391. “Which one works better for you sir?” Do you see what he did there? He changed your $3000 price reduction to a payment and asked you a question directing you to pick from HIS two options. Many people lose here. They say they like one of the payments and lose OR they say they negotiate and say they want to be at $350 a month. The salesman takes your $350 request to his sales manager, they come back at $360 (They always come back higher). Great. Car is sold. Let’s do the math though. You wanted to be at $22,000. By accepting $360 you just paid $23,000 for that vehicle AND you have no idea what the interest rate is. The lesson here: Keep things simple and stick to the vehicle price first. When that is settled THEN work on payments.**

i am not very smart in this field. i dont understand this at all. how does accepting 360 make you pay MORE, when your payments are now higher than 350 (which is what you wanted), and you're paying the car off sooner? how does asking 460/391 change the 3k price reduction,and make the salesmen make out like a bandit? i know the out the door price is the important part. i want a 12000 dollar car. thats what im going to walk away with. but obviously if the payment is 300 instead of 150 i couldnt afford it(for example of course) so how does this all tie in? 


3 . how does this whole process work if im going thru craigslist? obviously dealers mark up. for 11-13k, i can get a very decent and nice vehicle on craigslist with next to no worries. a year or two newer, with 10-40k less miles. this is my preferred route, but im not sure if this is possible with a cosigner/involving a bank.


4 . i have horrible credit. its been a year and a half since i owned my very first secured credit card. i paid 300, ill get it back next month finally. ive risen my credit report (according to creditkarma) from the low 500's, to 650's across all three agencies. my main killers are a bankruptcy report that is going to be gone in another year or two (bad car accident, young, dumb, no insurance, i bailed out. i am reliable paying bills and managing money), and the age of my credit history. wellsfargo denied me for any loan, but i heard credit unions are the place to do it. i have a great union near me, BECU, so i may go in there and ask. i'd rather not get help from parent in laws, it would be easier.",finance,1475434582

personalfinance,Student loans are the death of us,"Help! We need advice or a million dollars. As most young adults we are facing the crippling reality of student loans. We also have a life and have a house-which comes along with standard bills of living. Without getting into the detail of utilities-I'm going to focus the discussion on student loans and some small other debt. We have two credit cards-one balance is $1,100 and the other has a balance of $2,200 (with a $30 charge a month). Our house payment is $557.00 a month. Student loans are the killer. I have a federal loan amount of $33,300 and a personal loan amount of $45,991 and a 7% interest rate . I basically have $9/day in interest. The fed loan is slated to be paid off in 7 years but the private loan has 17 years (grand total of $85,000-👎🏻) now, my husband also has student loans. He has another $45,000 with various interest rates.
 
Now we are both nurses. We make a fairly good wage for our area of living. However, we basically live paycheck to paycheck with 3 checks a month going to bills. We have some other bills. Our daughter is in daycare that costs $560/month. She goes everyday, all day and honestly she doesn't need to. We don't have cable. Just internet and our cellphones a $60/month (for both). We don't splurge on anything and have the occasional restaurant date. 

What are we doing wrong and what can we do to make this better? I know making extra payments on principle balances would be ideal but we just don't seem to have the extra money to do it.

personalfinance,How to apply for a loan when it is to pay off family members?,"Hey PF, my brother was in a bad spot just over a year ago and needed to borrow some cash to keep up with payments. Since then he is a lot more safe from lay offs but would like to pay off the family that lent him the money. He would like to do this as quick as possible as it has been an interest free loan for the last year and a bit.

I know you guys love numbers, however I do not know all the details. It is about $11,000 (this is in Canada by the way if it matters) owed to 3 different people. And I am guessing he has about $1000 extra every month. (Probably close to $1300 extra if he really budgets)

I am willing to go to the bank with him and help him through the process of applying for a loan, but I am unsure of how to request it. Do we have to make up an excuse for why he might want a loan for around $10,000 or is that a decent enough reason for wanting a loan - to consolidate all the loans into one and just have to pay interest to the bank? 

And then should we try to get him a loan by himself with no co-signers (I am one of the family members he owes money to and I would prefer not co-sign unless really necessary). He also has a new truck being financed that is almost half paid off now, so I am not entirely sure how a line of credit works, if that is an option. He even said hes willing to pay a slightly higher interest rate if that means he gets to do this on his own.

20 year old student here, 

I've been accumulating debt with my landlord for about 2 1/2 months now ($650 per month), which totals a whopping $1,950.  I haven't been able to pay rent due to the lack of hours my job has given me as of late and it being minimum wage (which averages around $300 every two weeks) I've been constantly submitting applications and going to interviews but no avail.  I was turned down for a promotion twice even though my performance reviews have been solid.  When I first started out I had my father's help with rent because I was going to school, but my father hasn't helped me with rent for over 7 months now.    The only way I was able to pay rent for the first few months by myself was with the money I had saved up for college during my high-school years and some of my federal student financial aid.   All I have in my account right now is $42 until my next paycheck that'll be around $250.  I'll be staying at a friend's house for a bit but I don't want to overstay my welcome.

personalfinance,Extremely Small / Unnoticed Student Loan Harming Credit,"Long story short, among my student loans there was a singular Perkins loan for $350 taken out my freshman year of college.

I have been aggressively been paying down my remaining 30k in student loans and was looking to refinance due to the high interest rate on these loans. I was immediately declined due to what SoFi stated was a seriously delinquent account.

""Hmm...thats funny"", I thought. Neither Transunion (offered through Capital One), nor Equifax (through Credit Karma), had any accounts in delinquency.

Paying for a $1 trial on Experian I then discovered that this $350 loan has been delinquent for nearly 3 years and I had no prior knowledge of.

Even though all other student loans appear through my ACS account, this one did not.

Apart from obviously paying off the loan in full which I have done, are there any ""best practices"" in working with my college (who is listed as the creditor) or ACS (I'm assuming they are simply the processing arm) to having this removed from my credit report?

I understand that at the end of the day it is my responsibility to know of all activity under my name and I will be requesting my full report moving forward and not relying on the ""free"" value-add reports for the complete picture.",finance,1475461760

personalfinance,Interest only mortgage?,"I was just talking about this the other day with a friend. Let's assume you are taking out a 30 year fixed mortgage at 3.92% (around the current rate for good credit scores i believe).

Let's say you decide to get an interest only loan, so your monthly payments are lower. And then you decide to take that extra money you save monthly and put that into index funds in the market. 

Now, you can probably assume, what, 7% returns per year averaged over 30 years? Come 30 years later, you liquidate that investment account and pay the 15% long-term capital gains tax. You should come out ahead in this scenario than simply getting a standard mortgage. I understand that it's riskier (maybe a huge crash happens in that 30th year or something), but just wondering if I'm missing something here, or why more people don't take this kind of loan for mortgages. Assume I had a lot of $$ and could afford to take on the risk of a crash like mentioned earlier, any reason I wouldn't use this approach?

EDIT: from doing some other research, the main reason you wouldn't do an interest-only mortgage is because:

1. The interest rate on those types of loans are generally significantly higher than a regular 30 year fixed.
2. There are a lot of cases when banks won't even provide interest-only loans (e.g. investment properties).",finance,1475478058
personalfinance,"Getting really overwhelmed/depressed with new understanding of money, need some help calming down.","Alright, trying to make this short. I found a job I really like unexpectedly three years ago and went from 20k/2014 to 48k/2015 now I am on track to make 70k this year, at least 65k. All the same company, but I am very passionate about this work particularly and it showed with three promotions within the company, now I am pretty much at a ceiling with 3% raise per year unless I get a degree (that is another story, for the sake of brevity let's say it's not happening soon.) With this new money I started to get interested in what I am doing with it and became much more financially literate, and in the process of reading more it is really starting to overwhelm me and I picture a bleak future with no end. 

I work a base of 45 hours a week, (paid hourly) and I have the option to work overtime in the same or different department within the company almost as much as I want, which I usually do, I usually fall between 50-70 hours a week because frankly the overtime pay is great. Overtime is less frequent when my SO feels needy or when homework or studying gets heavy. 

I bought a house and picked up a wife this year (technically will be this year, getting married in a month to my girlfriend of two years but we are just going down to the courthouse, she just wants to be married she doesn't want a big wedding, just a nicer honeymoon.) She works and makes 30-35k a year, we have no kids. Now for financials, this is what is worrying me because I try to budget but I don't see myself out of the woods any time soon and I desperately want out of debt. I just threw most my savings at three credit cards to pay them down to zero (3,500 total, now gone) but I have no more lump sums to throw at the rest of the debt. 

* Student loans: 15,000, varying interest rates.
* Car 1: 26,700 3% interest 485/mo
* Car 2: 11,300 7% interest 230/mo
* Credit card 1: 1,700 0% APR for another year 67/mo minimum.
* Credit card 2: 1,500 0% APR for another year 105/mo minimum.
* Credit Card 3: 5,300 (21% APR, I know, it's bad. The other three cards I just paid were around the same) 100/mo minimum.
* Credit Card 4: 3,000 0% APR for another 18 months. 35/mo minimum.
* House, 205,000 4.5% 1,350/mo minimum.
* Credit cards 5, 6, and 7 at zero dollars as of last month.

Other bills:

* Cell phones ~175/mo
* Insurance ~210/mo
* Power ~130/mo
* gas ~20/mo
* Water/sewage/garbage/stuff ~50/mo
* Netflix ~12/mo? this comes out of my SO's account.
* Apple music ~16/mo with tax.
* Internet ~55/mo
* School tuition ~400/mo for 3 more months, paying out of pocket now but am reimbursed by employer if all classes passed which I already tanked one from working too much OT so I'll probably eat this semesters tuition. 
* Money for groceries varies wildly because we are going back and forth from trying to cook at home every day to giving up for a week and eating out a shit load. It's bad and I am trying to work on it but I am just so tired from work and school I can't even think about cooking and I love her but she is hopeless when it comes to cooking anything. 

* She brings in 2,200/mo after taxes very steadily, she only works a straight 40 a week no overtime in her job.
* I bring in ~3000/mo minimum after taxes, I think, never had a check without overtime at my new pay so I'm not sure. It can be up to 5,000/mo If I work enough OT. 

All this debt makes me and her skip taking up my employers 401k match (They match 3% if we contribute 6%) because I want to funnel all future pay into debt. We have 1,500 in savings. I feel buried and I feel like I will never pay off everything and contribute enough to retire in time because I only started saving this year. I am 27 and she is 21.

Thank you for writing to me and I am sorry for not replying sooner: I’m afraid your email slipped out of my normal system for replying to correspondence.  However, please be assured that I did read your email when it came in.

 I am intrigued by the idea of new currencies – including supporting the Brighton Pound – and have been interested to see how Bitcoin has developed and grown over the last five years. I think that the financial system as it currently operates is not working in the interests of the majority and, for this reason, I believe in widespread economic reform. I work closely with the New Economics Foundation (NEF), for example, who have done a lot of good work on alternatives to the way the economy currently operates, to create a fairer and more prosperous system for the many, not just the few. They have written a number of articles on Bitcoin and emerging currencies here,here and here.

 I am worried that we are on course for another economic crash and that we have not yet learned the lessons from the last one, including what caused it. It's critical that we take every possible step to put our economy onto a sustainable footing - and for me that means asking questions about the purpose of the economy, banks and monetary policy – and how new currencies like Bitcoin might support that. I’m not yet sure what role new currencies will play, and I do have some privacy concerns over the digitalisation of money more broadly – there’s a fascinating article on that issue by the economist Brett Scott here – but will be sure to keep abreast of developments over the coming months and years.

 Thanks again for your email, and if you require any further information on my work here in Parliament, please do not hesitate to be in touch.

personalfinance,Need to move out soon. Likely to require a career change. Would appreciate some discussion on my options.,"Hello, so recently I had a financial discussion with my parents, and I learned that I will need to move out by the end of December. We live in a high COL area in Cali, and my dad was laid off and is nearing retirement age, so he and my mom are planning to move somewhere that's easier on their finances. Fortunately, they've told me early, and I have a couple months to think about what I want to do. I have some ideas, but I wanted to get some of your thoughts on my best path forward.

Some details about my situation: I graduated a year and a half ago with a social science degree, and began my first full time job earlier this year, a data analytics/data entry role for ~29k a year (pre-tax). My work background is in marketing and communications, but I am still unsure as to what long term career path I will pursue in the future. I am fortunate enough to not have much in the way of debt, around ~9000 total in two student loans with ~3.5% and ~4.5% interest rates. I own a fully paid off, cheap car. I have a couple thousand in savings, and will have more by December.

Here are the options I am considering: 

First, find a cheap place to rent and stick it out at my current job until the one year mark, then look for better opportunities. This path is probably the most sensible, but the least appealing to me. I like my job, but there's not much room for advancement or raises. Rent in the area is expensive, usually starting around ~800 for a single room in a shared space, leaving me very little to work with, let alone save when I factor in phone, gas, groceries, utilities, and other costs. I have nothing keeping me here, as most of my old friends have moved on, and I went to college out of state. I'm considering this option because the conventional wisdom is to stay at every job for at least a year. I do like working here, I just don't want to deal with the stress of having to live on such a tight budget and I feel like I have more to offer.

The second option I'm considering is to start applying for other jobs elsewhere. It would be great if I could get a higher paying job in a lower COL area. My area is known for having high COL and comparatively low pay, especially for those just starting their careers. No concrete plans or preference for any place (although I heard Colorado was a good place to go). However, it took me a while to secure the job I have now, and I don't know how easy it will be to get a new one. Will it be easier now that I have some experience to back up my degree? Also, can I cite the high COL of my current area if potential employers ask why I am moving on so soon?

I am also thinking about going overseas to teach English. While I wouldn't plan on staying in education long term, I do enjoy working with kids, have some teaching experience, and I think it would be nice to be able to build some savings working this way for a year or two, living cheaply and putting my career on pause, thinking about what I want to do next. Plus, it would be nice to see the world while I'm still young.

If you have any thoughts, please share them with me. This will be one of the biggest changes of my life, and I'm honestly feeling a little overwhelmed. Thanks for your time, and please let me know if you need any more information.",finance,1475494121

personalfinance,Need help dropping my student loan - looking for cash management / side hustle suggestions,"Hello, I don't know if this is the right forum for this, but here we go.

My backstory: I'm a federal employee (US), with about 21,000 remaining (on an original loan amount of 33,000) of 2.5%, 20-year student loan debt I took out in 2007 / 2008. I was unemployed for a year until I found my current job, and during that time interest continued to pile up. Right now I'm paying 100 extra, for a total of 250 / month.
I know about the federal loan forgiveness program for persons who are now federal employees, but I'm not eligible (loan is private, not consolidated under a public / federal loan program, etc.).

So I'm coming here in the hopes that you all have some ideas on how I could make more money / develop side hustles / better utilize the money I have.

- I've got about 80k in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP, the Fed equivalent of a 401k), traditional (non-Roth) contributions. I thought about borrowing against it to repay the loan, but know I'd be screwing myself out of future earnings on it, so probably won't.

- We recently refinanced our home loan at 3.75%, which saves us about 250 / month (got rid of mortgage insurance).

- I've got a car loan at 1.875%, and I estimate I've got 15 months left to pay on it. At that time, it'll free up an additional 290 / month. I want to put that toward the loan, but my wife says we should be putting money aside for when my junker (the car that's paid off) finally dies.

- My credit score is 800+.

- I could cut down what I spend on a daily basis, but am pretty comfortable with it. I don't mind working in my off-hours to make some extra cash. Marketable skills: I'm a licensed architect in my state, and know drafting and modeling software. I know graphics software (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign). I've tried to leverage these things in the past, but guess I'm not looking down the right alleys.

This is a pretty high-level view of my financial situation. Right now I think my best option is consistently working overtime, then dumping that money straight into the loan. I feel like, if I was more clever, I'd be able to find some side jobs with my graphics skills -- but damn if Craigslist isn't full of some weirdos.

Again, would appreciate any help you can offer. Thanks for reading along.

personalfinance,"23 y/o medical student in debt, personal finance issues, planning for financial independence. Advice?","BACKGROUND: 

New to reddit, I'm a 2nd year medical student, attend an OOS school so each year I'll be taking on 80k in debt x 4 = $320k with interest rates posted below (2016-17, 2015-16) respectively.

Direct Unsubsidized Loans (Graduate)	5.31%	5.84%
Direct PLUS Loans (Graduate and Parents)	6.31%	6.84%

CURRENT FINANCIAL ISSUES:
With the current budget I've set aside using the loans, I can spend $1600 a month. My dad pays for my car, car insurance &amp; phone bill and provides me a credit card to use for groceries if I need to. I pay for my rent/utilities/gas/groceries/credit card bill/other expenses using loans. We're given ~19k each year for living expenses with an additional 1.3k to cover books/exam (STEP 1 being $600).

Due to some unforeseen circumstances, I need some extra money to move out/break lease. Would ideally like to have an extra source of income or at least earn an extra $5k-10k+ over the year. I feel bad asking my parents for money because they shouldn't have to support me anymore &amp; are struggling to support themselves/my younger siblings through college.

So I’m thinking of picking up a side job -- people say this isn’t a good idea but I look at my current study habits/schedule and I have large blocks of the day/week where I’m unproductive (not studying, not working). In college, I had a routine of work/study which worked out better because I was so busy that I didn’t have time to waste.

Is picking up a side part time flexible job a decent idea? What options do I have as a medical student? Ideas based off my past in college: I could tutor/personal trainer/donate plasma/try to find paid research?


LONG TERM DEBT MANAGEMENT QUESTION:
I came to medical school straight from college and throughout college worked 20-30 hours a week on weekdays/weekends doing odd jobs (some allowed me to study at work while others I was selling things/doing research/etc). Graduated college debt fee due to full scholarship &amp; me paying for my housing through the jobs I kept up. I’m looking at this enormous debt piling up from medical school and I’m scared about future financial independence/worried about finances although I don’t know if I should be stressing about this debt right now. 

Reading Rich Dad Poor Dad, 4 hour work week, Mr. Money Mustache blog, &amp; 10 year retirement books (extreme 20 spending/80 savings, although a great idea, hard to execute), I feel so behind in comparison to my peers not in medical school (delayed gratification). 

I’ve ruled out HPSP/National Guard/NHSC scholarships and my plan if I perform well on STEP1 is to specialize in a field that pays well/interests me as well. Then I plan to reconsolidate my loans after medical school &amp; use the 10-year loan forgiveness program if that’s still around. Also will look at jobs that help with loan burden.

personalfinance,30 year old. Any alternative or bankruptcy my only hope?,"Brief backstory-
Moved across the US about 8 years ago for a fresh start and got into a fair amount of trouble. My big dreams dependent on credit cards turned into a financial mistake.
Reaching out to fellow Redditors for opinions and suggestions.  

I will try and give as much information as possible.
My current credit score is the low 500s, so it’s already pretty trashed. 
Total debt is around 25k, with 13k being federal school loans (understand these don’t go away no matter what).  $8500 in old credit card (most written off in 2012), the rest is medical or unpaid tolls. 
one judgment against me for $2500  
Blocked car registration due to $1000 of past due road tolls.
 
I make 24k-26k a year, live with 1 roommate and my so.
Drive a 25 year old honda. 
Rent is $500 (my portion), in an already pretty bad area.
Cook almost every meal at home.
Keep the bills as low as possible.  
Feel like I have cut every corner possible and still make just enough to live.

I'm pretty sure the advice is to suck it up and get another job, but the plot thickens because my so has a pretty debilitating mental illness which requires a fair amount of time and attention the moment I get home every single day. 

Is it worth it or does anyone see an escape?

personalfinance,I worked as a stripper for a few months to help pay for college. I put all the money towards my tuition/bills and now I'm worried I won't be able to afford my taxes,"Hi all,

So this is mostly a tax question I guess. I earned about 15k as a stripper earlier this year. I deposited about 4500 into the bank, used about 6000 to buy a car (cash), and the rest was spent as cash on things like rent, groceries, etc. I quit that place, went to a new club, and only worked there for like a week and half. I live in a state where strippers are considered employees, so I did submit my SSN and I-9 documentation to both places. However, they both routinely employ girls under the table. At both places I left less than 2 weeks after submitting my documentation and never received a paycheck from either, so I don't know if my paperwork was ever processed. I'm not working in that field anymore.

This year I was also fortunate to get a research stipend (about 5800), and private scholarships (7000). Finally, I recently picked up a minimum wage gig. 

I have no idea what to do for my tax situation. I pretty much threw  everything at my tuition bill, probably too much since I am now struggling to cover my living costs. It didn't cover my tuition completely and I still took out some federal loans. I don't know if I have to report the stipend, or the scholarship money, and I'm not sure if I should report the money from my strip job or just not file and hope for the best. Additionally, if I do end up with a big tax bill, I don't know how I could afford to pay it. Any advice would be appreciated!",finance,1475526706

personalfinance,Is this CA committing fraud? I don't know what to do...,"Not sure where to start, but here goes:

I was contacted by a CA about a debt I don't think that I owe.  I asked for a letter of validation (twice) and they said that I'm using ""stall tactics"".  The only document they have given me is a settlement offer $300 on an $800+ payday loan from 5/3 bank (the debtor listed on the settlement is another CA).  I figured I would just wait and see what happened and blocked their number. That's when things started getting interesting.

I received a call from the local court house and the clerk told me that they were sending a process server to home; she wanted to know what was a good time to come.  I thought this was fishy; as far as I know, the point of a process server is to serve you papers without giving you the opportunity to avoid them.  Anyhow, we get to talking and I explain my situation.  She asks me if I'm going to dispute the debt- I say absolutely.  She says she's going to call the CA and get back to me the next day.  In the meantime, I stop by 5/3 to double check I don't owe them any money- the teller says there is no record of a payday loan.  There hasn't been anything on my credit report.  I know nothing about this.

The next day I don't hear anything back from the clerk, so I call her back.  The clerk I spoke to said there was no way they would give me prior warning about being served and that nobody by that name works there.

I believe these people spoofed the court house phone number to call me.  They also threatened to take me to court without the intention of doing so, in violation of the FDCPA.

What do I do now?  I know I can get a statutory judgement if I sue them, but at this point I believe this to be a criminal matter (faking a phone number to get me to pay.)  I'm unsure of what court to file papers with.

I live in Michigan, and the CA is not licensed in my state.  They are out of NY.  I have filed a complaint with the FTC, but that was before the ""clerk"" called me.

personalfinance,My dad's parent PLUS student loans are in default. How can I help him?,"The parent plus loan was for my school.  My dad had no idea that it was his responsibility to pay the loan, he thought he was more of a cosigner, a loan that I would repay once graduating.  And I dropped the ball too, because I thought that my federal direct consolidation loan included the two parent plus loans. 

I do want to repay this loan for him but I'm not sure the best way to go about this. The 2 loans total roughly 21k. And they are both in default. I helped him log on and now there is roughly 3000 past due, too much for either of us to currently afford; I am in the process of saving for a house and he is retired.  

So what is the best thing for us to do? Should I use his account on the loan granter's website to pay from my money and slowly chip away at the 3000?  The monthly payment is already $250 a month if we are paying on time, and I couldn't pay too much more than that per month, so it could be years before the $3000 is paid.  

So I'm wondering if I should request a new consolidation loan which would consolidate my existing consolidation loan with my dad's parent plus loan? It is way past the initial 180 days where I could add a loan to my existing consolidation loan, so if I understand correctly I will have to apply for a new consolidation loan. Will doing that significantly hurt my credit score and make it hard for me to get a house?  (currently 680 credit score due to low credit age and high number of hard checks)

Would it be a good idea to make the minimum monthly payment on the loan creditor's website until I have a house, at which time I will consolidate?  

If I do consolidate, will the loan leave default status and what will become of the $3000 past due?

-Max out 403(b), I have a good match program. (done)

I've been scouring the PF subreddit, reading up on similar situations, and trying to figure out what would be best to do.  Here is my situation:

I'm 28, an artist/freelancer/teacher making an income of about 50k/year in NYC... Cost of living is obviously high, and in my career I am not likely to have a huge income bump in the near future.  I have 100k in federal student loans from Bachelors, Masters, and post-graduate degrees, with interest rates between 5-6.8%.  Currently I'm on the income-based repayment plan, which means that my monthly payments are manageable, but the loans are just getting bigger..  

I received a large (to me, massive) inheritance of 120k unexpectedly last year, and it's been sitting in a high-yield savings (1.05%) since then.  My question is basically this: should I just bite the bullet and pay the entire loan amount off now?  Or would it be smarter to pay part of it off to bring the monthly payments down to a feasible amount, and then invest the rest into savings/retirement planning?  I am really trying to be smart and rational. I'm already frugal, and wouldn't spend it anyways... but I don't anticipate having another chance to have this kind of money to work with in the foreseeable future.

Any advice would be much appreciated.  Thank you!

EDIT: Throwaway account for privacy  

EDIT2: It seems the consensus is to pay the loan in full.. pretty much the answer I was dreading, but knew was probably true.  I realize hoping for investments to beat the 5-6.8% the loans are accruing would be risky at best, but still it helps to hear other people's opinions (and for obvious reasons, I'm not talking about this to friends/family)",finance,1475546186

personalfinance,Is requesting multiple smaller personal loans a good way to transfer $50k in credit card debt?,"Short version: 
I would like to transfer about $50k in credit card debt to personal loans. My wife and I have $145k annual income and $116k in debt. (student loans, car loan, personal loans and credit card) We each have ~715 credit scores but understandably individual lenders aren't enthusiastic about making an unsecured loan in such a large amount. 

My thought was to apply for multiple loans in smaller amounts, say $5k per lender. My understanding is that multiple hard credit checks only count as one check if they're within a week of each other.

- Would this work? 
- What are the reasons I wouldn't do this, or issues we might run into?

---
Long version:
- My wife and I both work with a combined pre-tax income around $145k
- For the last year both our credit scores have fluctuated around 715.
- She has around $18k in student loans.
- We jointly have a $12k car loan.
- We each individually have a lending tree loan around $19k.
- Combined we have about $48k in credit card debt.
- We have never been late in any of our payments.
- We rent.

I'm deeply embarrassed by our financial situation. I've come to understand (much too slowly) our relationship dynamics aren't suited to using credit cards, and closed them all except for two. Those two are maxed out and I will close them before doing any final transfer. As far as credit report goes my understanding is they're not reported fully closed until they're paid off.

A while back we actually paid off most of the credit cards with his and hers lending tree loans. I thought we would keep the cards open since I had read that closing them would harm our credit score. Instead we ended up running up all the cards again.

We can afford the payments although without as much breathing room as we'd like, and paying a lot of interest. What I'd like to do is pay the same amount or less, but with a defined end date when it will be paid off, and with a higher ratio of principal to interest.

We had tried applying for a $25k loan six months ago in my wife's name. Lending tree declined while discover offered a loan in that amount but with a pretty high interest rate. High enough that we'd be doing just as well to keep paying the credit cards frozen at their current minimum rate.",finance,1475549809

personalfinance,Help! Bank Emptied by Department of Revenue,"Yeah, so the Alabama Department of Revenue garnished my bank account today.  They drained $1600 from it, and ~$1000 of that was already set aside for bills.  I'm sitting at $0 in my checking, and don't know what to do.

I have a way of getting the funds necessary to cover my rent and bills, but the bigger problem is the reason they took the money in the first place.  I owe them ~$10,000 from 2012 income taxes, and the bank confirmed that the total garnishment is the full $10,000.  On top of that, I owe the IRS around $35,000, and have $5,000 in delinquent credit card debt.

I know this all seems extreme, but my finances were awesome for a lot of my adult life.  I started a business when I was in 2008, at 21 years old, and it quickly took off.  I was engaged, had a baby, and was making enough money to pay for my fiancee's school, as well as my own, with enough left to cover all of our living expenses.  Then everything fell apart.

In 2012, my business died.  It was performing very well, but regulatory changes nullified the business model overnight.  Unfortunately, I had also split with my son's mother shortly before this, and was going through a custody battle.  Between the money she squeezed out of me, tuition, paying lawyers, etc., I ended up with very little left, but I did get full custody of my son.  However, I still owed taxes for that year.

I just didn't have the cash to pay the taxes, or to clear out my credit card, so both ended up getting pushed aside.  That was in 2013 (I made the money in 2012, but all the other things were drug out through 2013).

Anyway, so now it is 2013, and I owe $50,000 but have no income.  I started trying to find something new to get off the ground, but couldn't come up with anything that I could get started quickly enough, or with a small amount of money.  I ended up working for a friend's startup, which paid decently, but not enough for me to do much more than cover my bills and make sure that my son was fed, clean, and happy.

Sadly, that went sideways, and I ended up on another business venture.  That one had potential, but I just couldn't get enough traction, and without the income from the other job I ended up having to sell it for way less than I feel like it was worth.

By that time, it was 2015.  I decided to get my A+ certification, and started looking for a stable IT job.  I found that toward the end of the year, and I've been making decent money since then.  I'm still basically living paycheck to paycheck, but things have been getting better.  I've been cleaning up little debts and learning to budget my money a bit better.  One of my near term goals was to try to negotiate payments on my back taxes, but the State of Alabama decided to make the first move.

Now they have frozen all of my money, and I don't know what to do.  It seems that since the taxes are from more than 3 years ago that I could file Chapter 7 bankruptcy to wipe it out, but that is scary as hell.  What should I do?  Am I completely fucked?

It was a surprise, definitely not planned at all but we are excited nonetheless. We sat down today and realized (Albeit not shockingly to me) that we are absolutely horrendous with money/spending habits.

We both work pretty crappy, non-salary jobs. Nothing with long term benefits. I (haven't checked in a long time) believe that my credit is either next to none, or garbage. His credit is decent (Around 720 the last I heard). Our two biggest problems are his debt (Nothing crazy, thank god) and our spending habits.

We have nothing in savings. Absolutely nothing. I know this needs to drastically change and I've already forwarded him the ""How to handle $"" page you guys have. We cover our bills every month. Most, if not all, of these bills are his. But after paying, we survive on my measly paycheck for two weeks. Which, would be okay, if it weren't for our spending habits. The biggest offender is eating out.

I'm not 100% on interest rates, but a lot of his bills are cards that he took out from stores. The two biggest ones are Guitar Center (He's a musician) and Sears (He got this to handle emergency car repairs). He already told me that the Sears card will be discontinued after we pay it off. I think I would have to pull some nails to get him to drop the guitar center one. Other bills include car insurance, a car loan, and rent. I'd say, all in all, his debt is less than 5k. 

Some realistic goals the two of us have is that we both need to get our GEDs. It was stupid of us to drop out, though mine's was for medical reasons. This would cost us a measly $240. Another is that I need a driver's license. I currently rely on him 100% to get me to and from work. Currently, this situation is working out for us. After the license, we had hopes for getting another car loan so I could get a vehicle. I'm afraid my terrible credit will cause the interest to go through the roof on it.

So, the biggest thing question I have is; How do I make a budget when our income fluctuates? Like today, I got home from a four hour shift. But tomorrow, I'll have an eight hour shift.

science,Science AMA Series: We are 3 scientists who are collaborating on an open science project to find treatments for Zika. Ask Us Anything!,"Hi reddit!

The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has caused global concern. To help advance the fight against this debilitating virus, we launched OpenZika. OpenZika is a project running on World Community Grid, an IBM philanthropic initiative which provides scientists with free, massive computing resources, donated by volunteers worldwide. Specifically, we’re enlisting the help of World Community Grid volunteers to run docking experiments against crystal structures and homology models of Zika proteins (and other related flavivirus targets that are structurally similar) on their computers and Android devices. We are harnessing World Community Grid’s massive computational power to search through thousands of current drugs (to see if they can be re-purposed against Zika) and millions of drug-like compounds (to lay the foundation for subsequent drug development against Zika). 
After we have selected and our collaborators have tested compounds that could be effective in killing the Zika virus, we will publish our data and results and share them with the public. As soon as we have proven that some of the candidate compounds can actually either (a) prevent the replication of the Zika virus in cell-based tests or (b) prevent the virus from infecting cells, we and other labs can then modify and evolve these molecules to increase their potency against the virus, improve their other properties (such as solubility, permeability, and metabolic stability), and reduce their toxic side effects, to advance and accelerate the discovery and development of new antiviral drugs against the Zika virus.

&amp;nbsp;

I purchased a TV 4 years ago for $1999.99 on a card through HH Greg on a promo. The promo expired after 2 years. Somewhere during that time we had also purchased two iPads for our parents on the card. Long story short, promo expired and we have been paying every month for 4 years Min payments on 29.99% APR through auto debit. After finally getting access to my statements it looks like I have been paying on average $75.00 per month of which $50.00 has been interest. I paid $683.00 in interest in 2016 alone. Although we have never missed a single payment, we are getting nowhere on the principle. 
Currently so far this year I have paid $477.47 in interest. My current balance is $2,004.88 and my Min payment for this month is $71.00 of which it looks like $50.11 according to my statement will be the amount of interest owed. The max for the card is $2000.00

&amp;nbsp;

**Financial Overview:* 

&amp;nbsp;

We struggled with income through school and made a lot of bad financial choices for a good portion of our twenties which wrecked our credit and delayed our savings. This year we finally landed great careers and so far we both bring in about 8-9k a month. I am on pace to make $85k this year and my fiancé just started her career here and has made about 15k in the 3 months she has been employed. (We work for the same company in sales and both make 32K Base +VC). 

We currently have 3k in savings; the goal is 10K which is achievable by March 2017 according to our Mint Account. 
Checking account currently sits at $1994.41 and we have paid our most expensive bills already.  Our next commission checks will be $3.1k and 5.2k between the two of us. Our 401k is currently being maxed at the 5%; however, we just started this summer and only have a balance of 2.5k so far. 
We have no other investments. 

&amp;nbsp;

**High level Debt overview:**

&amp;nbsp;

**5 year Lease:** $1275/mo currently, then $25 per month every year, until the end of the agreement. (1300 yr2, 1325 yr3, etc)

**Car:** $344/mo 13.8% APR. This is the last 12 months we owe and have to pay the final $4800 by September 2017. 
We missed one payment 3 years ago and have been behind a payment every month since, and currently have 
$1008 in late fees and overage charges. 

**Car:** Through a family member, $150/mo until the 4k is paid off. 

**Cell Phones and tablets:** $260/mo

**Gas &amp; Electric:** $205

**Water:** Less than $100 usually

**Synchrony Bank:** 2004.88 balance, Min Payment Avg $75/mo

**Daycare:** 88/wk

**Gym:** $50/mo for both of us

**Internet:** $99.00/mo

**Student Loans:** 60K, currently in deferment with $20/mo payments, will balloon to $200+ in 11 months.

**Random other things:** Dental Care, Musical Instrument rental for the kid, etc. (Totals $508.92/mo)

That covers our on paper bills that I can think of, I may have missed something though. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Question:**

&amp;nbsp;

My credit is currently 625. I have collections well over 7 years old that have newly reported, I know this is against the law, however not sure what to do about it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I was told the biggest thing affecting my credit however, is having this Synchrony card maxed out. I asked for a credit increase already and promised to pay whatever amount they increased it by, to give me more credit room to make my ratios better, they declined, I threatened to transfer the balance unless they give me a lower interest rate, and they also declined. I tried to transfer the balance to my credit union through a new card, but they said I can’t yet, because my ratios are too high. 

I fear that if I pay a lump sum, of $500 or $750 they will simply cut the max limit to meet the new balance. Should I transfer the balance to some other type of card? Do I just pay it off and be done with it? 

&amp;nbsp;

I could really use some help. We finally have the means to be proper adults and would like to enjoy some of the things that come with having better credit; however, our past seems to haunt us. We would like to purchase a new car next year with a warranty, since we have been plagued with 4 years of car repairs literally over 6k, new engines, etc etc.

politics,Topic Tuesday: Federal Funding of Planned Parenthood,"^(*Welcome to Topic Tuesday on /r/Politics! Each week we'll select a point of political discussion and pose it to the community to discuss and debate. Posts will include basic information on the issue at hand, opinions from leading politicians, and links to more data so that readers can decide for themselves where they stand.*)

#General Information

Planned Parenthood is a US-based nonprofit organization that provides women's health services, specializing in reproductive health. Within the US they are the largest provider of reproductive services, including abortion.

Initially founded in 1916, the organization began to receive federal funding when President Nixon enacted the Public Health Service Act in 1970. The Title X Family Planning Program, part of this act, was designed to help low-income families, uninsured families, and people without medicaid obtain reproductive health services and preventive care. It's from Title X that Planned Parenthood receives its funding. Yearly congressional appropriations provide this funding via taxes, and the organization receives roughly $500 million dollars per year from this method.

Though Planned Parenthood takes federal funding, it is not allowed to use this funding to finance abortions. Title X includes specific language prohibiting funding stemming from it to terminate pregnancies. Another factor is the Hyde Amendment, a common rider provision in many pieces of legislation preventing Medicare from funding abortion - except, in some cases, when the mother's life is in danger.

Due to the controversy surrounding abortions, many people object to taxpayer money being granted to any organization whatsoever that provides abortions. Many pro-life advocates have stated their desire to have PP's funding revoked unless they cease abortion services, others have called for the institution to be defunded entirely.

Last year, a new call to repeal PP's funding arose when the Center for Medical Progress, a pro-life nonprofit, released videos claiming to show Planned Parenthood executives discussing sales of aborted fetuses with actors posing as buyers. These videos sparked a national inquiry, eventually leading to the head of PP appearing ahead of a congressional committee to testify. The PP head, as well as many pro-choice advocates, have called on the videos as edited and deceitful. Regardless of the truth behind these claims, the idea of a taxpayer-funded institution carrying out illegal and/or immoral operations has struck a chord with many Americans. That's what we'll be discussing today.



#Leading Opinions

**Hillary Clinton** has made Planned Parenthood a major part of her campaign platform, and wishes to increase the taxpayer funding allocated to the organization. She's also stated a desire to repeal the Hyde Amendment, allowing Planned Parenthood to perform abortions funded by tax money. Of note is that her VP pick Tim Kaine has expressed his own support for the Hyde Amendment, in contrast with Clinton's position.

**Donald Trump** has praised the organization's general health services, but does not support its abortion services. “I am pro-life, I am totally against abortion having to do with Planned Parenthood, but millions and millions of women, [with] cervical cancer, breast cancer, are helped by Planned Parenthood,” he said. He's discussed the idea of shutting down the government in order to defund the organization, though later softened on that concept stating “I would look at the good aspects of it, and I would also look because I’m sure they do some things properly and good for women. I would look at that, and I would look at other aspects also, but we have to take care of women...The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should absolutely not be funded.”

**Gary Johnson** supports an overall cut to federal spending as part of his Libertarian platform - however, he's also made his belief clear that abortion is a personal decision that shouldn't be infringed on by the state, and that Planned Parenthood should not have its funding cut disproportionally compared to other programs.

**Jill Stein** believes that women's health and reproductive services should be human rights, and that the US should aid Planned Parenthood however possible. She believes that abortion is a personal choice, and should receive funding.

#Today's Question

Do you believe that Planned Parenthood should continue to receive federal funding? Should it stay the same, be expanded, be reduced, or cut completely? Should their funding depend on the institution not performing abortion services, should it depend on how those services are performed, or should funding or lack thereof occur regardless of abortion status?

personalfinance,Reining in my Credit,"Hello.  I've done some reading of the sidebars and I understand that its generally risky to close out a credit card entirely, but I thought I should ask a second opinion based on my situation.

After a divorce and company closure, I was forced to take on a little more debt than I wanted to and fall back to the support of my parents (27 years old).

*I am currently making $20/hour in NYC, where taxes take a pretty big chunk of that.

*I am paying $500/month on auto expenses.

*I have a credit card with my bank at 17.74% APR(v).  Its nearly maxed out near its $6k limit.

*I have a citibank credit card at 28.24% (M)(V).  It was maxed out until this week, when I paid the full balance on it.

*In December 2015 my score was 326.  Yes.  That's awful.  This month I was up to 611.  Which is still not great. . . .

I burned most of my savings to pay off the citibank card with the intention of closing it, but I have been told that may hurt my credit.  I have no intention of using that card, as the bank credit card has a slightly less murderous interest rate.

I know I should have more in savings, but I've also been paying off several informal, personal loans that got me through my unemployed period.

Credit Factors (per Mint)

*I was at 95% credit usage.  Paying off the citibank brings me to 84%.

*My average age of credit is 5 years, 2 months.

*I have 7 open credit accounts, 4 closed.

*I have made three inquiries, one this month, the last 16 months ago.

*I have zero derogatory marks.

*I have 98% on-time payments (4 late out of 255)


I have started tracking my expenses and I am taking steps to reduce my spending.  

Questions:

1. Given the above factors, should I just leave the citibank card open with zero balance on it?

2. Are there any advantages to closing the card out aside from peace of mind and satisfaction?

3. I currently have *no* savings and minimum monthly expenses of ~$700.  Should I make minimum payments on the bank card and save everything I can or should I split what extra cash I make between credit and savings?",finance,1475597657

Just started my first big boy job and have been trying to absorb as much PF wisdom as possible.  Been going through all the guides and materials.  It's been great so far.  I went through the 401k fund selection guide but I feel like I'm still at a loss as to how to make my elections.  Short of just choosing the ones with the lowest expense ratios, I'm not sure what else to consider when making my elections.

*Relevant Info*: I am 30 years old.  My gross income is $180k.  My employer does not match my 401k contributes but I have no debt at the moment so I plan on maxing out both my 401k up to $18,000 and $5,500 into a traditional IRA to backdoor into a Roth IRA.  After getting these squared away, I plan on doing a little more research into other taxable accounts to increase my retirement savings.

Here are the funds available to me with their corresponding ticker symbol and ER:

* Vanguard Federal Money Market		(VMFXX)	0.11%
* Loomis Sayles Core Bond Fund Class N	(NERNX)	0.40%
* Vanguard Short Term Bond Index	 	(VBITX)	0.06%

As for today, to my understanding and knowledge, multiple reasons as to why gold tanked. Brexit fears, dollar getting stronger (when dollar gets stronger, gold naturally drops), as well as gold breaking its resistance today and a few other resistance broken today, multiple people speaking today regarding interest rate hikes, and tons and tons of economic data coming out this week.

personalfinance,NJ Family Care (Medicaid): does it really require you go 3 months w/o insurance?,"My wife and I continue to live right at the income border of ""eligible for a large tax break from a Marketplace insurance plan"" and ""eligible for Medicaid"". In NJ, Medicaid is called ""New Jersey Family Care"" (NJFC). If we are in fact eligible for Medicaid, we have to take it, according to Marketplace rules.

HOWEVER, one of the listed stipulations for being eligible for NJFC is **you have to be without health insurance for three months**:

&gt;&gt; Is it true that I must be without health insurance for 3 months before I can be eligible for NJ FamilyCare? 

&gt; Yes, this is true. However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as if you lost your insurance because your place of work went out of business or you were laid off. Depending on income, other exceptions may apply for families privately paying for health insurance or for COBRA benefits. We strongly urge you to call 1-800-701-0710 and speak with a Health Benefits Coordinator to find out if any exceptions apply to you.

Now, my question: **Is it really true that, in New Jersey, in order for me to transition from a bronze health insurance plan bought through The Marketplace (and receiving a large premium tax credit), my wife and I need to cancel our insurance and *go without* any health insurance for three full months?!?**

This seems like a major risk! If anything unfortunate happens during that time, we are left with no coverage at all!? Can there really be such a glaring hole in the two entities' (Federal and NJ) policies??

personalfinance,"Immigrant in-laws didnt know you had to pay taxes on real estate sales, and then things got really bad","Hi all, I am attempting to help my in laws with a big problem... in 2014 they sold a house in California... they sold it after the tenants reported them to the city for repairs, and other details lead me to believe they sold it for below market value, and they managed to complete the sale without paying state or federal taxes.

They took the proceeds of the sale and paid off the mortgage on their house in Nevada, as well as giving money to relatives for car loans and whatnot, because they have zero of it left.

Early 2015 the tax man comes calling. Somebody tells them to get a Bankruptsy attorney so they do that. Mind you they have zero debt besides the non-dischargable 15k due to the IRS and 10.5k due to the state of California from the sale of the house.

The bankruptsy is confirmed and they begin paying $500 a month to the trustee (their bankruptsy attorneys husband) and pay that amount for 7 months. All the while the IRS calls them every day saying they havent seen dime one. They call the firm and they tell them not to worry about it, and the 8th month of ""the plan"" they stop paying.

Now, these are good people, they genuinely didnt know they were going to owe taxes, and judging by the amount of the taxes on a large property in suburban southern california, they already have been screwed out of a lot of money. Obviously they are very leery but they keep following bad advice.

Of course the bankruptsy plan lists the $5k they owe the attorneys as the priority payee, but arent they supposed to placate the IRS if indeed there is a plan in place? They arent trying to get out of paying taxes, they were paying the IRS directly, but the interest rates were killing them. What should they do to unsnare this mess?

The charges started on 9-24 and continued through until I called them just now.

This is a Visa Card through the Michigan State University Federal Credit Union. I have had the card since college.

I have to call back tomorrow to speak with the Loss Prevention department. The woman asked me though if I had gotten a call from the Fraud Alert dept on 9-26. Checked my phone and I did. I have no recollection of that conversation and what, if any, charges I may have verified...The Card activity started locally (Chicago) and the charges were innocuous, like a Gas Station. So I may have thought they were legit charges. I had gotten married 2 days before, so my mind was still a bit of a blur.

Anyone have experience with possible erroneously authorized charges? Can Visa try to hold me responsible for any of these charges (or the subsequent charges) if I authorized them?",finance,1475628494
personalfinance,I need money to cover living expenses while finishing community college but apparently I can't get private student loans. What should I do?,"I'm 27 and in my 2nd year of community college. I'm transferring to the University of Illinois next fall. I live on my own, work part-time at school, and I'm receiving the max allowed Federal Loans of $9,000 for this school year. I got by last year on savings, but I need to take out an additional $7,000 to cover my remaining living expenses.

Here's the problem - because this is a community college and I need a loan to cover ""off-campus"" living expenses, I was told I'm ineligible for student loans from Sallie Mae. Is this true for all Student Loan providers?

If I try to take a personal loan, I assume I won't have the options (deferment/forbearance) I would have with a student loan. I would expect payments to start right away, and a brutal interest rate. I have a credit score of 650 and an income of $19K.

Thanks in advance. 

* No debt whatsoever
* Income/Spending: My base salary is $35k a year. I spend about 50% after tax and account contributions. At the beginning of the year I projected spending no more than $15k overall (incl. rent, gas, food, necessities, and discretionary spending) and I'm on track to meet that goal. 
* Savings: I have a Roth IRA and I contribute the max % matched by my employer to a simple IRA. There's 3k in Roth, soon to be $8.5k in both by year's end. Otherwise, I have 10k in a UTMA acct that I don't mess with, and 20k sitting in a savings acct with a fuckall interest rate (I earned a dollar so far this year). 
* Costs:  My car is a '97 with 70k miles. Drives fine for now but I may need replace ol' bessie within the next few years. My bigger concern is school and living while in school. The programs I'm considering are all out of state public schools, all have assistantships for grad students with either in-state or full tuition waivers, a living expenses stipend, or both. So the overall cost of attendance is highly variable. My parents are a safety net *ie they will not let me starve* but I am on my own. I had scholarships for undergrad so I have no experience with loans/FAFSA. 

Goals: Matriculation Fall 2017 so at my current income - spending rate I can conservatively add another 10k to my savings. I don't know exactly what I'll be paying for school, but it won't be 40k in one sitting. **Can I invest or save the money I have and earn so that it isn't in a stagnant acct but a portion is available in a year to start paying for school?** **What is an appropriate emergency fund to maintain when I know that next fall I'll have no income for 2-? years?** **With a long term goal for financial independence, should I be doing anything else to that end now?

ethereum,Success! I got Parity running on Fedora 24.,"I did not have to compile Parity: I was able to install the Debian/Ubuntu package on Fedora.  It was actually suprisingly easy (all terminal commands are in a **BOLD** font):

* Install apt to meet Parity dependencies:  **su -c 'dnf install apt'**
* Install Parity: **su -c 'bash &lt;(curl https://get.parity.io -Lk)'**
* Run parity: **parity -j**

The next step was to get Mist to use Parity instead of Geth.  To do this, I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sta-p5d1blQ&amp;feature=youtu.be

Though the video above is applicable to Windows, its instructions worked in Fedora 24 (my Mist wallet is no longer stuck at a particular block as it was all day today using Geth).  

What I got from the video:  start Parity in Geth mode by opening a terminal and issuing this command: **parity --geth**

After Parity starts running, open Mist.  Mist will automatically connect to Parity.  So now, I will start Parity every time using the command **parity --geth** instead of **parity -j**, and then start Mist.

I'm currently downloading blocks in Mist, and it is lightning fast.   Note: Mist will start downloading blocks from scratch after the switch to Parity.  I'm currently on block 470,000 of about 2.38 million, but the download is moving very fast.  It only took about 10 minutes or so to get to block 470,000.

personalfinance,"Less than 2k debt, very poor credit, wanting to own a home in two years time","As the title says, my wife and I (no kids and no plans on having them, both near 40) are looking to buy a home within the next two years and I'm wondering how feasible this is.

The stats:

I make 18/hr base rate at 40hr/wk, 4+ hours of OT each week at 1.5x.

The wife makes 10.10/hr at 40hr/wk.

We've both been employed by the same factory for 15 years.

Combined we have about $1800 in medical bills (collections)

I just got finished being garnished for a $1200 medical bill.

We are both right around 580 on our credit scores.

No credit cards nor loans.

Expenses:

Rent 625

Utilities 425

Car 225

Phones 100

Pharmacy 100

Cable 90

Entertainment 75

Food 500

Incidentals 150


So we've currently budgeted about 2300 per month to handle everything.

A few notes, we are buying my brother-in-law's car by picking up his payments, so we don't have an auto loan ourselves even though we are making payments.

Also, our rent was $425 when my mother-in-law was living with us and paying $200 in rent, and the gas bill, but has since moved out.

Incidentals includes necessities such as gasoline, pet food, etc.

The plan is to get the current debt paid down by January, though I really don't know how to even start that process. I was considering a debt consolidation firm, but in searching here yesterday, it seems I'd be better off going it alone.

We would like to purchase a home in the $50-90k range.

We know absolutely nothing about buying a home, loans, interest rates, mortgages.

We plan to save $250 per week after we get our debt cleared and after the holiday season, meaning in two years time we should have over 25k to cover the down payment, appliances, furniture, and money to cover unexpected circumstances.

What can I do now to start the process? How can I prepare us for what is sure to be a scary ride?

personalfinance,"$150k in student loans, €400k mortgage, and no retirement. Need a plan. (US/NL)","That title may sound grim, and perhaps it is, but my wife and I both have good jobs with some disposable income, so we really just need a plan.  We are Americans living in the Netherlands.  We bought an apartment here, because no money down was required and we wanted to build equity instead of throwing our money away on rent.  We mostly subsist on the money from my job alone, and her income goes to savings.  I pay the mortgage.

Student debt:  My wife currently has $153,000 in federal student debt, which is being paid back on an Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan.  Because we're out of the country and we pay taxes in the Netherlands, her income is considered $0 by the IRS, and her IBR currently requires $0 in monthly payments.  We file taxes separately.  Nevertheless, we have been making voluntary payments to her loans to try to keep the interest from going out of control and chip away at it.  This year we managed to make two payments of $10k and $14k.   Most of her loans are at about 7% to 8%.   In the year 2030, if she still has a balance, her remaining balance is supposed to be forgiven.

Retirement/Savings:   We really have no retirement plans, and this is where I worry. We're both in our 40s, so we need to invest ASAP.  We have about 30k in a savings account, which is our emergency fund and the account that we use for her loan payments.   I have $50,000 in a 401k in the US from an old job.  We pay into a Dutch pension too, but we don't plan to retire here.  I think it would only give us a tiny amount (like €800 a month when we're 65 years old), and I'm not even 100% sure if I'll ever be able to collect it if we move back to the US in a few years.  I was thinking we should open an IRA or something, but then again she has that massive amount of debt...

So what should we be doing with our extra income?  Pay as much as possible towards her student loans?  Or should we save for retirement, pay the minimal amount on the loans and let them grow gigantic, and just bank on them being forgiven in 2030?

We really need some advice and some financial coaching, but our situation is unique and I don't know who to go to.

(PS, if we ever move back to the US and worked, we could probably make significantly more money and could start putting into a 401k again, but we would also have to rent again because we probably couldn't qualify for a mortgage, and her loan payment requirements would increase once she got a new job, so I'm not sure how much we could actually save...)

I have about 50k EUR, half of it in Stocks, half of it in some suboptimal bank-account. It came from my grandmother who was kind enough to save it for me. I personally don't earn much, but get just by with what I earn.

I don't trust stocks, but it's mostly fonds and they did alright in recent years. I'd prefer to have something more save.

For the money I don't know how to save it best, interest rates are so bad currently.

I don't need the money right away, but it would be good if I could tap in to some of it at least in case of an emergency.

So what to do? Go to two banks and compare what they offer? Buy a chunk of gold?

I'm in the medical field and there isn't a lot of upward mobility outside of managing/supervising and that's not for me. I came across a new field that sparked my interest and the more I think about it the more I ""feel the calling"". I'm doing some looking into it now and I plan on going to the open house in a month so I will get more information then but I wanted to run numbers through to you guys. 

* Currently I make 50-60K depending on OT.
* Only monthly payment is $500.00 to my current student loans which are at 35K.
* Savings at 10K but I don't want to touch this at all.

And like I said, I love my career but I want something more challenging, rewarding etc.

So the new career.

* Salary 80-140K. Even if I make the lower end that is significant increase for me, but I'm sure I will make a little above 80K. 

This is great and all but here are my concerns.

* Paying for it. I don't mind taking out more loans, but I'll likely have to use private loans. Which is fine even though it will be at a higher interest rate.
* Cost of tuition from what I  gathered will be 8K per semester. If this is the case I'm looking at approximately 35K in tuition. I know we like exact figures here but bear with me : ) 
* I may or may not be able to continue my current career so I might have to take out even more loans, I haven't decided how much that will be, but assume I take out a maxiumum of 80K.

So after graduation and employment etc. etc. I am
115K in debt, and making, for arguments sake again let's make it a nice round 100K, and assuming I enter and complete this program in the earliest possible time frame I'll be 33 years old. 

Any advice based on this information? Any more questions I should seek as I continue scouting ahead?

Thanks for your time!

Edit 2: I'm already attending the school open house which since it's in the same state I'm in will help me save on tuition.

personalfinance,How are we doing? (Retirement/savings planning),"Just paid off a debt and want to see how we are doing and what we could do better. Our info:

- We are 28 &amp; 31, married, no kids, no plans for kids. We rent a comfortable apartment that is about as cheap as we can get without living in a dingy place or area, have a working budget that we stick to, and we are careful about lifestyle creep. Our two biggest monthly expenses are rent and travel. 

- We have no credit card debt and are working on paying off our student loans. The ones that are left have 6% interest rate or lower. 

- Combined household income is $125k. We have an emergency savings fund. Husband has a 401k that we just started paying enough into to get to the annual limit and it has about $25k total so far. I have a traditional IRA with about $10k in it and we put what we can in there, around $3500 annually currently. As you can probably guess, we both started a little later on the retirement funds. 

- We just paid off one of the bigger loans and have some more cash each month to work with. We plan to pay more on the other loans so they will be paid off in a year and we can then focus on building our savings for an eventual downpayment for a house. 

- If we do that based just on the budget we will still have a little leftover most months from areas where we didn't spend as much on our budget. Usually somewhere between $100 to $350 monthly. I was just dumping it into the loan with the scary interest rate that is now gone. Instead of dumping it into the remaining loans I wanted to start contributing a little more to the IRA but also start a nonretirement investment account. I want us to have some money in the future that's not necessarily tied up in a retirement fund. 


I've read a lot about retirement planning, mainly on pf or links from pf, but I just want personal feedback on things we should change now or strive for in the future. Considerations that concern me are that we may be paying a mortgage still when we retire and that we spend more money on traveling than most and don't want to change that. My parents have retired very comfortably and I want that, but they also can't physically do a lot of the things that we want to do. I want to make sure we don't waste our youth purely on the idea that we'll have time for everything later. 

- Are we being realistic with our plans or are we going to be broke when we are old?

- If we have a couple hundred extra dollars a month should we be dumping it all into paying off the loans faster, into my IRA until it is maxed, or is it okay to invest some in a nonretirement fund?

- What should our long term goals be as we make more money? Open another IRA? Basically what is a good goal to have for retirement contributions that isn't going to completely restrict our lifestyle?",finance,1475678450

personalfinance,"24, Questions about investing and paying down debt","I have a few questions about investing in my company's 401k (or other options) more aggressively and aggressively paying down student debt and credit cards. 


Little bit of back ground, I am 24, married (wife is 24). I work full-time as a CPA at a firm, wife works full time at a children's hospital on the administration side. We both have been working for the last year. We currently have ~$7k in savings. Our combined income after taxes is roughly $77k. I have contributed 7% to my company's 401k since I began in September 2015, and have $4,600 in it as of today. I am only invested in one fund, Vanguard 500 Large Cap, that has earned me 9.27% return so far. I have roughly $9400 in federal student loans at 4.66% with a $101 monthly payment. What I hate to admit though is being in credit card debt. $3900 (11%) on one card (my card before we were married), this was used to pay my last semester of school ~$3500 and I have just been making the monthly minimum on it. Then we have $3500(18% still in 6months of 0%) on another card together that has been used to pay part of her Master's degree she is pursuing online and will finish. 


I guess my question on the debt is which to tackle first? I have talked with her about paying off one of the cards in full and taking the other one to zero over the next two months. We would do this by pulling from savings, and then contributing to savings to build it back up and more. While using my one of my semi-monthly paychecks to pay down the balance on the other, while continuing to make my monthly on student loans ($101). Does this sound reasonable? 



On investing, what else should I be investing in IRA, Roth IRA? Can you please provide some examples of what would be most advantageous to us as a young couple trying to set ourselves up for success? My firm doesn't actually match a % specifically on the 401k, but rather it will make an annual contribution based on the firm's performance during the year whether you make contributions or not. She currently contributes to her 401k, but I am not exactly how she has hers set up and will talk with her more tonight to see if we can figure out a plan for investing better. 







Thank you for any input and taking the time to read. I may be able to better clarify things if you need more information about the situation.",finance,1475688896
investing,What am I missing? A (flawed) strategy on using interest rate differences and forex hedging?,"I just can't figure out what's the catch. I must be missing something crucial, but I just don't see what.

Let's say I have savings in US dollars. (Alternatively, I can borrow USD at really low rates.)

Then, I can deposit money in a foreign bank account with insurance in a foreign currency. All legal and in solid banks.

Let's assume some currency of a developing country. High volatility, moderate to low political risks, high interest rates. (There are several such currencies I have in mind to diversify. I'm not talking about political risks at the moment, but I am aware of such.)

Let's say that such deposit would yield me 10% per year in that foreign currency.

The problem is of course the risk of that foreign currency losing value faster than the interest rate I'm getting paid in the currency.

If after the first year I get 10% more but that currency is devalued by 20% compared to USD, then I would end up with less dollars when converted back to US dollars.

To address that, I would simultaneously open a long position for USD/XXX with a forex broker
(I would in effect sell back that XXX currency and buy USD, for as long as the position remains open.)

So, I would take US dollars, convert them to currency XXX, deposit at a foreign bank at high interest rate.

At the same time, I would go long for the same amount (notationally) of XXX. I would use little leverage to make sure I don't get a margin call. Part of the available US dollar savings would be used for that.

The lot size of USD/XXX would match what I would deposit in a foreign bank in XXX.

If XXX goes up compared to USD, then my long position loses me money, but I make it back when converting that foreign deposit back to USD.

If XXX goes down, then my bank deposit would be worth less, but I would make money on my long position.

There is roll cost and conversion spread (both for the trade and for the deposit) and there are political risks and there is still a risk of a margin call, if leverage is greater than one.

But theoretically, I could even do with without leverage.

If I have, say, $200k. Then I would set aside $100k (plus the maintenance) for the forex broker.  And would open a lot for that amount (minus the maintenance), and would convert a matching amount to XXX and then would deposit XXX.

The way I look at it, I would effectively be getting 10% interest in USD. Well, that would be 10% minus the associated costs. But the costs could still be less than 10%.

And risks as really limited only to political risks. I wouldn't invest in a country that's at war. But there are plenty of developing countries that pay 10%+ on deposits in their currencies.

But must be missing something. It can't be that simple.

So what am I missing?

Would the rollover completely kill any profit margin?",finance,1475690415

personalfinance,Help with family identity theft (complicated situation),"This might be a good story for other's debating whether or not to file a police report on a family member who stole their identity...

In 2008 I found out that when I was 18 (7 years prior) that my mom opened a credit card in my name. Apparently she was making minimum payments on time but she missed a payment and I received a call from the lender.

I came to find out that my mom had a credit card in my name with a $8k balance. I confronted her and she agreed to pay down the balance, which she did (most of the times only the minimum). Faced with the options of potentially sending my mother to jail I decided, against my better judgement, this may be the ""better option"", the lender was made aware of the situation and said all I could do was file a police report. 

I checked my credit report annually and saw that the balance was slowly going down until about 8 months ago when the account again went past due.

Fed up with this hanging around my neck and seeing that she was falling behind I went ahead and contacted the lender and filed a police report. In the report I did mention that I found out about the account in 2008, figuring that it would be considered a ""false report"" if I did not mention that bit of information. The police report was rejected since I knew about the account.

The lender said they could not help me since the police rejected the report. 

Now I'm stuck, my mom is refusing the pay on the card, it's almost 160 days past due and I'm sure it'll fall into collections pretty soon. I know the usual rules would still apply regarding debt validation letters and requesting that all communication be done via certified mail.

I'm not too terribly concerned about my credit at the moment, I already own a home, doing good on building my retirement, have a 6 month+ emergency fund, all my credit cards are paid off monthly. If I had to I could weather a 7 year lowered credit scored. 

I could pay off the amount myself but as it stands the amount is nearly $8k...which is a good amount of money and would completely kill some of the goals I have right now. 

The only reason I'm concerned is I fear things like wage garnishment and of course dealing with the harassing phone calls. 

So my questions is, if and when the account does fall into collections, what recourse might I have at this point? Do any of my options change at this point?

Since the account with the original lender would be ""charged off"" and a new account created with the collector. The only thing I can think of is waiting for the account to fall into collections, get labeled as a ""new account"" and then refile a police report saying this collection account is news to me, though I suspect that might still qualify as illegal?

The other alternative would be negotiating a low payoff amount (with deletion) when I do start to receive collection calls...though at this point I'd rather not have to do this and find a way to get the police involved after all this headache.",finance,1475693037

personalfinance,Lowering taxable income to lower student loan monthly payments,"Hi everyone,

I have a specific questions about my taxes and how they play into my taxable income with regards to student loans. 

I am 29 years-old and I have a sizeable amount of student loans -- about $200k. They are all for grad school and are all federal loans, so I qualify to have them forgiven in 20 years if they remain in good standing. I graduated in July and have not started making student loan payment yet.

I am very fortunate to have gotten a job in my field, and have the potential for a lot of growth in my income in the future. It may look bleak when you read it on the page, but trust me, I am a lot better off than 99% of my classmates.

For the time being, I have a job making about $55k a year, but it is a very good company where I have room to grow in income and responsibility. I am happy with how things have turned out in the short term, despite my loans. 

Because my income is so small in comparison to my loans, I'd like to pay as little of them back as possible through an income contingent repayment plan. I understand that the calculation of how much you pay in taxes plays into your repayment plan. 

My question is: what are the smartest ways of reducing my taxable income in order to lower my monthly payments for my student loans?

My thoughts were putting some in an HSA and maxing out IRAs. Can anyone recommend a low-fee IRA that will satisfy my needs of lowering my taxable income? If you can point to books or resources that might help me with this as well, I'd be very appreciative.

I have about $45k liquid saved up that I was looking to use as a down-payment for an apartment or house, but I don't think I will be able to get a mortgage given my loans and lower income. I am thiking I may max out IRAs (which I have not set up yet) for this year in order to lower my taxable income already. '

personalfinance,Federal Thrift Savings Plan Beneficiary,"Hello readers of PF. My father passed away earlier this year and he was an employee of the Federal Government. I received a letter in the mail about his retirement savings and I wanted to see what some of y'all's opinions are regarding what I'd like to do.

Firstly, I have to decide quickly as the deadline is Oct. 17th. I moved and it took quite a while for this letter to catch up to me.


Anyway, the amount is $47,817.56, the letter states I was listed as a beneficiary and I am entitled to 100% of it. I have 90 days to send it to an inherited IRA or they will send me a check less 20%.


I am thinking that I should just take the check, pay the 20% tax and be done with it. For my taxes I will have that listed as income, the 47k, I also worked Jan. to Jun. which is 6 months, and I was salaried at 30k, so 15k from that job. My income for 2016 will be ~62k. I do have a child that I will be claiming whatever deductions you get (long story short, I haven't claimed him yet, his dad did it the first year, the courts let his dad do it a 2nd year, and I'll be doing it every year forward since his father committed suicide).",finance,1475706648
personalfinance,Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and Income Taxes,"This is a cross post from https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/562aw6/chapter_7_bankruptcy_and_income_taxes/ but I really need help, and I'm guessing that there are a number of accountants, tax attorneys, etc. that frequent this subreddit.

I live in Tennessee, but the State mentioned below is Alabama. I lived in Alabama for most of my life.

So, I'm in a fucked up situation. Back in 2008 I started a business with some friends. I was 21 at the time. The business started slowly, but in 2011 it really started to take off. By 2012, I was making really good money. Unfortunately regulatory changes completely wiped out our business model in mid 2012. At the same time I had a young child (he was born in 2008 and was part of my motivation for starting the business), and I was putting both his mother and myself through school. My son's mother and I ended up splitting, so I also ended up in a custody battle which drained my bank account via multiple methods.

At the end of all of this, I had custody of my son, but I was effectively broke. Also, I had a ton of unpaid taxes. In total I owe ~$50,000 to the IRS and State. I wish I could have paid it then, but I couldn't.

After that, I had some other failed businesses, worked for a startup (which went poorly), and have really not made a lot of money. About a year ago I decided that I couldn't keep living like that, as my son was getting older and I wanted to be able to keep him in a decent school, so I moved to a bigger area and started working in corporate IT.

I'm making ~$40,000 per year, which is enough to pay our rent, bills, and keep us clothed and fed...but it doesn't really leave a lot of extra cash. I've fully intended on working out my tax debts as soon as I can, and I'm working on certifications which would result in a promotion / raise / better job, but the State beat me to it. 2 days ago they garnished my bank account, and completely emptied it out. They took $1600, part of which was intended to pay my rent and bills, with the remaining being a constant balance I need to have in order to purchase a plane ticket / hotel whenever my work requires me to travel.

Anyway, once they did this, I decided that I needed to take extreme measures to resolve it. After a bit of research, I learned that Chapter 7 bankruptcy should apply to income tax debt in my situation. [According to NOLO](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-debt-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html), tax debt is dischargeable in Chapter 7 as long as the following criteria are met:

1. The taxes are income-based.
2. The return was due at least three years ago.
3. You filed the return at least two years ago.
4. The taxes were assessed at least 240 days ago.
5. No fraud of willful evasion.

I believe I meet all of these criteria...almost. This is income tax, I filed nearly 3 years ago (I had an extension, so 3 years will hit this month), I filed the returns at least 2 years ago (yes...nearly 3), the taxes were assessed at least 240 days ago (maybe? Not 100% on what this means, but I think so), and I was completely honest and have not tried to evade the taxes. I can't pay them, but that isn't because I don't want to...

Anyway, what I've been told by 2 lawyers now is that my tax debt will not qualify for Chapter 7 simply because I filed for an extension on the returns. In 2013, we were still working on finishing up the accounting for our defunct business. I filed an extension, and had my taxes completed in October of that year. They said that the simple act of filing the extension automatically exempted the taxes from Chapter 7, and the bankruptcy would have no effect even once the 3 year mark is reached later this month.

So, my questions are as follows:

1. Is it true that filing for an extension on my income taxes caused them to be exempt from Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief? (They said something about it making it into priority debt).

2. If so, why? All of the documentation I have found seems to suggest that the 3 years is simply extended to 3 years from the date of the extension deadline, instead of 3 years from April 15.

TL;DR

I made a lot of money at one time, but ran into issues, and lost it all. I owe tons in taxes from returns that were filed 3 years ago. I can't pay it, but I'm being told that Chapter 7 bankruptcy will not wipe the tax debt away simply because I filed for an extension on my returns that year. Is this true? Why? I'm completely fucked otherwise.

And, since this the personal finance sub, I have one final question.  If Chapter 7 bankruptcy ends up being out of the question, how can I survive this?  What possible way could someone making $40,000 a year pay off $50,000 in tax debt?  I have to provide a suitable home, food, clothing, etc. for my son at the very minimum, and even that seems difficult if I end up losing half of my income every month for the next few years.",finance,1475708762

I am hopeful that I might have some light shed on my options.

My budget for the build will be in the window of 35K – 55K. I’m looking for a way to borrow with the lowest interest rate possible. I am able to find temporary labor work if needed for additional income. My housing / partial food expenses during this time will be covered while I build at a family cabin. Living expenses will be roughly $500/month. My parents are of middle/low income but currently have their home paid off. They would be open to the idea of co-signing a loan or possibly taking one out for me. I would prefer to do everything on my own but would like to compare to using my parents help.

Bitcoin,Fiat will Fail with Mathematical Certainty,"The fiat system will fail with mathematical certainty: the reason is very simple - because it is debt based system, and therefore it is unsustainable. I will super simplify things here to get my point across.

* First and foremost money are created by central bank out of thin air and granted to the economy in the form of the loan. Let's say in the initial phase the economy requires $100 to trade, develop and operate. Federal reserve provides the economy with $100 in a form of a loan at the rate of 3%. (Loan is not backed by anything, just an entry in the ledger but that's not the point). At the end of the year, the economy needs to repay the loan + the interest. Wait! But economy only has $100 to begin with. Where should it get extra money to repay the interest? That is right, it has to borrow again to repay that interest. So you get my point - with current system design, one has to continue to borrow to repay the interest - indefinitely. But this only part of the point.

* the second part of the point is the fact that interest on the loan is calculated using compound formula, while economy grow at the simple rate. The high school math tells us that the rate of growth of compound formula is much faster than simple rate. Eventually everything that is owned gets turned into a debt - and then what's next?

The most I am upset about is that there is this army of scholars and economists and why they cannot figure this out? My only explanation is that at one point the fact that the speed of one object is only relevant to the speed of another did not come obvious to the world until the Einstein came around with theory of relativity.

EDIT: The most clever comment was that the Fiat is the **Unit of Account of Debt**.  We need to change the text books to state three functions of modern currency: 

* Medium of Exchange
* Storage of Value (of someone else's debt)
* Unit of account (of someone else's debt)

So the store of value and unit of account is actually a function of ability to repay the debt.

With all the articles about FI floating around lately, it seems like some financial planners are getting fed up with people asking how they can retire early. 

&gt; Barring winning the lottery or achieving Silicon Valley riches, financial independence requires two things: time and money. You’ve got to feed your program one way or the other.

This guy makes a good point, that if you want to invest for a shorter period of time then you have to invest a lot more money to compensate.

I think it would've been cool if he'd posted a graph showing how much you'd have to invest to retire early, though. His point seems to be that you should start early so you can save less and still retire on time. What about starting early and saving MORE so you can retire early?",finance,1475766199

personalfinance,Auto Loan Refinancing - How do you get the lowest rate?,"Hello PF,

I have done a bit of browsing around the sub but I cannot find much information on how this works. My GF has a car loan with a ~7% interest rate and is about 1 year in. When she bought the car she had no credit history and whatnot.

Now her credit score is in the 750 range and we would really like to refinance her auto loan to save some money in the long run, but, I do not know much about refinancing or how you shop around for interest rates. Could anybody help me out with the following questions:

1. What is the lowest rate we could reasonably expect? 2.99%?

2. Do you generally shop around at multiple banks, or do they all tend to have the same interest rate offers?


3. Can you negotiate an interest rate? Say a bank advertises a 3.99% rate - can we sit down with them and haggle down based on good credit history, income, etc, or do we just have to go with whatever they say?


4. I see credit unions promoted quite often on this subreddit, but the only credit unions around here (Chicago) appear realllly sketchy and their websites haven't been updated since Al Gore created the internet. Does anybody know of, or utilize, reliable credit unions in Chicago?

5. Are there any hidden fees, tricks, etc. we should be aware of?

6. I assume her car is worth less than the amount she owes at this point in time. What kind of difficulties will this add?

personalfinance,Student Loans vs. Investments in the Market,"First off, forgive me if my question could easily be answered in the wiki. I read it but wanted to see what the discussion would be like here regarding my question, since there are several perspectives one could consider. I've come to consider all aspects of life as investments (health, finance, education, etc.).


Suppose this hypothetical scenario: You've just graduated your college with an undergraduate degree, you have a full time job that pays $50k/year, and you have a grand total of $50,000 of student loan debt at 6.8% interest rate. In addition, you live at home, 100% rent-free. Given 6 months of a grace period (where the loans still accrue interest, but you don't ""have to"" pay them back until the grace period expires), would you rather invest your earnings for the first 6 months in the market, then withdraw at the beginning of the 6 months and make it a massive ""down payment"" on the student loans, or simultaneously invest money in the market while paying the minimum on the loans?


My take on this scenario is the student loans are a guaranteed (financial) loss investment at 6.8% while investing in the market will either go up or down... It would be in the best interest (no pun intended) to prioritize paying off the student loans over the ~16 month period and then dedicate earnings in full to catching up on investing in the market (Employer Contributed 401k, IRA, stocks, etc.). Assume living rent-free is guaranteed for 2 years. What are your thoughts?",finance,1475770664

personalfinance,Where can I find a knowledgeable local professional to help me with finances?,"Hey all, I haven't posted here in a while and this may be the wrong sub, but my finances have reached a point I am not sure what the best decision to make is anymore and would like to seek help from a local professional.

**The Details**

I am a software engineering 1 year out of college making about the median salary for the field with no student loans or auto loans. I purchased a 3BR town home 6 months ago, admittedly maybe a bit hasty, with 5% down at 3.6% and am renting out two bedrooms. After the tenants rent I pay about 175$/month including HOA, Utilities, Insurance, PMI, Mortage. My home is in an area that is rapidly getting nicer. Luxury apartments just finished being build with 4 more townhouse developments being built with a starting price about 1.5-1.75x the price of my townhouse (10 years old) for the same square footage and ammenities so my value should only rise, historically 3-4% a year. I am currently saving to buy a car with cash in the next 4-6 months.

**The Questions**

And herein lies the dilemma. Do I claim depreciation on the house to reduce tax burden of the renters or pay full taxes to not get hit with taxes when/if I sell? I would say there is a 75% chance I atleast move out once I have fulfilled my obligation to live the house as my primary residence per the loan conditions. If I turn it in to a rental or sell I am not sure yet. After the car do I put more towards my loan? Max out my 401k to the federal max (currently max out employer match, not federal max though)? Put some in to a Roth IRA instead of my 401k? There are way to many options with way too many nuances for me to be able to decide what is best. I am more than willing to pay a professional for their opinions on what the best options are but I have no clue where to even begin looking for a reputable local professional.

financialindependence,Sacrificing 401k/Roth IRA contribution in the name of Real Estate Investing; yea or nay?,"I'm trying to weigh the opportunity cost of forgoing contributions to my Roth 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA this year and instead directing that money into a real estate investment (generally speaking). I've been maxing out these contributions for the last couple of years.

Here is my current situation:

* 31, married (sahm), 2 kids + one on the way and likely more in the future  
* Only debt is a mortgage on our current home  
* Roth 401k balance: $64,000 *(no employer match)*  
* Roth IRA balance: $64,300 *(wife and mine combined)*  
* HSA balance: $30,000 *(we pay for medical out of pocket, keep all our receipts, and consider the HSA like another IRA)*  
* No 529 funds yet. We haven't had much left over after buying our house and contributing to retirement. I've taken the ""put your oxygen mask on before helping others"" perspective and have focused on our retirement first.


I consider myself more open to risk than many. That being said, I work on ""Wall St."" and while I currently have all of these funds invested almost exclusively in equities, I'm leery of having all my eggs in the capital markets basket (job &amp; investments). I'm keen on trying to expand my personal portfolio with real estate (I get that it is connected to capital markets, just less so); part of it is the diversification, the opportunity to lever-up, and part of it is the entrepreneurial nature of it. I'd like to start small and fail early, if need be, to show myself if it is or isn't for me.


My compensation is bonus-heavy, so I have not contributed to any of these vehicles for this year, and I will only do so upon receiving a year-end bonus. Options basically boil down to:  
A) continue to max out these tax advantaged accounts each year; save on the side for at least 2-3 years (more if we aren't disciplined) to accumulate funds for a down payment on an investment property.  
B) skip the retirement accounts this year and invest in a property shortly after the new year. Depending on experience with it go back to maxing out retirement accounts next year or continue to build the real estate portfolio.


My current balances obviously aren't sufficient for full on cruise control mode, but I lean towards option B in part because of the interest rate environment we are currently in, and I'd love to have another source of income (even if small in the beginning). I envision retiring in 15-20 yrs and would love to have an income stream from rentals to help me bridge the gap to 59.5 and beyond. However, the tax advantages of the 401k/IRA are compelling; I'm just having a hard time quantifying it. Obviously some elements here would be good for the BiggerPockets crowd, but because of the either/or with the retirement accounts, I thought I would ask here. Thanks for your perspective.

EDIT: formatting

RECAP: Sounds like the majority would continue to max out the tax advantaged accounts while a few have had success diverting funds or wish they had earlier on. Not 100% which way I'll go, but definitely some food for thought.",finance,1475780687

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans in full?,"First I'll give a little background. I graduated from a 4 year university with a finance degree in May 2015 with just over $50,000 in student loans. I have these loans on a 25 year repayment plan and I am just over a year into repayment. My monthly payment is $350 with an average interest rate around 6.5%. Some as low as 3.5% and some as high as 9%+.

My plan since graduation has been to repay my loans in full as soon as possible. I have continued to live as cheap as possible since graduation. My fixed monthly bills are relatively low at just over $1600. I do not have any other debt except for a vehicle lease. Over the last 14 months I have been working nuclear plant outages across the US and have pretty easily saved up the $50,000 to pay off all my loans.

After working the past year I have begun to wonder if paying my loans in full is a wise decision. The loan payments are relatively cheap but I do not want to get hammered by the interest in the long run. Is it economical and beneficial to pay these loans off now or would I be better off paying them down over a longer period of time. I have considered maxing out a Roth IRA and then paying off the higher interest rate loans in full over time.

Right down to the numbers:

Credit scores:


Me: ~775


Wife:~750

-------------------------------------------------

Net Income (I'm part time, still in school, wife is full time):


Me: 8K


Her: 38.5k


-----------------------------------------------------

Debts: 0

-----------------------------------------------------

Liquid: 38.7k


Brokerage: 18k


Total: 56.7K


We have retirement accounts and active contributions but those are non negotiable and already subtracted from the post tax income. Same with health insurance, already deducted from the post tax income. No life insurance for either of us (both 27).


Cars:


1 Car ~150k miles on it no payment, expect another 75K miles out of it. Will have to buy another one if we buy a house. Probably like 6K used solid car (this is the car payment built into budget below).


Projected Budget:


Allowed: 3865


Gas:	225


Groceries: 400


Savings: 150


Entertainment: 100


Utilities: 250


cable/internet: 100


repairs: 200

Misc: 200


phone: 40


Car insurance:	250


Home insurance: 130


Car payment: 250


Property tax: 500


Mortgage: 1015


So if we put down 20%, that leaves us with ~16.7k. I'm assuming there will be some closing cost that hopefully isn't that much so planning on 10K in reserve emergency fund.


I'm also (being safe?) assuming a 4.5% interest rate on the house over 30 years for ~$1015 payment.

Loan 2: $4,500 in unpaid principal, $498.39 in unpaid interest, and a 3.86% interest rate.

Loan 3: $5,500 in unpaid principal, $477.48 in unpaid interest, and a 4.66% interest rate.

Loan 4: $5,220 in unpaid principal, $0.00 in unpaid interest, and a 4.29% interest rate.

personalfinance,Defrauded by finance guys at Kia Motors dealer,"Just got my bachelor's and planned to buy me a new Kia Soul!, and my husband an Optima Hybrid.  Not now, not after this:
My dad had held on to his beloved Explorer until it hit 200k miles and he finally swapped it; first, for a Tundra but then resold it and bought a Kia Forte maxed out with whatever sports package that makes this into to a premium vehicle/rare in the USA. They weren't even looking seriously, but they saw a Kia dealer in DFW had one so they went to take a look.  Said afterwards the sales guy was great but the financing department left much to be desired.   Keep in mind my mother has an 840 credit score and my dad not far behind, so they knew they would get the best terms available in the market from any lender they asked.  
While they were waiting their turn to do paperwork, the dealership's neighborhood had a power outage. Fast forward to six hours later and they are still there.  The deal with finance was struck, APR (0% financing I think, but through Kia Motor's financing division) and a 60 month term agreed upon.  After six hours, power comes on, and hours worth of customers to process, the friendly and knowledgeable sales guy said to them hold on, you've been here forever, loan good blah blah blah so said he would expedite the paperwork for them and see if he couldn't get any extra something done to make up for the ordeal.  
They were so pleased with the guy's helpfulness that they just John Hancocked each page and went home.  The next day, my dad got the paperwork out, and sure enough there was a $20/month lower payment listed.  But he wanted to know where the discount came from and then saw that the finance department did indeed tweak the deal - by force adding GAP, extended warranties, etc and then rewriting the loan terms per 72 months.  Need I mention that they had emphatically said no multiple times to more than a sixty month term for the loan and had to fight with the finance guys over this issue.  
If I am not mistaken, this was all very illegal, and while my dad wouldn't do anything that would wind up causing the people any trouble like go after them with a lawyer, I on the other hand, think that this needs to be reported on somehow and the message made public.  
My husband mentioned to my dad the fact that he was lucky to have found all that and then went to PenFed to refinance the loan (because the dealership when contacted said too bad so sad you have to wait 30 days to make changes).  So reporting on this here, and on Facebook, hoping somebody reads this that needs too, and won't innocently get defrauded.  

BUT -
That is not the last of it.  He has had the car for three weeks now, the past two and a half it has been sitting in a lift at the dealership.  Needed some kind of new fuel pump part, one that is considered hazardous material and therefore on a boat, yes, a boat, from Germany or somewhere in Northern Europe.  Why a company like Kia doesn't have spare parts available in the same country - especially given this is one of their limited edition premium offerings and they can't just put the part on a plane - is beyond me.  Again/still not a word back from Kia Corporate, not about being defrauded by their dealership and not about this brand new vehicle breaking down in the middle of the road three days after it drove off the lot.

personalfinance,"Please help, my girlfriend and I really need some help/advice about student loans, taxes and if marriage could help the latter.","Okay, so this could get a little bit long-winded, so please bear with me. I'll break this up into three sections about us and then I have a few questions about the information I provided.

Her: She is a pharmacist making about $130,000/year. This puts her into the tax bracket where she is taxed about 28%. After taxes, benefits, 401k, etc. she takes home about $80,000 per year, bi-weekly paychecks are around $3,250. She has about $300,000 in student loans, $270,000 in Federal, $30,000 in private. We know the obvious and the basics that we want to pay off the highest interest first, then the next highest, etc. The issue that comes into play with this is that she is on an income-based repayment and her Federal payments just jumped to $1,200/month. Another thing with her is that with having high Federal loans, she does get a credit on her tax returns based on the interest paid towards those loans, which equals about $3,500. 

All of her expenses that are recurring, including the above Federal loan payments come to around $3,300 per month. I can break stuff down, but I have read enough on here to know that she is not spending money in stupid places, a large majority of that is student loan payments (She's only spending about $1,100 on rent, utilities, car payment, etc.)

Me: I am a full-time student and a full-time employee. I just accepted a position that will put me into the next tax bracket, pushing me from 15% to 25% (~$34,000 to ~$38,000). I have no student loans yet as I have been able to pay for my way through school with my full-time job. Like I said above, I will be making about $38,000 per year, which is about $1,500 per paycheck and I am unsure what take-home pay will be after the new benefits, taxes, etc. 

A bit more about us as a couple. We are talking about getting married, buying a house, having kids and the like. She has heard that if we get married, she will not be able to collect the student loan interest that she has paid as she can right now if we are making over $160k. I am not sure if this is entirely true, maybe somebody has better information? We are also not sure how the tax deductions from getting married, getting a mortgage or having kids could affect us at our currently salaries.

So for the questions:

1. Should she consolidate some of her Federal and private loans together? Just the Federal? Just private? Just the high-interest ones? Or not at all? She has some Federal loans that have an interest rate of 1% but some that are as high as 7%. Would consolidating or refinancing lower her payments?

2. What about marriage? If we got married, according to bankrate.com, we would both be put into the 28% tax bracket, where she's already at. Would that benefit us in any way? 

3. Obviously buying a house isn't super ideal right now, but if she was to get a higher paying job in a city with a lower cost of living, would it work itself out eventually? We're renting right now and both paying $600 in rent. If we could work out a mortgage around the same price in a city like Bloomington, MN, would the tax benefits work more to our advantage? Or would home insurance and the utilities and everything screw us over?

Any advice you guys are able to provide would be great. We are really trying to get our lives on track, but we are finding it difficult.

personalfinance,Sketchy Package Delivery Notice [Other],"Hello! I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but there are lots of scams on this sub, so I thought I'd try. I received a note on my door about a package delivery with an 888 number and a tracking number, and a message to call them to receive my package. I haven't ordered anything, and I contacted the family about it and they haven't sent me anything.

There is no branding on the notice. I can't find the tracking number on FedEX, UPS, or USPS. I'm concerned this may be a scam or setup for a home invasion, as these sorts of things are somewhat common around the holiday season. Usually, they'll call you though instead of actually coming to your place. Has anyone heard of this?",finance,1475814044

personalfinance,"(AUS) Fresh out of uni, will graduate next year with a $110k (incl. super) job offer. Developed a ""trial budget"" but it seems kinda tight for a single young guy? Help me figure out if my estimates are off or wrong.","Hi all,

I live with my parents currently and will move out after graduating, so I don't know too much about money management. I like playing with graphs and Microsoft Excel and stuff, so I wanted to build a pretend projected budget to see how much I can save per year once I start working (this is in Sydney, Australia). Here's the annual breakdown with comments:

&amp;nbsp;

**Income:** $110,458

Pretty self-explanatory.

&amp;nbsp;

**Taxes:** -$34,755 (31%)

This tax rate includes HELP repayments, which are a kind of federal student loan in Australia.

&amp;nbsp;

**Superannuation:** -$11,499 (10%)

Mandatory retirement contribution ($9583), plus an additional 20% voluntary contribution I was interested in doing.

&amp;nbsp;

**Rent:** -$26,000 (24%)

An one-bedroom apartment in Mascot, which is around 15-20 minutes away from the city, runs between $400-$500 per week. I put $500 per week as a conservative estimate.

&amp;nbsp;

**Groceries:** -$5,200 (5%)

I set this to $100 per week, which covers food and other things you need to buy (soap, toiletries, cleaning supplies, etc.). I don't know if this is right, because I've never done my own groceries before... a reference point is that a 12-pack of eggs costs $4-$5.

&amp;nbsp;

**Utilities:** -$2,600 (2%)

I'm just guessing I have to pay $200/mo in water, electricity, gas, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**Internet/Phone:** -$1,200 (1%)

Pretty simple, a mobile phone plan and an internet package should come around to $100/mo.

&amp;nbsp;

**Subscriptions:** -$1,200 (1%)

This includes gym membership ($40/mo), Spotify, Netflix, Google Drive, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**Public Transport:** -$3,640 (3%)

Train fare in and around Sydney might be around $10 per day, 7 days a week (assuming I go out weekends), coming to $70/week, multiplied by 52.

&amp;nbsp;

**Private Health Cover:** -$1,560 (1%)

A basic health cover for dental, opto, etc. should run me around $30/week, from looking online... I think!

&amp;nbsp;

**Disposable Discretionary:** -$3,640 (3%)

This amounts to $70 per week, which is budgeted for things like dates, eating out, movies, concert tickets, video games, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

**Long-Term Purchases:** -$5000 (5%)

I wanted to allocate a flat $5k per year on purchases like furniture, appliances, TV/computer/phone/camera. Obviously I won't buy a new TV or computer or laptop every year, but the idea is to allocate enough so that I could be comfortable with making a large purchase every year. Maybe this is too high? I'm not sure. Anything I don't use up can roll into emergency fund at the end of the year.

&amp;nbsp;

**Emergency Fund:** -$5000 (5%)

I wanted to have an emergency fund to cover around a month of income per year. Bigger would be better though, as I'm very risk averse.

&amp;nbsp;

**Vacation Fund:** -$5000 (5%)

I have lots of family abroad, but unfortunately they're all over the world! In addition, I love to travel. A vacation fund of $5000 should support me for a month off every year, including international flights (which become expensive depending on where you go), hotel, insurance, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

Whew! Congrats for making it through all of that. If you deduct all of the above from my salary, **around $4,000 (4%) remains**. And I still haven't added anything about car repayments, or home/life insurance, or all manner of things that I'm probably forgetting. I would be really interested in researching and starting an investment portfolio eventually, but it doesn't look like there's any room!

&amp;nbsp;

My wife and I have $36,000 in our savings account, and due to recent life events (wedding, honeymoon, new apartment) we have accumulated about $9,500 in our Visa bill. Also, I have $8000 left to pay for my student loans. Thus, in total, we have $17,500 worth of expenses left to pay.

We are currently only capable of putting aside $1000 a month for either our Visa bill and student loan, or our savings account. Given the high interest rates on our Visa bill (19.9%), we were wondering if we should take money from our savings account and pay it off completely, or if we should simply devote $1000 a month to pay it off and not touch our savings.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my private student loan early?,"I know that this will likely come down to a mix of math and emotion, but I wanted to run the numbers by the community

When I went to graduate school I took out a variable interest rate $7,000 personal student loan with Sallie Mae for living expenses, on top of my fedral student loans, which are fully paid off early. 8 years later and it's only down to $3,500 and the estimated payoff date is 7/2023. Somewhere a few years ago they lowered the payment from around $65 to $47 without my asking, I'm guessing to run out my payments to get more interest out of me. For a few years the interest rate was 2.75%, now I check today and it's 3%.

I'm sick of this loan and the variability it can have. I have the income to make higher payments to pay it off earlier, but I fear that in retaliation they will increase the interest rate again. I also have the money in savings to pay the entire thing off right now. Paying off the $3500 is an 11% hit to my savings account, which doubles as my emergency fund as I pretty much don't ever touch that money.

At the current interest rate of 3% the loan will cost me about $350 in interest over the 6 remaining years, which I know is not very much, but they can make that much higher on the fly. It's a gamble. The money in my savings account is making 1-1.25% interest, so really the loan is a net 1.75-2% rate currently.

So what does everyone think?

Experian Scores - 578(before discharge), 653 (right after discharge), 723 (current)

This month we are holding several Town Hall threads for statewide ballot initiatives.  Because there are *so many* initiatives up, we have set up topic-specific groupings for the 4 most popular subjects according to Ballotpedia: Minimum Wage, Healthcare, Marijuana Laws, and Gun Laws.  

In the Town Halls, the ""support"" and ""oppose"" groups listed on each ballot measure have been invited to send a representative here to answer your questions.  We set up the thread several hours before the guests will arrive so that questions will be there for them to answer, and cross post to the relevant local subreddits.

The [Minimum Wage Town Hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/55z39g/rpolitics_town_hall_state_ballot_measures_about/), which took place on Wednesday, was great.

## Topic Tuesdays

Our Topic Tuesdays program began in September and is off to a great start!

&gt; Every Tuesday, we'll sticky a post about a hot topic. The OP will include a general overview of the issue at hand, some opinions from experts and leaders, some links for more reading, and a discussion prompt or two. We're going to keep these threads a place for structured and serious discussion debate, so put as much thought into your comments as you can and keep in mind we'll be enforcing rules more harshly than we may elsewhere on the sub.

##Megathread Changes &amp; Polling Megathreads

Two weeks ago, we announced changes to the megathread policies [with a sticky announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/53yz93/meta_improving_the_use_of_megathreads_in/).  

See the current polling megathread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/566s1f/polling_megathread_1004_1006/).  

Remember that all poll results should be posted directly to the current megathread, and articles which analyze poll results are acceptable as independent submissions.

## Clarified Link Flairs for Blog Removals &amp; Source-Altered Titles

In response to feedback that our link flairs were leading to misunderstanding of the involved rules, we've made the following changes:

* ""Title Change"" is now ""Site Altered Headline"".  The common misunderstanding was that ""title change"" was used to allow a submission with [a non-exact title](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_do_not_create_your_own_title) to be approved instead of removed.  The actual meaning of ""title change"" was that the title of the article had been changed, after the OP had submitted it with the exact correct title.  This is a fairly common occurrence with breaking news, and sometimes an article's title can be changed by the source many times.  Any time you see ""Site Altered Headline"" next to a submission title, that means that we have verified that the title used was once exact, but now you will see a different title on the article.

* We've added ""Personal Blog"", to be more specific on domain-based removals.  [Personal blogs are not allowed on /r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_the_.2Fr.2Fpolitics_on_topic_statement).  Formerly, we typically used the ""Unacceptable Domain"" removal flair to indicate this, but the reason that the domain was unacceptable wasn't always clear to the community.

We hope these little wording tweaks will improve understanding of why certain things were approved or removed.  If there are other unclear flairs, please let us know your thoughts.  Keep in mind, we are somewhat limited on realistic length of the text in the flair, and also on the number of overall flairs we should use.

- Work at same job for 5 years (Clinical Lab), 35k salary (Higher positions from here require degree)
- Photo business helps pull in at at least extra 5k a year.
- No College credits: Carpooled first 2 years of work because of saving for a car thus no school. Last 3 years, decided on building my own business with photography, weddings, and basically a production company. Used the money I earned to buy equipment and ex girlfriend of 4 years I spent a lot of money going places I wanted to photograph.
- I stopped paying for the loan after I realized I was going more broke first 2 years trying to beat the interest rates and paying it off. So I stopped paying and started saving the money 

 
Bills - $1020 Bi-Weekly $2040/Month

- Rent - $400/m with current girlfriend room mating
- Phone - $110/m - 20gb of data. Might lower it but need to stay up to date with media trends/email clients for business that takes up a lot of data etc. Always on the go. 
- Car Insurance - $102/m - Geico 
- Car Payment - $392/m with 19k left. Car under Girlfriends name because my credit wasn't enough to get approved, reliable 2015 civic I need to travel long distances for shoots and carry gear. Her car is getting old so this is for the both of us. But I insure the car under my name and her as the secondary driver. Re-financing soon.
- 401k - 70$ Every week goes into Retirement with over $8k saved up since 2014. Work gave out Retirement bonuses for long time employees.
- Storage - $78/m - Mom &amp; Brothers things they left behind. No space in girlfriends place to keep them. 
- Gas - $20 /week

Rougly $1,172 in bills a month, and around probably $800 saved if I don't go anywhere far/go out a lot. I don't eat out as much as my GF's family knows my situation and they can cook for me/I cook for them. 

My savings/E-Fund account only has $4,000, but with these defaulted loans looming over my head, with no support from my POS biological father gone, I feel trapped and have a huge feeling I'll get sued and have my checks garnished. My options came down to:

- Filing Bankruptcy - Found one for $1,350 that my friend used and referred me to, and continue my life with out credit for 3 years. I've lived with out credit use for 3-4 years and only cash/debit, so why not?

Or

- Pay off the Defaulted Loan with 24%+ Interest Rates but be super broke for YEARS and literally disabled from doing anything, especially continue my career in filmmaking. I'd have to stay in his dead end job that stopped giving raises 2 years ago because they also filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. 

I don't see myself owning a house or property anytime soon unless I find a way to earn a big income with no college degree. Reddit, I will take any insult/criticism/suggestion/recommendation/assistance, anything to help put my foot in the door of salvation and on the road to be debt-free, financial stability. Down the road, maybe afford to buy my girlfriend in an engagement ring in the future (maybe 5 years from now). Houses can wait.

personalfinance,Managing a Sinking Man-Child,"I need a place to post anonymously about the trouble my mom and her husband are in. My mom is smart enough to manage her own finances, but has probably made some big mistakes with her man-child of a husband who I just found out last night is sinking in debt. He's not a terrible guy, just incompetent and not that bright. 

She manages their ma and pa little construction business and it pays the bills and allows them to survive, but I just found out about the troubles they are in. It is so bad that she has had to leave and visit me for a bit and is planning on separating to possibly fix some of her involvement in this.  They recently moved into a foreclosed house (this is in Canada) they got for really cheap which she paid in full (60k) but put in both of their names. I will try to keep the details concise. 

The details: He has 30k in credit card debt. 20k in line of credit, and a -$7k balance in his chequing. That's a 57k debt with varying interest rates. Their business brings in each of them around 20k-25k after tax money per year, so they are verging on poor I would say.

I would really like to know what my mom should be doing. She doesn't care at this moment whether she and him make it, but she's very concerned about whether the bank will come after her for the house which is 50% in his name at the moment. He as verbally agreed to voluntarily get his name off of the house.

1. Will getting his name off of the deed to the house eliminate the liability on my mom? (This house was purchased 100% by her, and his debt happened long ago).
2. After they untangle financially and possibly separate legally, what should be his next step? (Debt consolidation or bankruptcy?)
3. Any other advice? I really could only go so far as to suggest steps 1 &amp; 2 (once they figure out if bankruptcy or debt-consolidation will be better). Please if you require any other details let me know and I will reply back ASAP. I am mostly concerned about my mom. She has scrimped and saved all of her life, she has a fully paid house and slightly over 100k in RRSP. They are both in their mid-fifties. I guess the third question would be what does she need to do to make him own the debt? He doesn't even get the situation he's in. He says ""debt sucks"" but really does not understand the situation he is in. He is expecting my mom to keep telling him what to do and that she will manage everything for them.

personalfinance,Is there any possible way to finance a second bachelor's degree with low income?,"Sorry in advance if this is posted often I didn’t see anything too similar.

I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor’s degree in Exercise Physiology – Pre-Physical Therapy. After 2 years off school and working (1 year not in my field) I’ve decided I’d really like to go back to school for engineering.  Here are the facts (I think, correct me if I’m wrong)

I know I am not eligible for any grants. 

I am unsure about scholarships. 

The in-state tuition where I live is exorbitant

I used $32,000 of federal loans and 30 thousand of private to pay for the first bout, currently paid off a measly $10,000. So I have about $25,000 worth of federal loans left in my lifetime limit. (?)

I have heavily considered trying to get my prerequisites out of the way in CC or do a pre-engineering curriculum but I don’t have the savings to cover that out of pocket (maybe a class here or there), can’t do the schooling part time, online, or evenings, and I’ve also read that you may not be able to use Federal loans for community colleges. 

It seems my only options would be school full time and work part time. Which I don’t know if I could afford rent and my current student loans doing that (435 student loans, rent 500) and using private loans to finance the school, but the interest rates I’m paying are insane. Right now I don’t even want to apply to schools. I’m at such a loss and disheartened that I may never be able to go back at all. I’ve been stuck in a place I’ve hated for a year and a half now and I fear I’ll be stuck at this dead end job with a worthless bridge degree for the rest of my life.

So how in the world could I possibly finance this? Is it all just a pipe dream? Any advice at all would be GREATLY appreciated as this has been stressing me out for months.",finance,1475862740
personalfinance,Miserable in the condo I bought and not sure how to get out,"I am 22. In early 2015, someone suggested that I think about buying myself a condo, as I'd had an $18-20k job for a year and a half, about a 60% savings rate, and have always been good with my money. I had lived at home with family my whole life, so the idea of owning my own place and no longer ""throwing money away"" on rent was really appealing to me. I got myself a credit card to start my credit history and eventually **bought a condo, for $93k with 10% down and a 5% interest rate, in January of this year.** I assumed I would be living here for the next 5+ years.

However, I quickly became miserable instead:

* **The neighbours are noisy at all hours of the day and night** (talking, laughing, fighting, music, etc.). A lot of the time, I cannot fall asleep or relax, or I'm woken up at 2am. I'm the minority race in this neighbourhood, which is uncomfortable, and I like to keep to myself, so I'm not comfortable confronting them or calling the police. I had to move my entire bedroom to my loft after a few months because it is too loud and frustrating to spend most of my time at home in there anymore
* Crime is higher in this city, and **I worry about the safety and security of myself and my belongings**
* **There are cockroaches**; not a huge issue since I'm very clean, but I think the people above me have them bad and that's where I'm getting them from
* **I get cigarette, weed, food, and other smells seeping in from other unit(s)**. I'm not sure how they get in or how to stop them
* I have learned from maintenance and through researching the complex on the Internet that **there is heavy gang activity here** (what kind that means exactly, I'm not sure)
* **My ceiling has been leaking since February** and I can't seem to get the HOA, tenant, or owner to do anything about it. I just threatened legal action last week, so we'll see if that goes anywhere (I am prepared to find a lawyer, but I'm not sure if I'll end up being able to afford it, especially if I don't ""win"" or whatever)

I had to quit my underpaying job in February, so I was living off ~$10k in savings for about six months until I got a paycheck from my new job last week. In hindsight, staying unemployed for so long was an awful idea, but I felt like I needed a break from work, and then I couldn't get a job right away. I expected moving out on my own to be really good for me, so when my situation got worse instead, I became very depressed, and that hasn't helped me, either.

Here's my current situation:

* **$1900/mo. paycheck** ($25k/yr. salary)

**Monthly expenses (~$1,355)**:

* $730 mortgage + HOA fees
* $60 gas/electric
* $35 Internet
* $30 cell phone
* $200 car payment ($9,240 remaining @ 8.45% interest)
* ~$150 car + property insurance
* Maybe $100 groceries
* ~$50 gas
* (I haven't gotten health insurance yet; I'm estimating it to cost $120-200/mo., but I'm stubborn in that I think it might be cheaper to just pay the tax penalty instead)

**I have:**

* **$3,700 in savings**
* **$0 credit card debt ($9,600 limit across a few cards)**

There is not much room to cut back as I am already very frugal with my spending. I don't go out to eat, coffee, etc. For the most part, if it's a non-necessary expense, it doesn't happen.

I'd like to sell the place and move out, but I'm struggling because I'm not sure how to do it.

**Here's my current plan:**

* Continue at this new job; **I am trying to get back into freelance web design to start making a bit more money**, which could potentially mean an extra $300-800+/mo. net depending on clients (conservatively)
* Move non-essential items to storage and pay $200+/mo. for that so I don't have to worry about moving it all once I've sold the condo, as I'm very worried about that being a stressor for me. I will have to store additional furniture once I've moved out
* Try to sell the place once the leak has been fixed
* Move back in with my mom for $200-300/mo. rent and find a new job (current one would be too far away) or continue freelancing full-time

I have a couple issues with these ideas:

* I'm very afraid of blowing so much money on storage
* I'm not sure how long the sale will take. Depending on what I have to disclose legally and morally (smells, cockroaches, and noise), if I can even sell the place with the disclosures, and if I can afford to fix anything (smells, primarily) if I'm obligated to

Current Zestimate for condo is $94k (year forecast is $98k), but realtor recently told me she thought she could sell it for ~$100k IIRC. She is aware of all the issues I have been having.

Finally, I'm also wondering if refinancing the mortgage and/or car loan might be a good idea, since I have another eight months of history now, and my credit score has gone up from 716 to 751 since January.

**tl;dr:**

I tried to bold bits that were most important:

* Bought a condo in January; $93k, 10% down, at 5% interest (30-yr.; fixed-rate, I think)
* Can't stand living here (noisy neighbours, safety, cockroaches, outside smells, gang activity, 8-mo.-old ceiling leak)
* $1900/mo. income (+ potential freelance income)
* $1355/mo. expenses
* $3600 in savings
* $0 credit card debt

Looking at the numbers on this post again, I think it sounds like I might just have to continue to endure this until I have more savings, but I want to hear your thoughts just in case.

personalfinance,"University overcharged me $11k a year and half ago, what can I do about it?

My question is whether it is reasonable to ask for interest on that amount for the last 1.5 years.

It seems like I should be able to ask for some compensation since my finances have been quite tight (it's about equal to the amount the University has actually paid me). It's not really a small error, and it wasn't fixed quickly. It also would never have been noticed unless I was wondering why I couldn't pay rent.

personalfinance,Ten most important things about personal finance that someone without a finance background must know,"Personal finance is more behavioral and less to do with finance. All it takes to under stand personal finance is seventh grade mathematics and a little bit of common sense. Below are the 10 most important things or best practices in my opinion about personal finance
1.College Degree
You need to have basic college education in a subject which has got good job prospects. You can always opt out not to go for a college degree but a look at the graph below will explain my point

The graph shows that just having a bachelor’s degree can nearly double your income when compared to some one who has only a high school diploma. So spending 4 years on a college degree is worth the effort. What this graph doesn’t tell is that jobs requiring advanced degrees are more difficult to be filled by the right candidate and hence have more job security. Obviously there are more people applying for secretary positions than for management roles. That is the reason why the unemployment rate decreases as your career progresses in terms of academic degrees. Also do not waste your time in degrees where you will incur large student debts with very little return of investment. Again have a look at the graph below

The figure clearly shows you why engineering is the most sought after degree today for an undergraduate major.
In terms of college selection do not go by reputation but chose a good instate school or even a community college with a proven record. In case of undergraduate education it really doesn’t matter which school you go to since you will be just dealing with course work and finals and getting your degree. Choice of a school does become important for MS and PhD studies. I have done my Masters in a school which was ranked by US NEWS around 135 and my PhD was from Ga. Tech which was ranked as the 4th best school in USA. So I have seen two ends of the spectrum for Masters and PhD program. However, it is much better to complete your degree from a middle tier in-state school rather than enroll in Harvard and not complete your degree. You can always argue that the likes of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg never finished their degrees but such examples are far and few. My point is that by the end of your freshman year you should realize that if you are cut out for college degree or not. If not then you would rather drop out and start working on what you are interested in and try to translate your interest into income instead of wasting your time and money
2. Good Paying Job
The next step towards financial solvency is to have a good and stable income. You need to be able to pay for food, shelter, utilities and transportation at the bare minimum. Its like my son is first learning to float in water even before he can swim. An early start to your career with a good stable income will help a lot in your retirement savings as I will explain later. When you seek employment, look for jobs with skill sets which map across different geographies and industries such as manufacturing, teaching , banking, services, management etc. In this way you won’t be restricted to one company and one location for long time and your skills would always be transferable. When you are just out of the college look for jobs where you will learn and which will enhance your skill sets. In my first 5–6 years at Intel I learnt a lot about semiconductor processes and packaging which is helping in my present job where I am drawing on the experience from my previous job.
3. Have a monthly budget
Please note that income is not wealth. The difference between income and expenses is what is defined as savings which you can use to generate wealth in the long run. While having a good income is important, it is equally important to keep your savings in check. A monthly budget goes a long way to ensure frugality in your life. Please refer to my post
Soumyadipta Basu’s answer to What are some lifestyle changes that save money?
There are many free apps which can help to set up and maintain your monthly budget such as Budgeting Made Easy ,Mint: Money, Bill Pay, Credit Score &amp; Investing, YNAB. Personal finance software to take total control of your money. to name a few. Remember it is always easy to scale up your lifestyle rather than scaling down. So if you start leading a minimalist lifestyle, you can always scale up and afford some luxuries in life once your income tends to go up. When I was a graduate student, our annual income was only $20K which increased to $100K when I started at Intel and my wife went to graduate school and now it is close to $250K with both of us employed. Say you allocate $200 every month on eating out, then taking my income as an example, the fraction of your monthly salary spent on restaurants changes from 12% to 2.4% and then drops to 1% as the income rises. So you see how by keeping the same expense rate for individual items you will increase your savings as your income improves. Now you can use the extra money in savings or in some other expenses which were not part of your budget when your income was lower. This also underscores the point on why we need a good income since everything there after is a % of your salary.
4. Marry your soulmate who shares your vision about personal finances
I feel like this is the most important step in your financial planning. Of course you do not need to be married to be financially successful and you can skip this section if you intend to stay single. If you are married then it is very important that you and your partner are in complete sync about your long term goals as well as spending habits. The largest cause of divorce in North America is the financial strain between couples. If your marriage ends in divorce you will have to split your 401K savings and other assets as determined by the court. When you have a healthy marriage your life is on autopilot and it removes the unnecessary theatrics from life. If your spouse is a stay at home mom or dad tending to your kids, then it saves vital child care costs. At the same time, if your spouse is working full time or even part time it adds to your income bucket. Also, in today’s uncertain economic times, having both spouses working is very beneficial especially if one of them loses their job or plans to take a break. I just cannot stress the importance of an understanding life partner in your financial success.
5. Never get into debt
In the words of Dave Ramsey “ the borrower is slave to the lender”. Hence you should never get into debt and even if you do then you should be intentional in paying off the debt as soon as possible. The interest rate that you accrue on the debt far exceeds any returns on your investment. As long as you have debt you will never be able to generate any sustainable wealth. There can be many kinds of debt such as consumer debt in terms of credit cards, student loan, car loan,unpaid medical bills or even house mortgage. Your house will appreciate in value and it is not possible to cash flow a house of 300K so taking a mortgage is very much prevalent and is least sever of all the debts that I mentioned. Besides your house does appreciate in value over time and you do get some tax benefits on your interest. I will discuss about mortgage later in this answer. For all other loans I understand that we can become default due to different extraneous circumstances in life. However, once you are in a hole it is your responsibility to get out of it. All it needs is some financial discipline and lots of focus and determination. The only benefit of debt is that you need to scale down your expenses and you need to live on less than what you make to pay off your loans. Once you are out of debt and if you continue to live as before then the savings that you make can go a long way to heal your wounds. A great website for reading and getting out of debt is
DEAR DEBT — A blog about breaking up with debt. You can also read about how to prioritize paying off debt by following a debt snowball method as discussed by Dave Ramsey in Dave Ramsey Homepage — daveramsey.com
6. Set up your emergency fund
Once you are out of debt, you need to create an emergency fund equivalent to about 3–6 months of your expenses. Keep this money deposited in a checking/money market account where you will not lose the money. It won’t appreciate in value but will also not depreciate. You should not touch this emergency fund as long as you have a steady income and no unaccounted expenses.
7. Saving for retirement
After having an emergency fund, you need to start setting aside money for retirement different retirement savings account.
Some of the pretax investments are 401K or any other employer offered retirement plans, Health Savings Account (HSA), and any flex account.
For 2016 the max 401K employee contribution is 18000. Decide on how would you like to contribute towards your individual retirement account. Even if you are not planning to max out the contribution, at least contribute enough so that you get the employee match.
If you are enrolled into the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) you can contribute max. of $6500 towards the HSA account. The HSA account grows tax-deferred and can be withdrawn tax-free to pay unreimbursed medical expenses, including your deductible and health costs that aren’t covered by your plan.
In addition to 401K and HSA, one can also contribute tax free money towards a flex account which can be used for medical expenses as well as for paying child care costs. The goal of maximizing pretax contributions is to reduce the amount of taxes I need to pay to the Federal government.
Within 401K you can select a pretax contribution or a Roth 401K or even a combination of both.
It is always a good idea to have a Roth 410K over a pretax 401K especially if you are early in your career. When you are in your mid 30s, your retirement contributions can growth tax free for a long time, at least for another 25 years. Over such a long period of time the growth of your investments far exceeds the original investment. To give an example, if you max. out your 401 K contribution of 18000$, over a period of 25 years at 8% annual return the money grows to 1.44 million dollars, while the total contribution during that time was $450000. Now think of two scenarios at age 60:
All contribution was pretax: Your contribution of $450K retirement savings out of about $1.55 million is tax free but you are taxed on the actual growth of around $1.1 million. At the tax rate of 30% you will pay a tax of $330K on the $1 million growth. So your final retirement savings would be $1.22 million.
All contribution was Roth 401K: Your growth is tax free and the only tax paid is upfront on the annual contributions, you would have paid a tax of about $200K.
Therefore between the two types of contribution you end up saving around $130K in the later case. Roth 401K is definitely a better option. However there are two caveats of making 100% Roth 401 contributions:
Many companies do not offer Roth 401K option
In some situations it is better to do a pretax contribution to reduce the tax rate in which case doing a traditional 401k might be better than a 100% Roth 401K.
I think it is best to evenly split between Roth and pre tax contributions
8. Invest your savings
With interest rates being near zero if you do not invest your savings then you will never be able to optimize your savings. In fact with an average inflation rate of 3.2% over the past 30 years, without any investments your savings will lose value over time. Lets look at some investment options:
Fund your Roth IRA account outside of your 401K to the maximum limit of $11K ($5.5K for each of you and your spouse) if you are under 50 years and $13K ($6.5K for each of you and your spouse). However your income needs to be less than the income limit capped by IRS. Please refer to Internal Revenue Service for Roth IRA contribution limits
Once you have kids open a 529 savings plan for their college education and keep it well funded. The annual limit is $10K, but if your kid goes to college at age of 18 then you should have $445K in college savings fund if you were to max out college contributions every year.
If you have money still left after these contributions then invest your savings in the stock market either in shares or good growth mutual funds or even bonds with a proven track record. However, with stock markets, one needs to be patient. It is not the place for a feeble heart or impatient people. If you stay invested for a long time (at least for a period of 10 -15 years), there are many funds which can double your money.
9. Own a home over renting
It is undisputed that owning a home has long term benefits over renting for the following reasons
Rent will increase over time whereas once you are locked into a mortgage rate for a certain time period your monthly payment is fixed.
Rent is sunk cost where as for mortgage you will get a tax deduction on the interest paid.
For most of the metro areas you can own a large property for the same price at which you rent an apartment.
Typically houses will go up in value if you are willing to ride the ups and downs of real estate world. I recently made 25% profit on the sale of house within 3.5 years of purchasing.
Any real estate gains are not taxed as compared to capital gains tax levied on stock market investments.
Once your house is completely paid for, you can rent out the property with the rent being your extra income. Thus a 300K paid off house can generate monthly 1500$ in rent which translates to a 6% income at the end of the year. At the same time your house price could have appreciated by another 5% in that one year. In other words, you got a 6% dividend on an investment which itself grew by 5%. Needless to say the effect of compounding will stand you in good stead if you own a house.
Typical house mortgages are for 15 years or 30 years, the difference being that in the former your rate of interest is lower but principal is higher. The opposite is true for a 30 year mortgage. Obviously a 15 year mortgage has a higher dent on your take home pay but you will save a lot of money in taxes. A common rule of thumb is to put atleast a 20% down payment at the time of home purchase to avoid being hit by what is called monthly mortgage insurance. In other words it is an insurance you pay to the lender against a short sale or a foreclosure of the property. A middle ground between 15 and 30 years of mortgage is to take out a 30 year mortgage but keep making extra payments as if it were a 15 year mortgage and pay off the house way early.
10. Be Generous
Last but not the least be generous once you have reached your financial goals. When you are generous it makes your life happier and it is not surprising that billionaires like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg are the most generous people. We should remember that we came to this world empty handed and will leave empty handed. We are the guardian of GOD’s possession in the form of wealth and it is our moral responsibility to take care of the needy as HE would have wanted us to do.",finance,1475866674
personalfinance,[Debt] Somebody help me see the bright side of all this.,"**I'm 27**, and I'm wondering if I can get some long-term advice and a critique of my current approach. I've got a lot on my plate, but please be honest.

Backstory:
**College dropout** with 2 years remaining on an electrical engineering degree from a state university, **48k student loan** debt as of now, at an averaged **7.2%** interest rate - current payment plan has me paying **$400/mo**

Car is underwater by about 6k. Owe 12k - current payment is **250/mo**.

Credit card debt: **30k** at 0% until August 2017, then 19% thereafter. Credit score currently 735.

House is paid for, and work is within walking distance, but I can't sell the car because the nearest grocer is 7mi away. Currently living/working in a desolate area of Texas.

Current income is about **34k after taxes**, work averages 70hr weeks. 

No health care.

No investments/retirement.

Expenses average **600/mo**

No E-Fund. All remaining income is going to credit card debt.

I would vastly prefer to just pay everything off and have a ""late"" start on life. I'd like to manage my debt, finish my degree, get a real job, then go from there. Here's my issue.

In July I am going in for major surgery (already paid for) with a bed/wheelchair recovery of at least 6 months. I am trying to pay off as much debt as I can because I feel I'll need 12-15k for aftercare expenses.

At this point, I'm feeling like just declaring bankruptcy and stocking paychecks might just be a better way. Am I completely wrong? Are there any options I don't know about?",finance,1475867984
personalfinance,"Today, I bought back my freedom.","Hello Reddit this is a long one but I wanted to share. For anyone feeling shitty about their debt situation, know that there is a way out in time. 

In the last 24 hours I have made the most significant changes to my life, in line with my view of 2016 being 'the year of less'. Yesterday I gave notice to quit my current job on the December 31st and today I cleared £10,000 of personal debt.

Dear things holding me back...

FUCK YOU.

While we all experience a dopamine hit when making a new purchase, nothing can compare with the feeling of knowing that everything you own, you actually own. Over the years I have been guilty of wanting the 'best camera' or stretching my budget to get a BMW which I didn't even drive. Is the stress associated with managing all the repayments and being at the mercy of interest rates really worth it?

I have come to the conclusion it really isn't.

While currently I have nothing more than an iPhone to write this on, I am much happier. While it would be great to type this on a new Macbook, wouldn't the opportunity to travel be more interesting? 

Everyone has different financial circumstances and responsibilities but I encourage you all to consider how much better your lives could be without the burden of debt.

personalfinance,Pay off debt or continue to pay off on schedule?,"Here's my situation:

My wife and I currently have about $9000 in debt, not including the mortgage. We are close to paying off some, and if we continue to pay on schedule, all will be paid off by 2018. We do have savings totaling about $46k which could be made available immediately (not tied up in CDs or anything, just sitting in low interest-earning savings/checking accounts. 

Here's the breakdown by type, monthly payment, total left, interest rate, and payoff date.

1. Car loan, $232/m, $1392 total @ 3%, April 2017

2. Wife student loan, $100/m, $1500 total @ 4%, payoff January 2018

3. Student loan, $100/m, $1600 total @ 4%, payoff Feb 2018

4. Student loan, $180/m, $4545 total ($1289.90 @ .4%, $3255.43 @ 4.55%), payoff November 2018

Advice on whether to payoff all now, payoff some now, or continue to pay on schedule appreciated. If it's all paid off, that will be an extra $612/month saved, but $9k seems like a big hit to take. We're also looking to purchase a new car soon and possibly move in the next 2-3 years, so anything that reduces our savings seems to put those further out of reach.

personalfinance,200k student loan debt and 75k/yr salary - What is My Best Payment Option and Housing Choice,"I have 85k in Private Loans from Wells Fargo at variable interest rate which is 7.5%. From reading this thread obviously these loans are the problem. I contacted Wells Fargo and payments would be 828/month for 15 years right now. 


I have 113 in federal loans. I plan on doing a IBR/PAYE which will lower my payments to around 400/ month. 

So total loan payments per month = 1200. 

My after tax income is 4600/month. But the law firm I work for gives a big jump from year 1 to 2. Barring a major fuck up, my 2018 salary will be 100k. However, after about 5 years my salary will stall out at around 112-115k until I make partner or make some other kind of move. 

My only expenses are car payment + insurance together which is 350/month and Invisalign at 189/month. 


I am planning my financial strategy for moving out of my parents house and this is where I am looking for input on what the best option for me is. 

I want to buy instead of renting, and I am looking at places between 170 and 190. 

Per Month Expenses with Mortgage 

Loans = 1,228
Potential Mortgage (taxes/pmi/hoa) = 1300
Car + Gas + Insurance = 400
Invisalign = 189

total = 3,117

Left over = 1,483



This seems REALLY tight - and I am wondering if buying a condo is really the best option? One caveat is I am looking at two bedrooms so I would get a room mate to help w the mortgage ( but I found a 1BR I am in love with and I also don't want to plan to much on that roomie income - it could be hard to find one). 

I've been living at home for so long, I don't even know if 1500 a month after all necessary expenses is alot or a little?  

Wells Fargo offers modification and consolidation programs I could do. I could modify or otherwise consolidate and get my monthly payment on my private loans down to 600/month so I had a more comfortable budget. 

Under this scenario I am left with 1700 /month after expenses  

The idea then being when I break into six figures I can delegate more of my income to paying off the private loans? 

I just don't know, like if my plan to buy a place is smart. 200k is so much debt. Part of me wonders whether I should take a more aggressive approach and find a shitty apartment and throw everything I have at the private loans and THEN buy a place.

personalfinance,"Family inherited considerable assets &amp; accounts, wants to help improve my situation...but how?","Here's the situation: 

My mother recently inherited a large amount of money, both liquid and in concrete assets.  These assets are:

* ~800k in the bank
1. Interest in a commercial property that nets 1500/m 
* Full ownership of a 810k condominium (her primary residence) 
* Half ownership in a second condo valued at $790k.  
* An assortment of smaller account and things totaling another ~200k.

Last week, with the finalization of the estate and the final transfer to her, she immediately called me and said that she wants to do whatever she can do to improve my financial outlook.  I'm very hesitant to take money from her, as she's in her late 60s and doesn't have any retirement to speak of aside from this inheritance.  She's adamant that we need to do something, however, so I'm looking for how to make the biggest bang for the smallest buck.

Here's me:

* 35yo, $4100/m income after tax
* Core expenses of $3200/m including rent, food, transport etc 
* No credit card debt
* Student loan debt of ~$31k
* Savings of ~$15k 
* Credit rating of ""garbage"" from missing payments on SLs

She's suggested paying off the 8k portion of my student loan that charges 8% (the highest interest rate of the lot), but I'm thinking more along the lines of maybe we can leverage her holdings to boost my credit rating?  I've heard that joint accounts can do this?

Ideally what I would like it to find a strategy where we can use her ""rich person"" access to boost my standings without costing her anything, but I know that's a difficult ask.  Neither of us has ever had more than subsistence money before, so I'm pruning the sidebar but couldn't find anything about this in particular.

personalfinance,Advice please for starting real estate business.,"Hello All -
I am a reasonably solvent individual with a great job (130K/yr and an 11% pension), about 100K in retirement, about 25k liquid assets, and a house my dad lives in worth about 80K.
I have about 110k in student loans at interest rates &lt; 3.5%.

I bought a ""fixer upper"" house a couple of years ago and have been steadily working on it. I *think* I probably have about 100K equity in it after all the work, work was paid for in cash. (I do have the original mortgage of 200K but house now worth about 300K).

Long story short - I want to start working half time and flipping houses the other half. (I could get half pay for half time, but no pension). Would appreciate any advice, specifically, will a bank give me a business loan to buy another house and materials to fix it? 

I am getting my real estate license right now, and I think the fact that I added 100k in value to my house should count for something to a bank, do you think so? I cannot write a business plan, but can get someone to do it for me.

Less than 25 years old and it's the fourth largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in the United States.

## Recent financials 

The topline's been flat for a few years, but in the current financial environment, what financial services firm has had a good top-line? As a result, the EPS line's not been exciting either. Though at least we've the crutch of the Divie to hold onto :)

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $23bn | $22bn | $22bn | $21bn | $16bn|
|EPS | $7.07 | $7.59 | $6.89 | $6.11 | $6.76|
|DPS | $1.50 | $1.20 | $0.95 | $0.20 | $0.20|


If you are wondering which unit is the driver... well it's Cards.

|2015|Cards|Consumer|Commercial|Other|Total|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Net income | $2,354m | $1,034m | $570m | $54m | $4,012m|
|% | 59% | 26% | 14% | 1% | n/a|

## Competition

It's the usual suspects when it comes to competition. With the Cards business up against the Visa/Mastercards of other banks, and then there is Amex and Discovery. The Consumer and Commercial units are chasing deposits and offering loans in competition with every other bank or finance brand. 

Looking at returns on equity, they are at the bottom of the class... alongside poor old Citi :(

|Companies|Latest Sales|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|
Capital One Financial Corp. | $21,636M  | 8%
American Express Company | $34,567M  | 26%
Citigroup Inc | $57,601M |  7%

Wells Fargo &amp; Co | $51,206M  | 12%

# Wall Street thinks?
The professionals on Wall Street have a $79.11 for Capital One Financial Corp. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 8% to their target.

# Valuation

Wow are the valuations bunched. ~10x earnings, 2% yield and low single digit growth. Feels like I'm looking at Utilities or Telecom stocks. ;)

# Dividends
Capital One Financial Corp. is forecast to pay a dividend of $1.60 per share which compares to a forecast EPS of $7.17. So plenty of room there to increase the payout. Though they've a share buyback program too. 

They are proud to point out that $100 in COF have growth to $180 from 2010 to 2015. When the S&amp;P only grow to $163, and the rest of Finance to $150.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 13% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -4%. That's against a backdrop on net interest income off 1% and net income off 4% in the last 6 months.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they said

&gt; Compared to 2015, we still expect some improvement in our full year 2016 efficiency ratio, with continuing improvement in 2017.

They also pointed out that the Fed has no objections to an addition $2.5bn buyback. So they aren't one of finance's bad boys. Phew.

So, am I interested? Yes... a little. The valuation is cheap, the management's been buying up loan books, and other assets. Consolidating the sector. They've not been dragged through the mud by Congress. 

But what can drive the growth? Can they increase their returns? I wonder, just wonder if there's better value in some of the smaller more specialist financial services companies.

Anyone?

With the finish line in sight, that figure is super scary to me. The interest rates are all over the place. Some are 4%, some are 7%. I got an email today stating my current principal balance was 10k and outstanding interest was 3.3k. I don't even know what this means but it's stressful to see those numbers!

I've worked a part time job during school for the past few years, about 20 hours a week, but I honestly haven't saved much money, I just have been using it as it comes. I've got about 4k in the bank right now. I still live with my parents so I guess I have that going for me. I did recently decide to take out a lease on a new car over the summer, 10k/3yr and I'm paying 250 a month out of my own pocket for that right now. 

I'm an only child and my parents never finished highschool. They do well for themselves we are probably upper middle class. I don't know why when I've mentioned my debt amount they've seemed a bit laissez-faire about it. Like I got a 'That's a lot' comment, but I expect more of a 'Holy shit what the fuck' kind of comment...the situation is just severely stressing me out.",finance,1475892581
personalfinance,"I can afford 20%, but should I put down less?","I am fortunate enough to have many options with my life. My wife and I (26,27) aren't exactly sure where we want to live forever. We are currently renting in SoCal and I love it here, but other places like Oregon aren't off limits. 
So we met with a mortgage adviser today, and he recommended buying a house near the beach and putting only 3.5% down. It will appreciate in value, and the interest rates could be lower making up for the mortgage insurance I would have to pay for not putting down 20%. This would allow us to maintain my liquid cash, and possibly buy another house sooner than I would be able to had I put 20% down on the first house.
His logic was this is the best way to own property, which will likely appreciate in value, and I can rent it out to cover the mortgage, and 30 years from now I'll have an extra property I can rent out for passive income, plus the equity in the house. It also helps with the ""problem"" of not knowing if we do want to live here forever. On the other hand, everyone has told me lately to put 20% down if you can to avoid the unnecessary insurance costs.
Any advice is appreciated. Thanks",finance,1475893014

I major in Philosophy and Film(two separate degrees). I currently work and go to school. I currently have no college debt but I owe about 12000 on a car. I have 300 dollars in my bank account. I have two part-time jobs one that pays 11/hr and another that pays 15/hr. The 11/hr is a set schedule, while the 15/hr fluctuates depending on my availability. I make music and get additional money from recording people not much usually ranging from 25-50 dollars. I also take photos on the side sometimes. I'm 21 and I have been putting a portion of my check into an IRA account. Now that I've given some background I have alot of questions. 

 I know that with college loans you can pay sally may what you want and not have to worry about the high interest rates you face with banks.So I'm thinking of taking out money for investments.

personalfinance,Refinancing a refinance within the same year.,"howdy all,

so I recently opened a consolidation loan for my student loans. I had three with three different interest rates and over the past few years it fluctuated and some were sold off and what not and was all just a cluster. 

My answer was to do the consolidation loan and overall, it worked. Decent fixed rate, lower monthly payment and didn't extend the terms of my loan by much (like 8 months). 

Well the loan is through Wells Fargo and in light of recent news, I don't really want to stay with them. If they embezzled money I would be more understanding than straight up making up accounts and essentially taking money from customers.

this loan was opened maybe 6 months ago though. My credit is still in good standing. is it worth opening a new loan to get away from them or should I just deal with it? 

TL;DR do I refinance loans from Wells Fargo that I just financed to them a few months ago.",finance,1475941369
personalfinance,Pay off or save and pay monthly?,"Sorry if this (or something similar) has been posted before, but I didn't see it in the FAQs or in recent post history...




Currently my student loan situation is less than ideal. I'm 26 years old and I make 3 loan payments a month:

#1:
* $365/month to Company #1
* This loan is broken down into the 5 following groups:
    * Group A: Principcal balance = $5,335, Interest Rate = 6.8%
    * Group B: Principcal balance = $1,179, Interest Rate = 6%
    * Group C: Principcal balance = $2,712, Interest Rate = 5.6%
    * Group D: Principcal balance = $1,459, Interest Rate = 4.5%
    * Group E: Principcal balance = $3,533, Interest Rate = 3.4%
* Current balance of total loan = $14,230
* For this loan, I have been paying between $266 and $365 total monthly since Jan 2013 (amount increasing over time to try to pay loans off more quickly). I always pay more for the higher interest groups than the lower.
* Since Jan 2013, this loan has reduced $9,619. 

#2: 
* $369/month to Company #2
    *  I used to pay ~$400 monthly at 7.25%, but two months ago, I began using auto-debit since it reduced my interest rate to 7% and this is the amount it automatically takes.
* Unfortunately, this loan is not broken down into groups, and I make one lump payment monthly.
* Principcal balance on this loan is $34,082 and I have been paying since Dec 2012.
* Since Dec 2012, this loan has reduced $5,867. 

#3:
* $296/month to parents for loans in their name.
* Not looking to make any changes to this payment currently.



Basically, I am wondering if it would make sense to pay off Loan #1 and continue on with #2 and #3? I currently have abuot $36K in savings.

For someone who has this many loans and has been paying for years, I admittedly don't understand the process as much as I should. I'm just looking for the way to pay this off most quickly while not depleting my savings entirely.

stocks,Earnings Season has arrived! Get ready for the trading week of October 10th!,"Get ready for the next round of earnings season r/stocks! Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the new trading week ahead! :-)

# **WEEK AHEAD: Politics, earnings and other issues heating up for markets next week** - *[(CNBC.com)](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/07/politics-earnings-and-other-issues-heating-up-for-markets-next-week.html)*

*****
&gt; ### Investors will have a lot to digest in the week ahead, ranging from politics to earnings to events in Europe.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""Given the elections, that will obviously take a lot of the headlines in the next few weeks. … The election will put a lot of volatility in the market,"" said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer, equities, at Charles Schwab Investment Management.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Right at the start to the week, traders will watch Sunday night's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This second debate between the two candidates is scheduled for 9 p.m., ET, at Washington University in St. Louis and will take the form of a town meeting.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""I don't believe a Clinton win is completely priced into the markets,"" said Brian Muench, vice president of investment management at Allianz Investment Management. He expects a pullback in stocks by the end of the year, and polls showing a tighter race between the two candidates could contribute to the decline. 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The potential number of market-moving events only heats up as the week progresses. 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Earnings season unofficially kicks off Tuesday with Alcoa's quarterly results, and the meeting minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's September meeting are due Wednesday. New York Fed President Bill Dudley is also scheduled to speak that day.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The climax comes Friday with earnings from major banks Citigroup,JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""For me, the real driver for markets the end of this year should really be third-quarter earnings,"" said Chris Wright, ultra high net worth investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. ""We'd be looking for quite strong earnings growth in the third quarter given we've got a fairly benign third quarter.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### Retail sales are due for release on the same day, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak that afternoon on ""Macroeconomic research after the crisis.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""We'll be watching consumer data next week just to confirm we think the consumer is in a good position here,"" said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""Earnings and the retail sales and any Fed speakers will be closely watched as to how they digest (Friday's jobs) release,"" he said.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The September nonfarm payrolls report showed creation of 156,000 for the month, below expectations, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent. Average hourly wages rose 6 cents to an annualized rate of 2.6 percent.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### U.S. stocks closed slightly lower Friday after the jobs report and snapped a three-week win streak. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week at 2,153.74, weighed by a 5.3 percent decline in the REITs sector.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### ""While we're still two jobs reports away from the Fed meeting, there probably could have been some political implications for this,"" said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management. But the data ""wasn't strong enough to crow about if you're a Democrat, and it wasn't weak enough to bad mouth if you're a Republican. It won't have a lot of effect on Fed expectations."" 
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ### The data reduced already low expectations for a November rate hike and added to general expectations the Fed will raise rates in December.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Regardless of election outcome, S&amp;P 500 advances 72.2% of the time**
&gt; For all the heated discussion, debate, worrying, slicing and dicing of numbers, the actual presidential election outcome appears to have little bearing on S&amp;P 500 performance in November and December. Since 1944 election-year Novembers have been up 55.6% of the time with an average gain of 0.6% and election-year Decembers have been up 83.3% of the time with an average 1.4% advance. The two-month combo of November and December is collectively up 72.2% of the time with an average gain of 2.0%. Regardless who wins, history still favors a typical yearend rally.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: S&amp;P 500 deviates from incumbent party victory pattern""**
&gt;With just two trading days in the record books, the fourth quarter of 2016 is off to a bumpy start. As of today’s close S&amp;P 500 is down 0.82% and appears to be casting its vote early, against the incumbent party’s candidate Hillary Clinton. Perhaps it is voting for Republican candidate Donald Trump or maybe for Gary Johnson of the Libertarian party. Admittedly it is too early in October to make such a call however; it is notable that S&amp;P 500 has already deviated from its typical path in October compared to past incumbent party victories.

###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/03507a11cd45ad760cc5aff6ed7013ab/tumblr_inline_oejm9btdi51spdppr_500.jpg))

&gt; In the above chart, S&amp;P 500 performance in October is plotted for “All Years,” “Election Years,” “Incumbent Victories,” “Incumbent Party Defeats” and “2016.” Should S&amp;P 500 continue to track the Incumbent Party Defeat pattern, weakness is likely to persist until near the end of October before a modest rally ensues, but still fails to return to positive territory.

personalfinance,Question about what to do with my current vehicle in light of new job.,"So here's the story quick and dirty. I've been offered and accepted a job that I can't complain to much about as it's increased my annual salary almost 17k. The issue is that not even imagining that I was going to leave my current employer (Federal position) I recently bought a truck (Tacoma) this past April. I love it and have no complaints it's allowed me to do a lot of DIY stuff around the house and avoid a bunch of delivery fees. The catch with this position is that it's a 120-130 mile daily commute (mostly highway) depending upon my route. My current daily commute depending on which campus i am working out of is either 18 miles daily or 60miles daily. Now the commute is no issue I've had just as long before. As you can guess though I'm wondering about the wisdom of having a pickup in this situation. I've done the math and basically my fuel costs are going to go from about an average of 100 dollars a month to 350 dollars a month so a little over 3000 a year.  Now I'm wondering if I should try to find a ""beater"" car for a couple thousand, just stick with the truck (it's a Tacoma I'm not to worried about the mileage), or sell the truck for at least what's left of the loan ( which should be no issue as again it's a Tacoma and I got a fair deal) and look into something with much better mileage and more of a commuter car. The monthly take home increase will probably be somewhere around 700 dollars give or take a couple of twenty dollar bills. I'm not sure what route to take here. I think I included all of the relevant info. Thanks in advance for any help with this issue.",finance,1475961673

personalfinance,"Upside down in my car loan, looking for the best option","I bought a used 2012 Chevy Cruze (currently has 52,000 miles on it) in November of 2013 to replace my paid off Ford Focus that was on it's last legs. Last legs as in it broke down as I drove into the dealership. I bought my previous car by cash, so this was my first experience having to finance anything. Young, naive, and basically desperate, the salesman saw me coming from a mile away and needless to say I got had. Currently I still owe about $10,000 on it, paying about $265 a month (with a pretty decent interest rate). We aren't exactly struggling financially, but $265 dollars a month isn't a meager sum to our household. 

I no longer commute; my job is about 8 miles away from my home and we use my wife's car to drive anywhere else (I hate driving). I put roughly 80 miles on my car per week, so I now feel like it's pointless for me to have this car and continue spending $265 dollars a month to barely drive it. My wife and I work overlapping hours in addition to me occasionally working erratic schedules so us sharing a car isn't really an option. I tried cycling to work for a while, but the weather where I live just gets too hot for this to be a functional option for me either. I should add that my wife does commute about 30 miles to work each way and drives a 2014 Kia Soul that we spend about $250 a month for. 

Recently over dinner my wife suggested I get rid of my car and get a motorcycle instead. I've never ridden one and naturally I like this idea, in fact I like it a lot. I feel like this would be a reckless decision just by the nature of it but it does seem like a decent option.

personalfinance,Buying a condo postgrad vs. renting an apartment,"I'll be graduating out of college in the Bay Area in about half a year. I have a full-time offer at a place in Chicago and will be moving there soon after graduation. 

While I'm looking for places to rent in the central Chicago area, my parents are telling me to instead just buy a house or condo since the housing market there is ridiculously cheap and stable, and will be much cheaper than renting. On top of the relocation package that my company is providing, my parents will be willing to comp me up to between $100,000 and $150,000 for their portion plus relocation, or 30-40% down payment on the new condo depending on the one I choose. I browsed around Zillow and found that $300,000 can get a very decent place (from studio/1ba to 2bd/2ba) for me (and potentially my girlfriend).

So, please bear with me as I toss a bunch of numbers below. I'm pinging this sub to make sure my math checks out, or if there are any other costs I've forgotten. Another important note is that I plan to keep the condo for 2-4 years, after which I'll resell. So my monthly principal and interest is taken from what I'll be paying the first few years living there (I know they change linearly over the loan term).

Condo: $300,000

Downpayment: $100,000 (33%)

Loan term: 15-year fixed

Interest rate: 2.7%

Mortgage (monthly): $1,352

Principal (monthly): about $913

Interest (monthly): about $439

HOA (monthly): about $300

Assuming that I plan to **resell the place in exactly two years**, I will have paid $(1,352+300)*24 = $39,648 in mortgage and HOA payments. Using this [mortgage calculator](https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/amortization) I see that in two years I'll have paid up $22,230 in principal, with a remaining balance of $177,770.

Now assuming a constant housing market and I can resell the place for $295,000+ (which seems pretty likely given the price history of a lot of these condos), I'll be able to pocket $295,000 - $177,770 = $117,230 after paying back the remainder of the balance. And assuming I pay back my parents a conservative loan of $100,000 no interest, that's an estimate of $17,230 in my pocket. Of course I haven't deducted the $39,648 monthly mortgage and HOA fees, so $17,230 - $39,648 = -$22,418. And paying my agent 5% to sell my place is an extra $15,000 out of my pocket, for -$22,418 - $15,000 = -$37,418. At the same time, my parents tell me that I'll be able to collect some ~30% back from the monthly interest paid out, so 0.3x$439x24 = $3,160.80, for -$37,418 + $3,160.80 = **-$34,257.20**, which translates to about  $34,257.20 / 24 = $1,427.38 out of my pocket monthly for two years.

Browsing apartments for rent in the same area show about an average of $1.7k/mo. Renting over two years would then cost me $1,700x24 = **$40,800.**

The reason my parents want me to buy a house is not only because it's cheaper, but also something to do with helping my credit and something to do with claiming a tax deductible. All in all, I think they have a pretty sound plan. What do you think? Thanks in advance.",finance,1475973629

personalfinance,Dealing with Chase Returned Item Fee,"Alright, so might be a pretty basic question, but I haven't seen it answered anywhere. I have a Chase checking and savings account, as well as an Ally savings account. I rarely use my Chase savings for anything as the Ally account gives a better interest rate.

I was trying to transfer $500 from my Chase checking account to Ally savings, and started the transfer from my Ally account. However, I screwed up and selected my Chase savings account instead, which only had $300 in it. After a few days, I noticed the money still wasn't transferred, and that I received a $34 Returned Item Fee from Chase. Blah.

Now what? Should I just call up Chase and politely ask to remove the fee? Is there anything specific I should say? I know I was stupid and selected the wrong account to transfer from, but a $34 fee for a simple mistake like this seems a bit much.

Also, do you think I should close my Chase savings account and just keep the checking account active? I barely use the savings account anyway.",finance,1475980281

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin price should ""theoretically"" drop in value come December, but Increase come 2017. Lets talk Fed Rates, Gold, BRIC, and China.","So I swing trade equities on a regular bases, and what most people don't know is that the US is in an economic bubble we just don't know when shit is going to come crashing, a lot of the things we are seeing now has never happened and is unpredictable. It is so bad that the current Market has been swinging crazy due to Clinton vs Trump, Fed meetings, and the price of Gold.

I don't want to dig too deep into economics but a long time ago the US moved away from USD being backed by Gold to being backed by the US Government. Giving the Federal reserve more power (maybe to much power). Currently the Fed loans out money to banks at 0% to 0.25%. This of course creates inflation.

At the same time the US’s #1 Export is the US dollar. The USD is the Global Reserve currency. This means that foreign governments and international companies hold large amounts of it to buy stuff like gold and oil (hence the term petrodollar).

Hence the raising of rates will make a stronger dollar but this affects the world economy and is both good and bad. China themselves holds $1 Trillion+ in USD so this is clearly good for them (is it? keep reading) At the same time it helps alleviate the uncertainty we have in the market right now.

But how does this all relate to Bitcoin? Well if the general consensus is that the price of Bitcoin has increased due to Chinese buying due to seeking a ""safe"" place to store value vs the yuan then wont this change in the coming months? 

China ontop of Bitcoin has been buying a lot of gold. Their currency is backed by it. So are the other BRIC nations who are gaining track on being a global currency.  

Now putting this all together there is a relationship between Gold, the USD and potentially Bitcoin. Theoretically due to USD inflation and global market uncertainty people will flock to Gold (which has been true for the past 6 months). As there have been more and more Fed meetings it is clear that rates wont be raised until Obama is out of office, and they will be coming in December. Investors have taken notice of this and gold has dropped $50-$100 per oz over a week as they feel the USD will have more  relative value.

China during this period of has been on a national vacation. I expect chinese investors to come out of Bitcoin and to buy up this ""cheap gold"" and continue to drive the price of gold all the way up till December assuming we can trust the Federal reserve. (Edit: This part is all theoretical and has no real data analysis, it is equally likely that the price of Bitcoin will jump come the next 1 to 2 weeks. In fact I just checked BTC price and it jumped recently)

Going into 2017 the USD should have more value as rates increase. This will pop the equity bubble depending on how extreme the rates. Putting us in a recession. Hopefully American Investors are smart enough to buy BTC. This rate increase will also in turn devalue the Yuan long term and I expect Chinese investors to continue to buy more Bitcoin.

Although not beating my 51% returns (humble brag) YTD Bitcoin's YTD is 41.5% which is extremely good compared to the every hedgefund, mutual fund, bond, s&amp;p500, etc out. I already own BTC from the $200 days but personally will be exiting the US market and will be buying BTC. I just hope my ACH transfers are fast enough.",cryptocurrency,1475984918

My employer offers a 403b plan where the money goes into Fidelity investments / TIAA. It's on a voluntary basis and is pre-taxed. They mentioned that in the future, you can take out loans from this account and pay the account back with interest (essentially paying yourself back). 

I plan on attending medical school in about 3 years or so and will be taking out lots of loans. I'm wondering if it's a good idea for me to put in a part of my salary into this account (and take out loans from it in the future) or just save it up in a normal savings account. 

The thing is, my salary currently is very low, so if I were to put in any money into this account, it would only be about $300 / year. 

My questions:
1.) If I choose to invest in a 403b and take out loans from it in the future, are there any things I should be cognizant of? They didn't tell us how high the interest rate was, but would this still be a good idea? 

2.) If the 403b is a good choice, how much of my salary should I put in it? 

3.) Should I just forego the 403b and stick all my unused money in a savings account?

So to start things off, if I have made any mistakes or broken any rules with this post please let me know and I will correct asap. I read the rules but again, if I missed something, I'll happily correct.

So in an effort to at least try to keep this short, I've summarized everything below:

•	Single and employed at my current job for 3 and half years now. Making just over $50,000 a year salary.

•	Last of my student loans will be paid off as of this Friday leaving me with no loan debt, and no credit card debt. The only debt I will have left is medical bills from numerous ER visits in the last six years which equals to about $6000. I do plan to pay that off but I’m taking my time with it. 

•	Question 1: Should I close my original credit card? Just paid off the credit card I’ve had since I was 19. I’m considering closing it because it’s through Bank of America, not a fan of them at this point and my interest rate is at 24% which is ridiculous. The card has a $6000 credit line that I used in large part for my college tuition and then after college poor financial choices (which I’ve since learned from). But I’ve paid off the card twice now at this point and think I might be better off closing it. I recently opened a new credit line through Chase that has a better interest rate (14%) and I keep that paid off with less than $100 spent a month on it anyway. So why not close the old card? My current credit score is sitting at 800, would closing it damage that significantly or at all?

•	Question 2: Current lease with my roommate for our apartment is up in April. Want to move closer to work so I’m not driving on the tollway every day to get there. Trying to decide if I should rent an apartment on my own out in that area which is a considerably more expensive area but also much nicer than the area I live now, rent a house which would be slightly more expensive, or reach a whole new level an buy a house. I’m leery about buying because I know I’m also taking on the responsibility of everything about the house too which I won’t have if I rent. But I also like the idea of being able to do/change whatever I want to the house. I also like the idea of having something that is truly mine to come back to if I decide to try and travel for extended periods of time like I would like to do. But I only make just over $50,000 a year. At most I think I could save up $7500 between now and April, minimum $5000. Is that enough to even bother trying to looking at buying? Plus that would be the extent of my savings at that point. Or should I pay the higher rent that is still in my budget and focus on my savings?

•	Question 3: Was going to ask about how to even start looking saving for retirement but I realize there is a whole section on that linked in the sidebar that I’ll read first. If nothing else, I guess I just want to ask how normal it is to feel completely lost/unprepared when trying to figure out what to do with IRAs/401(k)s/stocks/investments, etc. when one is already 30 years old. I’ve spent so much of the last decade focusing on school, getting a job and then paying off all of my debt from said school that I feel like I’m just starting to wake up and look around. I don’t want to waste this next decade but I also don’t want to lose any opportunity to save/prepare either. So how do you figure out how to balance that?

Conslidating: She is pretty set on consolidating, if nothing else just to get them all in one place. Do the pros outweigh the cons financially? Do the Parent Plus loans get consolidated as well? Are there loans we should target before consolidating?   

Not Consolidating: If consolidating doesn't make financial sense... Should we make minimums and pay extra to the Parent Plus loans (highest interest rate)? Should we pay minimums and pay off the Graduate Plus (highest interest rate in her name)?

They left me with a book of marketing strategies that would complement my endeavor. A few months prior during the spring of 2014 I hired a contractor to develop my first business product which was an app/website and basically the one that I had already fleshed out on paper. I met this individual through my business mentor in that program I was in and figured that we'd help each other in that I was an aspiring CEO in need of a developer and he was a...so called developer in need of consistent work. 

           Some months pass. It's summer 2014. I supplied the dev with all manners of logos for the app store, a down payment and consistent monthly maintences fees and from what I could tell there was only minimal progress made. However, due to my (at the time) limited knowledge on the difference in capabilities of wordpress based projects versus coding based projects and how much one individual could accomplish in 12 months using either idk. I was desperate at the time. Desperate and unlearned in computer science. 12 months passed, and the project looked exactly as it did in the first month. I was officially fed up. I tried to contact the developer and he'd deleted his facebook, flagship website and gmail accounts. And to make matters worse I didn't have the source code or anyway to access this projects at it's root. 

          The project was however still online. It's 2015 now, I had left the group too stressed out and ashamed of my ignorance to face my mentor at New Generation Venture or my counselor the director of the SBTDC. So I kept developing asthetics for t shirts and merchandise. Shark Tank executives came to town Fall 2015 and I was in line. It was a great experience meeting up with all of the creative hopefuls. The executive that interviewed me wouldn't have me with out a working prototype. All I need now is a working prototype and then the doors for investments and whatnot will be more easily accessible to me. All is not lost. 

          So I've learned a few programming languages by now. 50% of the way through my course material until I'm fully armed as a Full Stack developer myself. I'm a manufacturing tech these days. My employer has recently hired a new president. There is a fair amount of change that has happened since he's taken office. One of the most noticeable being that there are loads of contests going on lately. From designing new company anniversary logo merchandise to product innovation / invention contests. I opted out of both of those thinking that I my project was too ambitious and unrelated to my employers industry. Then I got bored at work one day. I took the back of a sku card and rifled out a business plan outline for a new project. 

         Some time passed and someone got injured at my place in employment. I was chosen to represent my department in the briefing with the ""higher ups"" in the company along with other department representatives. So naturally after business is taken care of I start to mingle with the general managers about an idea I was toying with to redesign a work process. The work process of Human Resources to be exact and on a national and eventually global scale and I conveyed this idea as concise as possible. 

        From there I was told that they would introduce this idea at the next conference call so there was a few months of silence. Then I was approached by one of the aforementioned individuals, who relayed to me that my idea ""killed it"" at the quarterly conference meeting and they'd like to hear more about it before the day is out. So I was asked to take a ""Presidential Suggestion"" form from the front entrance / break area and be as thorough as possible. I made a rough first outline and essentially an executive summary and turned it in to HR. I had also taken it upon myself to sketch out a rough logo on the back of an sku tag and took that home and finished it in photoshop over my 3 day weekend. 

       That weekend I had also finished my first rough business plan/ proposal document and turned it in to HR that Tuesday. This was about July of this year. The trail went a bit cold after that. I inquired on the status of the project with the ""higher ups"" directly and I was notified that the fate of the project was currently in the hands of the human resources department. I figured those old ladies just glanced at the like oohhh shiny and placed it into file 13. That wasn't far from the truth. 

      Mid August I noticed some bald headed white collar guy coming to check on me about 6:15am everyday for about a week. I give him a status on my department usually and just "" Hi and bye"" it out after that for the most part. Later that week I see him making his rounds and we formally introduce ourselves and he tells me ""Oh yeah, and I'm the new Director of HR"" some I'm like jackpot we get right into chopping it up about my project. He's loves the idea and said the magic words ""Wow, we could do beta testing here, Denso and Toyota then Nationwide and eventually The World"". So, we seemingly hit it off. It felt nice. I'd like to have a beer with that guy. So he makes a note to run down everyone involved thus far and give me an update in 24 hours. 

     Sure enough he's back the next day 6:15am. He says a general manager in Western North Carolina is quite interested in the project. I asked him if he's read my first draft of the plan. He hadn't seen or heard of it. I direct him to a specific old lady in HR. Some time passes and he comes to me super excited like: ""bro your document is amazing"". Also, he conveyed to me that the General Manager and my facility and also the GM at the other facility want to get production started on this project as so as possible. And that's the last I've heard of this matter. 

     I'm not out here writing business plans for fun. This idea wasn't ever going to be my personal flagship product. Had my employers not been interested I would have paraded it around town until I caught a bite. It's my intention to sacrifice it to generate income so I can quite working and breath new life into my own company and flourish. On the front page of the document that they are raving about and intend on developing says clearly in plain English that it is my intellectual property. If there were negotiations taking place what I'd feel comfortable with taking for them to use my IP it would be: 

 
A. 
  -10% royalties for the life time off the app or any based on my models including spiritual successors. 
  - In addition to a salaried director of creative enterprises or whatever bs position i can finesse this into along with a lump sum.        
  - Any lump sum as long as I'm clearing 100k annually now.

or 

B. 
  - Royalties. 
  - And a rather large lump sum of at least $250,000.

   

 I know. I'm new to this. I probably need a lawyer. It's probably too late for all of that. I have no idea. I don't know what this will turn into, or what it won't. If I'm protected by the words this document is and intellectual property of the author or not. Or if they'll just pat me on the back and expect me to keep busting ass for $15+ an hour. Idk. What I do know is that I am on to something. Also, I'll be personally developing my version of this project starting January as I'm becoming more talented with each passing day. That'll give me more leverage to do business with my employer or any entity interested in partnering with me on this (I'd like to think). I've been married for 5 months this week and my wife is due in January. Help.

  

TL;DR
   
    I have previous experience writing business plans and other bootstrapping qualities and proposed an app to my current employer. My current employer wants to start work on developing this app as soon as possible. How can I maximize how this benefits me?

personalfinance,Was I sold into staying with American Funds when I tried to rollover into the TSP?,"I recently started working as a Federal Employee and now have access to the TSP. My initial plan was to roll my Traditional IRA of about $8k (American Funds) into my Traditional TSP L Fund. When I called my American Funds financial adviser to do this transaction, they mentioned I should roll that into my current Roth IRA (American Funds) worth about $6k and making the total $15k in my Roth IRA with American Funds. His argument: Since I was already investing more heavily into the TSP at 5% and only $150/month to my Roth, i'd eventually equal a good medium towards my retirement (35 years from now) where I have a good amount of money in my Pre-Tax and Post-Tax contributions in case the tax rate in the future is much higher or much lower. I agreed with him initially until I thought about the tax hit i'll take of about $1500 rolling my Traditional into the Roth. 

Not really sure what to do at this point, should I roll that the 8k into my TSP and save myself from the Tax hit? or do what he says and roll that into an IRA since it's pretty hard to tell what taxes will be like 35 years from now? Maybe there is an option i'm not thinking about. I know the fees for TSP are much lower however he also mentioned that with American Funds the funds are actively managed (human interaction) whereas with the TSP it's more of a passive management (more computer algorithms). 

I take all advice on this sub with deep gratitude since I've already learned so much and even turned my entire financial life around to where I'm able to take vacations which I could never do before. I also take criticism very well, if i'm messing up just say so, i'll find a way to better my financial situation with that. 

edit: Wanted to add the reason I ever started with American Funds was because of a friend. I'm currently on Step 4a of 'How to handle $' and I know Vanguard and others have lower fees. Like I said, it was because of a friend who's no longer part of the American Funds community so leaving wouldn't be a problem if that's whats best.",finance,1476051371

personalfinance,Should I pay off my orphan student loan or just keep paying the minimum?,"Long time lurker on this sub. So I have a lot of student loans, most of which were bought out by one servicer (9 total, divided up into three sub-loans).  The total for this ""main"" loan is about $55,000, I have been on IDR for just under a year and just applied for the renewal. I work in a public service job which is eligible for the 10 year forgiveness program. I'm pretty content to do the IDR with this loan as long as I work at the same job due to that. I pay $254/month.

In addition to this loan, I have two of what I call orphan loans. For whatever reason they weren't bought by the main servicer, so I make separate payments for them. One is through my school, the balance is just under $2000 (I don't have the exact figure/interest rate as I don't have online access to the site right now), I pay $120 quarterly. The second is through AES, balance of $2,460.66, 6.8% interest. I pay $50/month.

I was looking at my AES payment history and saw that I started with a balance of $3500, paid $1902, and only reduced it by about $1040. I'm paying something like $14/month in interest on this one loan. And I was thinking, the PSLF program will have no effect as it will be paid off long before 10 years with my current payment plan. And I do technically have the money to pay it off, it will just decrease my savings.

So my question is, should I just pay it off? I'm only hesitant because I'm currently pregnant and I'm about to be out of work for 12 weeks (FMLA leave, 10 weeks unpaid). Here are my pre baby stats:

Take home pay - $2120/month (assuming two pays)
Expenses (including all loan payments) - $1600/month
Savings/checkings (I just count it all together) - $16,000

Am I crazy to want to pay it off by the end of the year with the imminent baby? Is it better to wait until I get my tax return next year? Or just to keep paying the $50 and keep my money in savings?",finance,1476052801
personalfinance,Using a small inheritance to pay down debt.,"My grandmother died in the past year, leaving a small inheritance to my dad.  She was an extremely frugal woman who lived on very little, so the money she had saved, while humble, was a surprise.  My dad wants to give my husband and I some of the money to pay down debt and help us save for a house in the next two years.

My husband has an excellent job, but with two small children and crippling student loan debt, we have not been able to save much.  I'm currently home with our kids, so we live on one income 

We have personal loan that we took out two years ago to consolidate some credit card debt.  It has a 9.9% interest rate and we pay an additional $20 a month in life/disability insurance on it.  I currently put $350 a month towards it in hope of paying it down sooner.

My dad would like to give us approx $7,700 to pay off the loan.  We would then put $350 a month into a separate savings account, plus any bonuses, to save towards buying a home.  We would be able to start doing this next month.

My husband's idea was to use his holiday bonus to pay off the loan in December, start saving the money in January, and have my dad give us the money towards a down payment when we are ready to buy.

I think paying off the loan sooner would be better in terms of saving more....but I also feel that using this money to pay off that debt will FORCE me to be diligent in saving towards a home, knowing that I need to respect and honor my grandmother's legacy if I am going to accept this money.

My husband wants to talk to a financial counselor about it

personalfinance,10 year loan forgiveness or bite the bullet.,"I was recently informed that there is a program that will allow for forgiveness of federal loans after 10 years of consecutive monthly payments. 

                Income / expenses:
  ( all estimates because I am recently broke up with ex / gf and looking for new place) 

  -  Currently making $42k a year 
  -  Rent+ utilities = $600/month
  -  Food + laundry + gas  = $210/month 
  -  Car insurance ≈$96 /month
  -  I have 6% of total gross income  going to 401k.
  -  Rest goes into rainy day fund. 

                  My debt:
  Currently I am $40k in debt spread across 20 different loans. The interest rate ranges from 3.2% to 6.55%. 

  I am signed up for IBR and pay a minimum of $200/month. In addition to that min' payment, I pay $1200/month using the avalanche method. 

                   My question:
  It seems like it's too ""good"" to be true.  I understand that at the end of the 10 year term, the remaining balance will be considered a taxable income. 

  - What are the advantages and the hidden disadvantages of such a program? 
  - Should I continue doing what I'm doing and pay the extra in an effort to bite the bullet and be debt free sooner? 
  - anyone who is on this program, what is your experience with it thus far? 

  I understand that I could Google this (and I have)  to get my answers. But I'd like a response from others who have a bit more input than the standard Google search.

personalfinance,Moving to San Diego vs Staying with rents for ~1 more yr??,"Gonna keep this as simple as I can ; I am deciding between two outcomes at this point and its so back and forth its hard.

I'll be 26 in about 5 days

First Choice ; Keep living my parents for about another year and finish up some certs for cybersec and get into defense contract world / air force etc. 
I currently am part time and my hours were ok but now looking at about 15 hours / week but I do not pay for food or rent or any bills really since I live with my parents and they are nice enough to let me live here with no payment or bills. 

So I'd say net income at this rate: 900-1000/month with no bills and nice place with full 1gb internet speeds, lots of food, they pay for out to eat meals too etc. only expense is basically stuff that is not needed like games, beer etc. and at work meals if i go on lunch and go out to get food. 

2nd option ; Full time gig in San Diego for 16.50/hour and I have a buddy who lives there so could spilit a 2bed/2bath or whatever for under 800$/month rent then + all the normal life bills. Probably be living close to little intake home per month but enough to possible do 401k and save some. Benefits would be FT job - full medical benefits , dental,vision, on my own and not under my parents anymore so independent and closer to my friends. I would keep working on certs out  there and goal still be in a year to have a new job in cybersec somewhere either private or military.  
Net Income probably be around 2,100/month roughly. 
800-Rent
250-Food
200/250- Utilities if not included in rent
140- Car Insurance 
200$- 401k
100$ - Out to eat money

plus some other expenses im sure im missing so lets say all together 1,800$/month gone leaving me with about 300 extra for savings or if I have to drive somewhere then gas money but plan on limiting use of car to small trips if any at all to keep expenses down.








So what do you guys think?

Is it worth staying with parents vs moving to san diego ?



P.S should include I am in Orlando,FL suburb near Melbourne,FL at the moment and parents would help with move if I went with it so no expenses on the moving front. Just would be normal everyday life stuff. 



Possiablity for 2nd income in San Diego would be uber which I am qualifed for already and could net maybe extra 500-1000 a month depending how committed I am with it.",finance,1476082060

I am also lucky enough to not have any debt.

I have already maxed out my Roth IRA for this year and allocate 30% of my income into my 401k/Roth 401k (15% each). I figure that I can leave ~$10k-$15k in my savings account as my emergency fund (for both me and my dog as I do not pay for pet insurance), which would leave $25k-$30k that I can use to grow my net worth, but am at a loss as to how I should go about doing this.

Her FICO score is 820 and mine is 745.

Forex,[Update] Easy money on NZD/USD? A week later the result,"9 days ago I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/5595lm/easy_money_on_nzdusd/) outlining 4 technical reasons why I thought Kiwi was headed down to .7117

On Friday Kiwi did indeed hit that .7117 in short order. Unfortunately price did not hit my desired entry price of .7330 (requirement of R:R at least 1.5) so I was not able to profit from this trade personally. However I have no regrets because I'd rather miss some good trades due to following my rules than make money being an undisciplined trader who later gives it all back and more.

I currently work for the federal government in the Midwest. I think I have laid a financial foundation that PF would be happy with, but I am not happy here. I am thinking of switching to the private sector so that I can afford to live in Seattle, WA. I have much more friends and family out there and I'm basically alone where I am currently.

Some stats:

*Own about $100k equity in my home

*I am single and in my early 30s; no kids; just a dog.

*Have $41k in my TSP account

*Have $17k emergency fund

*Earn $71k salary

*Only debts are $36k mortgage and $18k student loans

I have the possibility of wanting to rejoin the government after my love of city life fades (if it does). I don't know what to do with my TSP. I also don't know which salary I should seek that would enable me to live comfortably downtown (rough calculations show around $95k). I also am debating on whether to get a condo for $350k or rent in Queen Anne for approximately $2k/month.

personalfinance,Leaving PT Job: Must I turn in attire?,"I just gave my PT job notice of me moving/leaving/quitting. I'll be done at the end of the month (~20 days). They replied with a few reasonable things I would need to do before my last day. Help train a replacement, wrap up any projects, etc.

Then they said I would need to bring a change of clothes for my last day, as I would need to turn in all work related attire. When I started, they ""gave"" me some company branded clothes to wear while at work. They failed to mention my first paycheck almost entirely went to paying for it. I remember b/c I was pissed that first payday, but I got over it. Now they want it back?!?!? Not that I really need to keep the clothes, but is it not mine? I paid for it. Can they actually require me to return the clothes? Makes me wonder if the stuff was used when they first gave it to me. Why would they want the stuff back?

EDIT/UPDATE: Thanks guys, I wanted a few other peoples opinions before going back to the boss and questioning this policy. Just so I didn't sound completely crazy. Yes, I was charged $xx.xx per shirt and $yy.yy per pants. And yes they said I would have to change out of my work attire on my last day. There really wasn't any ""employment agreement""... this is just a small town/small company PT job. I didn't sign anything when I started beyond the standard federal/state tax stuff (W4?).    

I just went to my boss and asked about this policy, he said it is so I don't wear the stuff around town giving them a bad name. I said they could buy it back from me, otherwise I'd be keeping what I paid for. He told me he would have to talk with the owner. I could understand that mentality if I were getting fired. I guess this is just what they did in the past and nobody questioned it. I'll be back later with the decision.

UPDATE 2: Not that anyone really cares. But I said I'd be back, and here I am! Boss had to go back and look at my first paycheck to confirm. They evidently stopped charging newer employees. So they thought all the stuff was theirs. I'll be keeping it Thank You.",finance,1476122021

Here's what I have so far: 

Wells fargo checking - around $200 

Wells fargo savings account - around 6k with I think a .01% interest rate annually 

Cash - 1.4k 

Student Loans - 27k (not sure how much interest gained so far, but payment on my student loans begins in February after the 6 month grace period). Also, the student loans I plan on paying off monthly when I have a job.

Also, I was thinking about switching from Wells Fargo due to the recent scandals, but maybe I should keep my checking account open with them, as they've been very helpful to me when i've had fraud problems or they thought something was up with my account. I've been banking with them for around 7 years.

Here are some of the details:

* ~46k remaining on the mortgage

* 690 cash flow per month before paying mortgage

* mortgage payment is ~ 360 per month

* interest rate is 4.25%

So the question is, should I be paying just the minimum payments on the mortgage while saving some cash, or should I be paying down the mortgage faster (say, putting in 500 per month instead of the 360).

personalfinance,Credit report told me I have outstanding mortgage loans that aren't mine.,"Hey. I've been frequenting this subreddit and figured out my budget and lifestyle with you guys, hopefully someone has some insight into what I should do from this.

--------------------
Context

I am a 21 M living in the Midwest.

I have been working since ~15 (2010), have an open bank account in hometown. Both of my parents are listed as account holders.

When I moved off to college, I opened a bank account with US Bank at the college. My mom might be listed as an account holder on that. I'm not sure, but I did read that's really not ideal (she could gouge it and I wouldn't be legally able to do anything about it) so it's on the back burner to change.

My mom has had identity theft issues in the past as well as credit card debt. AFAIK, she has worked out the identity theft issue and has locked things down, but this was only 2+ to 4 years ago...

-----------------



I filed for a yearly free credit report from AnnualCreditReport.com. It requested from each of the big three credit reporting companies; Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

Experian was first to return, and it said it couldn't process my file. Whatever.

TransUnion brought up a report and everything looks good on it, I tried clicking the tab to see my score because I just wanted to have the number in my head (haven't checked it before). Page wouldn't load/display. Whatever.

So the problem lies, when I went to Equifax, they want you to verify your identity (as did TransUnion). However, equifax had some odd questions for me. According to Equifax, I have:

* ""A mortgage loan, opened in or around March 2012""

* ""What is the total monthly payment for above-referenced account""

* ""credit file indicates you may have a retail card, opened in or around October 2012""

* ""Indicates you have a bank card opened in or around September 2013""

I have none of these and couldn't answer any of them. I filled the information out on Annual Credit Report.com and I assume it queries each site with the same information. 

-------------

I submitted a paper-mailed version to ACR.com and hopefully they'll return all three properly instead of the half-report I got.

So: Why does Equifax pull this up, why *doesn't* TransUnion know about this, and finally, what do I need to do to protect myself and clear up my name. This must be bound to my SSN, so is this an identity theft issue?

In addition to this, just because Annualcreditreport.com doesn't let you view your file doesn't mean you answered anything incorrectly. Often, the bureaus will simply not have enough information to automatically verify, 100%, that the user of the website is really you. This frequently occurs with ""thin files"", or credit reports that contain sparse information on a consumer.

personalfinance,Trying to adjust payments for student loans,"Hi all. 

Recently, my state loan was bought out by company that owns my remaining loans. In total, I owe just over $19k, with roughly $1.5k being from the loan recently transferred. I am looking at readjusting my payment process to focus solely on the highest interest rate groups, and was looking for some advice. I have been paying ~$350 a month.

 - Group B - 6.550% with $1,953.94 outstanding

personalfinance,Private Student Loan payback strategy (assuming there is no highest interest rate),"Hey PF,

I have 12 private loans I pay on every month. They range from 890ish on up to 10kish. They are variable rate but they all seem to receive the same variable rate each month. From what I read here, targeting the higher interest rate is a good route. Since they're always all the same, i'm curious about another way to target my over pay amounts.


Is there any benefit in paying off these loans in smallest to largest with my over-payment? Currently, when I pay over, they do a weighted distribution of the over pay amount (loan amount / total of all loans, overpay amount * loan weight) to all the loans. They do allow me to specify my own weights (so long as they total 100%.) So would setting my own custom weight to 100% on the smallest, paying it off quicker, then moving up my list be a gain, or no difference at all?


I've been looking at crunching the numbers in excel, but kinda stuck at how to redo calculations over-and-over based on the previous calculations results. Still reading up on how to do this.

I will also be speaking with my brothers this week about taking on more of the student debt ourselves. I will also be doing some research into non-bank employed financial advisers.

Hi reddit. I'm stressed out and could use some advice. My parents are good people, the best, but they have made some bad financial decisions and have a lot of debt now. 

My dad is a proud man who loves and finds a great deal of purpose caring for his children and parents, but last night he finally broke down to me [23F] crying and admitted that he needed help sorting out his finances. I really want to help him. However, I am still learning about managing finances myself, so I'm seeking outside advice here. 

**As a background to how he got so deep in debt**--growing up my parents owned a restaurant. However a number of bad years lead them to remortgage the house and go into significant debt to keep it afloat. They ended up closing it a few years ago anyway, though.  It was a rough few years for them, but eventually they have managed to land on their feet okay salary wise. Their debt from that, though, is killing them.  They also put me and my brothers through college, and my mom through grad school.

As of last year, my parent's combined adjusted gross income right now is 210k (mom makes 60k, dad makes 150k, though he does consulting work with food companies so that varies a lot--last year he made 90k). **They only started making around this amount within the last year or two (if anyone wonders why they didn't pay things back before now) because it took my dad a while to build up his consulting business enough.** As for savings... sadly they wiped out their savings in the business, and because they have been focused on paying off their debts they have only been able to rebuild about 60k. They are putting the max into their 401k, but they are also scared because they have nothing for retirement. The business ate everything.
  
Resources breakdown:

 * Net income: 130k (roughly, this year. Can vary a lot)

 * savings: 60k

Debt break down: 

 * 90k credit card debt

 * 200k mortgage (underwater, so selling not a great option)

 * 190k student loan debt (130k currently most federal, 60k more being added from my brother)

They pay about $1900 a month between their taxes and mortgage. They also have medical expenses for themselves and my grandfather that amount up to at least $1000 a month (often more), and they help my grandfather and grandmother with rent ($800 a month). Other bills (phone, utilities, pets, etc) add up to 800/month. I'm not sure how much they spend on things like food.  **I do know that my dad is putting as much as he can into loans, but he is so scared and stressed out and I've never seen him cry before.**

My grandfather is probably going to need to go into a home sometime soon, so there is that fee upcoming as well. I'd like to help in a few years, but right now I'm just making enough to cover my bills. 

I know they make enough money right now that they can tackle this debt. Only, I don't know what to tell them to address first. **Should they pay of the credit card debt first?** They are trying--they are putting all the remained into the debt--but they are scared they may only be able to make this much for the next couple years (mom is a nurse and probably can't work much longer as one).

Reddit, where do I start helping them build a budget? They are trying to balance the loan repayments with the need to save for retirement. 

**tl:dr; parents had a business that went under--they are almost 500k in debt and though they made good money this year, that is recent and might only be for the next few years. They are also financially helping/caring for my elderly grandparents. How do I help them plan and budget?**",finance,1476141824

personalfinance,Deeper into financial ruin - not a care in the world,"Keeping things vague enough....

Mid 30s, no kids, in a relationship (maybe not much longer, also, living with relatives for free.)

I had a high paying job for over 10 years. Had a very small amount in a 401k. Lost job about 2 years ago and spent all money relocating to another state for S/Os career choice. Spent 401K money relocating. Had existing credit card debt and student loans that weren't too bad, maybe $5,000-$10,000 total at the time. 

Losing job really f'd me over as I was starting to get handle on finances. Spiraled me into a deep loss if interest in attempting to get career back on track as I was behind in current resume skills. 

Last year I only earned about $5,000 on my income tax return working part time minimum wage job. Extremely difficult, relying on family and government assistance. 

Fast forward to now: 

Credit card #1:  $10,000+ and in collections for over a year.

Credit card #2: $5,000+ and also in collections for over a year.

Credit card #3: $13,000+ and is my only source of cash flow to eat, buy gas etc and has a limit of only a few hundred more than that. 

Online credit account: $3,500 - not in collections yet

IRS/Taxman owed: $3,000+ for accidentally filing self employment income wrong in 2014 (honest mistake, my fault, no way out of this one)

Family credit: owe $5,000 at least to family members

Fed. Student loan: $5,000+ in zero income repayment plan, so no payments are due for another 8 months or so.

Friends/S/O owed: $2,000

Roughly estimating I have about $42,000 in debt. 

Because of the collections accounts, my credit went from being nearly 770 to the 500s. I cannot get any credit and have negative marks. 

I'm guessing I would need a monthly income gross of about $4,000 to even pay all the minimums and eat. I can't find work in the industry I previously worked in because my resume is severely out of date. I can't work minimum wage because it's not enough to even pay half the minimums on debt. Can't go back to school because I have no money and no credit.

Mental state: Because the situation has gotten so dire, hopeless, uninteresting and unsolvable by my own direction, I don't give a crap about any of this any longer. When I first knew I was going to start missing payments, I went through all the correct steps according to my financiers. I went to an official credit counselor and they basically told me they couldn't offer any solutions because I did't make enough money. I was in a state of panic for months because I had perfect credit for many years and it just started a snowball of defeat. 

Here's the basic root of the situation - I no longer care to resolve this, and will likely be homeless soon if my family decides to kick me out. I have no other support systems. Can't file bankruptcy, have no money. 

Summary/TL:DR: 
-Massive amount of debt in mid 30s

-Not disabled, but am having increasingly hard time with mental facilities including memory and thought organization/motivation. Instructions have been getting more and more difficult to follow and comprehension is worsening as I age. Previous employers really brought this to attention when they became increasingly frustrated at inability to follow directions.

-Need a high paying job to resolve issue and entitlement doesn't mean anything (meaning nobody is going to give me $60K a year just because I need it)

-Have only a few hundred left of credit to eat/drive/survive on

-Don't have any interest in working or resolving the situation any longer

-No medical benefits

-I do exercise sometimes


I'm posting this because I'm maybe just reaching out as a last ditch effort and maybe some stranger on the internet will strike a cue with me. I feel like my case is a good study of how being jobless leads to homelessness and depression. 
Per rules for this SR - is the only solution a decent salaried income? What's likely to happen to me in this situation?

Forex,EUR/USD 1.08 End of Year,"Interesting piece from Barclay Capital

""Volatility in euro markets rose last week on media reports, that the ECB may be discussing tapering its asset purchase program, scheduled to end in March 2017. However, such speculation was quickly denied by Vice President Vitor Constancio. The ECB's communication this week, including speeches by ECB's Mersch (Tuesday, Wednesday) and Coeure (Wednesday) will likely also attempt to curb speculation of premature tapering. **A unified message regarding the ECBs ability to continue easing should keep EURUSD in check, in our view. We continue to envision EURUSD at 1.08 by year-end**
The accounts of the GC meeting released last week offer some comfort to our view that the ECB will announce changes to the technical parameters and an extension of QE beyond March 2017, at its December meeting (see ECB minutes: Monetary support still warranted, 6 October 2016). At this stage, we think changes to the size or composition of the PSPP are unlikely before March 2017 and in any case with related communication that reassures markets that policy will remain accommodative for the foreseeable future.

**In other words, the ECB faces a communications challenge that will be crucial for the future path of the EUR and euro area rates. The challenge is essentially to succeed where the Fed did not during the Taper Tantrum, by convincing markets that a slower pace of balance sheet expansion is still stimulatory.""**",finance,1476169758

I have no doubt there are people far smarter than me, doing far better than me who use fundamentals.

___________________________________________________________

 For relevance, this post will talk about Sterling, I have observed the same in many other currency pairs,  commodities, stocks, bonds and virtually all liquid floating assets. 

I have found very often positive or negative news to be deceptive, as it pertains to larger, longer term price moves. 

While there might be a bit of short term momentum in that direction, it is usually not plentiful regarding opportunity to trade. 

I think very often, the bigger and smarter players already position for expected outcomes and in these cases the news is largely already in the price and the larger players take profit into the short term momentum caused by the news release. 

This is where the saying ""buy the rumour, sell the news"" comes from. 

In other cases the news is ""for now"" news rather than overall dictation of what will happen in the future. 

We can see a clear example of this in the Sterling charts with the highs on the Brexit correction having been made in the minutes after the BoE declared they were holding the interest rates steady. 

This apparently bullish news was the top and the end of bullish price action. 

I'd speculate many larger players looked at this as the BoE were not dropping interest rates [today](http://www.relatably.com/m/img/not-today-memes/Michelle_Dobyne_NotToday.jpg) but the fact the Pound was under pressure that would require rate slashes was not in any way changed and this was where selling pressure into the spike came from.  

Juxtaposed against the falls when they did drop the rates and the fall on Brexit, these were sustaining moves since they were decisions that would have lasting long term impacts. 

At this point, I really would be happy enough to go out on a limb and say when the Pound does eventually bottom out, it will happen in the  minutes, hours or days at most after extremely bearish Pound news comes out. 

I think for the  average person, the complexities of decoding what the news really means are so vast that many of us do not have a chance and for many people, a focus on charting and pattern recognition is more suitable. 

While many different reasons are cited for the moves in the Pound, long before the fact there were technical indications that these moves would happen. 

Many of these I was able to foresee, call and trade. Some I was not, or I made misjudgements on but retrospectively I could work out where the hints could have been seen (and for anyone who say ""well ,you can't trade hindsight"" ... well, the markets are not closing and I can carry it forward to help me with future foresight). 

I have cycled through a few phases when it comes to news events for trading; 

1 - I gota know the news ... maybe I should pay for even better access to the news. 

2 -  The news is a red herring and I should be a contrarian to the news. 

3 - (Now) Whatever the news is, I already made my plans from chart analysis and I am trading that,  I should know when there is high impact news due so I am not over exposed to risk but I should only be aware of the news, not care about the news. 

If the news causes price moves that disprove my technical analysis, the chart will look different and i will do new technical analysis based on that chart. 

To sign off on this, I will quote something I'd posted (not on Reddit) back in January. 

""Markets are perception rather than reality.

On Black Wednesday (16 September 1992) when the Pound crashed (you may know this as ""Soros breaking the Bank of England"") in attempts to defend the Pound the BoE done the following.

1 - Make it very clear they were intervening to drive up price (spook the sellers)

2 - Raise interest rates.

They threw billions of taxpayers money and raised interest rates THREE times in a single day.

Rather than bring strength to the Pound, speculators seen it for what it was, a central bank panicking.

Blood was in the water and the sharks attacked.""


Since this is the case, that it is perception rather than reality,  I think it is a bit of a fools errand (let me state again, if your style disagrees with this and is profitable, then fair play to you, I speak only for myself and what I have seen in many retail traders)  since trying to work out the complexity of people's perceptions is intensely hard.",finance,1476179070

So I joined the army (national guard) partway through my bachelor's and got most of it paid. I graduated with ~20k in federal loans.

My car is paid off. I am on parents federal insurance for 3 more years then I'll switch to the national guard's which is cheap. Phone is paid off and phone plan is cheap. 

The guard is currently paying for me to go to paramedic school as well.

I don't owe payments on loans until 2018 after I'm out of paramedic school and I get to stay with family until I'm done with medic school. My income sucks this year because it's hard to work while in paramedic school. 

I was considering a few options for payments...

I could make the minimum payment each month with my drill check from the guard. 

Or I could attack them hard out the gate as I'm pretty much guaranteed a decent paying job as a paramedic here especially with a degree and military. 

Or in two years I'll be up for reenlistment and can qualify for  the loan repayment program but it's a massive pain in the ass. 

I guess what I'm asking is do I pay it bit by bit each month or go hard for a year or two and be done with it? I make about 4-5k off the guard each year (not counting deployments) so I could just put that money towards it and be done in about 5 years as well.",finance,1476188050

#General Information

The Glass-Steagall act was a large section of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933 sponsored by Sen. Carter Glass (D–VA) and Rep. Henry B. Steagall (D–AL). Deeming improper or irresponsible bank activity to have been responsible for the Great Depression, the proponents of the act passed it in order to separate commercial and investment banking in the hopes of creating a more stable banking environment. Once it was signed by President Roosevelt, most banking institutions were forced to choose whether to designate themselves as commercial banks or investment banks, and then report to the Federal Reserve which was given much more power over them. Restrictions were replaced on Federal Reserve member banks, such as preventing them from dealing in non-governmental securities for customers.

Though the act was popular at the time, it was met with criticism shortly after being enacted. In 1935, Senator Glass himself attempted to repeal portions of it believing it had unduly damaged securities markets, however President Roosevelt opposed this change and it was not enacted.

In 1963, the Comptroller of the Currency, James J. Saxon, believed that the act had caused undue stress on America's financial institutions over the previous decades. He desired to expand the power of national banks, and issued through the office several regulations expanding their power. Courts overturned these as Glass-Steagall violations, however over the next decade more challenges to the act were proposed which courts chose to uphold.

The popularity of the act continued to decline throughout the next several presidencies. President George H.W. Bush supported a financial system overhaul that would generally overrule it, this was met with bipartisan support. Dissent to Glass-Steagall would eventually culminate in the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, financial reform legislation with wide bipartisan report that was signed into law by President Clinton. With the new act, Glass-Steagall was functionally defunct.

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, many believe that a reinstatement or reimagining of the Glass-Steagall act is necessary to prevent future market crashes. This is a point of serious contention among political experts, and will be the topic of today's discussion/debate.

#Leading Opinions

**Hillary Clinton** opposes a new Glass-Steagall, believing that it would not have solved the 2008 crisis and that a better solution would be a strengthening of the Dodd-Frank act.

**Donald Trump**, echoing the Republican Party platform, believes that Glass-Steagall should be revived in order to prevent big banks from outcompeting small community banks.

**Gary Johnson** has not made the act a major part of his platform, and has not spoken of it often. he has discussed both the positive and negative possible aspects of reinstating it.

**Jill Stein** believes that Glass-Steagall must be reinstated, stating that big banks are gambling with public money and should instead be broken up, or otherwise beholden to public interests.

&gt;Do you believe that during the time Glass-Steagall was active, it helped or harmed the economy and the institution of American banking? Do you believe the act would've stopped the 2008 financial crisis? Should it be brought back currently, and to what extent? Why or why not?

personalfinance,"(AUS) Graduated top of my high school, can't afford university! HELP!","So I graduated with the highest marks from my high school last year (18y.o now), opening me up to a lot of options in university including Medicine and Law Degrees. However,  unaware of my family's financial situation I was told we couldn't afford the tuition fees for university. My parents have a horrible way of ignoring problems until they are in front of their faces and telling themselves everything will be okay. They had made it out to me that we would be able to afford it but they hadn't even known how much university fees cost. 

I really feel lost and trapped in my current situation and feel like I may not be able to get a degree even after graduating with marks even I couldn't believe I had gotten and spending my entire adolescence to get these marks, spending thousands on getting tutored through highschool to be suddenly hit with the reality that I cannot afford university. My high school marks as I know only last for a few years as well before it becomes nullified where I guess I have to wait until I can apply as a mature student. 

University fees in Australia cost around $30,000-40,000AUD a year for international students such as myself. I was even able to score a $10,000 annual scholarship at one university for a Bachelor of Law, but still told by my parents we couldn't afford the costs. Australia has a government-run student loan system that is available to all Australian citizens, however, I have been under my parent's work visa since I have been living in Australia since 2 yo. Therefore, I must pay the $30,000-40,000AUD annual tuition fees up front which we are in no position to afford. 

I really feel like I cannot rely on my parents anymore to pay for my tuition fees and have to start taking the responsibility for myself whether it be through finding out loan plans or any other options but I am so financially inexperienced and I feel my parents are not so well informed as well. I don't know anything about loans or making loans and don't want to get ripped off by horrible interest rates and conditions that put me in an even deeper hole. I also feel like there are other options that are available to me which I have just not heard of.

I work 2 part-time jobs, 7 days a week and make around ~$600 a week which I spend around $100 of. I was wondering if anyone knew about any viable options available in Australia such as loans or if anyone has experience themselves. Please, I just want to stop feeling so helpless and get out of this mess.",finance,1476193021
personalfinance,Identity Theft,"Sorry for the long post, but I feel some explanation is necessary.

A little backstory: around a month ago, I logged in to the online account that's tied to my wife's Chase credit cards to check balances, etc. Magically, there's a new credit card! I click on the account info and it's an Amazon Rewards Visa which was fine because we had actually just applied for one (with a $50 Amazon gift card bonus) but were not instantly approved. I thought it unusual that I never received an approval email after the application was reviewed but whatever. 

Here's where it got odd: the primary email wasn't the primary email I normally use for billing notifications when signing up for stuff - it was simply my wife's full name plus a few numbers at the end and Chase was asking me to change it because emails were bouncing. I thought this odd but thought that maybe when Amazon transmitted the application info to Chase they somehow screwed it up. After all, I **did** actually apply for this card. First red flag.

Changed the email, then I decided to dig into the account info a little more. The primary mailing address on this new card was assigned to an address that my wife and I moved from more than 4 years ago. Second red flag, but my old address was still listed in my Amazon account because I was too lazy to hit the delete button after we moved. Maybe Amazon royally f**ked up when they submitted my application?

I contacted Chase and they confirmed that the new card was indeed mailed to this old address. We spent an hour on the phone and finally got them to deactivate the old card, change the primary billing address, and mail a new card to the correct address. The new card arrived as expected and no mysterious charges were ever made to the original card before deactivation.

Everything was fine, until I logged into ***my*** Chase account today and found a brand new Amazon Rewards Visa card that I **did not** apply for and a notification that emails were bouncing and I needed to change my email address. Again, email with first/last name + numbers and the card is assigned my old mailing address. Logged into Credit Karma and I have a new hard inquiry from Chase from 10/03.

There are several things I have deduced from this. First, both of these cards were obviously fraudulent even though my wife's happened to coincide with our own real application. Second, since this has hit both of us within a month, with the same card and issuer, I'm assuming that one person/group of persons has our information and that, thirdly, they received this information from a single breach from a company where both my wife and I have personal information stored.

Also, since the emails were bouncing back from Gmail, I figured that these email accounts must not actually exist. So, I created both accounts and then used the emails to reset the passwords for the subsequent Amazon accounts that were created by the scammer(s). I was successful in this for the Amazon account in my name, but I can't login to my wife's after successfully resetting the password so I'm guessing that Amazon has already detected this account is fraudulent and deactivated it.

Upon logging into the fraudulent Amazon account, I found that the scammer has spent the $50 gift card signup bonus and shipped the goods to an address in Miami, Florida. **One of the packages is still in transit.** I Googled the address and this appears to be a shipping facility so I am assuming the scammer has the equivalent of a UPS Store Mailbox type thing and it's just a package pickup location, rather than the shipping facility actually being at fault for the fraud.

**Questions:**

1. I know I need to freeze our credit reports. I've heard that this can be done for free if you have been defrauded - is this true and are there any additional steps to accomplish this for free?

2. I know I should file a police report. Since I have an exact location of the scammer and I know that they will be coming to receive these packages in the near future, should I file a police report with the Miami police as well my local department? Or file with my local department and let them deal with Miami? **I just checked the tracking and the package is due to arrive today.**

3. I do not want and do not intend to keep the Visa opened in my name. However, I did want the one opened in my wife's name and, honestly, believed I was legitimately approved for it. I need to report the fraud - I assume I automatically lose this card?

4. I am very careful with my and my wife's SSNs. The only place these have ever been distributed would be to the university we both attended, our federal student loan servicer, 3 banking institutions, and 4 credit card issuers. I think it's a relatively safe assumption that, however our information was obtained, it was obtained from a single source, but that still leaves a large number of possible leaks. Is there any way to narrow down what institution may have suffered a breach? I'm not aware of any recent notifications from any of these places that our information may have been compromised but, obviously, they may not be aware of a breach yet.

I am located in the US. Thanks in advance for your help!",finance,1476194400
personalfinance,Paying off student loans vs buying a house,"My wife and I are currently debating whether or not we should consider paying off our student loans then save to buy a house, or buy a house and then slowly chip away at our student loans.

personalfinance,Graduation Debt Goals: I Have A Few Pennies To My Name RN,"Greetings Redditors! 

I'm going to the school of my choice into a competitive field. 

My goal is to graduate with as little debt as possible from the private institution I'm going to as I will not have a large income for the first few years of my life.

I've been going to school for awhile, but I have had assistance from the academic institution that my parents work for. There is a deal that they will pay for four years of a four year bachelor's degree. That has run out, as I've had a rocky road from one school to another where none of my credits transferred except for one. The assistance helped with two years of my current school. I am making my way through the last year of my four year degree at my current school right now.

I have been taking out loans for school by semester for tuition. The private school is reasonably priced for private schools (approx. $12,000.00 per semester) and I'm grateful to have this opportunity to build my human capital and make me viable on the job market. I have gotten grants to go to school as well that partly pay for the tuition.

I have about $32,000 in personal debt at a fixed interest rate. I will be in about $40,000 debt by the time I graduate this summer. 

My parents are helping out with the living expenses in my city until I graduate with $600 each, totaling a monthly expenses of $1,200. Nothing will come after I graduate (as I would expect myself to take care of myself at this age).

My rent is $1,050 
My internet is $40
My electricity is $60
My phone is $60

These expenses are split with my partner, so I pay a flat $600 a month for life, not including groceries. personal groceries are around $300 max (probably less). 

I am not working, but searching for a new job to pay off my loans and living expenses. I am confident in my ability to get just a job before graduation. I have been offered a job casually by a business down the street that I would be glad to work for.

As for personal finances, I smoke cigarettes, I drink beer (Never in bars, it's too expensive), and I eat out too much. This has been the major downfall of my money situation. Personal indulgence in excess is not good. I don't shop much retail though which is a good start.

Problem: I'm basically out of money for the month and October is 1/3 through.

Solutions:
I'm getting a job while in school.

I'm quitting cigarettes, drinking less expensive beer and drinking less, and I'm eating less by eating in and cooking smaller portions (and healthier foods).

I'm sort of ashamed to admit that I am bad at managing money and I've read a few articles on how to manage money better to help. Any tips and tricks are appreciated, and I would like some help with resisting temptation, which I'm going to a different subreddit for. I have a good methodical work ethic, and I'm a people person.

But this is a war between Bitcoin vs Ethereum vs Centralized fiat vs Banking system vs Zcash/Monero vs Dash vs Gold vs ETC vs Bitcoin Unlimited and versus even a hypothetical Ecoin or FedCoin. Bitcoin Core downplay the battle, because they are in a position of power. To acknowledge a war is to cede positional strength. But look at the Twitter profiles of Peter Todd, Tuur Demeester, Kyle Torpey, Chris DeRose, and Paul Sztorc. Some 50% of their posts are regarding Ethereum. Look at the reddit profile of Greg Maxwell. 95% of his profile is about the shortcomings of Bitcoin Classic or Unlimited. XMR is allied with Btc, and are very anti-Eth. The banks are very anti-public blockchains. BU hates Bitcoin Core. God knows what the SEC or FINRA is thinking.

There is no need to downplay this any longer.  I truly believe this is all out war. And wars. Cost. Money.

It requires capital to fund a war. Do you think Bitcoin was built on love? Ok, maybe at first it *was* built on love. But there was no competition back then, and development took years. Now, though? Blockstream raises FIFTY-FIVE MILLION at a crack from AXA. 21 inc raised 116 million from A16Z. Coinbase raised 75 million. They are sticking their hands in their pockets, and pulling out large wads of cash. Wars cost money! How many ventures has Roger Ver personally funded? And Barry Silbert?

Do you think Ethereum was built on love? Not a chance, baby. 18 million bucks. And they still almost went bankrupt in under 2 years. 18 million to create a BILLION dollar platform.  What do you think about that 55x return, eh?

There is a **massive** media exploitation / social engineering game going on. There are people literally posting in these threads saying that these massive and ambitious projects such as Gnosis and Ether Camp should be built for UNDER 100 GRAND. We need to let the free market fund these projects as it sees fit (yet within reason, too). We need to give these projects maximum chance of success. When TheDAO launched, there were several large whales who threw MILLIONS at the DAO. Many millions. Do you seriously want them to NOT be able to invest in Gnosis? Because that’s what’s going to happen with a 15 million dollar cap. Singular DTV raised 7 million in 10 minutes. They didn’t need much more. Gnosis is much more ambitious, there are people out there WANTING to give them money, and here we are advocating AGAINST funding our own projects. The competition is throwing **HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS** at their projects and we're squabbling over 10 million vs 50 million? Get the **** out of here. The quickest way to lose a war is by being cheap.

Wars. Cost. Money. As of right now, the Bitcoin community is much stronger than ours. They are more aggressive, more vigilant, more willing to die for and fund their cause. The Ethereum Foundation is formidable, no doubt. They have more power behind the scenes than we give credit for. Joseph Lubin is an incredibly shrewd businessman. Our developers are top notch. But we don’t play dirty. And we’re stingy. Is there no sense of urgency here? Digix raised 5 million, and with a team of 5 are ready to launch a platform within 8 months. What could they have done with 20 million and a team of 10? Augur is over a year old and still no product. Gnosis will take a couple years, perhaps less. Do you guys want these products in the next year or the next decade?

Finally, Preston Byrne makes some interesting points for sure, but is in no position to preach to our community. He is a competitor. He has a vested interest in its failure. He has a vested interest in our community raising as little funds as possible. I’ve read many Medium blogs on how ICOs are bad and stupid and illegal. They are saying that because they don’t have the projects to even invest in (and also because it's likely illega). Their platforms are not as flexible. They *don’t want us to raise capital*. You have to realize this. I will say it again. **People not inside of this community do not want us to raise money. They do not want us to be even attempt to build ambitious projects.** 

Roman, however, has a vested interest in our success, as he’s spent several years working on Ethereum and developing the tools. Martin Koppelmann and Joseph Lubin and Matt Liston and Stefan George have a vested interest in our success. I’m a huge fan of Maker, their funding has not been so great though. What could they do with more money? 

We don’t want to see our projects fail because they didn’t have adequate funding. At this point, we want Ethereum to fail because it blows. Not because we didn't get the funding we wanted. I won't sit quietly and watch us prohibit investors from putting up their money. To be clear, I’m not asking **YOU** to put up the money, but let others with deep pockets who have an interest in seeing Ethereum succeed be able to make that decision on their own. Don’t put up your own money if you don’t want, but nonetheless help fund the war.

personalfinance,Chase vs Ally Bank for a first savings account?,"Hi all. First time posting here, so hopefully I followed all the rules. I'm a 20 year old junior in college and I would like to open a savings account just to start saving some money. 
  
  I have a checking account with Chase but am looking to open a savings account. I would prefer to stay with Chase because that's what I'm familiar with, however I've heard that Ally is the way to go. My problem is that I'm not great at understanding the fine print associated with opening savings accounts. If I open a savings account with Chase, I plan on transferring $25/month to avoid a fee, but also because I was going to do that anyways. 

So, my question is, if I don't care about the extra $20 I may get at the end of the year with Ally (which I believe is one of their selling points due to their higher interest rates) are there any drawbacks to using Chase vs Ally?

personalfinance,Cash out Refi on VA Loan...worth it?,"I have a VA loan that i am started discussing the potential of a cash out refi.  Our home has appreciated by about 30% since we refinanced to a lower interest rate about 2 years ago (280k was our loan and is now worth 341k).  We could cash out about 40k to pay off some reasonable CC debt and use the rest for upgrades for our place.  

The interest rate would still be  3.25% on a 30 year fixed.  We both make good money and the possibility of moving to a 15 year is a possibility, but not something we want to do right now.  The monthly payment would go up by about 43$ a month, which to me makes sense as a viable option to move forward.  In total we would cash out 36k.

I'm getting a large sum of money (140k) and I'm uncertain how to proceed.  I have a decent budget, emergency fund, 401k, ect.  Here is my major debt.

75,000 @ 7% &lt;- My student loan $175/mo

70,000 @ 7% &lt;- Wife's student loan $175/mo

78,000 @ 3.75% &lt;-Mortgage (15yr fix - payoff in 8 years) $1100/mo

65,000 @ 4.25% &lt;-Heloc (variable interest only) $230/mo
35,000 @ 2.5% &lt;- Car loan

Normally I'd go with highest interest which would be the student loans.  However, we have a large family size and I earn the sole income.  Right now the student loans are on the IBR plan.

If I pay off my house (both mortgage and HELOC) it would free up about $1500 monthly, as well as a stable place to live if I were to end up with no job.  To me having no house payment would be fantastic.  

I'm not really concerned about the car payment as the interest rate is fairly low.

personalfinance,Finally decided to try and improve my life. Want to get your opinion on my budgetting plan.,"Currently 25,I’ve been looking at this sub every now and then and I have finally decided that I need to get my finances and life together. Looking at everyone here improving their situations has motivated me to finally take a good look at my debt. As of now I had only been paying off the minimal amount to my loans and realized that in doing so I would be in debt for a lot longer than I’m comfortable with. I only completed 2 years of college and I do wish to finish my education to get my degree but at the same time want to minimize my debt. I’m posting here to lay out my plan of attack and hopefully you guys can let me know if I need to make some adjustments and if it seems realistic.
In total I owe 47K in student loans, the highest one being 38K with 7% interest rate. I currently have 2 minimum payments that I have to pay monthly for the loans. For the 38K the minimum is $393 and for the other one it’s $130. I plan to increase the payments from $393 to $693 while leaving the other loan payment as is. I have 4k in my checkings and $1400 in a Roth that hasn’t been touched since I opened it. I’m planning to transfer 2k to a savings account and also set up an automatic transfer of $700/month. I also figured that it may be a good idea to at least put something in my Roth so I’m thinking of allocating $100/month to it.

Here is the breakdown:

* Monthly Income: $2200
* Student Loans: $822
* Phone: $45
* Food: $180
* Car Insurance: $62
* Gas: $90
* Entertainment/Going out: $200
* Roth IRA: $100
* Rent: $0 – Fortunate to be living with parents

Total Savings Per Month: $700 

I plan to take whatever classes I can in community college while continuing my full-time job before I transfer to a 4 year school (money from savings will be used to pay for community college classes). Once I transfer I plan to commit fully to finishing my degree so I will temporarily put my loans in deferment while paying off any monthly interest, and if possible get a part-time job so I don’t only have my savings to rely on.

personalfinance,Student Loan Forgiveness... Maze of Frustration.,"I've read dozens of posts and other online material about student loan forgiveness, and I'm still not sure I'd qualify. If anyone has any helpful information about my particular circumstance though, I'd love to know. I'll outline my convoluted situation first, and then detail my questions.

Here's my situation:

1) I took out loans only through the United States Federal government from 2001 to 2006. Each loan is still ""listed separately"" when I log into the company that now owns my debt's website, but they've only quoted me a single monthly payment I have to make.

2) I have never made any payments on these loans. They've always been in deferment or forbearance since I've had them.

3) About three years ago, I'd called into the Federal government to get another forbearance, but the customer service agent must have gotten something wrong. This resulted in two months worth of default on my loans where I made no payments, and had no idea any were due. As soon as I realized what was up, I contacted them and got another forbearance. However, a couple months after that, and the Fed ""sold off"" my loans to a private company.

4) The Fed sold my loans to Sally Mae, who then sold them to Navient who is my current loan holder. Not that I ever asked them to. This was just something that happened to me.

5) I've never made a payment on these loans, but I'm scheduled to start next month. And, for the first time since graduating from college 12 years ago, I think I can finally make monthly payments.

6) I have now been working (but not making any payments on the loans yet) for a non-profit University as a full-time staff employee for a year.

So here are my questions:

1) Given my situation, would I still qualify for student loan forgiveness under the [Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service)? Or does having your loans sold off to a private company void you from participation?

2) If so, should I contact my loan holder to discuss an [income driven repayment plan](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven)? I feel like my monthly payments they're about to start charging me aren't too terrible (they're still bad, though), and I'd hate for them to raise the monthly cost.

3) If I contact my current loan holder and mention anything about PSLF, will they try to ""take advantage of me?"" Meaning, is it in their company's best interest to not allow for student loan forgiveness?

personalfinance,[Investing] Ultra-long term investing,"First post here, couldn't find any topic that already talks about this. This doesn't necessarily apply to me, it's more of a question I've been having. 

The general rule for smart investing is, simplified of course, to simply buy and hold a diversified portfolio with the lowest cost (for example VTI). Risk is relatively high and therefore return is also relatively high, however counting on the fact that you intend to hold this for a long time (20+ years) and especially if you were to put money into this every month, risk in the long run is relatively low with still relatively high return.

However, what I am wondering is if this would be the same approach you would choose if rather than taking a time-frame of 20 to 50 years you were to take a time-frame of 50+ years. Would it in that case perhaps not be better to take an even higher amount of risk to get commensurate higher return? For example (though I believe this is not possible for normal investors) investing in venture capital, or for example leveraging at 2.5% (I realise this sounds low, but interest rates on mortgages are actually about 2.5% if you take out a 30-year mortgage with a 30-year fixed rate) and investing into VTI with a larger sum. 

It is my opinion that in the ultra-long case as stated before, a case could be made for leveraging early on, as long as this is by leveraging in the sense of a mortgage where you won't get margin calls. However, I wonder what other people's thoughts on this are. So, what do you think?",finance,1476271077

BlockChain,Lael Brainard Views Blockchain as Progressive,"The technology behind bitcoin virtual currency could lead to across the board improvements in how financial transactions are carried out worldwide.  Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard believes it can be a safeguarded from hackers and terrorists, and not grind to a halt in a crisis.  Though the Fed is closely tracking the evolution of so-called blockchain systems, and sees it as ""the most significant development in many years in how financial assets trade hands.  There is the potential of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to transform the way financial market participants transfer, store, and maintain ownership.

The Fed along with major central and commercial banks around the world are grappling with how blockchain may reshape the financial system. Such technology in theory could lower the cost, improve the security and speed the completion of transactions by eliminating intermediaries. It would instead rely on cryptography and computer algorithms to transfer electronic records across a shared ledger.  Brainard said ""common ledgers could simplify the complicated cross-border record keeping involved in trade finance, lower counterparty risk in securities transactions, or even automatically enforce bond payment or other contracts"".  The downside is that it would need to prove itself immune to hacking or other security breaches, use by criminal organizations, and show that it could improve - or at least not damage - financial stability.

Although most applications are in their infancy, and the industry may still be several years away from an application that is ready to be fully introduced.  The Fed expects to release a research paper on the technology later this year.  Initial relatively simple proofs of concept must be followed by much more complex demonstrations in real-world situations before these technologies can be safely deployed in today’s highly attached, intergrated, and far-reaching financial business.

personalfinance,Inherited 401k - Wanting to pay remainder of student loans.,"I'll try to keep this short, as I've basically made up my mind I'm just curious of any tax ramifications I haven't thought of. 


I am 28 and I am inheriting roughly $15k from a 401k. I have roughly $13k left on my student loans so I would like to take the cash payout and put all the money towards the loans, any remaining balance I would pay from my own savings. 


From what I have read there is a 20% mandatory minimum federal tax withholding which will bring the amount down to ~$12k. This will also count as earned income come tax time next year. 


Should I have them withhold more than 20%? Are there tax or other pitfalls to taking the lump sum payout?",finance,1476280165

I'm a new federal employee, about 35 years from retirement, and excited about having access to the TSP. Thanks to those who have made some great guides to the TSP here. 

I have about $10k in my previous employer-sponsored account, and I'm trying to workout my options for a rollover. The basic choice seems to come down to opening a Vanguard IRA or rolling into my TSP account. 

Some notes (that I think matter):

* I'm not sure if that rollover counts against the $18,000 limit, but with my scheduled 5% investment, I shouldn't hit the limit anyway. 
* The $10,000 was pre-tax, so I currently do not have any Roth vehicles. 

My questions: 

* The TSP seems great, but is there any benefit to having an outside IRA? 
* Should I consider converting this $10,000 into a Roth TSP so I have both accounts? 
* Any pitfalls to avoid when rolling into the TSP?

personalfinance,"Recently married, buying a house, discovered more debt than I thought","Using a throwaway for privacy.

So, to keep a long story short, I got married a couple of months ago and my husband and I immediately jumped into the process of buying a house. I've been saving up for this for 10 years, and so I knew we were set on the down payment/closing costs front. 

We had an offer accepted on a house, and are now in the underwriting process... however, after seeing everything laid out in our mortgage contract, I learned that my new husband has significantly more debt than what he'd told me before we were married. For reference, we keep our finances completely separate. I'm extremely uncomfortable with the purchase now, and I'm not sure what to do. I've worked very hard to pull myself out of extreme debt, and don't like the thought that if we go through with the purchase, even a minor financial hiccup could result in a foreclosure. Should I tell the loan officer about this? All but our mortgage contingency has been removed, and I'd really rather not lose our $7k good faith deposit.

Here are our finances, separated.

me:

* Income - $4300/mo (after taxes/401k/insurance)
* Savings, investments, retirement - ~ $45k, with $20k going to down payment
* Car payment - $230 (only have one more until car is paid off, and it's worth ~13k)
* Car insurance - $100/month
* Credit card - current balance at $4500, only high because of wedding. Comfortably putting $1200+ towards this per month
* Storage unit - $150/month
* Pet care - $150/month 
* Food - $540/month (only I pay for this)
* Coffee/bars - $75/month 
* Cell phone, internet, utilities - $230/month
* Student loans - $400/month (11 loans totaling $33k, 10 federal and one private )

husband:

* Income - $2600/month (after taxes, no 401k, no insurance)
* No savings or plans to save
* Car payment - $413/month (brand new car purchased 6 months ago, owes ~$27k on it)
* Car insurance - $150/month
* Credit card - $3k balance, I think he's paying the minimum $73/month
* Student loans - $1700/month (14 loans totaling $120k, 6 different companies, all private)

Our current rent is $1200/month, and our estimated mortgage will be $2200/month. I was already expecting to cover the difference in cost (instead of splitting it, like we do now), but he's been unable to cover his half of rent for the last few months. He's also extremely behind on his loan payments, and is basically shuffling them so that he pays each just before they're 30 days late. 

With all of that said, should I tell our loan officer about my current discomfort? I really, really don't think it's smart to move forward with buying a house right now. Is there any way I can get out of this without losing the Good Faith Deposit? Also, HOW THE HELL are we being approved for a house?!",finance,1476288548

personalfinance,(UK) Should I take out a student maintenance loan even if I don't need it?,"Hi Reddit,

I am a UK university student currently undertaking a placement year (internship) with a company.


I have the option to take out a maintenance loan and was wondering if it is worth taking even if I don't need the money.

Key Points about the loan:

* Current interest rate of about 5% (varies year on year)

* Wont have to start paying back until after I graduate and am earning more than £21000

* Will only pay 9% of my salary per month on anything over £21000 - e.g if I earn 22000 - I will only pay £90 a year towards my loan.

* Any remaining debt is wiped after 30 years


Basically, I have been living at home during my first two years at university but still taking the full maintenance loan of about £4000/year despite not needing it (I've actually ended up spending the money on traveling)


The reason I took it is because back in school one of my teachers said ""it will be the cheapest loan you will ever get"".


So - given my situation and the loan conditions, is it worth taking out a loan during my placement year - or even during my third and fourth years too?


Thanks

I had a death in the family and am going to get roughly $130k from a group life insurance payout, $20k from the decedent's IRA account, and $15k from an inheritance payout the decedent was owed.  If it matters I am 31 years old.


Here's my current financial situation:

* $65k yearly salary with max 25% (normally get 10-15%) annual bonus

* $14k in student loan debt at around 4.5% interest

* Zero month to month balance on two credit cards

* Renting a room for $500 a month that covers utilities

* I travel for work 3 weeks out of the month so they cover most of my living expenses

* Maxing 401k match at work + some (10%)

* Small savings account (most money goes to the 14k student loan debt)

* $130k in debt to the Federal Government.  Currently being repaid $600 monthly at *zero* percent interest (I really lucked out here).  This is not related to any type of criminal activity

Goals:

* I want to spend roughly $25k on a car to further my racing hobby

* I want to get my own place.  No more renting


Here's the dilemma.  It would be so easy to cut a $130k check to the US treasury to pay off my debt.  This would free up $600 a month to put towards a house.  But since it is at 0% interest, financially I'd be better off long term if I were to invest the $130k group life benefits.


So now I'm debating.  Should I pay off the 0% interest debt just to be free of it?  If I don't I'll be paying $600 a month for the next 19 years.  


Should I take $100k and purchase a house?  This massive down payment would make the mortgage affordable on top of the $600 monthly payment.  It will also serve as a type of investment that improves my situation over just paying the government off.  


Since I travel for work so much and will for the next 3 years, should I keep my rental situation, keep paying the $600 a month, and invest the $130k into a long term retirement plan?

financialindependence,Does the 4% safe withdrawal rate hold under current market conditions?,"Wanted to share a quick little research project I undertook when starting out my own FIRE journey. The 4% rule is obviously well known, but equally well known is the fact that there are TONS of people questioning the assumptions behind it given the current low interest rate, low dividend, overpriced stock market. Combine that with the crazy volatility we've seen over the last decade and a half and you get a recipe for nervousness. I wanted to see if the 4% would still be likely to hold under the current prevailing market conditions.

All calculations and data sets can be found at the link below:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxIS4j2LOLgzWDBQX2pINzVQTnc

Methodology:

1. Recalculate SafeMax (the highest withdrawal rate you could use for any given retirement year and not run out within a 30 year time frame) from the classic Trinity Study, but in addition run the calculation forward to 2011 (the current extent of Shiller's data set). Given the SafeMax numbers were calculated on 30 year timeframes this presented a problem for any date past 1986. For these dates, instead of calculating SafeMax in the traditional way I assumed the SafeMax rate for these years was the rate that brought the portfolio down to the average level of all previous portfolios being drawn to zero at that age.

2. Build a relatively simple linear regression model to predict SafeMax given a few fundamental variables - shiller PE, current SP 500 year PE, SP 500 dividend yield, and 10 year treasury yield. For those not familiar with it the shiller PE ratio is the ratio of current price to the average of the inflation adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years.

3. Determine the likely safemax for the last few years and current using this predictive model. Essentially taking the current market conditions from the last 5 years, running them through the model and seeing what was spit out.


A few interesting results from all of this:

1. There is likely a new contender shaping up for the lowest SafeMax withdrawal rate. 1999 at the peak of the dot com boom is currently on target to only have a SafeMax of 2%. This is fairly big as the 4% rule is always discussed as a safe point. Additionally 1999 is not alone, there are a number of years over the last decade and a half that all have SafeMax below 4%. Now these might revert back to the mean as we move further out, but given data to date this is the most likely outcome for these years.

2. SafeMax can be reliably predicted using these four indicators. Overall the regression model does a very good job of accurately predicting the final SafeMax for any given year. The match between them is pretty tight. For any statistics nerds the R^2 is 0.57 and the standard error is 1.2%.

3. Prediction for the current year is sitting at 4.3%. So most likely the 4% rate will hold for the folks retiring now, but it will be a more risky bet than in the past.

Now I'll add in the caveat that my wife and I still plan on FIREing in about a year and a half, so we're not too concerned about this analysis and are planning a number of safety margins. But I do want to emphasize that I'm preaching CAUTION here. The 4% rule is thrown around by a lot of folks, and the data suggests were at the low end of that range right now. And if the study that most folks get the 4% number from were run today their result would potentially show 2%.",finance,1476305783
personalfinance,A couple of questions from overseas,"Ok.  So to start with i live in the middle east. Was is syria but actually lived 50/50 (more or less) in UAE.  Now i'm thinking of migrating. Naturally not wanting to get into a lot of trouble i started reading on some of the financial rules in places like Canada,  the US and Australia. 

Thing is i am for some reason having more trouble understanding credit scores and their relationship with everything else.  I mean i understand the basics but going through some of the stories over here is honestly scaring the shit out of me. 

Here in the UAE i'm sure they have a way of deciding who to give a credit card or a loan to but its too easy and there are some security measures to avoid bad debt but it seems in the western word its too excessive. Once you come here getting a credit card can take up to a whooping 30 min if you have half a day you can get over half a dozen credit cards with decent limits and rather low interest rates with only a salary certificate. Loans are a bit longer like a couple of hours and require your salary to be transferred to the relevant bank.

Would a credit score cause you trouble when paying your taxes? Why is it so much easier to manage your financial issues in a country as fluid as the UAE (a lot of people come and go within a couple of years) where risks of bad debt are - i think - much higher; less troublesome? 

Shen i was 25 i was able to get a loan for around 70K USD to be paid over 5 years with an interest rate of 5.99 reducing and this was a personal loan which over here means really high interest rates without collateral i used the money to buy an apartment and just recently closed the loan how would that reflect on a credit report.  More precisely what would the credit score be for someone ""off the boat""  so to speak?. 

Finally how if at all would my credit score be affected if i have over seas accounts? I mean i have a visa/master card credit cards and i'm sure they must at least know what my spending habits are and if i pay my dues. 

Not sure if made my queries clear and thnx a lot for any help in advance.",finance,1476306426

personalfinance,(AUS) Does a Credit Card impact my score if I don't activate it?,"South Australia.

I bought some furniture from a large Swedish Furniture retailer.

I elected to purchase this on a 12 month Interest Free option, which is a credit card with HORRENDOUS rates, but interest free on the initial furniture purchase up to 12 months.

I fully intend to pay the balance in full before 12 months, and have no intention of using the card for anything else, I wouldn't even scratch my ass with it, the interest rate is that bad.

Should I activate it and put it in a drawer, or can I leave it unactivated and just pay it off? I have good credit, but would one day like to buy a house so better credit would help.

At the moment the card is still attached to the paper it was glued to when they sent it to me, I get around 1 message a day from the bank telling me to activate my card. Presumably they want me to activate it so I dig myself a pile of debt, but I'm not that stupid (although I was that stupid a few years ago).",finance,1476307650

I have student loans from the gov, and 2 private companies (fished for better interest rates and whatnot).

So how does that all work for repayment? Will I get 3 separate bills per month or do they consolidate into one larger loan. Each loan has a different interest rate and amount, so I'm confused how this will work.

I've read here on reddit that 100% equities entails a whole lot more risk with very little return difference with say 80/20 stock/bond allocation. I've also read that asset allocation that include bonds tend to do better in the long term. So, my question is, should I have bonds and what percentage? I keep hearing people say there is no point in having bonds because the interest rates are so low, especially for someone my age. I know some people like them as a reserve for dips in market, but to be honest I just want a set it and forgot it type deal (except rebalancing once a year). If I do purchase bonds, what bonds should I buy or look for? Or should I just use a target date fund, I'm just afraid they aren't optimal, but again what the hell do I know. Here are my options:

personalfinance,"Taxes [California, USA]. Filed federal taxes with two different online services, one is claiming I owe 300, the other is not. What gives?","This is a bit convoluted, but I put my tax info into two different companies (ExTaxReturn and TurboTax). One says I owe 300, the other says I do not. 

My income for 2015 was 8550$ (federal income tax was not withheld) from my 1099-G form. I took the standarized deduction of 6300 for both. 

If these details are needed, here's a timeline of what I did:

Started taxes with ExTaxReturn, realized I lost one of my forms and decide to file for extension. Turns out ExTaxReturn doesn't have a federal extension form. But from ExTaxReturn I estimate I owe 300. 

I find out TurboTax does have an extension form, and I file an extension with him, and I pay the estimated 300$ I owe with the extension. 

6 months later, I decide to complete with TurboTax since that's where I filed my extension.  

TurboTax comes up with $10,300.00 Federal deductions and exemptions	 (same as EzTaxReturn). 

In the finally summary page it says ""Based off your income of $8,550 and your deductions of $6,300, you are getting a federal refund of $300. Your federal refund of $300 comes from the $300 of tax you already paid""

I'm like oh, ok, sweet. I go to the final page and it turns out I have to pay TurboTax 54 bucks since I filed with an extension apparently. It says: 

""Why do I need to upgrade?
You made a payment with Extension Request (Form 4868), and that's just one of the reasons the IRS requires you to file Form 1040.

Federal Free Edition only covers simple tax situations (1040EZ/1040A)"".

I'm like hmm, no thanks. I go back to ExTaxReturn. There's a section where I can put the dollar amount if I payed some money while filing an extension. ""Extension amount Amount paid with extension request"", and I put 300. The final analysis comes with no refund (**If I didn't put the 300 I payed with extension down it would have said I owed 300**). I pasted it below. 

""Income	$8,550	

Expenses	$0	

Standard Deduction	$6,300
	
Exemptions	$4,000	Why?

Tax before Credits	$0	

Non–refundable credits	$0	

Total tax	$300	

Payments/Other Credits	$300	

No refund or balance due	""

. .. . I'm stumped. 

I rechecked everything. The obvious error may be in selecting if Tax was withheld but I double checked it. 

In TurboTax there's a section that says ""Federal or state income tax was withheld on this payment."". I selected no. On EzTaxReturn there was a section that said ""Box 4 - Federal income tax withheld"" and I left it blank because that's what it was on my tax form. 

The only major thing that was different was that TurboTax asked for health insurance info. I didn't have health insurance for all the months but TurboTax said my income is low enough not to be penalized. 

tl;dr

So in summary, TurboTax says I can get a $300 refund (for the 300 I payed with the extension) but need to pay 55 in order to get it since I filed for extension. EzTaxReturn is free but I get no refund. I put in the exact same info for both. My income is very simple, 8550 from a 1099-G, no federal tax withheld, I took the standard 6300 deduction and 4000 exemption. Why is there a difference?",finance,1476337621

You can find them here for 6 months

and 12 months
http://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/euribor/euribor-interest-12-months.aspx

So I am buying an apartment and my bank asks me what euribor rates do I want to use, 6 months or 12 months. And this brings and interesting question, which are financially better?

Right now Euribor is minus (which for most banks is fixed for 0 so you dont pay anything extra), which is good, but let's jump a little bit in future when Euribor rates start to rise.

My guess is that it's financially better to have 12 month rates average so even if Euribor starts rising, you don't feel it right away and there is still chance that it might go lower even before you are going to feel it.

On the other hand, if it does go up and starts dropping, it will take longer for these rates to drop.

I had been searching for a place that needed some work to take advantage of the market here as well as get my hands dirty with an immersive project.  I found a great candidate and had money set aside for the renovation but my bank decided to twist my arm with some HOA irregularities during closing which ended up forcing me to put 10% down instead of the forecasted 3% + closing costs. 

    
This put me in a really tight situation financially so I sought out help from family and decided to leverage my credit via 0% credit cards. 

I'm getting to a point right now where I'm closely observing any additional costs (I expect about $5,000 in additional move in costs ) 

I have a general plan for how to handle the budget while avoiding any unnecessary interest charges outlined below but I'm just very uncomfortable managing such a tight budget (~$150 is the difference between current income and expenses)  

So I figured I'd solicit advice from the community on lowest risk approach for me to maintain my sanity.

**TL:DR**

Here's my questions:

**1. Should I forget the extra principal payment right now?** I made a commitment to myself to pay this but I assume the difference will be negligible if I just increase it by 2x once these cards are paid off for the duration I wasn't paying extra to principal.

**2. Should I pay off some of the cards lump sum?** I hate to waste the 0% financing and having cash in my account makes me feel more comfortable incase of emergency. 

**3. Should I just make minimum payments and stash all excess cash, then pay the cards off lump sum before financing runs out?** This feels like it would make me more liquid, but I'm scared that it would create a false sense of security and I might not pay the cards off in time due to other purchases. 

**4. Should I buy a cheap 4 door and drive for Uber/Lyft for supplemental income?** I'm working on selling two of my vehicles, should liquidate about $8,000 which I could leverage to improve my Asset/Expense ratio fairly quickly. If I financed a used car for this purpose could supplement about $1000 a month just driving it. which would probably turn out to be about $600 after insurance/payment.

solar,What are people's experiences with going solar in Pennsylvania (Harrisburg)? Is there a cost savings?,"I've been looking into going solar for a few days (just on a whim) but had a phone conversation yesterday with a rep from Solar Wolf Energy and I was impressed with our conversation.  We discussed installing a 13 kW system at a price of about $35,000  After the federal tax credit, the price comes down to about $25,000.  Monthly payment on the loan ends up being $151.

My average monthly kW usage is 1,311 and my average monthly electric bill is $175 (PPL Electric).  I think I have a roughly $15 distribution charge in my electric bill as well.

Already, this seems like there is about a $9 per month benefit.  He then mentioned SRECs would get me roughly another $750 back each year but I don't know how this works or how to calculate it.  I have heard that the SREC market in PA isn't that good.

Also, I hear you can sell power back to the electric company but if my system is planned to generate 100% of the electricity I use, I'm assuming there won't be much to sell back.  Is this correct?

While I'd *love* to go solar, I don't think it's worth it to put a lien on my house just to save $9 a month.  For those in PA, what has your experience been?  Am I not accounting for other variables?",energy,1476365182

I can surely take that £70,000 back from the (flexible) mortgage and get a better return than 0.75%, but I don't have a clue how to invest it.

personalfinance,"Recent graduate, loads of debt, unemployed and just moved to a new country. Reddit I need your help!","Let me first start this off by saying I have put this aside for a long time. The fact that I have left myself in such a situation is truly upsetting for me. Let me give you all a few background details to understand whats going on.

I am originally from Canada. I recently completed my undergrad in Law and spent the last four years working hard to ensure I could cover my Osap debts. However in the last year I went from having my $30,000 needed to pay it back saved to having just about nothing to my name. A year ago I was in an unhealthy relationship that threw me into a life of overindulgence, heavy drinking, and even at one point drugs. Spending hundreds of dollars each week, combined with buying a car ($6000) and then a new car recently ($15,000) due to a car accident I was a part of (I wasn't responsible), has left me in a bit of a financial pickle. During this time I was working as a server because you can make very decent money doing that in Canada. After I finished my undergraduate degree, I moved back home and started work at another bar, met a girl, and we both have fell head over heels for each other.

Now heres where it gets interesting. She has finished her teaching degree, but needed to find teaching experience, so I urged her to find it, and she did find it, in the UK. Her financial situation is quite well off (at least $90,000) in the bank. Though i'm certain she doesn't know about mine or my debts. We recently made the move over to the UK, I sold my vehicle (took about a $5000 hit), and its cost me just about every dime I had left to do it.

We've been here a month and I still haven't found work. I wanted to find something in the legal field, such as a paralegal, but still have had no luck on any front. Im starting to worry, especially since I will have to start paying back my OSAP next month. My only job experience has been from serving and managing restaurants, and I'm afraid that just isn't enough in Britain (specifically Manchester) because their server culture is quite different and I wont be making $300 a night in tips, let alone $20.

I need your advice, I know I need to talk to my girlfriend and let her know my situation, I don't want her financial help, but I feel like she probably needs to know my expenses, because we have expenses we share together now.

What should I do the second I get a job, how much realistically do I need to make to not be drowning in my debt every month? I also want to plan for the future, but I know I need to figure out this problem now.

My Osap debt is $28,000 (3.5 percent interest rate, repayable over 9 years but would love to pay it off much sooner)
and I have a credit card with $1200
Our apartment costs 825 Pounds a month (roughly $1400 CAN)
and I have a phone bill which is roughly $40 CAN a month, and a internet bill which is roughly $60 a month

I only have $4000 in my bank account left. I need advice, and I need some tips and knowledge about what to do. I swore id never put myself in this position and I feel like I'm slowly drowning. Please help!",finance,1476367289

personalfinance,Agent is recommending I get into a mutual fund with 5.75% load fee. Bad?,"A bit of pretext before I get going. This past March, my parents came to visit, and sadly my mom died in her sleep unexpectedly while at our home. I'm 31, married with two kids under two. It's been rough, but through all of it, she graciously had me as her beneficiary on a $100k annuity she owned.

Shortly after her passing, her agent visited with me to sign some beneficiary papers, and we agreed to meet again in a few months to discuss how to reinvest since we didn't think an annuity at this stage of my/our life was necessary.

Fast forward to a few days ago, and we meet again with some proposals she had generated on where to go from here. Based on our financial portfolio, we decided to go the mutual fund route as that was one of her suggested options. The proposals for mutual funds had listed American funds only (specifically AGTHX, AIVSX)  which after looking into it, have a 5.75% load fee. That fee makes me nervous, and feels more like a ""pay to play"" type scenario.

From what I've gleaned scouring here, I feel like I might best be served going into index funds, not mutual funds. But, not knowing much about investing I don't know what's right and wrong or what to ask. The agent's company lists these fund families as options to choose from: 

    American Funds
    Federated Investors, Inc.
    Fidelity Investments
    Franklin Templeton Investments
    J.P. Morgan Asset Management
    Lord Abbett
    OppenheimerFunds
    PIMCO

Basically, am I sound in my thinking to ask her to research into high quality, low cost funds that don't carry a &gt;5% load? And further, is there anything specific that sets any of fund families above apart that I can use to help form my decision?",finance,1476369277

I am graduating with a BS in physics, a BS in Applied Mathematics, and a BA in philosophy.  5 years, $50,000, for three degrees in my opinion is a great deal for higher education, however still a ridiculous cost I have a difficult time wrapping my mind around.  I have no idea where to start once I graduate.  I understand several, if not all, will have a 6 month grace period, I also understand that I should be focusing on eliminating those with higher interest rates while maintaining minimums on others.  However, I know nothing further.  Is consolidating my federals a good idea?  Should I pay off as quickly as possible, or just work with minimums for years?

personalfinance,A friend asked me about paying off his mortgage early. My response is below. Before I send I have two questions:,"**A friend asked me whether he should accelerate mortgage payments to pay off his loan more quickly than scheduled.**

My response is below. I have one general and one specific question. **First**, any corrections or clarifications you would make to my advice? **Second**, regarding my comments on the impact leverage to changes in house value has on your effective interest rate, I am interested in a general discussion of this effect, how important it is, whether I've articulated it correctly and effectively etc. but in particular, am I right in thinking that if you hold the mortgage to term you do not realize the benefit of leverage to a rising house market? 

Thanks in advance for any thoughts. Here's my response:

**Before paying off your mortgage:**

•	Retire all other debt.

•	Maximize your contributions to tax-deferred retirement accounts

•	Set aside six months’ worth of expenses in medium-term savings.

•	Set up contributions to 529 accounts for kids’ college expenses. Estimate what you need to pay in so that they can go to school using only the funds in those accounts.

•	Set up a fund for car purchases so that you make a monthly car payment in advance and then pay cash at time of purchase. 

**Assuming you've done all the above here’s how I think about your question.**

**Mortgage debt has a couple of unusual characteristics that make it more attractive than other kinds of debt**

- **The mortgage interest deduction** This deduction means that your effective after-tax interest rate is actually lower than the stated bank rate. This is a number worth calculating and you can do so [here] (http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/loan-tax-deduction-calculator.aspx). For our purposes, call this your nominal ‘hurdle rate’.

- **Leverage to changes in house price** - this is potentially far more valuable than the tax deduction but it’s also much harder to predict/analyze and if you don’t sell the house before it’s paid off you don’t really realize the benefit. The basic principle is that you are using bank money to invest in the housing market, which can further reduce your hurdle rate.

**The questions you need to answer then are:**

•	Do you have uses for the money you would use to pay off the mortgage that are likely to earn more than that hurdle rate? 

•	Will you use the money that way?

**My answer to the first question is 'probably yes’:**

•	Investing in the stock market has historically generated ~7% returns on average. 

•	You may have other direct investment or business opportunities. Would they be likely to generate better than 7% after-tax returns, after accounting for your labor and other costs?

**You'll have to answer the second question.**

Ever since I visited NYC in high school, my dream has been to move there. I'm in my upper 20s and I think I am finally at a place where I can make the move but I wanted some advice/input on the amount of money that should be spent on rent and other basic budgeting advice while living up there.   


I bought a house with my sibling for our mom and have been splitting the costs down the middle. I have student loans (not a lot) and have virtually no credit card debt as I pay everything in full every month. Here's the breakdown of my expenses/earnings:  


* Salary: 100k/yr (plus bonuses but with a conservative estimate, let's say I won't get a bonus this year [around 5-10%]) 
* Savings: 45k with 1.05 interest rate  



*  Mortgage: $1100/month
* Phone: $100/month (splitting family plan with my brother as well - mom included)
* Student Loan: $7500 total (paying $250/month)
* Car: $270/month (but don't need to factor this in as I won't have a car living in NYC)
* Netflix: $10/month (the price increase! D: )


That's about it on the absolute expenses that go out for me on a monthly basis.  


I also realize the tax will be higher in NYC with fed/state/city tax combined on my salary.

personalfinance,Looking at an FHA 203k loan for housing repair. What should we be aware of?,"I posted about a week ago asking about the affordability of a house and it looks like it is within our financial means. It appears that we will need to take out an FHA 203k loan. What is different with these? I couldn't find a ton of information on line. Do we need the same percentage of down payment? Is there anything else to worry about? Is there a special type of federal or state grant we can get for revitalizing a distressed property? Also is there another type of loan that we can get where we have a certain amount of time to repair the property and then obtain a normal mortgage?

Today we are checking out the house with two different contractors to give us estimates. As of now we are debating on offering about 80k. Also here is the text from my last post which details our financial situations. Any insight on what we should offer or steps we should take now would be appreciated. 

My wife and I are looking to buy a newer more modern home. We purchased our current home in 2009 and owe 46000 still. The home is valued at 66000. We have a mortgage for 3.5% with payments at 590 with T&amp;I.

The house we are looking at is priced at 109k. Taxes are about 2900 with the home valued at 122k. The house was rented for a few years and the tenants damaged a bunch of the dry wall and appeared to not keep up with the maintenance. Due to this one of the upstairs loft bedrooms has no insulation or dry wall. All the work that needs to be done appears to be cosmetic. Also some vinyl siding has fallen off. We have spoken to two friends who are contractors and they said that there is a possibility of damage under some of the cracked dry wall even though there appears to be no water damage. They have estimated between 2k-10k for the repairs.

My wife and I have no debt besides our mortgage. I make between 50k-60k per year with overtime. My wife makes between 30k-35k. We have nearly no other expenses besides utilities and cell phones The utilities vary and the cell phones are under $100 per month. We have about 14k in savings and about 26k in our joint retirement accounts.
Would this be an intelligent investment for my wife and I to make? Due to the property being damaged they have said that it is not available for conventional financing. Will having to use unconventional financing hurt us in obtaining a loan? Is there a type of loan that we could use to repair the home with less risk? Or is there an agreement line rent to own with a stipulation for repairs and a clause to get a mortgage?

Lastly, both of our cars are decently low mileage and should be adequate for the next 5 years. I'm 31 and my wife is 29. if that matters at all.

personalfinance,Will we ever be able to afford a baby?,"Realistically, will I ever be able to afford a baby (and live comfortably)? Sorry, I'm not sure if this is where to put my post, but I would really appreciate your help.

Hello there,

Looking for ANY financial advice what you'll see in this post. 28 year old here. My husband and I got married recently (yay!) We will be setting up our joint account soon. But my main concern is if my husband and I will ever be able to afford 2 kids here in the Bay Area. I am a research associate, and he is a lawyer at a small firm. I don't have my husband's bills on hand, but here's my monthly bills breakdown:

**Monthly expense**

197.48 FirstMarks (Private) Loan

255.04 Student Loan

311.94 Anthem Blue Cross

26 Dental

95.32 GEICO

40 Gym

910 Rent (total is 1820, but we pay 50% each)

250 Groceries 

60 Gas

**Total: $2,145.80 Bills per month**

My salary is $48,500 (before taxes) and quite low because I live in the Bay Area, in San Bruno, CA. After taxes, each paycheck I take home is $1,519. 

My husband's salary is $102,000 (before taxes). 

**Loans:**

**FirstMarks:** 
Total: $22,815.64 

5.27% variable interest rate
I pay $197.48 monthly

**Student Loans:** 
Total: $15,056

3 loan groups from Loan 2:

A: 3.15% interest rate

Outstanding balance: $8,607

B: 6.55% interest rate

Outstanding balance: $4,289.73

C: 3.61% interest rate

Outstanding balance: $2,158.47

My husband's loans are estimated 40K (not sure how much he pays monthly).  

Another thing to note is we pay rent to his mom (she owns the apartment). She said as long as we live there, she won't increase the rental price. 

We can get on by living in the apartment with the baby, but eventually we want a house. However, I'm pretty sure buying a house is impossible for a longggggg while! That'll be for another post in the future ):

personalfinance,Home loan might fall apart,"In late August I signed a contract on a new construction home from DR Horton and enrolled in their ""Home Buyer's Club"" for their customers with credit scores that need improving. I started with a score of about 550 - 580 and my credit counselor informed me at the end of September that I had ""graduated"" and could on to completing the loan.
 

My credit counselor wasn't very detailed, all he said was that he'd forward along this information to the DHI Mortgage loan officer (Did in house financing with DR Horton to get extra incentives.)




The loan officer that was originally working this deal quit mid September and I had no idea. The new loan officer never got in touch with me so I reached out to them myself a few days ago after no contact from anyone and the moment I got him on the phone he says ""Oh yes I'll push the loan along now, let me send you over some papers to sign electronically."" 


As I look through the papers I see that everything is labeled and structured as an FHA loan. I call back thinking this was just a mistake because I've been going for a USDA loan from the beginning. This is the ONLY reason we chose this area, this subdivision, this builder, this house. Everyone from my realtor, the sales person @ DR Horton, to my original loan officer KNEW this. 

Well the new loan officer says that from what he understood (never spoke to me) this was an FHA loan from the start. This is wrong. But at this point what I say does not matter because according to the loan officer the HBC (HOME BUYER'S CLUB) was also working with that information and graduated me with a credit score of 636 which is good enough for FHA but not USDA. 



He also says that the DTI (debt to income) ratio is not where it needs to be and with a manual underwrite, which is what it would need based on my credit score, this deal would never go through with DHI. But he said I am more than welcome to shop around because another lender might be able to pull it off. 

I asked for hard numbers after restructuring the deal as USDA and not an FHA (to get rid of the higher interest rate and mortgage insurance premium) so I can see and know just how far off the mark I am when it comes to DTI but none was given to me. Just vague words and fluff. 


I contacted a different mortgage lender and they seem more optimistic but he was also realistic in saying that I do not want to give you false hope, but this is no way a crapshoot either. I'm working with very small windows. My credit was increased in a very short amount of time. I have no debts to speak of so no more leverage to really work with to increase my score. I have 1 credit account from conns w/ a balance of 1100 making $91 payment a month and a $300 credit card with a 0 balance since the end of September. 

The house had an ETA of a January completion, pre-drywall inspection can be done at the end of next week though. 


What would you do??? Looking for opinions, guidance, suggestions, anything. 


TL;DR: Mortgage company is now saying I can't do a USDA loan for a house that they originally said would be no problem and tried to bait and switch me into an FHA instead.",finance,1476387705

personalfinance,Minor League Baseball player in need of financial guidance for student loans,"I was drafted in the 31st round of the 2016 MLB Draft out of a small Division III university. I'm one of the very few that made it. I'm a professional baseball player who gets to wake up every morning living his dream. Sadly though, it has come with a bit of stress. For those of you who don't understand college athletics I'll explain it very plainly: Division III athletes don't earn athletic scholarship, and I was there to play baseball, 

Us Minor Leaguers are at the bottom of the barrel, though we get full insurance *during season* and two meals a day for after batting practice and after the game. 

Currently there is a Bill in Congress called the Save America's Pastime Act, below is a statement from MLB explaining it's support for the bill and explaining why we Minor Leaguers aren't qualified for the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
 
&gt; Not surprisingly, Major League Baseball released a statement Thursday supporting the Save America's Pastime Act. It's actually pretty amazing to read. Here's the statement: ""There are approximately 7,500 players in Minor League Baseball. MLB pays over a half a billion dollars to Minor League players in signing bonuses and salary each year. Minor League clubs could not afford these massive player costs. MLB heavily subsidizes Minor League Baseball by providing Minor League clubs with its players, allowing professional baseball to be played in many communities in the United States that cannot support a Major League franchise. Moreover, for the overwhelming majority of individuals, being a Minor League Baseball player is not a career but a short-term seasonal apprenticeship in which the player either advances to the Major Leagues or pursues another career. Minor League Baseball players always have been salaried employees similar to artists, musicians and other creative professionals who are exempt from the **Fair Labor Standards Act.** Like those professionals, it is simply impractical to treat professional athletes as hourly employees whose pay may be determined by such things as how long their games last, when they choose to arrive at the ballpark, how much they practice or condition to stay in shape, and how many promotional or charitable appearances they make."" 

You may have heard that signing bonuses are incredibly high for some of the draftees, including Bryce Harper who made $7,500,000 when he was the first overall pick in 2010; his monthly wages in the minor leagues were the same as everyone else's. Being a Division III college senior with **ZERO** negotiating leverage, my signing bonus was $5,000  - which after taxes came out to just over $3,400. 

&gt; In four years since he signed his first contract, recent call-up Mike Miller has made a total of about $40,000.

&gt; Meanwhile, Major League Baseball's teams took in about $9 billion and paid major-league players in the neighborhood of $4 billion last year.

For my first season I made $36 per game (which roughly accumulates $4 per hour) for our rookie level 72 game ""short season."" As we move up, we will make between $1500 to $2000 per month for full season (142 games) levels A - AAA. 

I report to *unpaid* Spring Training in March, a one month tryout to see what team you make: If I make full season A, AA, AAA I will be paid less than minimum wage for my season for April through September. **IF** I don't make a full season team I will report to Low A in June and be unpaid for March, April, and May while working 8 hours per day at the complex.

I have $50,000 in student loan debt: 

1) 4 loans totaling $19,000 for the Federal Direct Subsidized Loan w/ $104 accumulated interest
2) 4 loans totaling $8,000 for the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan w/ $1000 accumulated interest. 

3) 1 loan totaling $22,000 for the Walton Perkins Loan at $184.39 per month (at 5% annual interest) 

*payments begin on January 1, 2017.

I am trying my best to not default on payments, ruining my credit score. 

I currently have $6000 in savings and will *hopefully* accumulate another $4000 for work during the months of November - February.

financialindependence,"My plan for FI/RE (aka - ""Freedom 35"")","Hi all,

My first post - I did my best to read the rules and FAQ, please politely let me know if I've done anything wrong here.

When I was a kid and learned about interest rates I had a realization that if you had a million dollars, you could get 40K a year in interest (kind of funny that these work out to be the commonly used trinity figures). Ever since then, I've had the ""make a million dollars and retire"" as my financial goal. As a bit of a joke, I call this ""freedom 35"" because of [trailer park boys](http://trailerpark.wikia.com/wiki/Freedom_35).

I'm fortunate to have a good job with stock options worth a decent chunk of change. Unfortunately (in a way), my pay at my new job was double what it was at my old job. All my frugality went out the window when the naive me of a few years ago thought ""omg I have so much money now!"". 

Recently, I've re-gained my focus on my freedom 35 goal*. I started using [YNAB](youneedabudget.com) to better plan my spending. As an added kicker, I got my work to split my paychecks between three bank accounts:

* Enough money to pay my bills going to my joint checking account with my g/f.
* 80% of the remaining money going to a savings account
* The balance going to my checking account.

All money in my savings account is automatically transferred to my discount stock broker, where I then put it in a couch-potato indexing strategy. The joint checking account is to ensure the bills get paid, and the remaining money is for me to spend on ""quality of life stuff"". All of this of course is planned and tracked in YNAB.

What I like about this strategy is:

* It sort of artificially reduces my income, forcing me to live frugally, while also forcing me to save
* I need to closely budget my money, and since I've created scarcity I'm more likely to forego things I don't really need.

I've heard that one of the biggest factors behind early retirement is [your savings rate, as percentage of your take-home pay](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/). So, I'm trying to find every trick I can to skew that number upwards.

A couple of things about my situation to note:

* I'm pretty young still (26)
* I live in Canada
* I rent, and split my living expenses with my g/f
* I don't have a car, but I use a low-cost car sharing program
* I live downtown, so my rent is a bit more expensive but I walk or bike almost everywhere
* I really like my job right now

My ultimate goal is not to retire and do nothing (I'd get bored), but rather to achieve more autonomy - I am a software developer, and wouldn't mind supplementing my income with the odd contracting gig if I thought it was fun. Perhaps I'd even like to run a small business some day.

How am I doing? Any other tips?

business,[Request] Looking for a sane and compassionate attendance policy for warehouse employees,"Hey Everyone,

I am a C level exec for a small business that has an extremely strict attendance policy for all hourly employees. It is a ""no fault"" point system that doesn't allow for common sense or manager discretion.

I want to propose something that's a bit more focused on caring for our employees and weeding out abusers but I don't know what that looks like.

Or on the other hand, if I am the one being unrealistic that such a policy will work, I'd also like to fed a healthy dose of reality.

financialindependence,Have you already FI/REd? Tell us what your tax situation looks like.,"TL;DR: For those who have already FI/REd, please tell us: how much do you pull out of your assets each year and what is your take-home pay?  How has your approach changed over time during your retirement?

==

I've been wondering about the idea of SWRs, and I've read some of the pieces online about the topic.  (No, this is not a post about whether 4% is a realistic number.  There are enough of those, haha.)  It's possible I just haven't found the right ones yet (please share 'em if you've got 'em), but maybe I'm just someone who loves examples!  

Anyhow, I am going to present a few premises and a request.  

Some premises/thoughts:

* whatever your theory about what a truly safe withdrawal rate is-- whether you're comfortable with 4% of NW or some lower number-- we are all aiming to save some multiple of what we will need to withdraw to sustain ourselves when we RE

* an individual's NW goal for FIREing is going to be inversely proportional to his/her tax burden (e.g., if your total tax burden is going to be 20%, then you're going to need to have a NW that is about 25% higher than you would if your tax burden was 0%, since to withdraw $100 will cost you $125 ($125 times (1 minus 20%)  = $100)

* it's not easy to predict one's exact tax burden after FI/REing because it's all a bit of a dance: (1) one's allocation of resources among various kinds of taxable and tax-advantaged accounts (along with the zillion other factors that will affect income &amp; taxes) will be a moving target AT LEAST until FI/REing; and (2) intelligent tax minimization will certainly require shifting among income sources over the course of one's retirement.

The request:

With the understandings and caveats above, if you've already FI/REd (especially if you've been at it for a few years or, better yet, a decade or two), can you please share with the rest of us as much detail as you are willing about what your tax situation is?  For example, ""Each year, I withdraw $-- from my 401k, I pull approximately $-- from dividends from my taxable equity holdings, I earn $-- from renting out a spare bedroom.  The foregoing sources of income are taxable in XYZ ways/ this strategy has XYZ tax consequences.  My overall usable dollars each year are $---.  I pay $--- taxes ($-- state/local and $--- state/federal).  Over the past --- years, my situation has slowly shifted in XYZ ways...""  If you're more comfortable sticking to percentages, so be it, although total dollars may be more useful.  

Obviously, the more details the better, but I don't really care if you're estimating or if you're only willing to share percentages rather than dollar figures.  I'm just trying to wrap my mind around this a little better...",finance,1476402736

My wells fargo banker mentioned to me that they could refinance my car loan one day when I was in the branch. I looked more into this later and the lowest interest rate Wells Fargo has for refinancing cars is 3.91%. The lowest I could probably refinance it with the bank I have the loan with (5/3 Bank) is 3.50%. 

Is it worth it at either of these rates to refinance?

I have no problem paying the monthly cost, the car is my only loan that I have (no student loan or anything else), but of course always looking to save money and would like to cut down the length of the loan.

Right now there are two available options for me and I want to calculate the correct option that will cost me the least amount in total.

That gives me essentially a 6 month loan term to repay the $8000 without incurring excessive interest charges.

No sweat, I can pay that off for certain. What I'm trying to figure out is which promotion is better and will incur the least amount of fees and interest over the 6 month period.

personalfinance,Grad student with debt &amp; student loans don't cover all expenses. Options? Help appreciated!,"Okay, here's my situation. I would really appreciate a PF sounding board!

I am in a master's program for what will end up being a pretty lucrative field if I play my cards right (if I get good experience during my program and if I move to a ""hot"" area for my field after my program ends). I'm viewing this program as an investment of sorts in my future, and, as PF recommends, I've done the math to make sure that, even on the conservative end of my estimate, it makes financial sense to get this advanced degree.

Prior to grad school, my mother was diagnosed with stage IV cancer, so I ended up missing a lot of work and eventually taking months and months of leave to care for her. As a recent college grad, I just didn't have the savings and so I used credit cards to cover the expense. (I'd have handled the financial aspect of this differently knowing what I know now!)

Although I had debt, I knew I wanted to return to school after my mom passed, and so spent a large portion of my paychecks when I returned to work trying to pay down this debt. I paid off my car, as well. I also negotiated lower APRs for all of my cards during this time. I'm due to have them paid off a month before I finish my program. (Of course, I'll have student loans to deal with then, but the interest rates aren't bad.) My credit score has been in the low 700s, although I think it may drop a bit now that my auto loan is paid off and I've taken on student loans.

So now, I'm in my first semester of a two-year program, and these credit card payments are increasing my expenses above the level covered by my student loans. The financial aid office is unable to increase my student loan amount above what they've determined to be the ""cost of attendance"", which is understandable. I have about a year and two months until my program leaves time for full-time paid internships, after which I'll be done with the program.

I have tried to bring my expenses down and I have an assistantship in my program, which knocks out two-thirds of my tuition costs and brings in a couple hundred dollars a month. But I'm short on living expenses by about $400 a month (which is what I'm paying in CC payments). I recently started a serving job to bring in extra money, but I'm finding that - on top of the challenging program and assistantship - it's too much. My grades are dropping, and I'm worried that I'm not getting all from the program that I could be. 

**tl;dr** I need about $400 extra a month *above* my student loan and assistantship income, but another part-time job is detracting from my studies. 

So... advice? I don't want to burnout and not learn as much as I could in my program because I'm working a part-time serving job that's already taking over. But I also have to pay my bills. Are there any other options out there? Private student loans? Maybe a secured loan (considering my credit score)? Other ideas I'm not considering? Or should I just power through?

personalfinance,"Need advice with what is probably a bad ""mortgage"" investment. Modular homes? Trailer park drama to follow.","In advance: Sorry for rambling. We have been going around in circles about our options/issues for months. I'm tired and frustrated and thought you guys may have more sane/knowledgeable advice! Thanks in advance! Included a TL;DR for the short version.

My boyfriend and I bought a Mobile Home about 2 years ago. We had been living in the park, which was ran by a friend's family. We had no intentions of going anywhere; rent was cheap, the neighborhood was relatively nice and low drama, and the landlord was always willing to work with us. We were in the process of getting custody of his son, and I was pregnant, and when I inquired about renting a larger place, we were offered an opportunity that was perfect and fit our timeline. For $75 a month more than what we were paying to rent, we could get a brand new place, twice the size of where we were living, that would be ours. Retrospectively, it was a dumb decision but in the moment, it made sense.

We obviously knew there would be expenses (Insurance, taxes, etc) but we were considering the fact that he had land we could move the house to eventually and save money to build a house on when the time came. We weren't informed that we have to pay taxes to the park for *using* their property monthly, in addition to a rent payment to occupy their lot, in addition to a mortage with what now seems an astronomical interest rate. Instead of $75 a month, our expenses went up about $300, and about 30% of what we pay goes to what seems like erroneous occupancy fees. My hours at work have been cut, and I continue to have fears (after 7 years) about the realistic stability of my job. All the extra crap we are paying that I wasnt able to account for initially, is making it so we are living paycheck to paycheck right now, and savings is beyond minimal. On top of that, our friends who ran the park, retired. Since then, the park has turned into... well exactly what you'd imagine a trailer park in small town Oklahoma to be. 

We are financing through the company that owns the park. At the time, our credit wasnt spectacular, not that it is now, but we've been working to improve it and it's slightly above decent. We are paying 7% interest, and with everything else thats added to our ""mortgage"" I've been looking into ways out or around what we got ourselves into. 

I've considered talking to the property manager and asking what happens if we essentially turn over the house to them. Hypothetically, they don't lose anything, they can turn around and rent or sell the place for as much as they're getting from us, but I dont know if they would require us to find a ""buyer,"" who then has to submit to their background checks as though they are a renter, or if they would just reassume the property. I also dont know if that considered to be a ""default"" on payments. (Obviously all things I intend to discuss with them, but I havent figured out how to bring up.)

We have the option of attempting to refinance the house at which point we could have it moved, but because it's manufactured, the requirements typically (from what I've found online) involve you owning the property the home is on, and having a concrete foundation under said house. We do own land we could put it on, and could have a foundation laid, but we cannot move it until it is paid off. So I'm unclear whether we could even refinance it. So we are sort of torn.

Our other alternative is (assuming we can relinquish responsibility for what we are in now) using the land we own to have a modular house built, get a far larger, far nicer, ""brick and mortar"" style home built for essentially what we are paying now. My only hang up, is the property is somewhat under developed and over grown. I'm afraid the cost to develop the property we have will be higher than we'd like to/be able to afford, and I'm not sure if that would be a great decision, so feedback on that alternative would be greatly appreciated.

Either way, I'm becoming more and more aware I don't want to live where we are, and that we made what is really a bad financial choice. Thoughts?

***TL;DR:*** Was in a bind, bought a trailer house, paying a crap ton between lot rent and ""property taxes,"" to the landlord (about 40% of what we pay montly goes to the landlord, and essentially the rest goes towards our 7% interest) in addition to the taxes we have to pay to the county, and insurance costs. This has left us fairly tight on money because of cut backs at my job. Possibility of refinancing, but some hang ups with who/how we could get it refinanced, due to financing requirements for manufactured homes. Want to move the house, but cant until it's paid off. Possibly able to ""walk away,"" but unsure of the ramifications (credit/debt wise) if we were able to, if any, but I havent figured out a good way to talk to the property manager. (Worst case scenario presentations of issues we could run into would be great.) If we can ""walk away"" would it make sense to pay to have a modular home built and put on the property we have if we have to spend more money to develop the land, from an investment standpoint?",finance,1476420164
personalfinance,Fixed or ARM for HELOC?,"I was approved for a $25k HELOC at either Prime + 1.5% or 5% APR.  

A couple basic questions:  
***Are there strong arguments in favor of the adjustable rate?  
***The monthly payments are interest only.  So if I drew $10k for example, assuming 5% apr, my monthly payments would be $41.67 (= 5%/12 * 10k)?  

***I am thinking of using the HELOC to payoff some federal student loans I have.  Loans are 20 year terms, I am paying I believe about 7% on them.  I know generally people use HELOCs for this purpose but is there any downside to doing this that is often overlooked?

personalfinance,Personal Loan to consolidate Debt?,"Would taking out a personal loan to consolidate our debt be a good idea? I have one BoA CC that I paid down and only have ~2500 on it (10,000 limit/24% interest rate). I also have a chase card with about 2400 on it (3000 limit but it is still in it's 0% interest phase). Lastly, we got this stupid water system installed on the house that I regret but, can't return it now! It's at ~3500 at 9% interest. So, all together ~8,400 in debt. I think I can knock out that chase card before the time runs out. I wanted to get the loan for the BoA and the water thing. The loan would probably be around 10% interest and I would pay more on it than I needed to so I could pay it off early. The loan would be about 6,000 to pay both of those off.

I don't want to get another CC because once we pay these off, my husband needs to rebuild his credit a bit, So were going to get him a card. Right now, our budget that goes straight out to the debts listed is ~600 a month (already using everydollar to try and budget more to throw on there).

I guess what I'm asking is, is that a stupid idea? or should I just pay everything one at a time?

personalfinance,Pay more on current highest interest loan or future highest interest loan?,"Hey everyone, I am a student with 2 student loans. I have $5,200 in a subsidized student loan as well as $2,000 in an unsubsidized student loan.

They are both at 4.29% interest rate, and since the ubsub one already accrues interest, it has already accrued $80 for the duration I have had it.

And for the record I am graduating this spring so the bigger one will start accruing interest soon as well.

In addition to this, I have a balance of about $3,600 on my chase slate. The 0% APR is set to expire in July and then it will probably be something around 20% for whatever balance is remaining.

I have been applying $200 monthly towards my slate to build down that balance and decided to now start taking an additional  $200 out of my check monthly to put towards my smaller student loan that is already accruing interest.

My question is, is this a good strategy? I am worried about what if the slate 0% offer period expires and I still have a balance. Should I be focusing my payments and maybe paying more on the slate? or maybe pay more on the $2k student loan that's actually already gaining interest even though it's only 4.29%?

What is the priority? 

I have also decided to start setting aside $200 a month to start building a savings, should I focus this on payments instead?

I'm looking at buying an Audi A3 e-tron early next year that has a $4500 tax credit. In 2015 my federal tax was roughly $5800 and I don't expect that to change significantly for 2016 or 2017. So, assuming I have the same tax this year and next year, when I file my 2017 taxes, will I basically be liable for $5800-$4500=$1300? 

My monthly tax withholding is set to be a little above that $5800 over the course of the year, so I got a small check back in April this year. If I keep it the same in 2017, will I then get a $4500 check back in 2018? So, knowing that, should I change my monthly tax withholding to get closer to that $1300 number? I'd rather keep money I know I won't owe the government rather than give them an interest-free loan over the course of the year and then get a check back for $4500 in early 2018.

I've accumulated over the past 3 years $60,589 in credit card debt while buying/selling a home and also struggling with bipolar disorder (type 2). This isn't an 'excuse' - I accept full responsibility and want to clean this up. I've sold a house and went from a $1200/month mortgage to a $888/month mortgage. I'm also now on the right combination of meds and have completely stopped impulsive spending. 

I bought YNAB and am tracking all of my expenses for the past month. This has made me realize I'm paying over $500/month in credit card interest. I have *no* late payments or collections, but due to the high DTI my credit scores are only ~660. I am barely scraping by making minimum credit card payments. Working a 2nd job would be very difficult because I have some mandatory overtime and I am salaried (love my job). However, I am open-minded if you have any  outside of the box type of ideas for working a second job. What do I do? I'm in IT and work as a DevOps engineer in a major US city. 

Yesterday my bank account was overdrawn $400 and I used almost all of my emergency savings to cover this.  I bring home $2860 every two weeks. Hopefully I'll get a better handle on this as I get better at using YNAB.

gaming,[PS4] Third time unlucky: how I learned the hard way about preordering,"I'm not a hardcore gamer by any means. Generally I didn't preorder games, as ""collectors editions"" are tat and ""pre-order culture"" can be disgusting (hi Ubisoft!), but occasionally I did- this is the story of my recent three utter failures.

* **Star Wars: Battlefront.** I should have known better. I *hate* most multiplayer games, and hated the leak of Battlefront: Online in 2010. But I was suckered in by the gorgeous graphics, trailers...and promise of ""deep, highly replayable single player missions"". So I preordered the Amazon steelbook. Oh dear. Still, finally, I have Skirmish to play now- I should have waited the year, or at least a couple months. 

* **No Man's Sky.** There's not much to say here as its been done to death, but suffice to say that the initial leak (from the guy who spent $1500) showing the concept (mostly) working, combined with the misleading trailers, pushed me to order a week before release. I'd sold it on after 4 days.

* **Rise of the Tomb Raider**. After two poor calls in judgement, this seemed easy. I loved Tomb Raider 2013, and this had all the same things going for it except a recognised problem with input lag on X1. No problem, I thought; Nixxes were porting this, and they did TR13 Definitive Edition, and they fixed the lag issue on X360 and PC. To wrap it off, Digital Foundry said in a preview of the game that issue ""seemed"" fixed.
It wasn't.
Now I have a game which looks stunning but is a cow to play- where in TR13 combat was tight and fun, now aiming is such a chore and unresponsive I'm finding myself fed up with fighting against the game. Again: should have waited.

If you read all this, thankyou; it's easy, but lazy and unhelpful to simply say DON'T PREORDER GAMES. I wanted to share a) why I did, and b) why I never will again. No matter how good a preview, or a studios' previous work, in this generation of gaming it's just not worth it.",technology,1476448106

So, I am not proud to say that I am in considerable student debt. It hurts to even think about the number. It was not until grad school that I got smarter and started to work my butt off to limit the amount of debts I took to go to school.

I have recently graduated and put myself on an affordable repayment plan where I could have everything paid off in 10 years (~$1000-1100 a month). Great! However, I just learned that when factoring my monthly loan payments, Navient did not include the ones that were in grace period; coming out 6 months from now. Come Feb-March, my loan payment will increase by about $500+ a month. Bad! This was a little demoralizing to hear.

**My current plan** - Stick to my 10-year payment plan for the next 6 months (Paying ~$1000-1100 monthly). When my loan payment increases, I will ask for a repayment plan that's based on my income to reduce the monthly rate, BUT I will continue to pay what I was initially paying (or a little less given the increase) so this doesn't follow me for the next 25-30 years. I was told by Navient that when you do a repayment plan based on income, they lump all loans together, so I don't know if I can only have it apply to the ones coming out of grace in 6 months.

*ANYWAY*

There are many different loans of varying amounts and interest rates. A few of the loans are quite small as you can see from the list below. I have about $18.5K in savings collecting interest that I've been saving for many years. Also, 5% of my annual income (55K) is put into retirement, which my employer matches. I was wondering if I should use some of my savings money to pay some of these smaller loans outright, or if it would be wiser to let the account keep collecting interest (.75% a month). Also, does my plan make sense?

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you so very much for helping to reduce stress.

fintech,Microsoft and Banco Votorantim Partner on Brazil Fintech Venture,"Microsoft Corp and Brazilian lender Banco Votorantim are investing together in financial technology startups, executives said in a Monday interview, as the U.S. tech company adds a new specialty to its venture capital portfolio in Brazil.  Votorantim will invest an initial 3 million reais ($930,000) in the BR Startups fund created by Microsoft, with an expectation of funding about a half dozen young firms with investments ranging between 250,000 reais and 1.5 million reais.  The partnership underscores how Brazilian banks are looking to ride a wave of innovative financial startups, known as fintechs, which caught peers in more mature markets off-guard over the past decade.

The company is  looking for startups that have passed the validation and product development stage and need capital to scale up and gain traction in the market.  Those young companies are likely to fall in a valley of death between early seed capital and the larger rounds led by traditional venture capital firms, according to Franklin Luzes, chief operating officer of Microsoft Participações, the U.S. company's Brazilian investment arm.  Luzes said ""Microsoft set up BR Startups in 2014 to fill that niche and the fund has now grown to 17 million reais, backing about 70 startups and steering six to acquisitions"".

Funding has become especially scarce in Brazil in recent years as interest rates climbed to a decade high amid the country's worst economic recession since at least the 1930's.  BR Startups has focused this year on partnerships with anchor investors such as Banco Votorantim to focus on investing in their areas of expertise, Luzes said. The first such venture came in July, when the fund partnered with Monsanto Co to invest in agribusiness startups.

I've got a part time hobby/job that can (inconsistently) bring anywhere from an extra $300-$1000 a month. 


**SAVINGS &amp; RETIREMENT**

We've got about $15-16k in saving at a federal credit union but don't touch it so I've been thinking about moving it to a high-interest (1%) account with an online bank. The account hasn't grown in almost 2 years because we have no extra money to put in it!

I just started a new 401k with Fidelity (via work) and have about $2500 in it (contributing $223 per pay) and another $25k or so sitting in a Mass Mutual IRA I need to roll over. 

I have $250k worth of ESOP stock with my company and an additional $25k is contributed (at no cost to me) every year. The stock value historically has increased by about 8% year


**DEBIT &amp; BILLS**

Just over three years ago we bought a house that is currently worth about $410k and we have $363k left on the mortgage with a monthly payment of about $2250. We expect our house value to rise (some amount in the low 5-figures) over the next year or two due to some development activity nearby. We have a (transition-able) 10 year historic tax credit that saves us about $6k/year in property taxes and that expires in 2023. We're going to move our of the city into be burbs soon but unfortunately where we live you either pay cheap prices for homes with TERRIBLE schools or expensive prices for some of the best school districts in the country so I don't see us getting another house for less than $350k 

We have two newish (2013 and 2014) cars with monthly payments of about $250 each, with around $10k each to pay off. Insurance for both combined is about $250/month 

My wife also has some grad school loans but we've gotten them lowered to only about $50/month 

No home phone, no home internet - we use mobile phones for everything and pay about $95/month for that (work reimburses most of my monthly phone bill)

Our city gouges us with utilities (approx $350/month) and water (approx $250/quarter) 

I've been trying to manage a budget using MINT to pull all my accounts together but it is looking bleak... So far the monthly bills take up about 75% of our income and we still haven't bought groceries/diapers, gas, etc... we rarely eat out or buy things for ourselves and by the end of some months I need to dip into savings to pull out an extra hundred or two to get by and then I try to put the money back as soon as I am able to so we never really increase our saving account - just sort of maintain it for now but our expenses are only going to continue to grow with our kid (and we've already had to have the terrible ""we can't afford a second kid right now"" conversation) 

whew... wow that is a lot to stuff.... never really laid it out like that before so I'd appreciate any advice you can offer.


EDIT: I understand why everyone's reaction about my wife stopping work but you have to appreciate how hard it is to be a teacher for our city school system. For six years she was working 6am-5pm at a title 1 school dealing with junkie parents, fights, guns in backpacks, kids who hadn't eaten since they left school the previous day,  etc.... She'd come home exhausted, often in tears and was completely burnt out. Im the son of an overworked teacher who had a mental breakdown from the stress of the job so it was as much my choice as hers to not put her through all of that and stay at home and I don't regret the choice but we just didn't expect the other job to fall through.

Also I should clarify - no city school teacher takes home $50k, that was the pretax amount.",finance,1476464141

http://fox43.com/2016/10/11/navy-federal-credit-union-mislead-members-will-pay-23-million-to-victims/

Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) took action against Navy Federal Credit Union for making false threats about debt collection to its members, which include active-duty military, retired servicemembers, and their families. The credit union also unfairly restricted account access when members had a delinquent loan. Navy Federal Credit Union is correcting its debt collection practices and will pay roughly $23 million in redress to victims along with a civil money penalty of $5.5 million.

""Navy Federal Credit Union misled its members about its debt collection practices and froze consumers out from their own accounts,” said CFPB Director Richard Cordray. “Financial institutions have a right to collect money that is due to them, but they must comply with federal laws as they do so.”",finance,1476465716

I went through the links in the sidebar and didn't find anything that quite answered my question, but did find it curious that balance transfers put a hard inquiry on your credit score.

**MasterCard**

* $4300 balance
* $5000 limit
* paying $250/bi-weekly ($500/mo)

**Visa**

* $920 balance
* $1000 limit
* paying $50/bi-weekly ($100/mo)

By the time my next paycheque, I could technically transfer my Visa balance to my MasterCard, and close the Visa account. Are there any positives to doing this? Any negatives, other than the hard inquiry on my credit score?

personalfinance,Selling home at a loss,"I'll try to give as many details as possible, but not get too wordy here.  My wife and I bought our home in the summer of 2005 (pretty much near the apex of the housing boom) for $340K.  Over the years we have made many improvements to the home (remodeled kitchen, remodeled bathrooms, new windows, new HVAC, etc.) all of which have theoretically increased the value of the home.  I'd say we have probably pumped another $70K+ into the house which means that our initial $340K home has now increased (meaning our personal investment) to about $410K.  We recently went thru a mortgage refi and our house was appraised at $315K ($25K below what we paid for it 11 years ago and about $100K less than ""our investment"").  In a perfect world, we would like to move into a bigger home, but would hate to take this big of a loss on the sale.  Now, based on what we actually owe on the house, we would still walk away with cash, but if you base the sale on our overall investment, we'd be losing out on about $100K+.  Needless to say, it hurts.

Now, I know you cannot claim a loss on your taxes due to the loss on a sale of personal property, but you can claim the loss on the sale of investment property.  My question is, what if we were to rent out our home for a couple/few years, then sell it?  Assuming that we would still be selling at a loss (I don't anticipate the housing market to drastically increase over the next few years) can we now claim the loss because it is no longer our personal residence?

If not, our options are to either suck it up, take the loss, and move on.  Or we stay put and try and make it work in our current home (perhaps looking into expanding).

EDIT:  More info...we have actually refinanced a couple of times (both times to reduce interest rate).  We initially purchased the home with a rate of 5.875%.  It was interest only the first 10 years, but we still put in extra in order to pay down the principal.  We refinanced in 2014 to get the rate down to 4.75%, but we reset it at a 25-year term.  So we ended up adding about 4 years or so to the initial term (even though we extended the term, we were still going to save money on the interest savings).  Then we just closed on another refinance this summer in order to reduce our rate again to 3.75%.  With this refi, we kept the term exactly the same...so we have about 22.5 years left on the mortgage.  That being said, we're not paying this house off for a long time.",finance,1476473927

My dad reversed mortgaged his house when there was a spike in the interest rate, but now it's gone down and I'm trying to talk him into refinancing it back into a normal mortgage that I'll help him pay off. The problem is, the house has water damage on the roof and since it's over 50 years old with no records of preventive repairs, may have other host of problems. (His also blocked off the play room to add another room without a permit ;-;)

I know to get the loan, they'll learn of all this and I'd like to get a head start on everything. I want to get the value of the house as is, along with the value it would have if fixed up, the cost it would take to fix it up, and presenting it to the lender. These are the steps I plan to take and I'd like to know if it's the right ones to take, and any possible pitfalls I may face.

1. Get an inspection done, not sure which kind. A general inspection or an engineer's inspection?

2. Contact contractors who specialize in home restoration and/or home repair, give them a copy or the inspection report and get an idea of the cost it would amount to get the house up to code standards.

3. Order an appraisal to see the value of the house as is and when restored when compared to the value of the homes in my area.

4. Add the cost of the repairs with the total mortgage he has left, hopping it's less then the worth of the house after it's repaired.

5. With all that information in hand, get in touch with a leader and be up front with what I have planned with the refinancing.

Does that sound good? Do you think my father will have any legal problems with the added room to the home which was originally 3 bedroom and now has a 4th?

I want to start investing. However, I don't want to try to beat the market with stocks (I don't think I could even if I tried). I just want to something where I can put money in an account when I can and watch it grow with compounding interest. I'm hoping for 7-10%.

Right now ETFs sound more appealing because it seems like I can get my money back if I need it for some reason, but I'm not even sure if that's true.

Could anyone give me some recommendations given my current situation? I really don't have anyone to talk to about this sort of thing, so I highly appreciate your willingness to help!

- I'm 23
- I live with my parents right now and don't have a steady income yet, but do make at least a couple hundred bucks a month that I can spend on basically whatever I want
- My only real objectives with the money are seeing it grow an average of 7-10% each year
- I'm not sure what my risk tolerance is because I'm not sure what the risks are. I think I would just rather know how high my risks would be if I'm looking for a 7-10% compounding interest.
- I have like 30k in college debt, and some of the loans have an interest rate of 6.8%... Should I just wait until I'm left with only lower interest rate loans before investing?
- I would like to invest no more than 1-3k for starters (unless someone has a compelling argument for me to invest more)
- I already have an emergency fund so I'm not worried about that

Finally I have two more random questions:
- Lets say I was saving for a big purchase in the next 1-3 years and I'd like to invest some money for a short period of time (1-3 years)... What are my options? What returns could I expect?
- Everyone is saying that I should put money in an IRA, and it almost sounds like it's no risk at all. Is this true?
- If an IRA is low or no risk, what is the point in putting money in an index fund? Is it just higher risk, higher return? What are the risks?

My husband and I had a child this year and as a result, I want to update my W4; however, I've filled out the worksheet that accompanies it and it's telling me I should be budgeting to pay an extra ~$3,000 in taxes.  We've typically gotten large refunds (about $5,000 per year from federal taxes) so, I'm just not understanding the result I'm getting. 

Some details: This is the first year in a while, where my husband has been employed for the entirety, so he is earning more than in the past.  His income is ~$37,000 (compared to ~$15,000 in the past). I make about $115,000 a year, however it's a government job and I pay into a pension.  So my taxable income is about $96,000.  We now have 1 child.  We are planning on filing jointly and using standard deductions. 

I understand that because my husband is earning more now we'll be paying more in taxes, but I'd assumed that would mostly be covered by the withholdings from his paycheck.  Also, for reference, my current W4 still shows my status as single and only has 1 withholding.  My husband says he changed his to married and 2 withholdings.

Car is paid off, and my fucking amazing parents pay my cell phone and car insurance until I can get back on my feet. My monthly expenses are:

- **Rent:** $1100. In a lease until May, not much I can do about this.

- **IRS payment plan:** $136.81 (back taxes from contract position, started out owing 13k and got it down to about              1,000 after deductions and just communicating with them)

- **Credit card:** $50 a month with about a $750 balance. I plan on paying more on this once I start getting paid   more. 

- **Gas:** $60 a month, probably going to increase with my new commute

- **Food:** $120 a month, max.

Now... the worst part. Student loans. Most of these enter repayment in Dec/Jan

- **Wells Fargo:** $7,325 @ 6.99%, 66.81 min payment

- **Sallie Mae:** $4,589.24 @ 9.375%

- **Sallie Mae:** $3,997 @ 10.00%

- **Sallie Mae:** $3,607 @ 9.625%

- **Perkins:** 4,000 @ 0% (Repayment starts in April)

- **College Access:** $9,968 @ 5.25%, $107 minimum payment

- **Texas B-On-Time:** $22,830 @ 0% and being forgiven for GPA!

- **Federal via Nelnet:** $26,197 with 4-6% interest rates.

I have a bank CC with $1000/2000 on it at 11.9% APR. I have a PayPal line of credit with $1755/2000 on it at 19.9% APR. I also have a CareCredit card with $400/1000 on there which is on a 0% interest rate for another 9 months, that I am making $50 payments on until it's done. I know I should have been focusing on the PayPal one with more interest but I wanted to get my bank card paid off so I can start using it to increase my credit score and eventually have my limit raised. 

My credit score on Mint says it is 641 as of six weeks ago or so. I saw that through the app that Chase offers the Slate card with a $0 balance transfer fee, 0% APR for 15 months and no annual fee. I was wondering if this is something that I should try to apply for and then transfer over my PayPal Credit balance to so I can make payments on it at no interest.

I mainly wanted to get my bank CC paid off before the new year but if I should focus my attention on the PayPal line then that's understandable. If I was able to do the balance transfer I imagine I would have it paid off 12 months at the max but aiming at 6 months or less.

Her mother just gave her $20,000 to pay off all of her debts, so she has no debt at this point.

personalfinance,"Itemized deductions, pre-tax 401K allocations, and taxes... Oh my! Help estimating 2017 taxes. (x-post r/taxes)","**tldr: Trying to estimate my 2017 taxes so I can change my allowances and pay only what I'll owe. Check my logic please!**

Why am I thinking about 2017 taxes when we haven't even finished 2016? Well, I am aiming to do two things with my money in 2017:

* Max my 401K contribution at $18K (I've never been able to do this before because I was reducing debt / saving for a house)  
* Either pay off my student loans completely OR put extra $ toward the principle of my loan  

To make enough room in the budget for this I am going to tweak my allowances for 2017 to reduce the federal tax I pay each month (and have more $ in my paycheck each month rather than a refund at the end of the year). I'm hoping to get close to break even, and at worst not owe more than $1K come tax time. 

I bought my first home this year and I know I can combine the interest write off from my home and maybe also some pre-tax 401K contributions to reduce my tax burden. But I've never done this before so I am looking for a gut-check/feedback on my plan. 

The basics: I am single, have no dependents and am not anyone's dependent. I am a full-time, salaried employee and I don't make any additional income on the side. I make $100K/year before taxes.

By my estimate this puts my federal taxes at about $18K with the standard $10,300 deduction ($4K exemption for myself, plus $6.3K standard deduction). I'm going off 2016 tax bracket info found here: [2016 US Tax Brackets](https://www.irs.com/articles/projected-us-tax-rates-2016).

My mortgage interest will be ~$10K for 2017. Since this is greater than the standard deduction I am planning to go to itemized. Since I'll be itemizing my understanding is I can also deduct my real estate tax and my state income tax. Am I calculating my new taxes correctly below? I know the tax rates will change somewhat for 2017 so these are just estimates off 2016 numbers:

* Personal exemption: $4,000  
* Mortgage interest deduction: $10,000  
* Real estate tax deduction: $2,500  
* State Income Tax Deduction: $6500  
* Total deductions: $23,000  

At 2016 tax rates this would reduce my 2017 taxes to ~$15K. Does this look right to folks? 

* $100K - $23K = $77K taxable income  
* Tax rate = $5,183.75 plus 25% of the amount over $37,650  
* Amount over $37,650 = $39,350 * .25 = $9,837.50  
* Total tax = $5,183.75 + $9,837.50 = $15,021.25  

One final variable to throw in there is that I can also reduce my taxable income by making my 401K contributions pre-tax. For example, if I allocate 9% pre-tax that knocks my taxable income down to $91K/year and I *think* that means my federal taxes go down to ~$13K. 

So, what say you PF? Do I understand how taxes work? Help a girl estimate her taxes and meet her financial goals!

*****

&gt; ###Corporate earnings, economic reports and Fed speakers could all challenge markets in the week ahead, but traders will be on guard for the latest catalyst — the potential bombshells coming from the presidential election.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Earnings are expected from about 80 S&amp;P companies, including Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, McDonald's and American Express. According to Thomson Reuters, earnings for the S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to be nearly flat for the third quarter — down just 0.4 percent after a year of negative earnings reports.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Data in the coming week includes industrial production Monday, the Fed's beige book Wednesday, but most importantly CPI consumer inflation data Tuesday, after producer prices perked up more than expected in September.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Stocks in the past week were lower, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 1 percent at 2,132, the Dow down 0.6 percent at 18.138, and the Nasdaq off 1.5 percent at 5,214. In the past week, the market became vulnerable for the first time to the idea that Donald Trump's controversial behavior and sparring with Republicans could hurt GOP Congressional candidates.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###While traders give it low odds, there was speculation in the past week that Democrat Hillary Clinton could sweep in with Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. The conventional thinking is that Clinton will win and Republicans will hold one if not two houses. Markets prefer gridlock over one party control, especially Democratic control since they are viewed as more likely to adopt stiffer regulations and less favorable tax policy.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Trump has fallen in the polls since the revelation of a tape where he was making lewd and aggressive remarks about women. The final presidential debate is scheduled for Wednesday night.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: October options expiration prone to wild swings**
&gt; Since 1994, the Monday of options expiration week has a bullish bias for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Expiration day however, tends to be mixed with average losses across the board even though S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have advanced more often than not. Entire expiration week and the week after also lean bullish. Of note is the small-cap index streak of 13 straight advances from 1994 through 2006 (not shown, the streak is actually 17 years starting in 1990) and it has been down in six of the last nine years. October’s reputation for volatility can be seen with wild daily and weekly swings in the tables below. Weekly moves in excess of 5% occurred in 1998, 2002, 2008 and 2011.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: DJIA performs best under newly elected Democrat Presidents**
&gt; In the below chart, “All Post-Election” years since 1953 is the baseline to which “All 1st Elected,” “Dem 1st Elected,” and “Rep 1st Elected” are compared. “All 1st Elected” years are the first years of a new president. “Dem 1st Elected” are first years of a new president that was a Democrat and “Rep 1st Elected” are new Republican presidents. For the first half of a post-election year all four are quite close. Under 1st Elected Democrats DJIA was weaker in January and February on average as a result of early losses in 2009. By the end of July DJIA’s performance begins to show significant deviation and by the end of the year DJIA has performed best under a newly elected, 1st-year Democrat. Should polls hold and Hillary Clinton become the next President, DJIA’s performance in 2017 could resemble the green line. If Donald Trump can defy odds and polls then DJIA could follow the path of the black line.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my house?,"I bought a house in Portland, OR in March of 2015 for $292k. I put down my 3% and at the moment I owe about $270k on it. The housing market in Portland has been BANANAS since I bought. Zillow estimates it's worth $411k now. I know Zillow can't be relied on for supreme accuracy, but I do recall it estimating about $290k when I bought the place, so I assume it's in the right ballpark. I plan to look at recent sales of similar houses in the neighborhood to kind of fact check that, but I haven't gotten around to it just yet. 

Anyway, when I bought the place, I chose a weird financing option that I'd never heard of before that basically allowed me to take a slightly higher rate instead of paying PMI. My interest rate is 4.5% and my credit is good. I just refinanced my car (hated the old bank) and when they ran my credit, my score was 800. I make good money and am generally considered low risk. 

My knowledge of how stuff like this works is pretty thin. This is the first home I've ever owned. I'm wondering if it makes sense to refinance for two reasons: first, I've heard a bit about how rates are stupidly low right now. Possibly even lower than when I financed originally. Also, and correct me if this is not how this works, but I'm hoping that if the house appraises for an amount that's high enough over what I owe on it, then I technically have enough equity to not need PMI (or the higher rate I took in lieu of PMI). The second big reason I'm thinking about it is that I want to see if I can get away with (and if it makes sense to) financing $20-30k more than I currently owe so that I can do some big projects like new floors, appliances, landscaping, etc.. 

My questions are: Does it make sense to do this right now? Should I expect to have to go out of pocket for any of the costs (closing, appraisal, etc..)? Can I get a big hunk of cash to do the projects I want to do? Do the numbers sound like they work out with regard to not needing PMI?

•	Start the game and choose your bending class; earth, water etc. Design your character like in Fallout or Elder Scrolls.

•	Level up to learn stronger techniques in the bending class you chose. 

•	Different weapons and armor from different tribes boosts their respective bending types. Fire Nation armor would have buffs for fire techniques. Similarly, as you progress fire nation weapons can be buffed with flame, water tribe weapons with ice or water attacks etc.

•	Every class has some crazy second level shit once you master all the basic stuff. A master fire bender can use electric attacks. Master water benders can use blood bending. Earth masters can bend metal and air masters can alter wind currents and fly.

•	All kinds of crazy monsters and bandit gangs like in the show.

•	Map is huge with cities like Ba Sing Se, the Fire Nation Capital and other cool shit like the Boiling Rock.

•	Fire Nation invasion is more of a setting than a major plot driver, much like the Stormcloak rebellion in Skyrim. You can join the Fire Nation or the tribal resistance. If you side with the resistance, the fire lord is a final baddie. If you move up in the Fire Nation you have to face Aang or someone who looks like him and is an avatar.

•	More mature than the show. Bending techniques are brutal and aspects of real life society are present in the world; taverns with prostitutes, crazy Fire Nation mass executions and torture, that sort of shit.

•	When you beat the main storyline, you unlock avatar mode where you get to begin mastery of the other 3 elements you didn’t choose.

I would like to lower my federal income taxes with the 401k contribution. Do you think it's possible to max both? Or should I max out the Roth and just a little for the 401k?

personalfinance,Priorities in loan refinancing?,"I am refinancing a loan ($13291 remaining, currently through Wells Fargo, at a variable rate of 7.49%) through Earnest. There are a number of ways they will allow me to structure the repayment. Here are four options I'm looking at:

&amp;nbsp;

A - 4.90% variable rate over 5 years, with payments of $265/month 

B - 6.03% fixed rate over 5 years, with payments of $265/month

C - 5.55% variable rate over 16 years, with payments of $110/month

D - 7.04% fixed rate over 19.5 years. Payments would be $110/month.

&amp;nbsp;

With that said, I have four questions I'm trying to sort out:

&amp;nbsp;

1 - I understand the interest rate is at a near record low right now, and is bound to raise at some point. However, I expect to pay the loan off within 3-5 years, barring any unexpected dips in income. **Given that, would a fixed or variable rate likely be a better bet for me?**

2 - I plan on putting about $600 a month into the loan regardless of which repayment strategy I choose. There is a part of me, however, that is afraid of committing to an extra $150 per month (265-110), in case disaster strikes. I've played with unbury.us a bit, and the numbers aren't that different. **But still, would I be unwise to prioritize flexibility? Should I instead opt for the lowest interest rate possible?** (I'm not taking into account the psychological edge of being forced to pay more, because I've done well with that.)

3 - I'm also paying off some back taxes to the IRS (~$9500 left). The effective APR after all the penalties is around 7%, so I'm also unsure which debt if more important to pay off first. In spite of the higher interest rate with the IRS, and the fact that it's the IRS, I'm biased towards paying the loan off faster regardless:  The IRS does not show up on my credit report, and I want to continue improving my credit score more than I want to be out of debt with the IRS. They have been fine to work with, and are probably more flexible than private loans anyhow. But, am I wrong? **Are there compelling reasons I should prioritize the IRS higher?**

4 - I have two other variable-rate loans, at 4.27% and 4.27%. **If I should go for a fixed rate with the loan in question, should I also look at refinancing these loans into fixed-rate loans?** Or, given the relatively low rates, should I not worry much about that?

Now I am concerned my pension is just ""not enough"" so i want to save for retirement with a 403B / Roth perhaps. 

My only concern is that I dont have any fluid cash, and now multiple times I have needed cash for something and its really bad feeling having no savings, even though im ""saving"" for retirement.

Now my benefits at my current job give me 3yrs parental leave, co-pays all reimbursed, sick bank of 150 days after 7 years at the  job, 1 year sabbatical every 10 years. So i think i landed at a fantastic place.

 But for now I dont have much fluid cash. I think I will be getting a raise next year from  about $57K to about $68,000. HOWEVER next year I will start to pay my student loans ($47,000) so that will be an extra $400 per month, so that wipes out the raise pretty much, sucks. Loans will be forgiven after 10yrs of payment through PLSF.

Is there anything I can do to possibly increase income from my pay, could I change my tax withholding? I have it at 0 right now, i dont care about a big tax refund, need more cash per month right now.

Rent is already pretty low for where I live, If i move to somewhere real sketchy i could get rid of the subway cost, but not willing to relocate and be less safe. 

I am thinking of a summer job to get more money. I just want to be very responsible and feel like im not doing ""enough.""

financialindependence,Roth 401k vs Mega Backdoor Roth IRA and RE,"Edit: /u/tinyvices has pointed out an (large) error in my understanding of the way the 55 rule for 401k withdrawals works, making this post mostly useless. You can read and comment if you would like anyway.

 
#My Options

My employer's plan includes the option to make traditional after-tax contributions up to the $53k annual limit. In the plan, there are two methods (that I can see) to convert this money to Roth and get a tax advantage:

* Twice yearly in-service distributions to a Roth IRA
* Immediate in-plan conversions to Roth for after-tax contributions

I am trying to figure out if and how these options differ for me in any practical sense, given that I would like to retire early. I realize that I will likely incur some taxes doing the distributions to the Roth IRA. The investment options are substantially similar. For the moment, let's assume that these two factors do not impact the decision - the question is simply, where would I prefer to have the money?

#As I understand it, here are the features of each. Please correct me if any of this is wrong!

###Roth 401k

* Cannot access contributions without penalty until age 55
* ~~Can access contributions and earnings penalty-free at age 55~~ Can access contributions and earnings penalty free *if you retire at age 55*. If you retire earlier, you must wait until 59.5. Thanks /u/tinyvices
* Can roll over into a Roth IRA at retirement to gain penalty-free access to contributions
* Earnings are not tax free until age 59.5

###Roth IRA

* Contributions are immediately liquid
* Earnings are tax-free after 5 years
* Penalties apply to earnings until age 59.5

# The Plan

###Other Investments

* Max out pretax 401k contributions
* Max out Roth IRA contributions
* No substantial taxable investments

###Retirement Strategy

I think my best plan is to distribute the after-tax 401k contributions into the Roth IRA twice per year. This allows me to build up a large contribution base that I can withdraw from. I can then roll *a portion* of the pretax 401k contributions into a traditional IRA at retirement, and begin the Roth Conversion Ladder.

Depending on when I retire and how much I contribute to the Roth IRA (directly and via the 401k), I expect to have more than five years of expenses in contributions saved. This would allow the ladder conversions to pile up a bit and extend my penalty-free withdrawals, even if I choose to convert less than a year's expenses each year. I would have to evaluate the exact amounts to convert and how much of a tax hit to take when I get there, but the plan is to get to 55 living off of contributions and conversions only.

At 55, I would use the (now penalty-free) money in my 401k to live off of until 59.5. The remaining contribution/conversion base left in the IRA would be spread out over these 4.5 years in order to minimize the tax burden. I haven't run any numbers, but I expect the optimized plan would draw an amount from the 401k equal to the Traditional-&gt;Roth IRA conversions being done in the ladder. At any rate, the amount left in the 401k would be designed to bridge the 55-59.5 age gap. Roth Ladder conversions would stop during this time.

At 59.5 I would resume the Roth Conversion Ladder to minimize my future tax, while living off of the Roth IRA earnings.

###Alternatives Considered

* **SEPP** My first thought was that, if SEPP didn't give me enough to live off of, maybe I wasn't FI after all. But the interest rates seem very conservative, and I'm not convinced that's actually the case. This may still be a viable option if the interest rates go up and/or I decide to opt for a conservative safe withdrawal rate. I do not believe the 401k vs IRA decision impacts this option, aside from differences in taxes and investment options which I am neglecting at this stage.

* **Roth 401k, Roll Over at Retirement** It looked like using in-plan conversions and then rolling over to an IRA at retirement would give me the flexibility to re-evaluate the plan down the road. However, because I want to use 401k money to bridge the gap from 55-59.5, this would require me to leave an equal proportion of the Roth contributions in the 401k, which would reduce the contributions and conversions available to get me to 55. On the other hand, at 55 the Roth contributions remaining in the 401k can be used penalty-free, so I don't need to have quite as much in conversions left in the Roth IRA.

###Questions

What am I missing/what haven't I considered? What would you do differently? How could this blow up in my face?

How wrong am I to disregard the difference in taxes and investments of the two options? In-plan conversions would have to happen more frequently to avoid taxes, but seem easier to initiate (online). I don't know what the mechanical process for the distributions to the Roth IRA is, but I imagine it involves paperwork. I would probably need to manage a 3-fund in order to avoid taking a small expense ratio hit, but I could build twice-yearly rebalancing into the distribution process. Looking at the funds available, I'm not sure if I would come out ahead on expenses.

Interested in any thoughts. This kind of critical thinking on my retirement investments is new to me. I've been very lazy so far, but with the options I have now closer consideration is warranted.",finance,1476622278

Should I start a holding company to own the shares of my operating company?  With the upgraded annual wages, I’d like to protect my cash in case something unforeseen happens (unplanned pregnancy, being sued, etc.)

I travel a lot.  Typically 3 months a year at a minimum.  I have no problem spending money on travelling while I have debt.  I want to experience these worldly experiences before getting older.  This is a must for me and ranks very high on the priority list.

personalfinance,Student loan debt and continuing my education,"Background: 18 year old me newly graduated from high school did not do much research on financing college nor did my parents. I was recruited by colleges to play golf. During the school year I had played my worst season of golf and all the schools D1 and D2 that had offered me scholarships to play told me thanks, but no thanks. So, I ended up going to a D3 school to play golf. Not knowing what I wanted to do in school and knowing I just wanted to play golf I went to a D3 school. A Private Methodist College. 

In order for me to afford to attend I had to take out private loans. Roughly 21k a year in private loans. As well as federal loans which were roughly 10k a year. My sophomore year I could not find a cosigner for the full amount I needed, So, I remained for the fall (fully paid for) and worked two jobs to support myself while at school. My second semester was partially covered by the loans but I owed the school about $7200. To make matters worse my dad(main source of income) would become unemployed 2 weeks before that christmas. The school told me to return and that we would figure a way to cover the cost. We never did. 

I left school after completing my sophomore semester with 61 credit hours, $42k in private loans, $19k in federal loans, and $7200 owed to my college.

As of today, the amount owed to my college will be paid off the 28th of this month. My private loans have been reduced to $39k, and I haven't touched my federal thanks to IBR. 

With my transcripts being available at the end of the month and having the ability to defer all my loans while enrolled back in school should I do it? The catch is the only way I would be able to finance it is through more loans as my parents have always been in a bind financially and I have been told by them I will have to fund my own education. 

The DEBT scares me. But, I want an education so I can do what I want to do in life and make more money. Also, the school I would transfer to is a state school and I work there so the cost would be about $7k for the year.

I'm 18, going on 19. I live in Novosibirsk, Russian Federation. I'm considering purchasing an apartment, but I'd like opinions before it happens.

So, my situation:

* Have a car, no loan.

* No student loans, never will.

* No debt in general.

* $600 USD passive income per month (income is in dollars, not rubles) - will not be going away or down, only up, if anything.

* $300 in part time income per month (in rubles)

* Studying for an industry that generally has a $20,000 starting salary (in rubles, so about 1.25M rub)

* $25,000 USD equivalent in savings - still have a huge family as well, so if anything very bad happens, they will help.

* Average person in Novosibirsk will make $400-500 monthly.

* Will HAVE to be here for a minimum 5 years more, but more than likely at least 8. I don't see a reason to move; the city is nice, family, good wages, etc.

* Property tax is 0.1% 


A nice apartment with room for a family will be around 3 mil rubles or $50,000. But, mortgage rates around 10% when buying in rubles, less if in foreign currency, probably more in line with the country of that currency. In the apartment, no lawn or exterior paint to deal with. Biggest maintance will probably be things like a roof that is split among the home owners.

If I didn't care about space, I could buy one outright. But, I do.

Bitcoin,The Re-levation of Hayek: An inquiry into Denationalisation of Money,"Hayek's Denationalisation of Money : The argument Refined (http://nakamotoinstitute.org/static/docs/denationalisation.pdf) starts with a premise and lays the grounds for the unfolding of a global economy that would emerge post Keynesian society when national authorities no longer have monopoly rights on currency creation and monetary policy.

The premise that he starts with is comparable to the introduction/advent of bitcoin as a new form of (digital) gold, which if kept stable enough in value, would spark the political evolution that Hayek describes in great and simple detail.

Below are some excerpts perhaps relevant and significant in painting the picture of the world we now face ever since Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin experiment smashed the legacy of government monopoly over the creation of money:

&gt;The purpose of this scheme is to impose upon existing monetary and financial agencies a very much needed discipline by making it impossible for any of them, or for any length of time, to issues a kind of money substantially less reliable and useful than the money of any other. As soon as the public became familiar with the new possibilities, any deviations from the straight path of providing an honest money would at once lead to the rapid displacement of the offending currency by others. And the individual countries, being deprived of the various dodges by which they are now able temporarily to conceal the effects of their actions by 'protecting' their currency, would be constrained to keep the value of their currencies tolerably stable.

&gt;The idea of depriving government altogether of its age-old prerogative of monopolising money is still too unfamiliar and even alarming to most people to have any change of being adopted in the near future. But people might learn to see the advantages if, at first at least, the currencies of the governments were allowed to compete for the favor of the public.

&gt;It has the defects of all monopolies: one must use their product even if it is unsatisfactory, and, above all, it prevents the discovery of better methods of satisfying a need for which a monopolist has no incentive.

&gt;But the people have never been given the opportunity to discover this advantage. Governments have at all times had a strong interest in persuading the public that the right to issue money belongs exclusively to them.

&gt;A money deliberately controlled in supply by an agency whose self-interest forced it to satisfy the wishes of the “users” might be the best. A money regulated to satisfy the demands of group interests is bound to be the worst possible.

&gt;It is perhaps significant, however, that Adam Smith does not mention the control of the issue of money among the 'only three duties [which] according to the system of natural liberty, the sovereign has to attend to'.

&gt;It seems to me to be fairly certain that:

&gt;(a) a money generally expected to preserve its purchasing power approximately constant would be in continuous demand so long as the people were free to use it;
    (b) with such a continuing demand depending on success in keeping the value of the currency constant one could trust the issuing banks to make every effort to achieve this better than would any monopolist who runs no risk by depreciate his money;
    (c) the issuing institution could achieve this result by regulating the quantify of its issue; and
    (d) such a regulation of the quantity of each currency would constitute the best of all practicable methods of regulating the quantity of media of exchange for all possible purposes.

&gt;This is the process by which the unreliable currencies would gradually all be eliminated. The condition required in order that this displacement of the government money should terminate before it had entirely disappeared would be that government reformed and saw to it that the issue of its currency was regulated on the same principles as those of the competing private institutions. It is not very likely that it would succeed, because to prevent an accelerating depreciation of its currency it would have to respond to the new currencies by a rapid contraction of its own issue.

&gt;I have never doubted that the public at large would be slow in recognizing the advantages of such a new currency and have even suggested that at first, if given the opportunity, the masses would turn to gold rather than any form of other paper money. But as always the success of the few who soon recognize the advantages of a really stable currency would in the end induce the others to imitate them

&gt;I am certain that many of the present leaders of the profession will not be able to conceive how it could possibly work and therefore will describe the whole system as impracticable and impossible.

&gt;Once public had an alternative, it would become impossible to induce it to hold cheap money, and the desire to get rid of currency that threatened to depreciate would indeed rapidly turn it into a dwindling money. The inflationists would protest because in the end only very 'hard' money would remain. Money is the one thing competition would not make cheap, because its attractiveness rests on it preserving its 'dearness'.

&gt;Since it has become generally understood that whoever controls the total supply of money of a country has thereby power to give in most situations almost instantaneous relief to unemployment, even if only at the price of much unemployment later, the political pressure on such an agency must become

&gt;We indeed begin to see how completely different an economic landscape the free issue of competitive currencies would produce when we realize that under such a system what is known today as monetary policy would neither be needed nor even possible. The using banks, guided solely by their striving for gain, would thereby serve the public interest better than any institution has ever done or could do that supposedly aimed at it. Irresistible.

&gt;...it is really a crime like theft to enable some people to buy more than they have earned by more than the amount which other people have at the same time foregone to claim.
    When committed by a monopolistic issuer of money, and especially by government, it is however a very lucrative crime which is generally tolerated an remains unpunished because its consequences are not understood. But for the issuer of a currency which has to compete with other currencies, it would be a suicidal act, because it would destroy the service for which people did want to hold his currency.
    Because of a lack of general understanding, the crime of over-issue by a monopolist is still not only tolerated but even applauded.

&gt;Neither I, nor apparently anybody else, then thought of the much more effective discipline that would operate if the providers of money were deprived of the power of shielding the money they issued against the rivalry of competing currencies.

&gt;The gold standard, fixed rates of exchange, or any other form of obligatory conversion at a fixed rate, served no other purpose than to impose upon the issuers of money such a discipline and, by making its regulation automatic, to deprive them of the power arbitrarily to change the quantity of money.

&gt;Though gold is an anchor-and any anchor is better than a money left to the discretion of government-it is a very wobble anchor. It certainly could not bear the strain if the majority of countries tried to run their own gold standard. There just is not enough gold about.

&gt;Money which is current only because people have been forced to accept it is wholly different from money that has come to be accepted because people trust the issuer to keep it stable.

&gt;...the control over the supply of money gives national governments more power over actions which are wholly undesirable from the point of view of international order and stability.

&gt;The two goals of public finance and of the regulation of a satisfactory currency are entirely different from, and largely in conflict with, each other.

&gt;Nothing can be more urgent than that we dissolve the unholy marriage between monetary and fiscal policy.

&gt;I do not think it an exaggeration to say that it is wholly impossible for a central bank subject to political control, or even exposed to serious political pressure, to regulate the quantity of money in a way conducive to a smoothly functioning market order. A good money, like good law, must operate without regard to the effects that decisions of the issuer will have on known groups or individuals.

&gt;For the vast majority of people the appearance of several concurrent currencies would merely offer them alternatives; it would not make necessary any change in their habitual use of money. Experience would gradually teach them how to improve their position by switching to other kinds of money.

&gt;...there would be no important necessary change in the conduct of business or unavoidably difficult adaptations.

&gt;The urgency of these steps derives from the fact that, once the displacement of the hitherto exclusive currency by new currencies had commenced, it would be rapidly speeded up by an accelerating depreciation that would be practically impossible to stop by any of the ordinary methods of contracting the circulation. Neither the governments nor the former central banks would posses the reserves of other currencies or of gold to redeem all the old money the public would want to get rid of as soon as it could change from a rapidly depreciating currency to on int had reason to believe would remain stable. It could be brought to trust such a currency only if the bank issuing it demonstrated a capacity to regulate it in a precisely the same manner as the new issue banks competing with it.

&gt;Indeed it would be the day of final triumph of the new system when governments began to prefer to receive taxes in currencies other than those they issue!

&gt;Good money can come only from self-interest, not from benevolence.

&gt;I fear that since 'Keynesian' propaganda has filtered through to the masses, has made inflation respectable and provided agitators with argument which the professional politicians are unable to refute, the only way to avoid being drive by continuing inflation into a controlled and directed economy, and therefore ultimately in order to save civilization, will be to deprive governments of the power over the supply of money.",cryptocurrency,1476642587

As a result, after paying all of my bills and spending a little ""fun money"" I still have over $1000 a month that I don't see myself ever spending.  I'm also guaranteed a $10,000 pay increase every year for the next 3 years, so that number is only going to increase. I've already got a safety net of about a year's worth of living expenses saved up, and I'm only contributing 5% to my 401k, which is the max that the government will match.

investing,Buy the Cisco dip,"I'm saying this as an Australian, so take that fact into consideration when reading this post.

TL:DR: Look or or else you'll get eaten by a dropbear.

Cisco is currently down 4.5% from current highs. The goods news about Cisco is that they have lots of options volume so either way this post sways you, you can make a move on it.

Cisco's level of public interest is very low right now, but it always swings back. Also their earnings is gaining some interest (it's on Nov 11th after market close).

They've got jelly in all the right places, financially. They're down mostly because of a few minor rumors about sales and such but a major force behind this pull back is the overall market being shaky. Hillary is in the lead now so expect dovish tones from the FOMC and smooth sailing upward.

A major problem their company faces is their Frankenstein lookalike CEO. He's very creepy looking and likely drives down sales purely because no one wants him to destroy their bride, then have him force you to bring her back to life so he can have someone to love (this was a mean joke and I'm sorry to all parties involved both directly and indirectly).

The analysts have been trying to paint a bleak outlook on this company based on options volume. It's ridiculous, but if your boss says trash Cisco, you trash Cisco. Besides the volume being mostly speculation, they're forgetting that there are other people on opposite sides of those trades. While the crooked analysts help a little with pushing the stock down, its definitely the overall market and sales rumors that are pulling this thing down. I would say to follow the trend that the analysts are setting, but they're mostly from second rate organisations feeding third rate journalists (to be fair they're closer to bloggers) fundamentally distorted and dishonest viewpoints.

Now back to the part about Hillary's lead and the market outlook. While Trump is certainly coming back from the attacks that he's been facing head on, the media is not going to let up. Maybe the polling is rigged, maybe it isn't, but up until election day the media will say she's winning and ignore any new information that comes out about her. If Monday looks red for CSCO then wait till Thursday or Friday to load up on calls or equity, but if it looks green then try and get in on a low point. We're at the point where Nov 11th is fast approaching so the stocks IV will be rising and so will the shares in anticipation of a massive beat.",finance,1476648489

We're finally at a point where we are stable enough with some savings that we can start to pay this down. That said both of our credit scores are mediocre right now, in the mid to high 600's.

I've been a long-time follower of this sub, but have never posted here before. I've found others' discussions to be so helpful that I figured I'd give it a shot and ask for some advice myself. Please let me know if there's a more appropriate place for my post - I follow /r/studentloans as well, but it doesn't seem to have the traffic volume and knowledge base that /r/personalfinance does.


So here's my situation - I finished my Master's program in 2014 with about $70,000 in debt, broken down as follows:


Sallie Mae Student Loan: $18,284 at 8.4% 
($13,686 principal remaining, monthly payment of $325)

Federal Perkins Student Loan: $5,000 at 5% 
($4,188 principal remaining, monthly payments of $53)

Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $20,500 at 5.4%
($18,739 principal remaining, monthly payment of $234)

Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: $20,500 at 5.4%
($18,274 principal remaining, monthly payment of $234)

Direct Grad Plus Loan: $6,250 at 6.4%
($5,607 principal remaining, monthly payment of $74)



At the rate I'm going right now, I'll have the Sallie Mae paid off by November 2020, and the rest paid off by November 2024 (using the typical 10-year repayment plan). My goal would be to pay off the Sallie Mae and then use that $325 towards that Direct Grad Plus Loan to get that paid off as early as possible, and then continue on until everything is paid off.

While I believe I can manage these payments for the foreseeable future, I have been growing increasingly frustrated at my lack of ability to do just about anything else with my money. I have a meager emergency fund (it hovers around $1000), and am throwing the rest of my available income (about $250 a month) towards a joint savings account that I hold with my boyfriend, as we're planning on buying a house this summer. We're in the same field and make about the same (him a bit more than me), but he's currently able to save a lot more since his loans are fewer and are still in deferment, as he just graduated. It stinks - I would like to be saving equal amounts together, but I also want to be responsible in getting these loans paid down as soon as possible. (I would also love to take a vacation every now and then, or even go out with friends every once in awhile, but you do what you gotta do...)


So here's the thing - I'm eligible for PSLF. I work in the public sector, and will for the foreseeable future (probably the rest of my career). But I'm incredibly anxious about signing over to IBR and watching my interest build and build and build, when I could just be making the payments I am now. If PSLF worked out after the ten years, I could certainly save some money on my federal loans. But again, I'm just so fearful that something will go wrong with the program, and that I'll end up having to pay the loans (with all the built-up interest) after all. Are my fears irrational? Would betting on PSLF be as big of a risk as I think it is? Or should I play it safe and continue socking away $920 a month for the next 6-8 years of my life?

While I'll be funding most of the down payment, I'm curious if an intra-family loan would be a good option. I would be seeking a $30K loan in this scenario, from parents who do have the savings available and, perhaps most importantly, could still survive if they lost it! 

1. Can an intra-family loan be used as a down payment, in the eyes of the mortgage lender or underwriter? I suspect they would treat this like a second-lien-position loan, but I'm not an expert here. I would be contributing about $70K down in real cash, with the remainder being this loan.

2. What needs to be done to make this ""above board"" in the eyes of the IRS? I would like to structure it in such a way that I can write-off the interest, and I understand my parents will have to report the interest income. What is the process for submitting this as an ""official loan"" to the correct government or banking entities?

3. I understand the IRS has some stipulations for loans such as this. For example, they must carry a realistic interest rate, otherwise they are looked at as gifts. My parents would like to charge me the lowest rates possible, so I'm wondering what the ""lowest acceptable rate"" would be... Or is there an index I can use as a benchmark (like the Fed Funds Rate)? 

4. I would like to avoid using an expensive loan servicer... In this scenario we really don't need a third party to hold payments in escrow. But, if the fee is very small, I'd be willing to consider a provider if they can handle the up-front loan origination work. As an alternative, I have access to a few lawyer buddies (I work in the legal industry) who might be able to help out with the loan origination paperwork.

So I know reddit really hates these life insurance policies, mainly they feel like the insurance companies are trying to scam the customer.

However, I've been looking into the Nationwide indexed policies, and some of them offer:

1. fixed premium fees, and are pretty transparent
1. zero interest loans on your own cash value
1. guaranteed at least 0% interest, meaning if the market does really poorly, you're cash value isnt harmed since it isn't actually used in investment
1. Cap of 13% interest rate

The only assumption here is that over the next X amount of years the indexed interest rate will average to ~6%, which is based off past historical data but I understand that the market is very hard to predict.

But essentially, if you got the cash, you can put a lot of money into the policy at decent interest rates, and make future loans tax and interest free (given the right insurance policy).

So, with transparent, fixed premium fees and with disposable income, indexed life insurance policies seem like a great tax-free IRA.

I don't seem to understand why this subreddit hates these policies so much, as the main concerns can be addressed by finding out the details of the policy.

Background: Recent college grad, just got into a state US MD program. 

Debt: 31k in undergrad loans. 8k personal loan from my grandmother. 

I have one year before I start school, during which I will not be able to work and will be taking on about another 160k in debt over the next 4 years even though it is a state school. I know having 190k in debt is terrible but I cant see myself doing anything other than being a physician and hopefully I will be able to pay it off in a couple years as an attending if I live frugally. 

I was fortunate enough to be able to borrow 8k from my grandmother for medical bills that I nor my parents could pay. I did not even know I had this debt as I thought my parents handled my medical bills but I was over 18 and they were experiencing financial hardship that they sort of hid from me. I learned about this debt when it hit collections when I was in undergrad and at the time, I could not do anything about it. Long story short I went to my grandmother and she agreed to loan me the money but now I am paying her back 800/mo until I start school in August. I make 15/hr at my current job which is probably less than I am worth as I have a degree but its in the medical field and it is good experience. The person I work for gave me my first job in the field which helped me get into school so I cannot leave him to go somewhere else because I love this man like a father and would not shaft him like that. 

My credit is bad because of the money that went to collections, but went up since I cleared those debts. I have never had a credit card. My score is a 615. 

I don't know how I will be able to pay my grandmother back and my fedloans at the same time so I am thinking about deferring until after school if this is even possible. I have some at 6% and some at around 3% is there a way to refinance these all to 3%? Will my credit come in to play? 

I have a budget of 200/week and I am not exactly suffering on that. My question is basically should I try and defer on my loans or throw any money at it that I can through the income based repayment plan? I am going to have to defer once I am in school. 
Is there a credit card I can get and just use for gas to build my credit? Is it even worth building my credit with all this debt and the fact that ill be in the school for the next 4 years? 

Thank you all for the help and sorry for any ""dumb questions"" I have never been taught anything about finances and trying to learn. 

Also, I have 2k that I saved up to apply to medical schools but then I only had to apply to 1. I have been keeping this as an emergency fund..is this wise or should I put it towards debt?",finance,1476673536
personalfinance,Should I consolidate my accounts?,"I'm 31 and have been saving as much as I can for years and have about $140K with no debt.

To be honest, I'm not even sure the interest rates or limitations on them (particularly the retirement savings plans, which might have penalties for withdrawals if I tried to move them).

My accounts are:

* $29K - Betterment (65% stocks/35% bonds)
* $22K - Fidelity 401K through my work
* $19K - Mutual fund (paired to a tax-free savings account) at TD
* $18K - Cash at Capital One

* $13K - Tax-free savings account at Tangerine
* $10K - Sunlife Financial retirement fund (my last job's retirement savings)
* $10K - Retirement Savings Plan low interest savings account at Tangerine

personalfinance,"Tripled my salary, looking for advice (JP)","Hi everyone,

I'm a 30 years old Portuguese software engineer living in Japan and I basically just tripled my yearly ""salary"", from around $38,000 to $105,000, and am now a bit overwhelmed with all this cash. I'm also dealing with 3 different currencies.

Right now I'm a remote worker for a American company, they pay my salary in USD to a Japan bank account, so in the end its Yens but I'll put all the figures in USD. I get transfers of about $8,750 per month, since I have to do my own taxes I got an accountant and he says to keep 30% for taxes.

So, $2,625 are for taxes which leaves me $6,125 per month liquid. From here I was thinking of paying my self, read the money I'll use, a $4,500 salary so I have about $1,625 free that I can use for savings and etc. Also I'm using YNAB for the $4,500 and planning to also not use all of it.

My only debt is a student loan back in Portugal that has $14,376 (13,090eur) remaining to pay over 3 years. I make monthly payments of about $410 (372eur) of which $354 (323eur) are for paying the capital and $56 (44eur) are interest so I guess my interest rate is around 13%.

I have 0 savings and want to start correcting that. My current goals are:

1. Get a 1 month buffer (done)

2. Get a 6 months emergency fund $4,500 * 6 = $27,000, working on it.

3. Pay my debt asap

4. Savings/Retirement/Investing

I have some questions:

Q1. In my new situation paying my debt quickly seems to not be a problem, in 3~4 months I could pay it fully, should I do this first and then work on my emergency fund?

Q2. The tax money I'm putting on the side is to be used at the end of the fiscal year which is around March, so I have this non trivial amount of money ($31,500) just sitting around for almost a year, is there anything I can do with it?

Q3. I'm completely lost on the savings/retirement/investing, from my research in Japan the savings accounts are basically worthless. There are [NISA accounts](http://www.retirejapan.info/nisa.html), similar to UK ISA, that allow you to invest and not pay capital tax gains over 5 years. There is also a [J401k](http://www.retirejapan.info/j401k-309062345025312209862418037329.html) that I could start and contribute to. Most of the advice I see is very USA centric, which is understandable, so I would ask for any advice for my situation.

Bitcoin,These two pieces are damaging propaganda,"https://medium.com/@johnblocke/network-congestion-is-problematic-c9d7829ed4ec#.pip1zb9yt

&gt; the currently accepted view among developers in Bitcoin Core is that the electronic cash model is incorrect, and that bitcoin will work better as an expensive “settlement layer” for high-value transactions, with low-value consumer payments being driven to “second-layer” network overlays which have varying degrees of centralization. 

This is correct (I don't like the word “expensive” so much though).  I also think it is correct to suggest that core has an implicate mandate, which is to preserve bitcoin's soundness (which is definitely partly comprised of it's security).

There is also the implicate mandate that core cannot budge on its “monetary policy” without a scientifically founded argument to support the decision.  This puts bitcoin (and all the players involved) in a quandary, because the only empirical evidence is the current network protocol and the history of it and  the block-chain.

This makes bitcoin “hard” on a vector that is surprising to people.

&gt;The result is an ever-growing transaction backlog, ever-rising fees, and a stagnant bitcoin economy. Without also increasing the rate at which this backlog is periodically flushed, what we are left with is a permanent backlog. Bitcoin will be accessible only to the highest bidders, and as the great mass of consumer users turn elsewhere to find a cryptocurrency that is both fast and cheap, I suspect the transaction congestion problem will solve itself. 

The premise here is true, but the conclusion is to not understand the nature of money and to not have read the likes of Hayek, Nash, and I would add Szabo (perhaps Selgin).  They want us to know that if we guard bitcoin's properties that it share with what we have traditionally valued gold so highly for, then the public will very quickly learn to demand ONLY sound money.

“Cheap money” is a folly that Hayek warned us of:

&gt;Once public had an alternative, it would become impossible to induce it to hold cheap money... Money is the one thing competition would not make cheap,  because its attractiveness rests on it preserving its 'dearness'.

This is not at all certain.  Bitcoin CAN gain widespread adoption but without scaling its transactional capacity with a contentious hf.

&gt;Furthermore, it should be noted that one of the main arguments of the small blockist is that higher level scaling solutions on top of Bitcoin will increase Bitcoin’s market cap as well, which might bend the red curve upwards by an unknown amount. The time is now, though, and reliable, usable and widely accepted solutions have not been implemented yet. 

Small blockists I think want to see what happens when you introduce a sound money into an economic system where un-sound money is currently targeted.

&gt;There is also no reason that higher level solutions on top of Bitcoin can not work synergistically with a lifted maximum block size limit.

Yes there is.  Something has to be the anchor/benchmark.  If you mess with bitcoin's soundness then this will effect the nature of such “higher level solution”.",cryptocurrency,1476685141

Recently, Bullfrog Gold had announced additional land acquisition next to its Bullfrog Project in Nevada. While gold and the mining end of the business remains a mystery to many investors, those who watch the markets are looking for opportunities in domestic producing areas. 

Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:ABX) has decided to sell its stake in the Kalgoorlie Super Pit mine in Western Australia and a growing number of potential buyers are showing interest in grabbing the asset. Kalgoorlie is a joint venture between Barrick and Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM). Barrick owns 50% stake in the mine and the sale of that stake could generate $1 billion in proceeds for the company, sources have hinted.


Potential buyers

Potential buyers of Barrick’s 50% stake in Kalgoorlie mine have until the end of this month to place their bids. It is not clear whether Barrick has started receiving bids for the asset, but Kinross Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:KGC) and Zijin Mining Group, a former buyer of another Barrick asset, are among miners that have shown interest in Barrick’s stake in Kalgoorlie mine. The other companies that are reviewing data on the mine for possible bids include Australian miners Evolution Mining, Newcrest Mining and Northern Star Resources. Newcrest Mining is the partner of Barrick in the joint venture and the operator of the mine. Chinese miners Shandong Gold Mining and China National Gold Group are also said to be considering bids for ABX’s 50% stake in Kalgoorlie mine. Since taking over greater responsibility to operation Kalgoorlie mine, Newmont has improved the mines production and cost efficiency.


Gold deals

This year has been awash with deal-making in the gold sector as miners try to increase capacity or drop down costs to boost profitability. In 3Q2016, some 140 gold-themed acquisitions took place, making the quarter the busiest since 2010 in term of the number of transactions completed. Gold prices are up about 18% so far in 2016, but worries about interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve have tempered with the rally in gold prices in the recent weeks. Barrick stock is up nearly 115% YTD. The stock rose 2% to $15.83 in the last session.",finance,1476692384

personalfinance,Advice on Comparing Total Compensation - Unique Salary Package - Big Decision for My Life,"I would love your assistance in what is perhaps the biggest decision of my life. I am a Federal Government employee who intended to stay until retirement. Next week I will receive a job offer from the Acme Company.  Their salary and benefits are packaged differently and I am having a difficult time comparing the apples and oranges. Clearly my talents are not in finance and accounting. Most helpful / informative post(s) gets a donation to the charity of their choice. 

**Goals:**

•	Identify the long term better package.

•	Calculate how much better (in terms of total compensation).

•	Derive minimum salary to maintain take home pay and pay benefits.

•	Develop an objective negotiating stance

•	Identify tax considerations that influence compensation.

•	Identify where I’m wrong / made poor assumptions.


The recruiter has given me a spreadsheet to help compare the benefit packages Company A vs. Company B. I have entered CY17 numbers as possible, my created fields in red, but it still requires modification. I have made it available at: http://www.filedropper.com/salary-retirement-calculator As a federal employee, the spreadsheet is not a direct comparison. I need to better identify and compare the compensation plans, cash outlays, retirement plans, and include tax benefits and drawbacks that are not immediately apparent. Some complexity is added if we use my spouse’s benefits. 

Things to consider:

-	4% salary growth each year 

-	PTO / Vacation with both employers improve at the same level over time. 

-	Assume hourly wage is $57.69


**Acme Company Base Salary** is $120,000

•	Acme funds an additional pre-tax Individual Business Account (IBA) at 25% of base salary (in this case, $30,000).

 This funds:

* o	30 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) per year (includes holidays, vacation, and sick)

* o	Medical / Dental / Vision / Short Term Disability / Long Term Disability

* o	Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) up to $6k
* o	Education reimbursement up to $5k
* o	Dependent care reimbursement up to $5k
* o	Remaining balance returned as discretionary bonus (taxed)

• **Retirement 1**: Tax deferred profit sharing account at an additional 25% of base salary (in this case, $30,000)
* o	Immediately vested, disbursed twice per year
* o	Managed by Charles Schwab with employee directed allocations

• **Retirement 2:** 401k for employee contributions, no company match. 

•	**Total compensation** is equivalent to $180,000. (120K +30K IBA, +30K PSP)



**Fed Gov Base Salary** is $97,128 + $22,272 (locality) = 119,400 

* o	Base salary is used for benefit / retirement calculations

•	Earned Time Off

* o	10 Federal holidays

* o	20 days of vacation

* o	13 sick days (can be used to care for family members)

    ♣	This exceeds ACME PTO by 13 days, or ~$6000 / yr. 

• **Retirement 1**: Pension Plan (FERS Regular) = 

* o	At xx age, 1% per year worked of the average salary of highest 3 years worked. (assume 30 years of service, 4% salary increase per year)

* o	At this point, FERS collects ~$15,000 per year on my behalf – however, I only see this money if I retire from govt service. With 10 years of service (as of now) I get a small portion of that at retirement age. It would continue to grow. Can I use this ~$15k as a benefit in negotiating my total compensation with ACME? 

• **Retirement 2**: Thrift Savings Plan with 4% match of first 5% contributed. 



**Conditions:**

   1.	Switching to spouse benefits reduces overall compensation by $5000

    a.	Spouse employer currently funds DSA for $5000

    b.	Spouse is grandfathered into a plan, any changes disqualify the plan

   2.	Health insurance is required for family, and is the primary driving factor for short term comparison. Expenses per month for comparable plans:

    a.	ACME: $835 – Total for a la carte Medical / Dental / Vision

   * i.	Totals $10,020 annually

   * ii.	HRA available up to $6k pre-tax.

    b.	FED (current rate): $480 (pre-tax) – Medical / Dental / Vision

   * i.	Totals $5,760 annually

   * ii.	HSA Available

    c.	Spouse $650 (pre-tax) – Medical / Dental / Vision
   * i.	Totals $7,800 annually
   * ii.	HSA Available
   3.	I am unlikely to use education reimbursement in the short term (grad school complete)
    * a.	Fed Govt has education reimbursement / tuition assistance for select programs.
   4.	We use the full $5000 for DSA annually, and will for the next 5 years. 
   5.	Out of pocket medical expenses are usually under $2000 per year. 
   6.	20 years in this industry. Historically, I’ve worked with companies for 6 years before switching. I had no intention of leaving federal service, and would likely work with this company for 20 years, or return to federal service (and build upon existing retirement). 
   7.	Work environment, culture, and intangible benefits do not need to be accounted for in this scenario. 

I am in a fortunate (and hard earned) situation, and I appreciate your well constructed advice.",finance,1476706527

I tend to lurk on this subreddit quite often (mostly reading instead of actually providing advice since I don't have enough experience with money, as of yet, to provide reliable information). 

Graduated a couple months back with a degree in Economics and minor in Finance. I've always been pretty good at budgeting money throughout uni and managed to find ways to save money whenever possible (especially on weekends). Have ~$3,500 saved up at the moment. Currently living with my parents in New York (been to high school and uni within the state) so I know about ""NY State Get on Your Feet Program (GYFP)"" for Federal Loan assistance. 


Debts: 

Private Loans: $8,000 at ~7% and $1,000 at ~4.5% (I want this loan paid off ASAP since it's with Wells Fargo and I'd like to rid myself of that name)

Federal Loans: $17,000 at ~4.5% (there's a lot of loans within this amount but it'll take a while to write it out so I'll simply group the loans with interest rates together with a weighted average percentage). In addition to that, $11,000 in non-interest loans. 

The Federal Loan is also in grace period until January and if I do enter the NY GYFP, then I won't have to worry about the loan for up to 24 months.

How much do I bring in:

I bring in roughly $2800 after-taxes. 

I have not considered bonuses since that is still unknown 
My other expenditures:

Food (lunch at work) ~$90 per month

Miscellaneous ~$200 per month (gifts, outings with friends). As much as I'd like to save this as well; it's good to enjoy life/ give back to friends and family. 


Future plans:

I plan on putting $800 per month into the private loan in the upcoming month when the loan leaves it's grace period. 

If I become good at my position: maybe a pay raise and bonus.

Looking to start a retirement account soon. Preferably a ROTH IRA and company does offer a 401k but aside from the 50% matching after 1 year of employment, the funds within the 401k aren't too appealing. 

Looking into small time personal investment soon in stocks but nothing too huge. I have worked with stocks before while at uni and had relatively good returns on mock portfolios. 

Lastly, graduate school will be coming up soon so I have allocated around ~$3000 per semester in my mind.

I have no budget, and I'm starting to worry since last month I saved practically nothing because I've been immature in my spending practices.

personalfinance,Personal loan from family to take out student loans?,"Over the course of going to a private university for undergrad and taking out a loan to supplement an internship done during grad school (I was fully funded in my grad program and was paid out a stipend) I accrued around 30K in debt from four loans - one at 5.4% and the others at 6.8%. They're all government loans, none private, and I've been paying at least to cover interest each month since taking them out. 

Since getting my first real job a few months ago I've been trying to do a double payment monthly and expected to pay the smallest loan (around 6K) off in the next year. This morning I learned that my organization is shutting down next year though and while I'm fairly confident I can land on my feet and they're offering a generous retention bonus, I'm pulling back to making a regular payment and socking away what I planned on paying towards student loans to create a better buffer.

Before my job issues arose, my wonderful and generous parents offered to pay my student loans off through a personal loan with a much lower interest rate (probably around 2%). My questions are:

1) How much could they loan me to cover these loans so that I wouldn't take a tax hit? Would a personal loan like this qualify as a gift with that 10K yearly maximum? 

2) Is it possible for them to pay the loans directly and have me just pay them back or does that qualify as a gift too?

3) It's possible in the next year that I switch to a job offering up to a 5K yearly student loan repayment. I don't currently know the terms of this but assuming it's a matching program then by paying 15K in three years I could also pay down these loans. But there's no way this program would work with a private loan through my family. Is the potential benefit of a program like this worth gambling with repaying my loans right now by family and getting a lower interest rate?

4) Is there anything else with this scenario that I don't know about that we should be aware of?

Right now this is in the beginning stages of a conversation. My parents can more than afford making this as a gift, not a loan, but it is mutually agreed that this should be a loan and I don't foresee any stress on our relationship. These are just some initial questions but moving forward I know my parents would also meet with their financial adviser to hammer out more details. I just want to come to the table of our next discussion (probably over Thanksgiving) better informed.

personalfinance,I was almost scammed,"Not sure if this is the right place to ask and this is a throw away account. Due to being blinded by the need of money I almost fully fell for a scam. I ignored extremely obvious red flags in plain view right from the start and dived straight in. I was given a check to print out, which I did, and I deposited it in my bank account through the bank's cellphone app. Then I was told to take out part of that money to make some payments, which I did. But then I was told where to send it, which was Africa, and I finally realized I fucked up and all the red flags went off in my head. So now my bank has deposited the money in my account, I have part of the money with me, the bank isn't anywhere close to where I live, I have no way to deposit back the money and that check was most likely a counterfeit. What exactly are the steps to take here? Who do I tell? I called my bank a few days back to warn them that the check I deposited probably didn't have the funds (I didn't think the check could be counterfeit at the time) and they told me if anything happened they'd take the money back and if I didn't have the full amount I'd have 5 days to pay whatever was left.  My account doesn't have the full checks amount so if they take the money back I will be in the negative and I'll have 5 days to pay it back. I have some payments coming from my 2 jobs but one that makes the deposit directly to my bank account will probably not be enough and the one that makes the deposit to paypal will take 3 days to transfer to my bank account. I don't want to risk those payments not arriving on time. But then there's the matter of the check having a chance of being counterfeit. From what I checked online there's a high chance of that being the case. So what do I do to protect myself from that? Do I call the bank and warn them? Do I contact the Federal Trade Commission?

The house is in my name only, mostly because she had a bankruptcy in the past and we got a better interest rate with just me.    Currently we both have separate bank accounts at the same bank. The two main goals I'm concerned about are:  

1) How do we split the bills fairly?  ( I currently make 60% of our total income) 

2) How do we make her credit better?  

**My current solution:**  We keep the house in my name and put all the bills in her name.   Since we both have separate bank accounts at the same bank, we would set up a joint account that we both put our equal share of the bills total cost (60/40) into and have the money come from that joint account.     In turn, that gives us both our own individual money to use toward whatever we like, but also allows us to contribute toward the same goal for the house.

gaming,"""Harmless Fun?"" - An essay provided by my school","Harmless Fun?

From World Almanac

Say what you want, but in Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, the latest version of the wildly popular Mortal Kombat video game, the character Taven’s signature move is known as the “Ring of Hatred.” That’s when he pounds the ground with his fist, creating a shockwave of fire. If he executes it just right, he will obliterate his opponent, leaving small bits of flesh, blood and internal organs splattered across the screen.

And Taven is one of the good guys.

You can see from this example that in the world of violent video games, players can channel their aggressions and take on virtual foes, with instant and typically graphic results. Die-hard video game addicts will tell you it is all harmless fun—at worst, a way to let off steam. But don’t be so sure.

In 1996, M. E. Ballard and J. R. Weist reported in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology that playing these kinds of games actually increased blood pressure in some players. Studies by P. J. Lynch in 1994 found that in aggressive children these games increased the flow of adrenaline. These two studies prove that video games cause aggression.

Can it be true, as profit-hungry game manufacturers claim, that virtual fights act as a substitute for actual fights? Are they a way to give a player his or her “adrenaline fix” harmlessly? Not necessarily. Researchers Craig A. Anderson, ​PhD​, of Iowa State University, and Karen E. Dill, PhD, of Lenoir-Rhyne College, gathered 210 college students and had them play either a violent or a non-violent video game. Afterward, they had each student “punish” an opponent with a loud blast of noise. The students who played the violent video game blasted the noise for a longer period of time than those who played the non-violent one. In addition, Anderson and Dill examined the video game habits of another 227 college students who had exhibited actual aggressiveness. Anderson and Dill concluded, in the American Psychological Association’s Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, that violent video games prime the brain for aggressive thoughts. In the longer term, they found, violent video games get players used to using violent means to solve their problems.

“The player learns and practices new aggression-related scripts that can become more and more accessible for use when real-life conflict situations arise,” said Anderson.

Who is most exposed to and damaged by these terrifying scripts? Children are. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 83 percent of children between ages 8 and 18 have a video game console in their homes, and 40 percent had a console in their bedroom. And while the government began in 2000 to crack down on the marketing of violent video games to children, results are not so great. A 2007 investigation by the Federal Trade Commission found that out of 20 games with a rating of “M” (for Mature), 16 were advertised on websites popular among children. This must mean that young children are playing and learning from these hideous games without adult supervision.

Most grown-ups and young adults can distinguish between real violence and the virtual kind. They know where to draw the line. But what about those who don’t? Children are still learning the boundaries of good behavior, and the do’s and don’ts of problem solving. They are the real-life victims of video game manufacturers.

I’m not saying that violent video games are the root of all aggression in the world. But I don’t see any evidence that the blood-soaked citizens of the screen world are doing anything to make the real world a better place.

I'm currently a 4th year student in a 5 year program (22 yo electrical engineering). For this 5 year program, it requires a year of paid internships. I just received an offer for my last one to work at $17.50/hr full time for about 7 months, which is decent enough as a student.

In offer letter it said one of the benefits was ""100% match on 401K contributions up to 5% of your salary.""

Since my salary is approximately $35,000, would it be worth contributing $1,750 to this 401K as a student who will most likely not be going back to that company in the future? I ask because it sounds like free money really with the 100% match on up to 5%.

     2. $25,300 @ 7.750%

     3. $9300 @ 8.115%

     4. $8700 @ 4.350% (Full in-school payments, wish I had opted for this earlier to save on interest)

* Student loan balance (Federal): $30,000 @ about 4.5% on average 

* Checking/Savings/Stocks: $18,000 (I'm about to put a large payment onto my highest interest loan)

* Most likely am going to need to buy my own car soon, I was looking at $10,000 sedans for the most part and possibly taking out a loan on one while I'm working (having a salary with pay stub) and putting down a large down payment (~$5,000). 

*  Expenses are approximately $750/mo (constantly working on lowering this - significant others are expensive)

I have a couple of CC's and have pretty big lines and a pretty good score. Just dropped a little with a new student loan account opening but will go even higher after a few on-time payments going through.

My final outcome was  80% of our liquid savings. He keeps his super, the cars etc. my total was 50% of the total marital pool - as cash. Not much but definitely something I don't want to waste on living expenses if I can help it. (No need to get into the politics of the separation - wasted a year of emotional energy on it already).

Some facts:
Age: 36 - 6yo dependant school attending child who lives with me

Disposable income: currently 0-$300 per month after everything - I am good at budgeting but it's been tight living on my own income, even with child support.

Location: Sydney based - rent is expensive and it's an agreement of the parenting plan that I don't move more than 10km from sons school. 


So the cash: approx $130k to do something with. I probably won't qualify for a loan so have been looking at indexed funds or a Vanguard eFt to pop say $30k in. Current bank interest rates are 2.5% on first 100k, 1% on everything over that. 

I could leave it in the account, continue to live off my income and try to increase that (I work for myself full time but include flexibility to do the mum things, homework, school assembly attendances etc). 

I would need to make approx $30k more a year to qualify for a loan. I wouldn't be able to buy anything in Sydney so a modest investment property in another state or regional town is another option however it's at least a year away I believe.

I was in my last semester of college and had nothing but student loans affecting my credit score which was at about 580 at the time. My parents were unable to cosign for a loan but ""fortunately"" I had a family friend who worked at a car dealership and was able to finance me. My grand total for the car was about 19K with a 13.9% interest rate on a 72 month loan. I put $6k down and still have about 12k left to pay. My payments are set at $270 a month but I've been paying $300 in an effort to pay off the loan quicker. 

Since then, I've gotten a credit card and have been paying both my car and credit card payments on time. My credit score has gone up to about 680 and now have a second job and am living at home so I am saving a decent amount of money. I was thinking that once my credit score reaches about 750, I would try to either trade in my car or at least refinance it. 

I like the car and it has all of the commodities I could want (backup camera, steering wheel controls, touch screen, etc) but it probably isn't a car that I would want to work hard to pay off for 5+ years. Although it does have 4 doors, it is very small and since I am pretty tall, I would ideally like an suv or at least a full size sedan. Also, I recently learned that the Scion brand will no longer be produced and I am afraid that this might depreciate the value of my car. As I grow older, I also think I might quickly outgrow the scion style which seems to be geared towards a younger crowd so I worry about spending so many years paying off a car that I don't absolutely love.

On the other end, I'm not sure if trading it in is a stupid idea. I'm not sure if I would lose a ton of money if I jump ship so soon. I was hoping if I trade it in now (or once my credit score improves a little), I could receive enough to cover the loan and also put a down payment on the next car. Since my credit score is getting better, I was wondering if I could get a ""better"" car but keep my payments at about what they are now since the interest rate would (hopefully) be lower. 

So I guess all in all, would it be better to trade in my car before it depreciates in order to get a car I love? Or would I lose out on too much money? Should I just suck it up and stick with this car and try to refinance it once my credit score gets a little higher?",finance,1476762512

I need a year's worth (at full time) of prerequisites (about 30 hours) of classes before I can apply to either, which is my main concern. My plan is to stay at my current job for the next two years while I take a smaller course load of 1-2 classes per semester, nothing in the summer, which should put me finished in the two year timeframe. That way if I get declined during first round of applications I still have a good paying job that pays the bills.

Does $12k sound like enough of an emergency fund to stop funneling money into and instead pay for classes? My only fear with this would be job loss. $12k would probably be right at 3 months expense at current spending, although with cutbacks could probably go 4-5 months. If this happened, my plan would be to take out student loans to pay bills and grind the 30 hours of classes down as quickly as possible while finding a low paying throwaway job. I could find another job within my field, but I don't think I could find one that pays as well without moving, so probably $15k/year less. Plus I'd hate to work a professional job with the intention of leaving in potentially less than a year.

If $12k is not enough, what expense should be cut down upon? I can sell the car but I'm probably right at break even, so I wouldn't have leftover cash from the sale to pay for a cheaper car, it would just lower my payments. I could also stop putting into my 401k, but I've always heard people advise against that.

I know my wife getting a job would help, but it is not an option right now. Our daughter is special needs, and my wife is basically a stay at home teacher 100% of the time. It will stay that way until she is in kindergarden in 2 years, which is when I'm planning on going back to school (that way my wife will be able to work as a teacher while daughter is in school).

Like I said, I just wanted to gather some thoughts and see what people thought about my plan and if I'm well prepared enough, and if not then where the gaps are. Feel free to add anything I may have missed or not considered. Constructive criticism is welcome.",finance,1476787773

personalfinance,178K IN DEBT from school loans! Dear God someone help.,"&amp;nbsp;

Hey guys! First-time poster here. Maybe you wise financial wizards can give me some much-needed advice! I went to a pricey art school - very aware of the debt I'd be getting in. However, the investment so far is ""paying off"" because I found a decent job in a very competitive field. We're able to, thankfully, pay all of our bills but just barely. It puts a lot of stress on our finances because ONE small missed step or extra electric bill charge can mean we're dipping into our food money for the week (EDIT: We do have a 5K emergency fund. I'm aware that's not ideal). I make about 46K and my fiancé makes 35K before taxes and insurance (EDIT: I've only been in the industry for over a year. This is a junior level position, senior level makes 100-300K). I'm living in Chicago so city living can be costly but necessary to find work. I'm currently living with my fiancé, and we split bills.

&amp;nbsp;

**Loan Breakdown**
Ok, so they're US government issued loans. My parents both took out Parent PLUS loans. I did not consolidate. The interest varies depending on the year. Both Parent PLUS loans have an average interest rate of 7.35%. I took out a Standard Loan, average interest of 4.68%

&amp;nbsp;

[My Personal Loan](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14676264/loan1.JPG)

[Parent PLUS 1](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14676264/loan2.JPG)

[Parent PLUS 2](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14676264/loan3.JPG)

&amp;nbsp;

On paper it looks like I'm much less in debt than I actually am because the Parent PLUS loans are actually in my parent's names. The school expressed the loans would be in my name, and my parents would be ""co-signers"" but apparently they mislead us. (EDIT: I understand legally my parents have to pay, but our personal agreement was I would pay for the full amount)

&amp;nbsp;

**Repayment Plan**
I'm on a 10 year Standard repayment plan and they're on a Standard 25 year. I chose the standard repayment instead of graduated or IBR plan because the stability of a set-in-stone number is very appealing to me. Currently, I'm paying $1397 a month.  I believe this means I'm paying down the interest/principal with my payments.

&amp;nbsp;

**Loan Forgiveness Options**
My mom works in public education, and after inquiring about the public service loan forgiveness after 10 years or 120 ""eligible payments"" they said my mom would need to switch to a ICR payment plan and consolidate the loan to be eligible. Not sure how I feel about this. Not even sure if my mom will be retired by then.

&amp;nbsp;

During my exit counseling they actually asked how old my parents were while I was trying to pick my payment plan because if one of them passes away the loan is forgiven...that's pretty messed up right?

&amp;nbsp;

**Spending Habits**
It should be noted I'm...pretty cheap. I like a good deal. I budget. I'm a saver and a planner. I built a custom google doc that has been revised and optimized for years now. I know every cent we spend and actually it could be said I'm sort of obsessive about checking our accounts because we're always so close to the red every paycheck. Everything to my knowledge has been optimized to minimum spending each month. Here's my spending breakdown:

&amp;nbsp;

[Bills](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14676264/Bills.JPG)

&amp;nbsp;

**Snowball (EDIT: Avalanche) Effect**
I'm only a year and a half out of school, and so far the idea that makes the most sense to me is the ""Avalanche effect"". I'd like to target the specific loans with the highest interest first. Depending on how aggressive we can be, I could theoretically reduce our time by about 5-10 years.

&amp;nbsp;

**Side Money**
I try to pick up freelance and odd jobs whenever I can. My fiancé is able to work OT (my job doesn't offer it) occasionally.

&amp;nbsp;

Wow...thanks for reading all that. Is there something more I can do here? Any information I left out that can help you guys? Book recommendations? Thank you guys so much for any tips I appreciate it so much!

personalfinance,"Student loans are deferred due to grad school. I can pay off my student loans, but should I?","Hi everyone. I have a relatively unusual situation (I think).  I'm in a *really* good position regarding student loans, but I want to optimize my finances. I'm expecting to live pay-check to pay-check over the next 8 years, so properly investing the money I have now is pretty important.

I'm currently in grad school with about $30k in student loans. My loans are deferred until I'm done with grad school (which will happen in around 5 years). However, I spent a year working after I graduated and before I started grad school, and I have a pretty significant amount of money saved up. In fact, more than enough to pay off my debt.

I have about $20k sitting in my savings account as emergency funds. $30k sitting around waiting to either be invested, or pay off my loans. And about $60k invested in my 401k, and Roth IRA (I was able to do this using the mega backdoor roth strategy, and by working a high-paying job across two calendar years).

The student loans have interest rates ranging from 4-5%.

What I'm trying to decide is if I should spend the $30k to pay off my loans, or invest it. It seems like a better idea to invest it, as I can probably get better returns over the long term.

Here are at least 3 options available to me:
* Just pay off the loans and be done with it
* Wait until I'm done with grad school, then pay them all off. To do this, I would need to somehow make sure I have a large amount of cash sitting around in about 5 years.
* Wait until I'm done with grad school, then make minimum payments until they're completely paid off. If I plan to do this, I can start investing the $30k now without worrying about how to pay off all my debt immediately after grad school.

I'm thinking of taking the 3rd option based on what I've read and since the interest rates aren't too high, but I'm wondering what you all think. I'm worried I'm missing something, or not taking into consideration a certain angle to this situation.

Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Another Student Loan Saga: Is a Wells Fargo consolidation a poor choice in my situation?,"I currently have two private loans with Discover/Great Lakes:

* Principal of $10,200 at an interest rate of 9.25% 
* and a principal of $32,900 at an interest rate of 6% 

Last year I had a reported income of $26,500. Making payments was always a priority so I've got excellent credit. But due to the seasonality of my work, making payments will often leave me depleted in the winter. Manageable, but worth exhausting all the tools I've got available. 

Currently, I do not have any options for income-based payments with Discover. When I inquired to explain my situation they offered the route of forbearance which is totally out of the question. I applied to refinance through SoFi and was denied. My personal banker at Wells Fargo encouraged me to look into consolidating with them. They were able to offer me a **15 year term loan for $43,747 at a variable rate of 5.24%.**

My goal obviously is to minimize my payments--and I realize the duality here. I don't want to feel like I copped out of a better long-run deal further down the road. But the reality is that this consolidated interest rate is more affordable for me right now and would provide a bit more security. Pros of consolidating with Wells Fargo would be a lower initial monthly payment along with the option of income-based payments. And despite the threat of predatory behavior, I've actually had great customer service with WF.

Before I digress too much, what are your impressions? Is this offer something I should move forward with? Are there credit unions I maybe should try first? Perhaps it's best just to stick it out?

personalfinance,"Another student loan question. This one is related to the ""Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)"" program.","In general, PSLF will forgive your remaining student loan debt after 10 years of service with a qualifying public service employer. The catch is that only specific types of student loans will be forgiven. 

This program came into effect in 2007, so next year (2017) will be the first year that any loans will be forgiven through this program. By 2007, I had already completed my undergrad degree and was paying off my student loans. After graduation, I decided to consolidate my loans for a much better interest rate (seriously, how does the Department of Education have such crazy high interest rates compared to an auto or house loan). Once I realized that PSLF was a thing, I very briefly looked at some of the qualifications and read a statement about how even if your specific loans don't qualify for PSLF, you can consolidate them into one loan, and then that loan can qualify. So I figured I was good.

I've been regularly paying off my student loans, and a few years ago decided to go back to grad school. After finishing grad school, I learned that none of the loans offered through grad school qualify for PSLF (which is stupid), so I was looking into consolidating them. During this time, I learned that my undergrad consolidated loan is an ""unsubsidized FFEL consolidation loan"", which doesn't qualify for the PSLF! Here I thought I was one year away from having my loan forgiven, and now I have to start all over!

Does anyone know if there is a way for my payments to retroactively be used towards PSLF or anything like that? I chatted with someone through studentloans.gov, and they told me that there was nothing they could do on their end, but that perhaps my loan provider could apply my payments to the loan ""retroactively"". Here is his exact wording, ""Retroactive payment, meaning, any payments you have been making.  See if the loan servicer can use those payments towards your Public Service Loan Forgiveness.""

So I contacted my loan servicer, poured my heart out to them to see if there was something they could do to help. But they very abruptly told me, ""No. Your loan does not qualify."" They weren't willing to give any other options.

Does anyone know if there is anything else I can try? Or is my only option to roll my undergrad and graduate student loans into the same qualifying consolidated loan and start waiting another ten years?

**Loan Breakdown: (all are still in grace period)**

*Private Loan- $11,446.63 @ 7.25% ( will drop to 7.00% once it's out of grace and I do autopay)


*Federal Loans- $14,000(mix of sub and unsub)


*Perkins Loans- $1200+$1000


Things I need to save for:
Moving to Colorado. I'm going there for graduate school (fully paid) for a science PhD. 


**Expenses:**
Gas $200


Live at home


Groceries for home since I live rent free (3 people): $300

I take home $1175 every two weeks from the main job giving me a total of about 2350 a month. (Nope not changing to a higher paying job. I work in a lab very specific to my graduate work, and I get to work on the next Mars missions which is fucking awesome).

I first pay $150 to the federal loans, $150 to the private loan and $80 for both perkins loans. Then, I pay around $1000 extra into the private loan each month. Only month I missed was October when my car needed &gt;$600 repairs. (I live &gt;40 miles from work. Living at home is cheaper. I already carpool with a few people. I can't sell the car. It's how I make my side business. It's a paid off 2005 Volvo S60.)


The reasoning behind the private loan is I will be back in school soon and I want to pay off the private loan. For the subsidized federal loans and perkins loans, they do not gain interest while I am enrolled in graduate school. Therefore, I see the private loan as the biggest emergency to wipe out. Then, while I'm in graduate school, I can shift the main payments to the unsubsidized federal loans. 



At this current pace, I should be able to pay off my private loan by September, but I feel like with the move coming up, I need to pay it off by July. To save for the move, the tutoring money gets deposited to an Ally savings account. How much money should I save for moving expenses and furniture? I'm moving with my boyfriend into hopefully grad student housing (Boulder's expensive....) and we would just be driving our few belongings there. Things we need to account for: furniture and kitchen ware and home goods in general.


I already have a $4000 emergency fund. Some people suggested I liquidate $3000 of the fund and put it in my private loan. I feel uncomfortable with clearing out an emergency fund though. Becuase well, emergencies. 


TLDR; I'm paying my private loan first before I attend grad school since most of the loans don't gain interest. Then, in grad school, I pay off the unsub loans with my meager stipend. I'm also taking my side gig money and putting it into a savings account for moving to Colorado.

I believe my accountant came up with a different figure than a certain state did, and I ended up paying the amount my accountant told me to. If I remember correctly I ended up having a few dollars in late fees because, maybe because extensions are on the federal level and not on the state level (im guessing)?

Long story short, I THOUGHT I remembered seeing a bill come in after I paid everything that was smaller than 10$ around my house for state tax, I cant find the notice, and I dont remember the state. I was fairly certain it was Maryland, but I went through their primitive comptroller site and it doesnt look like I have a balance (I do have the original bill and notice number so I can look it up on their site).

I dont know how else to search for unpaid state tax amounts. I dont believe my accountant would have a way to know which state I paid incorrectly. Can this somehow end up on a credit report? I have a 800+ credit score and am in the process of looking for a new home.

personalfinance,Repayment term for Sallie Mae Loans?,"Hi Reddit. I'm a junior in college who recently transferred from CC to a 4 year university. I would like to move to an off campus apartment next fall because otherwise I am commuting an hour into the city every day I have class. I understand that this is an enormous expense and I want to plan things correctly so that I don't blindly take out 10s of thousands of dollars in loans and then struggle to pay them back. 

My question is this - how does Sallie Mae determine how long your repayment period is? Right now I have taken out $5000 from them with an 8.3% interest rate that I am paying while I'm in school. When I graduate I have 60 months to pay it off. Does this time extend if I were to have a larger loan? Because I don't want to be stuck paying back $20000 (after paying for housing for 2-3 years ) in 60 months. 

My other option is to stay at home and commute but psychologically it has taken an enormous toll on me. It's hard to make friends, get involved, make your class schedule, etc when you live so far away. 

My major is Information Science and Technology and my anticipated graduation is either the spring or fall of 2018 depending on how I need to space my classes out due to rigor of the courses. In my opinion I need to take a lighter load if I am commuting (learned that lesson this semester).

personalfinance,"Bank did not notify that new documents were required, loan lock expired HELP","Hey PF, I'm not really sure what can even be done at this point, but I thought I'd ask.

Break down of the story (as I know it). My parents are splitting up for reasons, and in order to afford the monthly house payments my mother was attempting to (I believe) refinance her mortgage to get a lower payment.  

Today I get a text from her freaking out because she needs keys to the safe where we put the deed. The safe holds the guns that are in me and my father's name, so we both had keys but were both away for various reasons. Apparently underwriting said they needed some document, but my mother was not notified until today and was told that if she could not get the documents by close then they wouldn't honor the refinance rate (or whatever it was) originally quoted. 

This is all as it has been retold to me via my (admittedly hysterical) mother, so some facts may be off. Is there anything she can do to get the cheaper rate they promised, since it was due to negligence on their part in informing her that another document was required or is she just SOL?

EDIT:

Here is the full story. Two weeks ago the Senior Processor at the loan company requested documents. Documents were sent-same day (paper trail to prove it). The processor did not respond or acknowledge anything, and until my mother called to speak with someone else earlier today was she informed that the Processor claimed to never have received the documents. 

At this point they are claiming that since there are only 8 days left they cannot guarantee that they will be able to process the loan in that time. There is no issues with credit rating, income, deeds, or any of the documents that have delayed the process, only lack of communication from the processor.

It is a 60 day interest rate lock, and the prices are not major but enough to make a difference in whether she can keep the house. There are currently 8 days left on the lock. All documents have been provided same-day as requested, but the loan processor has failed to communicate when any new request was made, or claim they did not receive documents.",finance,1476833377
personalfinance,Help me pick between two mortgage options,"Hello,
 I'm closing on a new house in about a month and a half. The short summary is if I use the home companies lender they will give me a $10K break off the purchase of the home. However their mortgage rate and closing fees are higher than I've been quoted by my previous mortgage broker so it may not be worthwhile. I've done the math two different ways and I am making an error somewhere because I'm getting two different timelines on that payoff. 

More detailed Options:
The home builder (option A) offered an interest rate of 3.75%. The incentive would bring purchase price down to $463K. The other Mortgage company (option B) offered an interest rate of 3.25% but the home price would be $473K. In both scenarios I'm putting down 20% so for option B the higher price would mean $2K more down (but $2K less in closing costs). So I have loan amounts of $370K for option A and $378K for option B. 

Closing costs are almost $2K higher for the Option A homebuilder, so that incentive is now closer to $8K in my book. 

If it matters we hate debt and would like to pay another $400 or so a month off to knock this out in 20 years as I dont have any interest in having a mortgage as I get closer to retirement. I have zero debt at the moment.

From a math perspective here is where I get confused. The monthly mortgage I have been quoted is $2261/month for the homebuilder A and $2195/month for Option B. That difference of $66 a month is less than $800 a year in savings. So to recoup the extra $8K I've been paying ($10K incentive minus $2K extra closing costs) I would need 10 years before I break even. But when I look at the interest paid in the first year doing simple math (which I know it's more complicated) I show $14,175 in Homebuilder Option A interest and $12,285 in Option B. Under that $1900 difference the incentive would come up in closer to 5 years. 

So if I dont see the payoff for more than a decade I dont know that it's worth the higher price. But if I see the payoff sooner then it might be. Anthing else I'm missing?  Any thoughts welcome.",finance,1476834480

personalfinance,I'm a Turkish girl studying engineering with 100K in my account (from parents) in need of deperate help,"Hi guys. I've seen people giving some great advices here so I thought I might give this a shot. Please read until the end it's not as optimistic as it sounds in the beginning.

I'm a 23 year old chemical engineering student and I have about 100K TRY in my savings account from my parents. (It's approximetely 32K dollars)

They have recently sold our house and decided to put some of the money in my account. I didnt necessarily think they decided to give it to me just because it was in my account since my bank's interest rate is better than them (you know, i thought it was OUR money, not just MINE) but I've recently heard my dad saying to my mom that they'll never touch the money and it's mine for using to plan my future. I'm an only child.

It may sound very nice and all but here's the thing:

By my future, I know he means me leaving the country. If you wanna know how I feel about the situation in Turkey you can check my previous comments on the situation. I'll just say being an atheist woman is not a very good way to live here. And you know with other personal problems, me being overly sensetive to aIl the situations in my country, losing my grandparents who I loved very much (also depression) resulted in me not being able to finish the college in 4 years. I was supposed to graduate last June but I have to take 2 more semesters because I barely passed any classes for the past  2 years. Studying engineering and having a depression is not a good mix. And I've had anxiety for as long as I remember but I didnt start having panic attacks until last year. I'm trying my best to recover now, hopefully I'll be able to graduate in 8 months. I'm also trying to improve my GPA.

My only way out of this mess is getting a masters degree somewhere in Europe and try to find work there. (US is too expensive) But then I'll be leaving my family who sacrified everything for me. And they dont have any other kids than me. 

The money is just sitting on my account, I dont do anything with it. It can help me study in Europe and maybe try to build a life there.

Or I can stay and work here, idk, buy a house sometime later, be with my current boyfriend. I must say chemical engineers can't find work here fast because Turkey can't produce anything for shit and there aren't many job openings for us. I'd probably find a job maybe a year after I graduate. I'm frustrated because I want to graduate and start building my life and try my best to leave this mess, but I also cannot commit to even meeting my friends, let alone school. 

My boyfriend knows my situation and understands my decision to leave. But I'm not sure when or if I'll ever be able to leave, I feel like I am cursed and maybe I'll be stuck here  until a suicide bomber decides to blow himself/herself up near me. 

Sorry for my english I'm usually better at writing my thoughts but it's late here and I don't feel very well. I'm just looking for ideas to what to do with the money. Should I save it and start a financially safe life here in Turkey, or should I spend it for a possibility of a better life? 

Even I decide to leave for certain, should the money sit on my account until I leave, or is there anything I can do with it?

Hi /r/PersonalFinance,

I recently graduated college and took a total of ~22k from federal loan providers that I received through FAFSA and my university over the 4 years I spent at school. They are listed below:

* Direct Subsidized Stafford of $3,502.38 w/ interest rate: 3.400%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford of $2,003.31 w/ interest rate: 6.800%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford of $5,500.00 w/ interest rate: 4.660%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford of $2,002.00 w/ interest rate: 4.660%
* Direct Subsidized Stafford of $5,500.00 w/ interest rate: 4.290%
* Direct Unsubsidized Stafford of $2,001.79 w/ interest rate: 4.290%
* Federal Perkins Loan of $1,500 w/ interest rate: 5%

All direct loans were borrowed from Great Lakes and will end grace period next month but are currently, and have been for a while, generating interest. The Federal Perkins loan will end grace period in March next year, but will not generate interest until the grace period is actually over. 

My gross annual income is 85k and my first priority is to pay off the student loan debt ASAP. With that said, I have a few questions about repayment and my plan in general:

* 1) I've read about the ""avalanche"" method from /r/PersonalFinance and was wondering how I would go about paying off loans of higher interest first if they are all from the same provider and if the only payment option that Great Lakes allows is to pay for the entire sum owed (~20k) without letting me choose which ones to prioritize. Would there be a way to apply the avalanche method here or am I completely missing the point?

* 2) I'm hoping to pay off my student loan debt within a year and a half. This means I'd be making payments as much as $1k/month rather than the suggested payment of $214/month on the standard repayment plan I am (which I'm assuming is my minimum payment- please confirm/correct me). Is this a wise/unwise thing to do? Overly ambitious?

 * 3) Along the same vain as the previous question, would it be wise to completely pay off a loan in full (i.e. the Federal Perkins Loan once grace period ends) with just one payment? And imagine I am making regular payments and a payoff amount is now well within my reach of paying it off completely (i.e. 5k left), would it be wise to drop all that $ to clear the debt immediately if I could do so without hurting financially?

* 4) I read somewhere that paying off accrued interest during the grace period can help lower the overall interest you pay in the grand scheme of repaying loans. Is this actually true? I recently made a payment on all of the interest accrued on my direct loans for ~$850, and the loans are still generating interest as we speak... (only $10 to date since I made the payment, but still- it seems like I made a payment on nothing at this point). I kind of just read that and went with it because I had some disposable income but am not feeling confident about my decision now - could someone clarify?

I appreciate all the help so much! 

**TL;DR** should I be using the avalanche method for averaged loans, and if yes, how? is paying more than your standard repayment wise/unwise? how about paying loans off completely in one payment? how does paying for accrued interest on loans in grace period actually help?",finance,1476841056

What do?","Hubby and I just bought our first home in May. Financially we have been well budgeted, and living at means until we moved in to this house. 

We had several thousand left in savings, but lo, when we moved in there were HuGE issues that were not found on inspection, etc, that had to be fixed. We depleted our savings, and nearly maxed out our cards, just so we could move in.

Next came the utilities in the first month (with combined houses), which was almost 1000$. Then came the other ""combined bills"" from moving in the middle of a month. This was the blow that took the rest of our savings. 

The next month we realized that the utility bill would be a 50% increase from where we moved from. (from $250 to 500-600$).We had the house looked at by the power company, and the only fix is to update our ancient ac units (2), seal ductwork, and insulate the roof. Before you ask, no, none of this was found in the inspection.

With no wiggle room left, we found ourselves paying the third mortgage payment just before the ""late"" date. Paychecks were a bit short this month, and we are officially late on October's mortgage, with November's soon to come. 

On top of this, Hurricane Matthew has decimated our yard. We currently have over $5,000 worth of trees to get rid of. Our insurance deductible is $4500, and though we have all of these trees down, none touched the house; so insurance will not cover having them removed. 

We have acquired 12k in credit card debt, which, up until September of this year, we have been paying every note that we owed, on time. 

We applied for a loan to consolidate the credit card debt and assist in covering the tree removal in our yard, plus update the ac units to decrease our monthly bills. The numbers were affordable, interest rate was excellent, and it would have truly helped us get back on our feet, but we were denied. 

At this point we have no idea what to do. We would have never bought this house if we thought we would have been in this position. Everything had been looked at in every way, and yet here we are. 

Any advice would be helpful. Honestly, I don't even know what to ask for; I am just sad and completely lost at the moment.

-I'm in university (2 years till graduation), but work a very well-paying part-time job and clear about $1500/month during the semester, obviously more when i can work full time (summer, etc)
-house (town house, actually) is valued at about $220,000
-have about 5 grand in liquid assets, started saving in may 2016
-utilities at this place are about $70/mo for NG, $75/mo for hydro, ~$60/mo for water, and $60 for internet
-again, rent would be split 4 ways
-**i may have a close family member who would be willing to help me with a down payment so i could avoid borrowing to make a downpayment/taking on an insured mortgage with less than 20% down**

Now, personalfinance, tell me: is this foolish? should i just pass up this opportunity to buy my mom's place and wait until I'm done school? or is there a way that this can be done without absurd financial risk to myself?

Hello. I'm looking for any advice, tips, tricks, personal criticism and/or general mocking I can get because I'm at my wit's end.

I was very irresponsible with credit cards/loans/lines of credit when I got my first job after moving back to Alabama. Because of that, I've accrued some substantial debt over the years. I was very inept at handling it, so my response to being overwhelmed would be to apply for a loan to consolidate as much as possible, then run everything back up to the limit. Right now I am lucky to not be overdrawn anywhere from a day to a week and a half before my next paycheck. I've started looking at bankruptcy as a last-ditch effort, but I'd obviously like to avoid that mark on my credit if at all possible.

I currently live with my brother, and my goal is to move out. I know I can't do that until I not only get my debts paid off, but completely change my attitude toward money. I'm hoping I can do that with personalfinance's help.

tl;dr - stupid with money, earned a lot of debt, need to find areas to cut and a solid plan to pay things off quickly.

I've applied for two credit cards this year and both got denied because of how many accounts I have open due to student loans. I have 17 accounts open with FedLoan, and some of them are fairly new. Two of them are less than 6 months old which tanked my credit score by 20 points, bringing it down to 587. I have bills in my name that I always pay on time, but my credit score will not go up.

I want to get a credit card to improve my credit but I'm afraid to keep applying because each inquiry drops my credit score further and it just becomes a ruthless cycle of applying, denying, lower credit, etc. I've looked into secured cards but even those aren't guaranteed acceptance which means I have a chance of being denied and lowering my credit score even further.

personalfinance,Should I utilize student loans to pay off higher interest debt to save money get out of debt faster?,"I am going back to school and can use student loans to catch up on some debt payments. My school expenses will be covered 100% by the GI Bill.

Basic Breakdown:
My wife is a stay at home mom. We have 3 kids ages 3, 4, and 5
Salary $65k
VA Disability: $1050 (monthly)
GI Bill Stipend $800 (Per month for the next 15 months while I work on my MBA)

Debts (Most figures rounded):
Car1: $8000 @ 3.8%  $180 monthly
Car2: $20900 @5.1% $355 monthly
Personal Loan: 12000 @ 11.9% $270 monthly
Student Loans: $16000 3.5-6% (4 separate loans, currently deferred but the payment shows is $170)
House: $855 a month (Including tax/insurance. Will not be trying to pay extra on in this stage)

The personal loan was from getting out of an upside down car payment that was $650 a month. As Dave Ramsey would say it is our stupid tax. We have loosely followed some of Dave's financial advice. Most importantly we live on a budget (nYNAB), and are very good at sticking to what we budget for.  Including the $800 stipend for going back to school, I will be able to put an additional $1600 a month on debt payments (this is in addition to the normal monthly payments).

I qualified for $14k @5.3% in federal student loans, and since my school is 100% covered by the GI bill, I could use that money for living expenses. And in this case, living expenses would pay off some of the high interest personal loan debt. It would come in 2 disbursements, 1 in November and 1 in April. I would likely only take the first disbursement, as I could pay the remainder of the balance off before April.

I know that you can't ""borrow your way out of debt""; however I would be able to pay off more than half of the personal loan if I take the student loan. This puts me months ahead on my unbury.us calculation. Faster wins = more motivation to get out of debt sooner. Any thoughts or other ideas are welcome, feel free to call me stupid for trying to borrow my way out of debt faster. Deep down I don't want to pass up the opportunity to possibly save quite a bit of money on interest.

My sister had some trouble with taxes one year, didn't file on time and then just started avoiding it for subsequent years. Now her chickens have come home to roost and her bank account is locked and her wages being garnished. Also, apparently in our state the interest rate she's being charged is 18% so it's basically 10k in credit card debt. She basically lives paycheck to paycheck, in the sense that she's never out of money, but never really has excess either.

She's not a redditor so I offered to seek out advice on her behalf. Is there some lawyer magic that can reduce the amount she has to pay? Some way to get the interest rate down? Could she pay a lesser amount if it's a lump sum right away? In the last case I would offer to pay it for her.

**edit** I should have mentioned this started with an unusual income situation at her previous job where the default withholdings were not being taken out of her paychecks.

I could pay the minimum's on these small loans until they're deferred during medical school (trying to save money for housing, books, food, etc. during school).

Or I could pay off these loans more aggressively, starting with the ones that have the most interest, because I'm afraid of interest charges and would rather pay ~$15,000 total instead of ~$20,000 total.

I don't want to stress about every dollar and hurt these two years, so I feel like I should save my money now due to the low interest rates on the loans - but I might like the piece of mind of doing something like just paying off the 4.7% loan. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance,1476887435

Seeing the #1 post on here today, I'm going to write a guide to identity theft as well.

**Finding Your Credit Score**

Unlike your credit report, credit bureaus are not obligated to tell you what your credit score is once a year. It helps to get a frame of reference to start from when you’re trying to repair your credit which is why I’d recommend using either [Credit Karma](http://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-monitoring-services/creditkarma-com-review/) or [Credit Sesame](http://financeography.com/credit-sesame-review/) to find your credit score, otherwise known as your VantageScore. This is what most credit card companies and other lenders will use in determining your creditworthiness. You can also pay for a $1 trial at any of the 3 major credit bureau websites (Equifax, Transunion and Experian) but it only lasts 7 days and they automatically rebill you between $20-$30 a month after the seven days are up.

At the same time, I’d also suggest getting your credit reports from [AnnualCreditReport.com.](http://annualcreditreport.com) This is the website the three major bureaus use to satisfy their annual credit report requirements to consumers. If you’re trying to work on your credit score, I’d suggest drawing all three reports at once since they look different for about 90% of people who have used credit in the past. You’ll be able to to get updated credit reports in the future before the year is up, which I will touch on a bit lower.

Once you have your scores and credit reports in hand, it should be fairly easy to see what’s hurting your credit score. High balances on credit cards, collection accounts, charged-off accounts, settled accounts, etc.

**Paying Down Credit Card/HELOC Balances**

This is probably the easiest way to raise your credit score since credit utilization is one of the biggest factors that go into determining what kind of score you have. People who might lend to you would much rather see you using $50 of a $1000 credit line (5% utilization) as opposed to $950 (95% utilization). [Getting your utilization down](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/home-equity/heloc-like-credit-card-account.aspx) under 10% is ideal and your credit score will reflect it within a month. It is not uncommon to see a credit score rise 40 points or more just from paying down a credit card.

**Credit Report Investigations**

Making the credit reporting bureaus investigate items on your credit report is something they are required to do by law. Take note of everything that looks bad on your reports **with the exception of accounts that are one or two months late right now**. Give your creditor a call on accounts that are just a month or two late, ask them to waive the late payment/fee that is associated with the late payment and many times the late mark will come off of your credit report, or prevent it from going on in the first place.

You’re going to be [writing three letters](http://www.myfico.com/crediteducation/rights/sample-credit-report-dispute-letter-of-explanation.aspx) - one to each of the credit reporting bureaus. In the letters, start  off with your name/address/DOB and a sentence that basically says “My credit report file number is (enter the file number of your report here)

“I request an investigation into the following accounts confirming the accuracy of all reported data:”

You’ll then list the creditor name and your account number (or the last few digits, whatever the report shows) for every account with negative information in it.

Sign/date it and ship it to the credit bureaus, here are the addresses you’ll need:

Equifax
P.O. Box 740256
Atlanta, GA 30374

Transunion
Consumer Dispute Center
P.O. Box 2000
Chester, PA 19016

Experian
P.O. Box 4500
Allen, TX 75013

Be sure to send these via certified mail in order to receive a tracking number. The bureaus will have 30 days to complete their investigation starting the business day after they receive your letter.

It’s also possible to dispute accounts online but for credit repair purposes you don’t want everything to be completely automated. A human may never see or touch your data if you file the disputes online, causing everything to be done automatically just from accessing databases. The creditor is supposed to actually conduct an investigation but it can be hard to prove whether they did or did not. Getting your letter into the hands of a human adds another step for the bureaus and your creditors to follow which can increase the chances that the negative information will fall off of your report.

After 30 days, you should be informed by the bureau what the investigation found. If there was an error, it will most likely be corrected. If they don’t hear anything back from the creditor, the account should come off of your credit report. No matter what, you will be entitled to see an updated copy of your credit report, even if you’ve already used your free copy from AnnualCreditReport.com.

While a removal due to an investigation or lack thereof may remove an account, there is always a chance that it might be placed back on there in the future.

**Removing Collections Accounts**

Collections accounts are placed on your credit report by agents acting on behalf of creditors. Debt collectors, especially shady ones, might try just throwing an account onto your credit report and hoping that you pay it off. This is referred to as “parking” a debt, which isn’t necessarily illegal, but in many cases a debt collector does not follow the law when doing this.

The [FDCPA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text) and [FCRA](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-credit-reporting-act) come into play when trying to remove a collections account. There are a laundry list of rules that debt collectors have to abide by to legally come after you for money but the one many of them fail to follow involves giving you required written notices. 

Debt collectors can call you before writing you but they are required to send you a letter detailing your debt within 5 days of first contact with you. If they fail to do that, it’s an FDCPA violation, same goes for failing to tell you that they are going to report negative information to a credit reporting agency regarding your account. Catching them doing this can almost always result in an offer to pull the account from your credit and possibly wipe out your debt depending on what you owe. You might need to talk to a consumer attorney about this however, but most should readily take you as a client since they get to charge their fees separately, which can quickly climb into the thousands.

If you’re learning about a collection account for the first time from a letter in the mail, you need to send them a [debt validation letter](http://financeography.com/why-debt-validation-is-so-important/) to make sure that your right to dispute the debt stays intact. Even if you receive the letter a long time ago, you can still send the validation letter to get them to acknowledge the facts about the debt. A surprise collections account on your credit report, assuming it wasn’t added in the last few days, is almost always going to result in an [FCRA violation](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/most-common-violations-the-fcra.html) for failing to tell you they are giving negative information about you and your account to a credit reporting agency.

Collection accounts stemming from a credit card company and some auto loans may be eligible for [binding arbitration](http://financeography.com/consumer-arbitration-can-help-with-credit-card-collections/). Many debt collectors will drop your case immediately once you elect arbitration because it can easily cost them several times more than the amount of your debt. Consumers trying to repair their credit can use arbitration their advantage by electing it immediately with a debt validation letter, preventing a debt collector from suing.

Most debt collectors will actually wait until you pay your portion of the arbitration fees ($200-250 max, $0 for California residents) before either reaching out to settle (which can result in a removal of the account from your credit report) or just dropping it entirely.

Some debt collectors will ignore arbitration demands, even if it clearly spells out the procedure for it in your original contract. When this happens, you can force it in small claims court, or pony up the $400 for a federal court case. Going either of these routes will almost always result in the arbitrator awarding you the fees that you had to spend up til that point in order to force the debt collector to the table, at the very least.

Other than electing arbitration, if a credit agency investigation concludes the debt is valid, you can write another letter demanding to know [exactly how the investigation took place and who was in charge of the investigation](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-puts-companies-on-notice-about-duty-to-investigate-consumer-credit-report-disputes/). Sometimes the credit reporting bureau will respond back with the information, sometimes they will just drop the account themselves.
 
**Dealing with Charge-Offs/Settled Accounts**

[Charge-offs](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/credit-card-debt-charged-off/) and settled accounts are a tougher nut to crack as opposed to collection accounts. Most of these types of accounts will come from credit card or personal loan companies. Your local payday lender might go out of business within a couple of years, or may not be quite as diligent about records, but a major credit card company is going to have everything documented and readily available. 

The above information about credit reporting investigations applies to these accounts as well, just do not be surprised if they tend to stick. Some credit card companies might remove your payment history from the account, which can help with your on-time payment percentage, but the line will still remain visible to others who pull your credit.

If you believe that they may have committed an FCRA violation, talk to a consumer attorney about starting a case against them. Like I said, even if you only get awarded $100 for the violation, your attorney might make thousands. Part of your agreement should mandate that they remove the entire account from your credit report, possibly in lieu of payment (to you).

As a last ditch effort, you can try writing goodwill letters to individuals high up the chain-o-command at the credit card companies. Most likely, you will get rejected, but you may be able to find someone compassionate enough to forward your letter to someone who can remove the information. 

**Statute of Limitations**

New York residents only need to wait 5 years before negative information comes off of their credit report while everyone else has to wait 7 years. The kicker here is that most consumer debts have a statute of limitations of only [3-6 years](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-state-statute-limitations-1282.php) (except Iowa and Rhode Island, both at 10 years) depending on which state you live in. The information can still stay on your credit report for the full 5/7 years, but the creditor or debt collector cannot attempt to collect the debt.

In these cases, when all else has failed, you can write a debt validation letter but be extra careful to not claim the debt as yours. Refer to the debt as “alleged” and make no mention of wanting to pay anything. At this late stage, the creditor or debt collector doesn’t have to respond to your letter, if that happens, there isn’t much you can do. What you’ll often find with validation requests though is the creditor will include a letter stating that this debt is “valid” and giving you a phone number to call to discuss payment options, along with documentation proving the debt is valid. Count yourself lucky if this happens because you’ve got them on (probably multiple) FDCPA violations. Get your attorney and get the process started, just be sure one of the terms of your settlement (debt collectors will almost always settle if they know they will not win in court) is to have the negative information take off your credit report.

One important thing to note here is that the [FDCPA only applies to debt collectors](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-is-the-diffrence-between-debt-collector-creditor.html), not to the original creditor. A Capital One account that defaults and is sold or assigned to a debt collector means the debt collector needs to follow the FDCPA. If Capital One wanted to keep the debt themselves, they wouldn’t have to follow FDCPA guidelines.

**Special Notes**

**Federal Student Loans/Tax Liens** - You can dispute, validate, send goodwill letters, and argue until your face turns blue, but these types of cases are going to stay on your credit report until they are paid. Once you’ve paid a tax lien, there is a form you can file with the IRS to [get the process of removing it from your credit report started](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f12277.pdf). Federal student loan information will stay on your credit report for 7 years after it is paid off. 

**Court Judgements** - Disputes may work with court judgements but you will still owe the money they say you owe. It can help your credit score but pay off the judgement or they will still have grounds to put it back on your credit report, this time in the form of a collections account. It may also be possible to have the judgement vacated, which will remove it from your credit report, but that only happens in certain circumstances

**Goodwill letters for late payments** - I explained that goodwill letters are a last resort measure if nothing else works for accounts. You may have slightly better luck with a goodwill letter if you just want late payment information removed, though there is a much better chance than not you will still be rejected.

**Being added as an authorized user on someone else’s credit card** - This can help your credit score in the short-term but any lender taking a close look at your credit will see exactly what you are trying to do. 

**Hard Inquiries** - For the most part, don’t worry about them. Shopping around for rates is expected and your credit score might take a slight dip after 30 days that it will recover from within a few months.

personalfinance,[United States] I have to leave school unfinished - here's my dilemma.,"I'm in a weird spot - I'm 21, still living with family, and school has just become cost prohibitive. 

In my state, if you have more than x credit hours, you have to pay out of state tuition at state schools. I'm currently at (x - 1 semester) and my situation is such that my parents have a buttload of real estate but no liquid assets. Moreover, they have made clear that their method of supporting my education is free living with them, free vehicle, etc. The buttload of real estate means no federal financial aid, other than ~7500/yr in unsubsidized loans that do nothing to actually help. I'm pushing the number of credit hours because my advisor conveniently left out the whole, ""Oh, by the way, you're gonna have to pay 7x tuition if you switch your degree"" thing when I asked about switching my degree from M.E. to computer science.

Well, the commute is long, the vehicle gets terrible mileage, and I'm spending close to $300 dollars on gas per month for school alone, excluding everything else.

Now, I know of places I can trim the fat in my admittedly shaky budget. But it's only shaky because my expenses outside of gas are low. That's about to change.

I have to quit school, I refuse to take out over $40,000 to finish my degree at a subpar university, which, until now, I could afford out of pocket by aggressively saving at my 12.50/hr, 20hr/wk job. 

Here's the aforementioned dilemma.

At $13K/yr, I have to somehow pay:
Rent: My parents have already told me that my residence with them is only good while I'm in school.

Car: I will need to source a vehicle. I'm a car guy so I'm totally okay with a beater and a tool kit, but that can be extraordinarily expensive and I'd have to save a bit longer to make that happen. On an objective scale, I'd rather have &lt;$200/mo payment on a 3 or 4 year old car, but that might be financially impossible.

Insurance: I can get benefits through my work, but that will slash my already scary takehome pay.

Loans: Between just under 17K in private loans, and just over 20K in federal loans, I have to somehow pay the minimum balance on each while dealing with all of the above.

Now, mitigating factors. My company has made it clear that at the location I currently work, I will not be able to get any extra hours. I can pick up hours at other locations but that is unreliable, and extra income at best.

I used to work at a restaurant near my current job, and on the few times I've been there the kitchen manager has all but dragged me back in there, begging me to come back. I'm confident I could pick up at least 30 hours a week there, but pay would be dismal. $10/hr if I'm lucky, in awful working conditions that really ought to be reported to the labor board.

Living: I'm blessed to have a wonderful church family, many of whom know of my situation and are sympathetic. I'm confident one of them would put their money where their mouth is and lend me a spare room/couch for a while, but I'm not a fan of relying on such things since they can come and go with the wind.

Other debt: Zilch. I have 2 credit cards, one through my bank that I got to build credit, and an AMEX that kicked back $500 when I used it to pay for tuition this year. Both are paid off in full every month without exception.

This means I have good credit for someone my age: 744, 744, 732 (Transunion, Equifax, Experian) [actually was higher, all 760's until this month due to aforementioned AMEX card, oops] and refinancing might be easier should it be a requirement down the road.

I'm wondering if this financial puzzle is even possible - obviously I would have to live like a monk for a while (which I'm okay with), sell a bunch of stuff to build capital (which I'm okay with - I'm a huge computer nerd and suddenly selling off all my gear would bring in close to $800 easy), and find a 2nd job (which is easy, if unattractive). Y'all know way more about this stuff than I do, and I'm sincerely hoping someone has some insight because this is scary as all hell.

Note for the obvious ""stay in school"" argument - I've considered that. And my university, to put it kindly, isn't worth 20 grand a year. After I've been on my own, and no longer live under the umbrella of my parents' real estate assets, I will probably qualify for way more financial aid than I do now. School isn't totally done and over with (probably), just on the back burner until it becomes affordable again.

Edit: forgot to mention I've got about $1000 in savings, that's about it. Only recurring monthly expense other than gas is $200 to my parents for the money they fronted a few years ago, then stopped due to financial constraints on their end.

EDIT 2: Even better news! I got done with my school a few minutes ago and it turns out my credits from my last university don't count against me and this will not be an issue. I was given bad info before. Thanks everyone who chimed in!",finance,1476892242

personalfinance,New Graduate Credit Score and Utilization Questions,"I am 22 and moving into my first real job, and with that my expenses are growing (within reason). I currently have 1 credit card which I have always paid off each month and have a credit score in the mid 700's. As my expenses are growing with moving out on my own, the utilization of my one CC has grown to over 50% of my limit almost every month. I am considering getting a new credit card to spread the charges across two cards. I do not plan on spending more, just spreading charges out between two cards and paying them off each month still. 

I also plan on consolidating a few private student loans out of Wells Fargo into one loan through Sofi. I would like to do this so that my parent's are no longer connected as cosigners (given the new job I am pre-approved without cosigners) and I have also been pre-approved at a lower combined interest rate. 

Would my credit score take a large hit from getting the credit card now and then applying to consolidate next month? Would the hit from a new credit card be enough to change the terms I was pre-qualified for? Any help would be appreciated considering the credit cards or the student loans.

personalfinance,[LOMG] ATM Card &amp; PIN was skimmed &amp; account cleaned out. Police report filed and Bank won't do anything else. What next?,"I'm posting this for a family friend. A domestic working lady. low income. Near nonexistent English ability.

Anyways, Her ATM card and PIN was skimmed and cloned. Her bank account was cleaned out over 2 days.  She notified the bank the day it happened (which should have led to a closing of the account) but the card worked on the following day -- leading to the account being cleaned out. 

She duly contacted the bank (with help of other friends) which opened an investigation (within their operations) while she also filed a police report re: the theft with the local police precinct. 

Anyways, The police detective investigating the incident concluded that she was a victim of an organized operation (as she was not the only victim locally) and had forwarded his conclusion to the bank's fraud department that this was a legitimate theft. 

From here is where things go off the rails a bit...

I would suppose that the Banks would have deposit insurance to cover such events, (after all, isn't that what the FDIC is all about?) issue her a check for the loss and book it to their bank's fraudulent loss ledger. This was not the case; The bank closed ""their"" investigation and basically concluded nothing else could be done -- claiming the police had not reached any conclusion with their investigation. 

(this kind of bouncing back-and-forth between the bank and PD did/didn't do has been going around for a few months before i got a hold of these details.)

Anyways, I went down to the Bank and met with the local branch manager who basically ""kicked everything upstairs to their fraud detection department."" The only straight answer out of this guy was was a confirmation of what the daily cash withdrawal limit on the account was (""$700"") My Q: ""Then why would the bank's computers approve a withdrawal of $900+?"" Him: (silence)

So this is where I see things getting sketchy and hoofed down to the local Police precinct to track down the original investigating detective. 

The detective's response was basically this: He had investigated the incident and concluded (my friend) was a victim of an organized skimming operation and she was not the only one that was hit. He had sent his conclusions to the banks involved that was basically that.

The sidenote from the detective: The other banks involved have apparently resolved the reported thefts with their customers SAVE FOR YOURS. He also mentioned that the situation was not unique to her (3+ others have also had issues with this bank at this branch.)

This is just 1 bank branch and 1 police precinct in this big city. (NYC) One shudders to think that the scale of this could be going on citywide or even nationally.

The legal avenue I've explored suggests that this is a small claims issue, lawyers will not want to be involved (because of the small stake involved) and the most the bank will offer to ""settle"" any action she takes will be about $500 (far below what she had in the bank to begin with and almost not worth her added anguish -- which is a bit.)

Is it possible for a bank to be willfully blind to theft of their customers to keep their fraud losses (and thereby fraud loss insurance premiums) low or am I just being extremely cynical?

What recourse does my family friend have besides the filing of a complaint with the state banking authority, dept. of consumer affairs and the like?

Any additional advice would be appreciated! Thanks All!

personalfinance,Refinancing within a year of moving,"I'll be living in my current place for at least one year. Then I'll decide if I want to upgrade, relocate, or wait another year before making a change.

I know it's *usually* a bad idea to refinance if you'll be moving. However, my current lender is offering a $0 closing cost refinance. I know, this usually means a higher rate, but...

* the rate is .5% lower than my current rate, which would save me ~$500 over a year
* I'm at 20% equity, with 1 year left before hitting 22% for PMI to drop off. That's another ~$500 saved in a year

I am not quite sure how to manage my 401k with the talks of the potential volatility in the future. I read that if the Fed rate hike raises then bonds will fall, so bonds are a bad bet. I also read we are in a bubble and stocks could be falling in a years time, so stocks are tough.

Now don't get me wrong, I read into this and am not saying this will happen. But, I would like to know what a more stable bet would be to do with my 401k if it where to happen. Do I put my money in foreign or world stocks, stick with bonds or just keep it where its at with a mix of stocks and bonds and whatever happens, happens.

Currently, I am working 30 hours @ 18.26 an hour.  My school is paid for by the VA.  I also get $530 from the VA every month for school.

So next year, I will have $742 a month to live off of (the $53) will increase due to bigger class load).  Working will be very tough due to the busy schedule.

How can I earn as much money as possible in the next 8 months?  Obviously my current job will not suffice as it is only 30 hours.  I will not be taking any classes.   My schedule will be completely free January-August.  What kind of work should I look into in order to save as much money as I can to stay afloat in Nursing school next year?

I would like to find a job making 50k.  In 8 months that would be $33,333.  I believe with my current expenses that I could probably save half of that, leaving me with a nice 15k or so to use during school in addition to my $742 a month.

worldpolitics,"Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, the Media, and Why You Should Vote Third Party","This collection of articles was put together in the hopes that I can persuade undecideds to vote third party.  It focuses entirely on the mass levels of corruption between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic party, and the suppression of information carried out by mainstream media and efforts like Correct the Record.  We already know Donald Trump is a deplorable (I’ll agree with Hillary on that one) con-man that appeals to the lowest common denominator of our celebrity obsessed culture, so I’ve decided to deny him any further coverage.  What matters more is that we respond critically to the Democratic party leaders who are supposed to speak for, and represent the voices of sanity and reason.  We must hold them accountable for their disgraceful actions that took place during the 2016 primary election, otherwise we may never live to see another candidate who truly represents the voices of the ignored.  I understand why people are voting for Clinton over Trump, but it should be met with extreme reluctance.  Clinton will win, but the victory should be met by a small margin.  We need to stop the spread of misinformation that paints her as a progressive, or a liberal.  We have to signal that we’re #BernedOut, that we’re not in favor of short sighted self-interest based politics.  When both candidates have the lowest favorability over any candidates in presidential history, if we don’t take a stand now…then when will we?  

I’d like to clear one thing up that disenfranchised voters are so keen on setting, Bernie was no sell out.  Not once did he ever demonstrate a decision that was made to benefit his own self-interests, his decisions have always been made to benefit the people of the United States of America.  While I don’t agree with his endorsement for Clinton, he did what he thought was best for this country by not taking the risk of electing a man who has encouraged intolerance in his platform.  Bernie supports the Democratic platform that he helped create, not the presidential candidate who orchestrated a war against progressivism and idealism.

personalfinance,"Mom couldn't afford the car I co-signed for anymore, stopped paying and let them repo it. What can I do?","So, the title is pretty self-explanatory, but here's the deal:

I co-signed for a car with my mother about 4 years ago to help lower her interest rate since I had pretty good credit at the time (around 700). Since then, I defaulted on my student loans for a while, which lowered my credit to around 500. I did the whole forbearance thing and have been up-to-date on EVERYTHING since then because, y'know, credit. I've been trying to recover so that I can eventually get my own place and all. Then my mother separated from her husband and decided that she can't afford that $400 car payment anymore, stopped paying, and let the bank or whoever repossess it. I expected this to be a burden on my credit, but now I've gotten a letter from the finance company (addressed to only me, not my mother) that says I owe them over $5,000 for this crap.

I feel helpless in this, and so angry at my mom for doing that to me after I told her it would affect me as well. Is there anything I can do other than just trying to pay it off myself? Because I don't think she plans to.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies. Everyone said exactly what I expected in this situation. Basically, I'm fucked. I'm trying not to take some of the comments too personally because I'm sure random people on the internet aren't trying to make a young, obviously naive stranger feel even MORE shitty than that person already does, right? Especially when that person was asking for advice about a potentially devastating situation. That never happens. Right, Internet? Yeah, thought so.

personalfinance,Need to pay down debt but am not living within my means. These are new problems for me. Please help.,"Hey all!  

I recently accumulated quite a bit of credit card debt while making an attempt at self-employment.  I’m now back in a full time job and have a steady income again.  However, not only do I have way more debt than I have ever had in my life, I am also – for the first time I can remember – unable to stick to a budget.  I know I need to be disciplined with my spending, and feel irresponsible that I’m not able to do so. While I’m not charging to credit at all, I am slowly depleting the cash that I do have saved up.  

I recognize that this is a big a problem but just cannot seem to actually stick to my budget.  I know that until I do this, the debt will never ever be resolved.

Here are some questions:

1)	How do I get my act together and start living within my means?
2)	What’s the deal with debt relief organizations/programs?
3)	Have any of you sought out loan consolidation through P2P (e.g. SoFi, LightStream)?
4)	If I can in fact get a lower interest rate through one of these companies, is there some catch I’m overlooking or are these guys usually pretty legit?

Here are some rough numbers in case they affect your advice:

$22k credit card debt., $14k accruing interest, $8k starts accruing in Feb (at the moment approx. $430/mo. payment, $200/mo. interest)
$11k student loan debt @ 5.75% ($191/mo. payment)
$2300 cash
$3200/mo. income after taxes, before expenses
Credit score: approx. 665 (was once between 775-800 but has been dropping over the past 1-2 years)

Any advice would be very much appreciated!",finance,1476905665

**Key Points of Discussion:**


**Retirement:**

Male will retire September 2018 or June 2019 (retirement rules are currently in flux)

Female will retire June 2019 (not promoted) or June 2021 (if promoted)

Goal is to transition from received income to retirement income to simulate living off of that income. For male begins January 2017 and female January 2018.

Will maintain medical (Tricare) into retirement

Plan is to move to CO after retirement. Decent job opportunity, own home there, great school, friends and church.

Other options are Texas due to abundant job opportunity, potential for lower cost of living, tax benefits.


**Taxes: Married filing Joint**

Retirement Income: $92,414.88 – $110,412.73

Federal 25% ($75,301 to $151,900) based on retirement income alone

Federal 28% ($151,901 to $231,450) if one person works

Would probably be in 33% tax bracket if both work (highly unlikely)

CO State 4.63% (income flat tax)

TX State no income tax


**Investments:**

No budget to continue additional investments if completely/semi-retired

If one person were to get a full time job intent would be to contribute majority to investments

Intent is to not touch investment portfolio until daughter graduates high school (2032)


**Post Military retirement employment:**

Male intends to pursue work to fill the gap of bills (~$7,000 monthly) and retirement pay minus taxes. Not sure the extent of that work (full time/part time) (not sure what he wants to be when he grows up).

Female does not intend to work.


**Budget:**

Currently tracking spending very closely to the penny to get a better understanding of our budget.

personalfinance,Drowning in personal debt and need advice,"My Credit card debt 18k

 My GF - 15k


We started a business together and it failed when she got pregnant. It was all on our personal credit cards. She went to work since she had a career and i stayed home to raise the baby while going back to school PT.


Her credit score is 740.
She wanted to consolidate all our debt into a loan for better interest rates and lower payments. We are sinking fast.
We both have job opportunities in NY. We live in LA. So we also wanted a little extra cash for moving expenses.


Prosper, Lending Club and Best Egg all sucked.


She also applied for a 30k loan at her bank Wells Fargo and they counter offered 16k which doesn't help. The person at the bank suggested countering that with a 20k request but we asked for 25.
So my question is, are there any more options for us? A better place to apply for a loan? Since I'm technically not employed we were keeping me off but if it's for a debt consolidation and it would work we would do it together. Although since my credit is maxed out my credit score is bad. Like 623 or something like that. No late payments. I was over 750 a couple of years ago.
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!!",finance,1476906498
personalfinance,Applying for car loan + mortgage within 12 months of each other: How much of a bad idea?,"High level question: I need a new car, but also looking to apply for a mortgage within the next 12 months. How much of a bad idea is it to do this in such an order (car loan, then mortgage)? Or does it really matter?

&amp;nbsp;

**Some context**


I'm in my 30s, and my wife and I take home roughly $160k gross per year. We have no debt at the moment. All liquid assets are around $200k (savings and stocks). While I realize we have an above average amount of cash and income, we also have a child and plan to have another so I'm always thinking of the future. Credit score for both of us is over 800.

&amp;nbsp;


**The situation**

My current vehicle is on its last legs. It's about 12 years old and its current repair needs will cost more than the car is worth. I'm a car enthusiast, and I love driving. As a result, I'm looking at vehicles in the $25k-$30k range. I could purchase outright, but with interest rates so low (~1.75% through my lender), that doesn't really make sense. I'd rather take the dollar amount of the car and invest it, paying maybe 10% down.  


The wrinkle in this is that we will be looking to apply for a mortgage within the next 12 months. Most likely in the $400k-$500k range in terms of the loan itself. I have no clue how much we could take out as a loan, this would just be our goal/target.

&amp;nbsp;

**My question**

How much of a negative impact will the auto loan have on our situation come next year when we apply for a mortgage? How much of a credit ding and therefore, interest rate increase, might it cause? How much would the monthly debt obligation from the auto loan impact how a lender would rate us?

&amp;nbsp;

I realize I may be overthinking this, but I also want to make sure I'm not doing anything entirely stupid. I realize the most reasonable/practical approach would be to get as safe, reliable and comfortable car I could for the least amount of money. However, I love driving, working on my car, etc..., so it's not so easy a decision in my head.

Thanks in advance for any helpful input.",finance,1476907170

Savings: 2K (trying to save up for an emergency fund)


**Game plan:**
So the current plan is for me to pay off the lower interest rate credit card first, then keep doing 0% balance transfers onto cards so I won't be getting killed by interest charges. Does this make sense? Is this sustainable? Can you help me come up with any ways to pay this down faster?

Should I use my savings to pay off the bulk of the BoA card or one of the other cards? Or should I stop saving? I know I have the means to handle paying for this, but I'm having trouble with how. Advice, tips and tricks, wake up calls?

**Misc:**
I also have various credit cards (5 VISAs + 3 Store Cards) carrying no balance, so I have that going for me I guess. I am not using these accounts, I'm hoping they'll eventually drop off my credit report.",finance,1476907392

Our loan for the house is $200,000 with an interest rate of 4.5%.  My goal is to be able to be home with my kids (planning on having a child in 8 years) as they grow up, my Dad was able to when I was young and I want to be able to do the same. If I find a job that allows me to work from home by the time kids come around that would be fantastic, but that isn't something I can't guarantee will happen. 

So my other thought was I could utilize my savings (I already have my emergency fund built luckily) to pay down my current mortgage as soon as possible, and then do the same for another place, with the idea of getting enough rental properties to be able to cover the expenses of my family down the line. Hopefully this would mean I could leave the 9-5 job while our kids are fairly young, and have all the time needed to be a landlord. 

So my question is if this is even feasible, or whether I should just focus on investing in index funds, and go the old school route instead? Any advice, or general guidance is appreciated.  Thanks in advance for your time and assistance. 

P.S. I left the savings lumped together (not seperated by IRA, stocks, ect.) because I think this is a discussion about what to do with that to accomplish my goals

personalfinance,"80k in student debt. Dad offered to pay about half of it, then have me pay it back to him at a lower rate, but I'm worried this will only increase my monthly payments.","So I'm fresh out of law school with $82k in student debt ($72k principal, $10k in interest). This debt consists of four different unsubsidized loans for the four years I was in law school, and interest rates range from 5.4% to 6.8%. I am currently looking for a job and signed up for the income based repayment plan, so I have no monthly payments for the time being.

My dad recently offered to give me about $40k to pay off part of my loans. His idea was that I could repay *him* instead at a lower interest rate (say around 3%). This is a very generous offer and theoretically it could save me thousands in the long run.

Here is my problem. Having two separate loans will mean that I will pay more monthly payments. Whether I owe $40k separately to my dad will not be taken into account when my repayment plan is calculated.

Say I don't take my dad up on his offer and say I start off by paying $500/month and end up paying $1k+ towards the end. This will increase with my salary, and I can pay off my debt in ten years and will have paid, say, $130k total.

Say I do take him up on his offer. I can pay maybe $300/month in the beginning PLUS the $500/month to my dad. I will have paid less over time (by a bit) but will consistently have higher monthly payments. 

So the monthly payment issue is my biggest concern. I feel like I would be a fool not to take my dad up on his offer, but what is the most financially responsible way to go about this?

personalfinance,Seeking advice for potential refinance,"Looking for some advice as my husband and I cannot decide what is the wisest choice.  Be warned, this is wordy.  

Edited to add: clearly i'm not great at reddit formatting.


Background: We’re in our 30s and purchased our first home in June 2015. We only had 5% to put down without completely depleting our savings.   Loan was a 30 year conventional at 3.99% for $200,450.  80% Loan to value would be approximately 170k so we’re paying PMI currently and looking at paying PMI for a number of years. Our current principal balance is 195,500.   While our credit is stellar, I’ve always felt that 3.99% felt a little high, but figured it is what it is.  I was told by our mortgage broker that the rate was high because we had minimal down. 


My original mortgage broker reached out last week with a warning that the Fed could raise rates in December and now may be a good time to refinance.  I was skeptical so I asked her to lay out some scenarios and told her we were not at all interested in refinancing back up to a 30 year. We would want to stick with 28 or go even shorter. 


For what it’s worth, I’m an intense micromanager when it comes to finances related to daily/monthly budgeting and retirement and other investments. I pride myself on having a great handle on our finances and have a super detailed multi-tab spreadsheet I use to track income/outgo, mortgage and escrow details, etc. I’m still a bit foggy where real estate is concerned so I feel uncertain about the options put in front of me. 


These are the options she provided with our current info below.

Current:    
* 955.82 P&amp;I  
* 216.39 RE Tax  
* 68.62 HO Insurance  
* 90.20 MI  
* Total: 1331.03  

We usually pay a small amount of additional principal to make a payment of $1360.  Once our two smallish loans (student and vehicle) are paid off in 2017 and we’ve beefed up our emergency fund, we plan to throw more at the principal to get down to the 80% LTV to rid the PMI.

Below copied from her email:
Refinancing options info for a 28 year (336 months) fixed rate with current balance of appx 195700:
 

Refinance Option 1:    
* 3.5 Rate - Loan amount would be 200K with adding closing costs of 3700 to the loan amount and payment would be:    
* 934.60 P&amp;I  
* 212.97 RE Tax  
* 68.79 HO Insurance   
* 68.33 MI  
* 1284.69 TOTAL PITI MONTHLY PAYMENT  
* 500 plus per yr savings and will make up closing costs in a few years of savings. 



Refinance Option 2:    
* 3.875 Rate – No MI with 200k loan amount that includes closing costs  
* Remove the monthly Mortgage Insurance (90 per month) from your payment by building a onetime MI fee into the rate so payment would be on 200k loan that includes closing costs:  
* 976.31 P&amp;I  
* 212.97 RE Tax  
* 68.79 HO Insurance  
* 1258.07 Total PITI MONTHLY PAYMENT  
*  800+ yr savings will make up closing costs in just a couple years  



My refinance Option 3:  
* Leave things alone and stick with what we’ve got.  Consider refinancing in a few years. 



Other things to note: I generally trust her and don’t feel like she’s being slimy though I do realize she has some financial gain in this matter.  She’s not being pushy and is always willing to patiently answer any questions I’ve got, and I’ve had a lot.  

I’m feeling like refinancing is not worthwhile if we’re not going to get a rate closer to 3%.  It could take us up to 7 years to make up for the closing costs and what if we want to refinance within that time?  I feel like I will not regret staying with things as they are right now and may regret refinancing so soon. 

Are either of the refinance options she provided worthwhile?  I really don’t understand how you can wipe out the PMI by increasing the rate

personalfinance,Should I sell my rental property?,"I bought a house in Denver in 2012 for $500k. I lived there for two years, then moved out of state. I now have tenants renting the house and it produces about $800 per month of net rental income. ($3100 on a $2300 mortgage payment.)

Its value has risen to about $750k. Should I keep the house and continue with the status quo? Or sell it before summer of 2017 to avoid the capital gain? (Because I will still have lived there 2 of 5 years.) 

Other considerations:
- I believe there will be continued growth in Denver real estate.
- It has not been too much of a hassle to manage, even from out of state. (knock on wood)
- I have an excellent interest rate on the mortgage -- couldn't replicate if I bought another rental.

personalfinance,Airline Pilot here with seemingly impossible to pay/refinance student loans.,"So here is my situation, I went to flight school at ATP (Airline Transport Professionals) it is a flight school that gets you from Zero time to the Airlines as fast as possible and is widespread across the US. You go in, learn the essentials to get you on your way. No excess degrees (most airlines don't require them) and you get all the requirements to get you on your way to the airlines, Private, multi-engine, instrument commercial, and flight instructor (CFI, CFII, MEI) certificates and ratings. 

I went through this school in 2011, it took me 4 months to complete then i went on to flight instructing to build the required time to get hired by the airlines. When I started the school, the Regional airlines could legally hire a pilot at 250hrs, (not likely) but many were hiring at 600-800hrs. Although due to a change in the Federal Aviation Regulations during my training I now had to build 1500hrs. But that is a story for another day. 

So when I was looking for financing options for ATP, the only lender that would approve such loan was Sallie Mae. I had heard horror stories of this company and really did not want to go with them, but after checking everywhere nobody would give me the $65,000 required for the ATP course saying that flight training is not eligible for student loans. The only flight schools eligible are also accredited collages that offer degrees with the training. Those schools, like Embry Riddle, take many years to complete and cost 5X what ATP costs, but in this age of pilot shortages it gives you no real advantage to getting hired. 

Anyways I ended up just going with the Sallie Mae option as it was my ONLY option. Its a horrific loan, its called the 'Smart Option Student Loan' but it is really a personal loan if you look in the small text. it started at 6% variable with no cap. Lets fast forward almost 6 years. I am currently working at a Regional airline, just started my third year with the company. ATP flight school got me everything i needed to get into my career, however lets get back to this loan.

 Three years ago when the interest on my Sallie Mae loan broke 10% i was desperate to do something. Once again I talked to every bank, lender I could find and nobody would help with this type of personal loan because I didn't get a degree from ATP, I got all of the Certificates and Ratings that they offer, but that doesn't count. I finally found a local Credit Union that was willing to refinance $25,000 of it, at a 3% interest for $300/mo. So I decided I might as well get some of it out of that huge interest rate. 

So now i'm sitting with a $900/mo Sallie Mae payment and a $300/mo payment through the credit union. $1200/mo on student loans is pretty rough when i only grossed $19,000 my first year with the regional airlines that only leaves me making less than $4000 a year to live on after student loans. I'm now grossing just under $40,000/year, I am scraping by barely making payments and living on the bare minimum.

 I realize if I was able to refinance this loan it could drastically increase my quality of life for myself and my family. Even paying a couple hundred less per month would make a world of difference. Not to mention that my interest on my Sallie Mae loan is now just shy of 12% and rising every month, and every month my payoff date is pushed back. So give me suggestions internet. How do you guys think i should go about managing this debt?

personalfinance,International Student in US - How I paid off $40K in Student Loans in 12 months,"Hi All,
I'm an international student in US. I came to US for my Masters at a top US school. I took huge students loan worth $40K at high interest rates back home. I found a good job after graduation( $5500 per month take home pay). My intent was always to pay off student loans as soon as possible. There was also this uncertainty about  US work visa due to lottery system. I had 12 months of OPT period(work authorization without the need of a work visa).

I came up with a plan to save atleast $3500-$3800 per month. Although I could have brought an old car, I car pooled with my colleague to work everyday. I made up my mind to continue living like a student. For me saving was critical since I work in pricey Bay Area. I lived in a shared room paying $850 a month. I set aside $150 for nightouts with friends. Rest was spent on grocery every month.I did minimal shopping during this period. I bought only essential stuff. I hardly ate out. I kept track of my monthly expenses in Excel. I ensured I don't take any unnecessary debt. I have $20K in CC limits. I ensured I pay off completely my credit card bills every month

Living like this was difficult initially. But it became a habit over time. By saving almost $3500 every month, I was able to pay all of my student loan in just 12 months. I was lucky to get work visa the next year. If this had not happened, I would have had to go to my home country. It would have taken alteast 5 years to pay all this debt.

personalfinance,The Cost of A Withdraw?,"I plan on withdrawing my first semester from a private university as a second degree student. I figured out that this degree is not beneficial to my needs and I could be making money now to pay off existing loans, investing my time on something I'm emotionally invested in. However, it seems they aren't letting me go that easily.

When I spoke to the Registrar and Financial Aid Office about my plan to withdraw numerous times, they made it clear that I would there will be ""liabilities and flat charge"" charged if I decided to leave. However, my federal loans and bank loans have already covered for the semester. I have a zero balance on my account. I understand that after a 5 weeks from start of the semester, I won't be qualified for any reimbursement, fine. But what the hell do I owe the school for? 

When I asked how much would I owe the school, they simply said the amount of money I owe would be *unknown* until I officially withdraw.  When I asked why I owe them? ""Because the university would have to return the loans with my withdraw."" Ok but the loans have already been disbursed and the 5 initial weeks of refund have expired. I am not expecting any returns so just let me leave and pay my loan providers. WTF am I paying?

The staff I spoke to mentioned about a policy how if I withdraw after the 60% mark of the semester, the ""liabilities"" would have been utilized. At that point, I wouldn't owe money. Best part: The office doesn't know when this 60% mark is. I assume its based on academic weeks (15 weeks total, 9th week = 60%).

In short, 

1.  University is charging me an unknown amount (until I officially withdraw) for if I withdraw giving my current account balance is 0. **Why and what am I actually being charged for?**

We paid him 80k down payment, make bi-weekly payments  of $913.58 and have a 3% rate.  He did this with the caveat that we refi in 3 years so he can have his money back.  cool beans.  We will be living in this house until we die, FYI. It is perfect. 

A little more info: combined we make about $165k per year and have no other debt.

So this year, and with election coming up (who knows how it will affect anything (not me)) and Feds potentially raising rates, we are considering refinancing early to get a good rate.

With all of this being said, we are not refi-savvy and could use a little ELI5 on refinancing.  I am not sure we can even refinance as we still owe more that 80% of the value. 

As a bonus question: We do not have to take money out, but may consider it to finance a solar energy system for our home.  How would that play into it??

personalfinance,Currently paying debt and just found out there is even more. What are our options?,"SO was a hard-head in his early 20's and accrued about $7,000 worth of debt. We spoke to a credit counseling agency and they have been helping us come up with a re-payment plan to pay in full what he owes. They have reduced the interest rates to 0 while we pay this off, and we managed to pay off $3,000 in 3 months so far (4,200 left right now). 

However, we just found out that an old University in which he signed up for one class and dropped it has now sent $2,000 that he owes to collections. He never received a letter about this and had no idea this was even due.
What are our options here? Should we add this debt to our current repayment plan or is there something we can do to get this removed from his score? pay for delete or something like that?

We are planning to purchase a house in the next 3 years and his credit score is 500 from this. We have gotten back on track with his student loan payments and are planning to pay off the rest of the debt within a year but we want to make sure we're doing everything possible to bring his score up so we can purchase a home.

investing,"""You shouldn't try to time the market""...What does this mean?","Hi all,

I hear this all the time. ""You shouldn't try to time the market"". But what is this referring to?

Say I want to buy into equities, and I'm sure of it. But I try to ""time the market"" and wait until it hits a certain point in the short-term. That makes sense why I shouldn't try to time the market. The investment might not hit that point, thus making my strategy ineffective and losing out on the opportunity.

But why is this a bad thing in the long run? I think that at some point in the next 5 years that equity prices will correct and then will go up with Fed stimulation. Why is it a bad idea for me to go into the bond market until I see an opportunity that I like? If my strategy is long-term oriented, I don't see why this is wrong to do.

My only request for your replies is not to say ""well if YOU think it's a good idea then YOU do it."" Please let me know on a conceptual level why this is a bad long term strategy so we can learn together.",finance,1476923992

personalfinance,How does student loan capitalization affect credit score/auto loan interest rates?,"Backstory: I graduated pharmacy school earlier this year and needed $160,000 in loans (6-8% interest rates) that gathered $23,000 interest while I was in school that is going to capitalize in three weeks. I have a job as a floater pharmacist (making a close to $100,000/year) that requires me to drive about 20k miles/year in rural Pennsylvania. My credit score is currently 744. I have never carried debt on my only credit card and have been paying $1000 every paycheck on my highest interest rate loan since I got my license two months ago.

I've decided to live with my parents at least for a few more months and they're not charging me for rent/utilities/groceries/health insurance and my mileage is reimbursed from work, so my monthly expenses are pretty small. Between saving and a modest inheritance, I currently have $19,000 in my bank account. 

The car I'm currently driving (2008 Chevy Cobalt with 50,000 miles) is owned by my dad. The car that he is driving probably won't pass state inspection in February and I either have to give him my car or buy it from him. So I NEED to buy a car before February but WANT to buy something with AWD before winter sets in. My parents are willing to co-sign, both have credit scores around 800 with no debt but a lower income than me.

A few weeks ago I applied for a second credit card and was denied because of my debt to income ratio, so now I'm worried about if I can even get an auto loan. And if I do, will I even have a decent interest rate? Do I need to hurry and get an auto loan before capitalization occurs? Or can I afford to wait 2-3 months and use what I have now to pay student loan debt?",finance,1476935923

personalfinance,500k in student loan debt and rising. How do I stop the hemorrhage?,"Already posted in r/studentloans, but posting here too.

I want to first start off that I have no idea what I'm doing. I do not understand banks, loan structures, and interest rates. I understand the general concept of a loan, I just get lost with all the lingo and numbers. I have a huge fear of dealing with my loans because I get ostracized in some way when I try to talk to people about my issue. My anxiety has been keeping me from calling the right people, whoever they may be. Like curled in a ball and crying in the corner anxious. Long story short, asking for help is not easy for me to do with respect to my student loans.

I went to undergrad and professional school and accumulated $350k in debt. Was told to consolidate the loans to make it easier to pay off. So that's what I did.

At the time, I did not have the income to pay the monthly payment of around $3,000 a month. Asked Navient for alternative forms of repayment. Kept on getting on deferments that accrued interest while trying to get on income based repayment. A couple years of this go by and now my debt is around $500k due to interest. Haven't been able to touch my loans at all. Not to mention I had a series unfortunate events for me that left me with some huge personal debts.

I'm now making okay money, but I cannot pay the $5000+ per month they want. This time I try to get over myself and pursue IBR aggressively. After 10 months, I finally get IBR status, but now my monthly payments are $0. I am going to call them tonight, but I want to get some opinions here first.

My questions are:

What can I do to pay off my student loans? Who do I talk to about not only making manageable payments, but preventing interest from making my work harder?

I am married, but my spouse does not have any income or job yet.

EDIT: Some questions that have been already answered.

Q: Are the loans 100% federal?
And what is your income?

A: think they are 100% federal. I don't think any of them are private loans.
My income is around $7,000 a month. but I had two long stretches where I could not land a job, I had something unfortunate happen to me, so I racked up a lot of debt with our credit cards. A lot of our income is going towards paying of these personal debts and we're successfully chipping away at them.

Q:If my monthly payments are $0 per month, does that mean they are not going to tack on interest?

A:Got off the phone. My student loan servicer is Nelnet. Not sure where I got Navient from.
So according to them, in the next 12 months, I have to pay $0 a month. However, the unsubsidized portions of my loans will accrue debt - ~$2226 per month. I really wish I would have done this earlier so I would have accrued less debt. I guess the damage is done. Also, I do have loan forgiveness after 25 years.
So I guess that answers question number 2.
So, that still leaves me with a $500k loan and no realistic way of denting it any time soon.

EDIT 2: Thank you everyone who has replied so far.  I'm going to talk to a couple of colleagues tomorrow who have offered to look into this for me. I think the general consensus is to leave my practice and find work in the public sector.  As much as I would really not like to do this, I don't think I have a choice.",finance,1476939570

I am trying to figure out how I can continue to afford what I have now. My vehicle loan is for a 2016 Polaris rzr 1000. Roughly $400 alone because of the ungodly high interest rate. I'm debating on trying to return it or figure something out so I can get this gone or at least cheaper.

personalfinance,I am starting a new job that pays significantly more than I used to. I'm confused about paying off student loans or saving for retirement,"Hello. When I graduated, I had about 109K in student loans (2010). My income has fluctuated from 50K, 60K, 30K, 40K, to 50K again. I am now about to make 105K.


I have unconsolidated loans in 4 different banks with interest rates that range from 2.4%-6.66% and one federal loan at 6.6%. From the fluctuations you can see I've had my bouts of unemployment and for the most part, I've been paying absolute minimum payments on these loans. Here are my current loan details:

15K - 3.62%
8K - 3.12%
13K - 3%
11K - 4%
2K - 2.4%
2.5K - 2.4%
4K - 6.55%
5K - 6.55%

My question is really the best way to handle paying this off. I'm getting a 10K sign-on bonus and I don't know if I should use that to pay off more of my loans or to put it toward retirement (I have nothing in savings at the moment - the company will start a 401K and match 6%). Does it make more sense to continue to pay off just the minimum and put more toward retirement?

financialindependence,Pursuing FI as an independent contractor?,"Has anyone switched from full time employment to full time contracting, and how did it go for you?  I know that the details of this sort of change will vary pretty dramatically between professions, but I’d love to hear some different perspectives.  I’m a veterinarian who was pursuing advanced training (not for money, it actually would have lowered my income significantly) but recently made the decision to go back to general practice.  I’m planning to try to make my living doing relief work – contracting with different clinics to fill in when they’re short staffed.  I’ve been doing it on a very part-time basis for the last year, and found that I really enjoy it.  The area I’m moving back to has high demand and current relief vets say they’re booking up 6 months in advance and turning away a lot of work.  I also have a good network there.  If I charge an average rate for the area, I would equal my old salary (with cost of benefits and extra FICA withholding) at an average of 3.75 days of work per week, 48 weeks per year.  That doesn’t include the additional tax deductions or options for tax-deferred retirement savings.  I'd have a combination of w-2 and 1099 income depending on the exact circumstances of my work with different clinics.  


Anything else I should consider here?  The appeal for me is the increased autonomy and ability to take additional time off if I want to.   With my old salary, I’d be about 7-8 years away from reaching bare-bones FI.  My old salary was about as high as I can make in this profession without owning a practice or taking on significant management responsibilities.   I may use the flexibility of contracting to take a slightly slower but hopefully more enjoyable route to FI, doing about a month per year of pro-bono wildlife conservation work and taking off a few months every couple of years for long distance hiking or travel.  Post-FI goal is to move to a mountain town and increase the amount of low/non-paying conservation work.  Not looking to RE per say.  The main risk here is further delay of FI if I can’t fill my schedule most of the time, and having a more variable income in general.  I have plenty of savings to survive a few slow months and it won’t take much work to meet my basic living expenses.  My profession is also facing a glut of new graduates which is likely to affect pay in the moderate term.",finance,1476963229

personalfinance,0% Interest Card for 5 Years or Card With Great Rewards?,"Hi all,

I usually give some advice in this sub about credit and credit cards, but a situation has come about that I'm just not too sure which way to go. 

I need a new AC unit and furnace for the house. Ugh. It's not needing to be replaced now, but in the next 6 months it'll bite the dust.

Here's where my question comes in. The unit and install is going to be ~$6,000. We have more than enough in savings to cover this, but it seems that lately we've been shelling out money for the house left an right (new front door, water heater...). I don't like the idea of writing a check for $6k but such is life. I am into churning a bit, not much, but I like to get rewards. I have two options. I can either get the Chase Sapphire Reserve, put it all on that card and essentially get $1,500+ back in travel or I can open up a card with the AC company and get no interest for 5 years.

What would you do? My wife and I's credit scores are 800+ and we're needing to get two car loans next March and will need to have the scores up there to get good interest rates. 

We currently have approximately $86,000 in credit limits with 0 balance on all of them. Would maxing out this new interest free card hurt our scores much because of utilization? I like the idea of getting money for spending money but I don't like the idea of being out all that money at once.

Thanks for reading! 

Edit: I should mention that I do already have the CSR under my wife's name.",finance,1476967529
Banking,[ADVICE] Long: Hometown Bank changed transfer date after it had taken place,"Greeting all! First time posting here, so please be kind, This is a long story, so I apologize and if you don't want to read I will TL:DR at the bottom but I could honestly use your advice because I've never seen or heard of this happening. I wrote it as it happened for me, so it may feel frustrating because it was frustrating to me. I attempted to be verbatim in every moment I could. I believe the only time it isn't burnt into my memory is the first initial contact with the teller.


Anyhow, here we go.

I recently had my first negative encounter with my bank and it has me concerned that I should possibly move to a larger scale bank (Mine is local/state). For context, I have been banking with this particular company for over five years, and I have never written a bad check, went into a negative balance/received an overdraft, or taken any action the bank would find suspicious (to my understanding.) 

A little over a year ago, I was in an accident that left me a paraplegic and now I draw disability which is automatically entered into my account at the beginning of each month. My mother has always had a horrible time with her finances so I told her that if she approved, I would look over her account and find out what was happening each month. I discovered that the way her retirement and other forms of income were depositing were causing her to pay over 300$ or more every two weeks in overdraft fees. Upon seeing this, I thought the logical thing to do would be fix it where she no longer accrued these fee's, and her money would just deposit as usual without the large deduction. This worked fabulously after an initial rough month (I went out of pocket to keep her balance positive, but the end result was that she was no longer paying these fee's she was unaware of.)


For about two months things were going very well. She was constantly in the positive, my account remained the same, and it seemed like a win/win for all. That is, of course, until we had a little bit of trouble. For whatever reason, my mother had an unexpected charge land on her account (I validated it. It was legitimate, just unexpected, which is never a good time. It was to be ""instantly"" refunded. They word it ""So it can clear with your bank,"" but I will go deeper in a the next bit ) I called the bank and spoke with our branch manager to explain how there had been an accurate charge, but it was made erroneously (The easiest way to describe it without personal details is, A form of a subscription that was supposed to be cancelled, but charged as if it were to be continued) and I asked our branch manager what she believed the best course of action would be. I told her I could transfer the funds from my account to my mothers and that would cover the expenses but when the refund comes into her account, I would transfer it out. She agreed that would be best. Then she made a comment that depending on my deposit, if my mother went into the negative again she would accrue a 36$ overdraft, and how the bank always uses the largest amounts when sending or receiving because they operate under the assumption they are the most important. This phrase is key in a moment.


I have access to both our online banking and we are on each others accounts. It showed me a screen (on my phone) that the money was transferred from my account to hers (I added extra for life expenses) and we went on with life.

Two days later, I log into the portfolio of our accounts and see that my mother is in the negative a large amount, and that my account is low for reasons unaware to me. So I instantly call the bank. While on the phone with them, I am going through our online statements, and it seems money and transactions have either disappeared or the dates have been changed. I am calm at the moment, but very concerned, because as I look between each account, it's not making any sense to me. The poor customer service representative is fluster, but begins to take a tone that I did not appreciate. After having as much lip from this lady as i could take, I ask to speak with our branch manager. We will call her Kay. She lets out a loud sigh and says she will try to get her on the phone, but she may be at lunch.

I am left on hold for 20 minutes. During this time, I notice that the deposit I made while speaking to the branch manager did not post that day. It has posted during the time or just before I began speaking the rude lady (It may have posted a short time before, I don't want to sound like it magically happened to throw shade at them.) This still left my mother in the negative, because as you know with overdrafts, it doesn't matter if it is 6 dollars, or 600 dollars, they take the same amount out each time. Well my mother had mad several small purchases, so the majority of the negative balance was nothing more than fees. I go to our transfer history and look under pending, and I see that the transfer I had already received a confirmation number on (I should have kept it) was in a pending status. So what I was witnessing was the attempt at applying a two day old transfer to a balance deep into debt. I instantly cancelled it, and strangely there was another one for a small amount pending that was from weeks before. Still being on hold, I click back to our overall portfolio and see that now my account is back to exactly what it was the day of the charge (on my mothers account)


The lady comes back on the line and the first thing she says to me is, ""What did you just do? You just cancelled the transfer you said you had made to your mothers account."" With her attitude and demeanor, I said ""Please put Kay on the phone."" Again, She huffed and put me on hold. I am now very upset. It's not showing, but anger is building up quite a bit.

Now Kay comes on the line ""My AndialGaming, I don't know what you are trying to do but our bank does not work this way.""

I was confused. ""Excuse me? I don't believe I understand.""

""The teller you were just speaking with told me that while the two of you were talking, You went into your account and deleted a transfer. We can't transfer the money if you delete the transfer.""

This is the moment where I think I may have been a bit harsh, but I feel it was justified, and maybe you will feel the same after our full dialog (Some I am paraphrasing, Some is verbatim as I remember) I said to her, ""Kay, You remember just a few days ago when I called you and told you that there was a mishap on my mothers account but the funds would be coming back in the form of a transfer. You assured me that the bank does not hold those funds, and that it would automatically go back in. Then I told you that I was going to transfer money our of my account and put into my mothers. Which I did while we were on the phone. This is also how I know that when I made that transfer, you took the money out of my account, and made it appear as though it was in my mothers account. For a reason I do not know, You decided to not only keep the money out of my account, but to act as if it never posted to my mothers account. So this 6$ charge at (fast food) ended up being 42$ to us. This 19$ charge for her hair cut ended up being 55$ Why has this happened?""


Her response was ""AndielGaming, We are a bank, but we are not your ledger. What you need to do is get a ledger."" I cut her off.

""Kay, That is not what I asked you, I asked you why this has happened, because when we were on the phone the other day, The transfer you mentioned was made, and it was not a scheduled transfer. You immediately took the money out of my account and placed it in hers. I saw with my very own eyes ""AndielGaming had transfer XXXX$ to AndielGamingsMother."" I saw with my very own eyes the same thing in her account. So why did she accrue these overdraft fees?""

Her tone changed from an insulting type of condescension to very defensive. ""AndielGaming, You deleted the transfer. We are a bank but we are not your accountant, You need to get a ledger."" I cut her off again. I cannot fathom what she is saying and how it is relevant to the current issue.

""Kay. Lets go through this step by step. My mom received that charge, so I called you and told you a refund should be coming so that you would know to clear it. While we were on the phone, I transferred money from my account to my mothers. Your website (and a customer rep later that day) confirmed that the money had switched hands, but today you are telling me that it never did, and that she owes you all of these fees. Why did the money not transfer when it showed leaving my account and going into hers.""


Her response was, ""AndielGaming, You can't go by what would website says it is best if you get a ledger a keep track of how much money you have. There may be a situation where you swipe your card and it tells the store you have 100$. Then you go to another store and swipe your card.  It may tell that store you have 100$ when in reality you don't."" I am curious if you are as frustrated as I was at this point. I am not sure the subreddits rules on language (they vary sub to sub) but all I could bring myself to say was, ""Kay, What the F does that have to do with our situation.""

""Mr AndielGaming if you or your mother kept a ledger...""

""Nope. Not having it. Explain to me why on Tuesday, My account went from 4,923$ to 4,500$. My mothers account went from -219$ to 204$. Then, Over the course of Wednesday, My mother spent around 190$ (I explained to her in detail, each purchase, where it was made, how much. I am enraged at this point.) All of these purchases were made like normal. I remember checking our account before I went to sleep, and she had something like 3 dollars left in her account total, In a positive balance. Now what took place between when I went to sleep Wednesday and today. Because I am not looking at her statement, and according to this statement, Which does not reflect the one I printed off yesterday (I lied.) In fact, It looks nothing like the same account. The one I see right now has each of those purchases made with an additional line underneath that says ""Paid Item Fee 36.00"" and shows her balance plummeting even past what you say is your limit for overdraft coverage/protection/whatevertheycallitnow. Then, Like I have printed out on another sheet of paper, You show my transfer going through this morning, Which even if it were applied would still have her in the negative. So what exactly the F is going on.""


She gets hateful with me and tells me she would prefer I not use that kind of language, which is fair. I shouldn't, but I was mad and seeing red. She then says ""Our website is not your personal accountant. You need to have a ledger so you will know how much money you have in your account. When you deleted the transfer today you stopped the money from entering her account""

I responsed, ""I stopped money from entering an account extremely overdrafted, which would had not be usable to anyone other that your bank. Would a ledger have helped, If I wrote -transferred amount to mother- but it never actually transferred?""

She laughed, to which I sharply said ""I am glad this is amusing to you, because it is definitely not to me.""

She said, ""I am not laughing (Obvious lie) and again stated how it is not her responsibility to keep track of my money and that the website is not an accurate portrayal of your account because things may be coming in or going out that have yet to post.""

This entire time, I cannot get her to say anything about what she herself said while we were on the phone. She slipped a little when she said it again but in a different way. By this point, I don't care anymore. I just want to know if she is going to help me in any way or basically tell me to go kick rocks.

""Kay, Will you tell me this. The amount that was supposed to be transferred on Tuesday, Was that enough that in the event it posted like it should have, would my mother had any overdraft fees?""

""No AndielGaming, It looks like she wouldn't have any over drafts.""

""Kay, Do you see my problem here? Do you understand now. I transferred money from one account to the other, and the money was moved. It showed available not only on your website, but when my mother called to check the balance. Like I said before, I do not know what happened today, But you charged my mother several overdraft fees that she would be paying if you would have transferred the money like you were supposed to. So is there any way that you will correct these overdraft fees, and I can place my money into her account, making it positive, and when the refund comes, I will subtract my money back from the account. I have never had any incident with this bank and I have been here for years. This branch has helped me pay off a car and consolidate debt. There is no time in my history with your bank that my account has been in bad standing. Are you telling me you will do nothing for us?""

The next bit out of her mouth made me want to lose it completely, but i kept a calm composure and just ended it. ""Sir, We are not your financial adviser or accountant. You deleted the transaction today sir, so I don't know what your intentions were. But what I will do is remove three of the over draft charges because that's all I can do as the branch manager, We would have to get the regional manager to do the rest. Andielgaming, You really need to get a ledger that way you can keep track of how much money you have when you are spending money. You can't rely on our banking website to tell you how much you have in your account.""

I gave up. This had been over an hour of banging my head against a rock. And if I am wrong in this please tell me. Is there something I am missing? I would understand if it was a scheduled transfer. I would understand if it were made outside standard business hours. I have read their online rules twice since this, and honestly what it seems like, and maybe I am being paranoid, but a bank saw a chance to capitalize and took it. The refund eventually came, which was less then she expected because she had to account for the negative balance, but it did eventually come. I am completely baffled that this could happen, and wonder if this happens to people every day and we just don't hear about it? I consider myself top notch when it comes to budgeting and taking care of expenses. Accounting 101 taught me that you can't expect to have funds going out if the funds coming in don't cover it. I have been able to live my life well and fine up to this encounter. I mean, Should I seek legal advice about this matter? Because it doesn't seem like a bank should be able to show that you have money, then say you actually never had it. It's not like it was a pay check or advance, it was money from my account to hers. How is that different than me going to the bank, withdrawing cash, and depositing it into her account? Would the teller hold onto it until she decided it was time to deposit it? And one thing brought up often is people are under the belief that had I not deleted the transaction, the Paid Item Fee's would have dropped off, That's not true according to the way they were applying it. The date was completely wrong. The transaction was made and posted on 10/4, but on the day I noticed all of this, it was saying it was made on 10/6.

Is this common? Is this something I should be concerned about? This is the only time it has ever happened. I have my kids college(trust)funds there, I have my personal savings, I manage my mother, aunt and uncle, all banking there. And I have suggested them to several people. The staff (minus the branch manager which seems like a BIG DEAL, she is new taking over for someone who retired) are wonderful people who know my face and know my voice. I don't want to just change banks, but this is scary.

What do you think guys?


TL:DR My mom messed up and was charged a large amount. I covered it for her and gave me spending money until it was refunded, but the bank later said I didn't and charged for overdrafts for everything, even trying to keep my transfer after it had already accrued hundreds in overdrafts.

I am posting through a throw away because I am about to divulge lots of financial information and my main account is closely linked to my name.

My goal of posting is to sort out: Can I (and is it a good idea to) purchase an apartment or townhouse in Philadelphia? Ideally it will be a 2 bedroom minimum in which I can rent out one of the rooms and occasionally stay in the other, splitting my time between my current farmland home and this city residence. My work commute is about 50 minutes currently and a Philly residence will cut that down to about 15 minutes, and reconnect me to city life that I am missing dearly. (More details on the why's and how's below)


My situation is as follows:

Age:28

Annual income = $48,000-$52,000 (pending bonuses)

Savings accounts = ~$7,600

Investment account balance = ~$84,000

Roth = ~$18,000

401k = ~$2,000 (my company just started offering this in June and I am currently contributing the max they will match)

Inherited IRA = ~ $24,000

YNAB says my net worth is about $134,000, and is probably a bit off considering I don't have most tracking accounts linked, I just updated them once in awhile. 

Current Property debt = $50,000 (My sister and I inherited a townhouse in a rural are in NJ, we just refinanced down from a 7% interest rate to a 10 year 4% mortgage. The house was appraised at $115,000. She is currently living in the house with roommates and together they pay 100% of the bills associated with the property. She will be moving in with her boyfriend shortly and we will continue to rent the property to the roommates. Any excess money from the renters will go into a joint account until it reaches 10K. From there my sister and I will split the profits above 10K. We don't expect to see any money from this property for some time but hope to make a profit on it down the line.)

Other than that, I have no debt, I own a 2012 VW TDI (that I am going to keep, if you are familiar with the scandal, and collect about $5,500 once the settlement is finished). I plan on keeping the car as long as it will last me - hopefully forever and ever. 

I currently live with my boyfriend and give him $400/month to help with bills. The mortgage is in his name only. If I were to purchase an apartment/townhome, I would no longer pay him rent. 


Zillow is showing me properties in South Philly for $150K and up. Some are listed for $50K, and require some work. My boyfriend and I together can rehab all cosmetic issues, and some light construction, if needed, in order to find a better deal on a property.  I would be willing to put some extra cash towards renovations. I plan on using some of the money in my investment accounts for a down payment, some more for renovation, and get a mortgage to cover the rest (some pre approval calculators estimate I will be approved for around $220,000). My grandma also has an account with my name on it in the amount of $100K. We have talked about her giving me access to it in order to assist with the purchase/reno, but until it is in my name I am not counting on it. (I am incredibly grateful for her and her willingness to assist me, and I did not grow up with money, she didn't either, and now that she has some she wants to see her family enjoy it.) I would find a roommate to help pay down the mortgage. Philly is growing and developing really quickly and I want to move quickly in order to find something in an up and coming area before it is all unattainable. 

Owning, flipping, and renting real estate is appealing to me. I would love for this to become my main source of income. My question now is, am I being realistic? Would this be a smart in a finically sound direction? I am asking here because my family and friends are not the most financially savvy individuals! Thank you in advance and I will be available this for a few hours to provide any additional information that is requested!",finance,1476974722

financialindependence,"Financial Plan for Kicking the 9-5, Advice Needed","Hello r/financialindependance,

I posted this is r/personalfinance yesterday, and was directed by u/sammobutler to come pay a visit to this sub. I think this was great advice, and would love to have some of your thoughts:

&amp;nbsp;

I just wanted to reach out to everyone here to ask some question about my financial plans. My wife and I (both 22) recently graduated college and started our careers. Below is our budget which will help give context to my questions, and hopefully help you with commenting on some courses of action. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Our loan for the house is $200,000 with an interest rate of 4.25%.  My goal is to be able to be home with my kids (planning on having a child in 8 years) as they grow up, my Dad was able to when I was young and I want to be able to do the same. If I find a job that allows me to work from home by the time kids come around that would be fantastic, but that isn't something I can't guarantee will happen. 

&amp;nbsp;

So my other thought was I could utilize my savings (I already have my emergency fund built luckily) to pay down my current mortgage as soon as possible, and then do the same for another place, with the idea of getting enough rental properties to be able to cover the expenses of my family down the line. Hopefully this would mean I could leave the 9-5 job while our kids are fairly young, and have all the time needed to be a landlord. 

&amp;nbsp;

So my question is if this is even feasible, or whether I should just focus on investing in index funds, and go the old school route instead? I'm also here at this sub specifically because I've also considered going the early retirement route, even if it's only while my kids are young (guess it wouldn't be early retirement if I were to go back to work, but I'd do whatever I had to). Any advice, or general guidance is appreciated.  Thanks in advance for your time and assistance. 

&amp;nbsp;

Note: I left the savings lumped together (not seperated by IRA, stocks, ect.) because I think this is a discussion about what to do with that to accomplish my goals

personalfinance,"Question regarding the refinancing of Student Loans. Details in body. Is refinancing possible, a good idea, or in my best interest.","Hey Guys, first time posted on here, sorry if I made a mistake in posting rules. 

Back in college I took out several Stafford Subsidized Student Loans in the State of Florida. Some are Unsubsidized and some are subsidized. The balance remaining on my overall loans is around $30K (USD) but the unsubsidized Interest Rates are pretty high. 

Financial Instuttion: Great Lakes Loan Servicing

Subsidized Loans interest Rate: 3.4%

Unsubsidized Loans interest Rate: 4.66% and 6.8%

I know the general rule of thumb is that you should pay off the higher interest debt first, however, my servicing company makes this extremely difficult to isolate the payments for individual loans. (The total balance is $28,492 comprised of 15 individual disbursements at varying interest rates) Im pretty sure the majority of my monthly payment is going towards the lower interest rate loans - though I cant prove it. 

Ive been playing with the idea of consolidating all of the loans into a single sum so its a bit more organized and easier, but, I dont know much about standard interest rates on student debt refinancing. 

I would love some advice or discussion on posibilities of handling this from anyone who has been in this situation before or has any insight into this. To anyone who responds, thank you, I really do appreciate it. 

Im pretty active on reddit, but im at work, and I might be a bit delayed in my responses.

Interest rates for these loans vary from 3.5% up to ~7.8% and of course like a lot of folks we'd like to pay these off and become more debt free. Recently we've been tossing around the idea of consolidating all of our student loans with a single loan at a fixed interest rate that is either equivalent to our lowest interest rate or lower than that. There are companies, like SoFi and Earnest that specialize in this and maybe some options through banks.

I'm curious to know what your opinions may be about doing something like this? And if there are better lenders who may specialize in this type of consolidation or better alternatives (as in not taking out one single loan to consolidate).

We do use the snow ball method and take the previous sum we were paying and add it to the next loan's principle.

personalfinance,Advice needed to best debt management after finishing school.,"Hey everyone.  First time posting here.  Looking for advice for the quickest way to pay off debt after finishing a web development program.

Here's the cliffnotes version. After finishing college with a double major in Psychology and Film I moved from a dead end town in upstate NY to Boston.  I owned virtually nothing and getting set up in Mass ended up totaling about $6000 in credit card debt.

The most I've made in my current field is $34,000 and the cost of living in Boston is third in the country, so between the debt and my relatively low wages I've basically been paying interest for years and living paycheck to paycheck.

I held off going back to school for many years because of this but finally accepted this circle would be never ending.

I'm in an accelerated program for web development.  Unaccredited, but highly respected- these sorts of programs are common in this field.

Unfortunately, because it's unaccredited I was not eligible for school loans (Obama changed this a month ago for new students.  Doh!).  I managed to negotiate some incredible deals with both the school and rent, but I have to work less since this is an accelerated program and school itself and some living costs are also on the credit card.  In total, I expect to to have between $12,000 and $14,000 debt after graduation.

I've talked to people in the field, and this is in fact a high paying field and even as a newcomer I can expect to make $65,000 - $80,000 a year.

That's a huge net increase and based on my most conservative estimates I could return to my preschool living style and still pay an additional $900 a month towards my debt, for a total of about $1050 a month.

I figure that would take roughly 18 months to pay everything off.  That's assuming I stay in Boston, too.  I'm looking at a lot of places with a lower cost of living but similar wages.

My hunch is I'd rather pay things off quickly than consolidate but be forced to pay everything off over 4 or 5 years.

I'm wondering if it makes more sense to just pay off the credit cards as quick as possible and eat the interest, or consolidate for a lower interest rate but be saddled with debt a few more years.

One idea I had was my credit score will start to increase once I start making the large payments and after six months I could probably get a better interest rate.

Any advice?",finance,1476987480

personalfinance,Laid off. First time being unemployed since I entered the workforce. Need some advice.,"Hey PF,

As the title says, I was just laid off today. I have been with the company since January, and was told today that my contract was not being renewed. It is a small transportation business, employing about at one point 6 office staff, and a few dozen seasonal fluctuating drivers. Over the last few months, we had 2 employees fired (one for poor work quality, the other for using company assets for personal use). The office is now down to 3 staff after laying me off.

Some history about my time with the company:
I was hired to work sales and help with dispatch. I received my salary, and was content with what I was offered. About a month in, I was told my skillset was valuable and I was offered a ""promotion"" (I'll get back to why this is in quotes later) and was given an increase in responsibility and a new title, but was told we would not be discussing pay at this time because I was brand new to the company. This new role put me in charge of safety and compliance, ensuring our drivers performed their jobs to federal guidelines. Several months later (around May) I once again brought up the salary and promotion and was again told it would be discussed at a later date. My thought was now that I had been doing my new role for a while, they were able to see I was competent enough to do it and the raise would come in time. Wrong. Flash forward to July, and our HR employee was fired. I was given this workload as well, and didn't bring up anything about raises until September, about a month ago. At that point, I had a conversation with the owner of the company, and she told me that she didn't view any of my extra workload as a promotion, and merely considered it ""professional development"" to which I was speechless. I had taken on major responsibility and role increases, but it seemed likely that I would never see a raise for any of it. I decided to counter with a salary increase after yet another task was thrust on me (sales for large wedding clients), which I know upset her, and prompted the next point. She brought up the fact that we could review my contract a month later (today) and I agreed. The salary I had requested was $8,000 higher than my current salary, and would still be lower than the average for both my field and the area.

Fast forward to today, and I have been laid off. The reason cited was the salary request I submitted was higher than they were willing to pay, and after consulting their business analyst, they decided they are spending too much on administrative costs and would not be renewing my contract.

I was thanked for my time, told that I would still be receiving my bonus on the condition I return all company property (I've telecommuted the last 2 months) and would receive both personal and professional references that are positive if I so choose, from both the CEO and the Manager of the company. I asked specifically if I was fired, because I know classifying this is important, and was told I was not. They had decided not to have my contract renewed, and that I was laid off. I am honestly very relieved about this decision, as I knew there was no future at this company and it caused me considerable stress every day. 

I have never had to deal with this before, and wanted to seek advice here to make sure I handle this the best way I can.

I have about 3 weeks of pay in the bank, with another week coming in. I will be calling my student loan provider to defer my loans until I have another steady income, and will be paying the minimum on all accounts/card.

First off, I assume regardless of fired/laid off status, I can qualify for unemployment and this should be the first move I make.

If anyone has any experience with this, I would greatly appreciate it.",finance,1476987875
financialindependence,Boosting your savings rate by living abroad and working remotely,"Something that I haven’t seen much discussion about in the FIRE community is the concept of living abroad in order to increase your savings rate and reach FI sooner.

Most people don’t have the luxury of working from home, but if you can get a job or start a business that allows you to work remotely 100% of the time, the impact on your savings and FI date can be huge.

I’m a solo consultant, and my clients are located all over the USA, so it doesn’t matter where I live as long as I have an internet connection. My wife and I lived abroad for 2 years, and we were able to save a significant portion of our income. I wasn’t totally onboard the FIRE train yet, so we didn’t save as much as we could have, but without even trying we saved a decent bit (around $40k last year).

There are 3 primary ways I’ve found that living abroad can increase your savings rate:

### 1. Reduce your cost of living by living in a low COL country

Many places in Central America, South America, Eastern Europe, and South-East Asia are extremely affordable. My wife and I spent 2 years total between Mexico, Ecuador, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, and my favorite places in terms of low COL while also being nice places to live are Cuenca, Ecuador and Chiang Mai, Thailand.

In both cities, you can rent a decent apartment in a good part of town for anywhere from $200-$400 per month. Everything from restaurants to apartments to public transport is incredibly cheap.

Of course, traveling to and from other countries requires the purchase of a plane ticket, but you can reduce your travel expenses by traveling to countries that will allow you to stay for a long time without leaving.

Usually, you don’t need to apply for a work visa if you are working remotely for a company that’s not in the country where you’re living. Most countries haven’t changed their laws to account for the fact that remote working is now a possibility, so we lived for 2 years on tourist visas while working on our laptops. As far as the government of these countries is concerned, you’re not working for a business inside the country, so you’re off the radar.

The key to this strategy is location arbitrage: you're earning a normal US salary (or a normal salary from whatever country you're from) while living in a place with a much lower cost of living. You can keep the same standard of living while boosting your savings rate significantly.

### 2. Don’t pay federal income tax on your first $100k of income

By taking advantage of the [Foreign Earned Income Exclusion](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/foreign-earned-income-exclusion), you can qualify to not pay federal income tax (up to $100,800 in 2015, adjusted annually for inflation). You still have to pay other taxes like state income tax and FICA, but avoiding federal income tax (legally) will save you thousands or tens of thousands of dollars each year.

How to qualify? By living outside of the USA for 330 days in a 365-day period. To put it simply, just stay outside of the country for roughly 11 months per year, and you'll qualify.

For example, let’s say that you earn $90k in 2016 as a single filer. Before any deductions, you’d owe 25% of that in federal income tax. In this example, we’ll assume that you put $40k into tax-qualified accounts, meaning that your net taxable income is $50k. As a single filer, you’re still in the 25% tax bracket, or if you’re married filing jointly, you’re in the 15% bracket. To keep things simple, we’ll just do the math for a single filer.

At this point, you have $50k of taxable income. At a 25% tax rate, you’d owe the government $12,500. Ouch.

However, simply by living abroad and qualifying for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, you’d owe $0 in federal income tax.

That’s $12,500 that you get to keep and invest.

With a higher income, the numbers are even more impressive. If you have $100k of taxable income, you’d owe $25,000 in federal income tax. If you qualify for the FEIE, you pay $0.

Over the course of 4 years living outside the USA, that’s an extra $100k invested.

### 3. Don’t pay for full health insurance that meets Obamacare requirements

Another handy benefit of living outside the USA is that you don’t have the same legal health insurance requirements. If you qualify for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, then you **also** don’t have to meet the federally-mandated minimum health insurance coverage. If you live in the USA, you incur a big penalty for not having enough coverage, but if in the eyes of the USA you’re residing outside the country, there’s no such requirement.

Last year, while my wife and I were living outside the USA, we paid about $1000 for a 1-year global health insurance plan that had a network with providers all over the world. At $1000 for the entire year, that comes to just $83.33 per month. It was a high-deductible plan that we mainly had just for the catastrophic coverage, so we paid cash for any doctor appointments. In the countries we were living in, a doctor's appointment would cost anywhere from $3-$20 or so.

In contrast, now that we’re living back in the USA, we pay about $450 per month for the minimum required coverage with a high deductible and HSA.

In addition, many countries have high-quality medical care for incredibly cheap prices. I had LASIK eye surgery while we were in Ecuador, and the total cost for both eyes was about $1200 (you’ll pay double or triple that back in the States).

By living outside of the USA, you can pay much less for health insurance, and any medical expenses that you do have will likely cost much less than they would in the States.

### Total savings

For the purposes of this example, I’ll estimate that the cost of living abroad would be about 2/3 of what it would be in the States for the same standard of living. In other words, if your COL in the States is $30k, then you can probably have the same standard of living for $20k in a country in South America or Asia. It’s actually probably more like 1/2, but let’s say 2/3 to be generous and include things like travel expenses.

The exact amount of savings will depend on which country and city you’re living in and how frugal you are, but let’s use $40k as our assumed COL for the States. This means that your COL abroad would be $40k x 2/3, which equals about $27k. The savings on COL alone equals $13k.

Let’s also factor in your tax savings. Using my numbers from above, we’ll say you have $50k of taxable income, which means that be living abroad you’re saving $12,500 in taxes.

Finally, we’ll factor in the savings of cheaper health insurance and medical care. You can get a high-deductible global insurance plan for around $1000 per year, while the premiums you pay in the States could be $300-$500 per month, depending on your income. The cheapest I could find for my wife and I was $450/month, so I’ll use that for this example. The total health insurance premiums per year would then come to $5,400.

By living abroad and paying just $1000 per year, I’ve saved $4,400 on health insurance.

The total savings between the three areas above comes to $13k + $12.5k + $4.4k = $29.9k per year in extra savings.

Living abroad isn’t an option for everyone. However, if you can figure out a way to make it happen, you could potentially be socking away an additional $30k every year, accelerating your path to FI.

**TL;DR**: You can significantly increase your savings rate if you're able to work remotely and live abroad. The main ways to do this are:

1) Live in a low-COL country to pay less for food and housing
2) Take advantage of the tax benefits of earning income outside of the USA (not paying federal income tax on your first $100k) of income
3) Pay less for health insurance premiums and health care because you don't have to have the minimum coverage required by Obamacare.",finance,1476988109

I have a family member that works in mortgage so I asked them for advice, and he suggested that since this is my first house (which normally people stay in for 3-5 years) it's unlikely that I'll pay off enough of the mortgage to even get rid of the loan insurance so I'd be better off just going for a FHA instead of a conventional loan, would you agree with this or is he over simplifying things?
3. He also mentioned that it'd be better for me to start applying when I have about 8 payments left on my car, rather than waiting until it was paid off because they can't see as much information when pulling my credit score if it's paid off?
4. Finally someone at work (who owns a couple of properties) suggested that I should look into withdrawing from my 401k to help with making a larger down payment as there is some sort of condition that if you're taking money out to pay your down payment on your FIRST house there aren't any fee's/extra interest. Is this something I should consider or is it in my best interest to leave the money there to help build towards my retirement?


Anything else that you guys feel is good information for someone looking for a first home would be much appreciated and if you have any questions to help you better offer advice feel free to ask!

Our incomes are more than sufficient, however we have run into a roadblock. My husband has a thin credit history, although he does have a good score. He only has one joint credit card that I am primary on. This according to the lenders means he has 0 lines of credit in his name.

We have a few options that we could go with, I mainly am looking for reddits advice. Also, if anyone knows of a way to get a jumbo loan even with one person having a thin credit history.

1) Some lenders have offered us the possibility of doing a double loan. One non-jumbo and then the rest as a line of credit. Although the interest rate would be higher, we could still afford this. My concern is would we even be able to be approved for this?

2) Have him get a credit card and possibly a personal loan in his name and try to get a loan again in 6 months. My question is would these new lines of credit show up as red flags and if so how long would we need to wait to get a loan? Would 6 months be long enough for it to no longer count as thin?

personalfinance,"Just found out my fiance has almost $300,000 in student loans + other issues. Please help me figure this out.","I am going to start with my side since it is a little less overwhelming. We are Americans living in Japan. We are teachers and, although we have the highest paid positions for what we do in the area we live in, we barely scape by financially every month. When I first got here 5 years ago, the yen to dollar exchange rate was amazing and I was planning on being able to pay off my student loans easily within a couple of years. I also stupidly allowed my (now ex)boyfriend to make some expensive charges on my American credit card because the exchange rate was so good, it was cheaper to send home yen to make the payments. He later told me he had no intention of ever paying it back and I was left with the payments. 

About a year after I got here, the exchange rate went to hell and I was then losing money every time I sent yen to america to pay bills. Before that I was living comfortably and just expected the rate to stay stable so I didn't send as much money as I should back to pay my American bills. My student loan payment became too high to pay with the exchange rate the way it was, so I got on an income based repayment plan based on my adjusted gross income. Because I am abroad, my adjusted gross income is $0 so my monthly payments are $0. 

I really wanted to get on top of my American debt because I didn't think I would be here forever so I used not having a student loan payment to make larger payments on my credit cards but I would like advice on things I can do better to prepare to eventually go back to America. 

**Currently my American debt is:** 

Credit card: $1,396.01 (Plane tickets for an upcoming trip that will be paid off by December)

Bank of America credit card: $5,031.83 (interest rate is 9.49%)

Student Loans: $30,226.33 ($0 monthly payment at the moment)

Total:$ 36654.17

My current plan is to take care of some expensive things coming up in Japan over the next few months, then transfer my BOA credit card balance to a new card with a 0% interest for balance transfers card (I think you guys have said Chase is the best, right?) and throw all my money at it to get that out of the way. I'll charge a small thing on each of my cards and pay it off every month to keep my American credit score up. Currently Credit Karma says my TransUnion score is 743 and my Equifax is 744. Am I doing ok for keeping my score up for when I eventually go back to America?

~~~~

Ok, now on to my fiance. Because I have been trying to fix my financial situation, I have been asking him for more info on his stuff. He went through a divorce last year and hadn't checked his credit score since before then, so yesterday I asked him to check it and was a little shocked. He was only able to get his TransUnion report from annualcreditreport.com and it didn't have a score on it. He tried to set up a credit karma account but they block registration from IPs in Japan so we will have to wait until we get a VPN to set that up. He sent the TU report to me and there is a joint credit card his ex wife made a lot of charges on then abandoned he is trying to fix right now that I knew about, but the real trouble is when I added up all his student loan accounts it was almost $300,000. He has been doing the same as me and has a $0 monthly payment on his federal student loans, but there is a $10,952 private student loan he wasn't able to make a deal with and hasn't been making payments on that I didn't know about. It is marked as In Collection and way past due. It says it will drop off his report in 07/2020. I don't think he knows who is servicing that loan now because not all his mail was forwarded here. 

Is there anything we can do to fix his student loan situation? My thoughts were he needs to try to work something out with the private student loan and we will just have to do whatever we can to make the payments to at least get that cleared up. Is there anything else we should do? 

I am afraid that we will have to stay here forever to avoid his student loan payments. He said that before he put the payments on hold they wanted over $2000 a month and I don't know how we would be able to make those payments if we go back.

Bitcoin,Using my bitcoin wallet for savings,"I was having a conversation with my fiancee about money, as we are starting to talk about merging our finances, and I realized something.

About half of my cash savings- that is not my 401k or IRA, or other investments- I have put into Bitcoin, where its increase in price and its stabilization over the last year has been a rather nice interest bearing account for me.

While I think it is a LONG way off from replacing my checking account, I see it as a superior way to replace my (or at least supplement) my savings account.  

It sounds silly, but I feel like THIS is what you guys mean by ""being your own bank"" lol.  I don't really care that much about the politics of the fed, but shit, my money is doing a hell of a lot more good for me sitting in my bitcoin wallet than it would be sitting in some crappy corporate bank's vault.

Sorry for this seemingly obvious post- but after owning BTC for a couple years now, I FINALLY had that ""I GET IT NOW!"" moment, and thought I would share it with you all, heh.

Think about this- with such low interest rates on savings accounts and CDs, people have shifted away from traditional savings accounts into less liquid investments....with bitcoin stabilizing, you now have an option to get a good interest rate AND have liquidity.

I feel like this is an important selling point and unique aspect of BTC.

Anyways, I know I'm preaching to the choir, but I just wanted to share my ""A HA"" moment, heh.

EDIT:

Allow me to clarify...I do not have half of ALL my wealth in BTC, but half of my - what I call ""cash savings"".  For those interested, my investment portfolio looks something like this:

home equity- 39%

investments- 401K: 40% ; IRA: 4% ; stocks: 4%

cash savings- savings account: 6% ; btc: 5%

checking: 2%

What is interesting about BTC, and what makes it a good ""beta"" in an investment portfolio.  The while a market correction may not necessary impact housing prices, if the housing market crashes, it DOES impact the stock market.  BTC's value is completely independent of what the stock market does, which makes it very valuable in that respect, and should be a part of people's portfolio.  Yeah, it could crash, and if it does, I'll live.  But I like that I have an investment that is independent of the market, that I can keep for the long haul, that can withstand stock market crashes, but can very easily liquidate if I need to.",cryptocurrency,1477026332

Why are *they* in a rush?","I had a significant amount of money come my way recently, and I thought the best use I could put it towards was paying off the rest of my student loan balance.

I contacted my student loan holder, Navient (who acquired it from Sallie Mae), asking them:

* Is this an option available to me?
* How do I actually do it on their site?
* What fees or penalties would I pay?
* Would this affect my credit rating?

Several days later, I received this message:

&gt; Your account can be paid in full if we receive $XXXX.XX within 10 days from the date of this message. There is no fee for paying off your account early. Paying your account in full may have a positive effect on your credit rating.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that if you have any loans with a variable interest rate, and that rate is scheduled to change within the next 10 days, the payoff amount may be slightly different. The payoff amount may also change if any other adjustments are made to your account.

My hackles rose a bit at their insistence that I send the money so quickly, but I'm not sure if that's fair. Are they saying I need to send them the money within ten days just to make sure the balance is paid off correctly? (That there isn't over payment or a tiny outstanding balance.) I didn't expect them to push me to do it quickly. After all, it's in their best interest that I don't pay this off immediately, and let them continue collecting interest.

Am I being too paranoid? It's just that this is a lot of money, and I want to make sure I'm going about this correctly.

**TL;DR:** Payment in full of remaining student loan balance needs to be paid in a rush, but I'm paranoid about why *they're* in a rush to do it.

For extra info, I will have about half of this money left over after I pay off the balance. I had planned to put nearly all of it into the start of a retirement account (once I've figured out the best way to go about it). Until then, it's sitting in my savings account. I thought I'd save at least some of it to pay off the taxes I'll no doubt be dinged with.

EDIT: Thank you for the replies. So I was wrong to be paranoid, the consensus is that this is the most accurate amount they can provide, and in ten days interest will be calculated/compounded again, so that's why the time limit. I feel much more secure now. Thank you again!",finance,1477030671

I recently was able to open a chase card and transfer $1000 onto it, which was the amount I budgeted that I could pay off in the term before the 0% went away. The rest of my debt though is very hard to get rid of. I've been looking at consolidation options and have gotten an offer from upstart. I'm going to compare my rates across some other peer to peer options as well but there was a line in the promissory note that I didn't really understand and I was hoping someone could explain to me.

The APR is 11.24% and they give me a table of the principal amount, the APR, the finance charge and my 35 monthly payments. These all add up so I'm assuming the ""finance charge"" is just the amount of interest I'm going to pay on the principal amount once it's all re-paid correct? They do this I assume because they state that while there is no penalty for paying off the loan early, I won't save any money. The finance charge is built in and non-refundable. But then in the note they say, 

""I promise to pay the principal sum of $6,400 together with interest thereon commencing on the origination date at the rate of 7.3% per annum simple interest....the final payment will consist of the then remaining principal, unpaid accrued interest and other charges due under this note....this note is payable in 36 monthly installments of $198.49 each, consisting of principal and interest...periodic interest will be charged on unpaid principal until the full amount of principal has been paid. Interest under this Note will acrue on a daily basis on the unpaid principal balance...if payments are made on time and no fees are incurred, my final payment will be in the amount of a regulay monthly payment...""

So I'm just confused I guess. I understand the difference between interest rate and APR, I just want to make sure that there's not something tricky about this offer that I'm missing? It sounds like if I make 36 monthly payments of ~$200 then that's it right? Am I missing something? Has anyone else used Upstart or a different company they can recommend?

Last year we filed jointly but i'm considering filing separately next year for financial purposes.
  
Here are a couple my questions:

Does co signing my repayment plan make the loan in its entirety show up on his credit?

Do the loan servicers, this in this case is Nelnet, have anything to do with FAFSA repayment plans?

Is there any kind of insight on this matter anyone can provide me?

economy,The fallacy that bringing jobs back to America will be good for our economy.,"I want to start off by saying that I searched a good amount of posts in hopes to find my question before positing this. I have spent many hours reading articles from Harvard Business Review, The Federalist, etc. At first i understand what they are saying, then it goes downhill from there. 

I am looking for someone to explain in simpler terms what economist are trying to say about the misconception of free trade, lack of free trade, and how that affects jobs, job quality, and the price of goods.

From what I gathered, most Americans (especially people that I talk to) think that if we start manufacturing more goods in America it will create more jobs and the US economy will be more efficient when exporting more than importing. From what I've read this is false. Am interpreting info correctly? Does America have free-trade if we have tariffs? I also read an argument that prices of goods would go up for a while but would eventually stabilize and the economy would be better off after that period of adjusting. Could this be true?

I wan't to re-assure the fellow reddit community that I am not too lazy to do my own research and looking for a quick easy answer, I simply do not fully understand what I'm reading. I should probably work on that, but for now I would like some help.

personalfinance,Doctor sent labs I did not request to an out-of-network lab leaving me with a $1680 bill.,"So today I was looking over my health insurance claims, and realized I have a $1680 bill that is not covered at all by my insurance. I had no clue what it was for but after a little investigating, this is what I figured out. 

I have ADHD and am prescribed Adderall. My PCP has me do a urine sample when getting the prescription refilled. I always figured this was a little odd, but whatever. Going through this bill today, I realized my urine sample is being sent to a lab OUT OF NETWORK where they screen for around 10 different drugs and each one costs anywhere from $84 to $104. I had NO IDEA they were actually sending the urine sample into a lab, I assumed they just read the cup. 

So, I racked up a $1680 bill because my doctor screens my urine before refilling my prescription. What do I do?

UPDATE: Thanks for the advice everyone! I called my insurance and they had me send in a formal appeal. This may have been an asshole thing to do to the PCP, but I am pretty fed up with them for other reasons 1) I was 15 min late to an appointment during rush hour once because there was an accident and I was forced to reschedule. Then I had to wait over an hour at my next appointment to see the doctor. 2) The doctor marked ""dispense only as written"" on my prescription once, aka I could not get a generic version filled and no Walgreens in my entire state had anything other than generic. It took me 10 calls and multiple trips to the office to get it sorted out. (Sorry this is irrelevant to personal finance and just a rant)",finance,1477072484

We have a child to provide for, and it seems like considering having another will be off the table for the time being.  We make enough money, and we have an inheritance, so there is NO reason things should be looking as dire as they are right now.

Here is our budget as it stands right now.  It's leaky, clearly, and I need to figure out how to stop the leaks while not making my husband feel strangled, because he has complained of that in the past.

Husband	2154.62
Bonus	2000  (last day of month)

Balance: 1981
Payment: 58/month minimum

Wells Fargo
Balance: 8,000
Payment: 193/month minimum
	
TOTAL	3566
Difference	1304.62

Now granted this month was a bit more expensive with 2 emergencies that drained us, but here we are, 10 days till payday, with 350 in our checking and 375 in a backup account.  We also have 3,005 in medical bills, thanks to a high deductible health plan.  We're set up for 100/month, but we pay more if we can.

The credit card debt payoff plan is this, so far:

Pay 275/month for 3 months on the best buy card until it's paid off to avoid paying deferred interest.  Pay 250/month on the Quicksilver card for 3 months, until we can roll the best buy payment into it, then pay 525/month for 3 months until it's paid off.  Pay minimum on both Kohls and Wells Fargo until Best buy and quicksilver are paid off, then roll those payments into the Kohls card until that's paid off, and then onto the Wells Fargo card until that's paid off.  If we do this plan, everything should be paid off by April of 2018.  

I guess I just feel like we are treading water, nothing is getting better, and we are STUCK.  I know debt payoff is slow, and I just wish we had never gotten into this mess.  We went through a tough time last year where my husband changed jobs, we had to hire an attorney for a personal matter, and we were just bleeding money so we relied on credit cards to make it through, and made payments on our medical bills to keep them out of collections.

personalfinance,Collections Question...,"So my wife hurt her back in 2012. Had a MRI that insurance took forever to pay (nearly 9 months). Eventually they paid their part and then my wife was supposed to pay her share. But, during that time she lost her job because she could not work  and had moved onto a friends couch for a while (no change in address), and then when she got better over time got another job and then moved out with friends, then moved AGAIN to her own place.  This moving in and out happened during the time insurance was figuring out what they would pay.  When the bill came, it never got to her, it went to her first address.  The doctors office never tried to contact her in any other way and my wife just went on living life with this bill unknown or unremembered.. she was young.

So in 2013 she got sent to collections. Had no idea until 3 days ago when she pulled her very first credit report! We called the agency because she didn't recognize this at first and it puzzled her.  Here is what has happened so far.  Agency says they did their job, which meant sending three noticed of overdue payment (last one being in 2013 and sent to the second address she had during those 9 months).  Then they stopped looking for her.  And allowed the debt to accumulate interest. Colorado law allows 8% interest rate, but then with the ""contract fees,"" it ended up being closer to 18% per year accrued. Meanwhile, she moved in with me, got a new license and updated all her addresses a few months after that final notice was sent and never received.  So they literally could have googled her name and found her (and we got married much later so this wasn't an issue with name change).  

So this collections agency is on her credit report for $230 over what the original bill was.  It's not overwhelming ($350 original and $580 now).  They said she could pay half the interest and fees but that the account will remain on her credit report.  Otherwise, if paid in full it would be removed from her credit report.  

The debt was not sold to the agency, so we called the original billing department but they were unwilling to negotiate even a full payment of the original bill.  

This issue has really bothered me but I don't have much experience with collections agencies.  It just seems really shady that this company whose has the job of seeking out people to pay their debt would sit for over 3 years without lifting a finger to even make a phone call (which I'm sure the doctors office had as well).

My questions are... Is this legal? That they wouldn't try to find her for 3 years then expect their interest and contract fee?  And what are they telling me that is not true?  We spoke with the supervisor and eventually ended the conversation with them validating the debt and sending us a statement to our current address.  I was pretty snarky when giving the address... I told her to google my wife's name and the word Denver and she would find it...

About 7 years ago I committed a number of crimes that I regret for several reasons. I lied, stole, and financially hurt several individuals. My particular crimes pertain to me stealing from my work over the course of a few years. I happened to eventually be caught. My motives were drug related, but that does not excuse my actions. It took me 2-3 years after my conviction to recover through drug treatment programs. I went back to school and finished my degree. I started making substantial restitution payments as soon as I started going to school working at the same time. I've continued to make payments since then, and still do. I make $400 payments to make up for the 2-3 years I didn't pay the minimum amount on my monthly payments. 

**TL; DR;**
My restitution started off ~$105,000. Because the restitution has a 10% interest rate, it's now at $111,000. The judgement was determined early in my recovery process. Additionally, I've written a letter to the organization that formerly employed me. They wrote me back telling me my restitution is too high to waive or reduce.

All items that were stolen were charged at MSRP at the time of the judgement. Therefore, some items were valued at $100, but their original MSRP from 10-20 years before were at $2,000. 

Additionally, the former employer has the potential to claim the stolen products as an insurance claim. I haven't verified that though.

**Or, is there a way to stop the interest from outgrowing the principle?**

investing,How Investors Should Deal With The Overwhelming Problem Of Understanding The World Economy,"By Vitaliy Katsenelson, CFA 

http://contrarianedge.com


“What the —- do I do now?” This was the actual subject line of an e-mail I received that really summed up most of the correspondence I got in response to an article I published last summer.

To be fair, I painted a fairly negative macro picture of the world, throwing around a lot of fancy words, like “fragile” and “constrained system.” I guess I finally figured out the three keys to successful storytelling: One, never say more than is necessary; two, leave the audience wanting more; and three …

Well, never mind No. 3, but here is more. Before I go further, if you believe the global economy is doing great and stocks are cheap, stop reading now; this column is not for you. I promise to write one for you at some point when stocks are cheap and the global economy is breathing well on its own — I just don’t know when that will be. But if you believe that stocks are expensive — even after the recent sell-off — and that a global economic time bomb is ticking because of unprecedented intervention by governments and central banks, then keep reading.

Today, after the stock market has gone straight up for five years, investors are faced with two extremes: Go into cash and wait for the market crash or a correction and then go all in at the bottom, or else ride this bull with both feet in the stirrups, but try to jump off before it rolls over on you, no matter how quickly that happens.

Of course, both options are really nonoptions. Tops and bottoms are only obvious in the rearview mirror. You may feel you can time the market, but I honestly don’t know anyone who has done it more than once and turned it into a process. Psychology — those little gears spinning but not quite meshing in your so-called mind — will drive you insane.

It is incredibly difficult to sit on cash while everyone around you is making money. After all, no one knows how much energy this steroid-maddened bull has left in him. This is not a naturally raised farm animal but a by-product of a Frankenstein-like experiment by the Fed. This cyclical market (note: not secular; short-term, not long-term) may end tomorrow or in five years.

Riding this bull is difficult because if you believe the market is overvalued and if you own a lot of overpriced stocks, then you are just hoping that greater fools will keep hopping on the bull, driving stock prices higher. More important, you have to believe that you are smarter than the other fools and will be able to hop off before them (very few manage this). Good luck with that — after all, the one looking for a greater fool will eventually find that fool by looking in the mirror.

As I wrote in an article last spring, “As an investor you want to pay serious attention to ‘climate change’ — significant shifts in the global economy that can impact your portfolio.”

There are plenty of climate-changing risks around us — starting with the prospect of higher, maybe even much higher, interest rates — which might be triggered in any number of ways: the Fed withdrawing quantitative easing, the Fed losing control of interest rates and seeing them rise without its permission, Japanese debt blowing up.

Then we have the mother of all bubbles: the Chinese overconsumption of natural and financial resources bubble. Of course, Europe is relatively calm right now, but its structural problems are far from fixed. One way or another, the confluence of these factors will likely lead to slower economic growth and lower stock prices.

So “what the —-” is our strategy? Read on to find out.

I’ll explain what we’re doing with our portfolio, but first let me tell you a story. When I was a sophomore in college, I was taking five or six classes and had a full-time job and a full-time (more like overtime) girlfriend. I was approaching finals, I had to study for lots of tests and turn in assignments, and to make matters worse, I had procrastinated until the last minute.

I felt overwhelmed and paralyzed. I whined to my father about my predicament. His answer was simple: Break up my big problems into smaller ones and then figure out how to tackle each of those separately. It worked. I listed every assignment and exam, prioritizing them by due date and importance. Suddenly, my problems, which together looked insurmountable, one by one started to look conquerable. I endured a few sleepless nights, but I turned in every assignment, studied for every test and got decent grades.

Investors need to break up the seemingly overwhelming problem of understanding the global economy and markets into a series of small ones, and that is exactly what we do with our research. The appreciation or depreciation of any stock (or stock market) can be explained mathematically by two variables: earnings and price-earnings ratio.

We take all the financial-climate-changing risks — rising interest rates, Japanese debt, the Chinese bubble, European structural problems — and analyze the impact they have on the Es and P/Es of every stock in our portfolio and any candidate we are considering.

Let me walk you through some practical applications of how we tackle climate-changing risks at my firm.

When China eventually blows up, companies that have exposure to hard commodities, directly or indirectly (think Caterpillar), will see their sales, margins and earnings severely impaired. Their P/Es will deflate as well, as the commodity supercycle that started in the early 2000s comes to an end.

Countries that export a lot of hard commodities to China will feel the aftershock of the Chinese bubble bursting. The obvious ones are the ABCs: Australia, Brazil and Canada. However, if China takes oil prices down with it, then Russia and the Middle East petroleum-exporting mono-economies that have little to offer but oil will suffer. Local and foreign banks that have exposure to those countries and companies that derive significant profits from those markets will likely see their earnings pressured. (German automakers that sell lots of cars to China are a good example.)

Japan is the most indebted first-world nation, but it borrows at rates that would make you think it was the least indebted country. As this party ends, we’ll probably see skyrocketing interest rates in Japan, a depreciating yen, significant Japanese inflation and, most likely, higher interest rates globally. Japan may end up being a wake-up call for debt investors.

The depreciating yen will further stress the Japan-China relationship as it undermines the Chinese low-cost advantage. So paradoxically, on top of inflation, Japan brings a risk of deflation as well. If you own companies that make trinkets, their earnings will be under assault.

Fixed-income investors running from Japanese bonds may find a temporary refuge in U.S. paper (driving our yields lower, at least at first) and in U.S. stocks. But it is hard to look at the future and not bet on significantly higher inflation and rising interest rates down the road.

A side note: Economic instability will likely lead to political instability. We are already seeing some manifestations of this in Russia. Waltzing into Ukraine is Vladimir Putin’s way of redirecting attention from the gradually faltering Russian economy to another shiny object — Ukraine. Just imagine how stable Russia and the Middle East will be if the recent decline in oil prices continues much further. Defense industry stocks may prove to be a good hedge against future global economic weakness.

Inflation and higher interest rates are two different risks, but both cause eventual deflation of P/Es. The impact on high-P/E stocks will be the most pronounced. I am generalizing, but high-P/E growth stocks are trading on expectations of future earnings that are years and years away. Those future earnings brought to the present (discounted) are a lot more valuable in a near-zero interest rate environment than when interest rates are high.

Think of high-P/E stocks as long-duration bonds: They get slaughtered when interest rates rise (yes, long-term bonds are not a place to be either). If you are paying for growth, you want to be really sure it comes, because that earnings growth will have to overcome eventual P/E compression.

Higher interest rates will have a significant linear impact on stocks that became bond substitutes. High-quality stocks that were bought indiscriminately for their dividend yield will go through substantial P/E compression. These stocks are purchased today out of desperation. Desperate people are not rational, and the herd mentality runs away with itself. When the herd heads for the exits, you don’t want to be standing in the doorway.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) have a double-linear relationship with interest rates: Their P/Es were inflated because of an insatiable thirst for yield, and their earnings were inflated by low borrowing costs. These companies’ balance sheets consume a lot of debt, and though many of them were able to lock in low borrowing costs for a while, they can’t do so forever. Their earnings will be at risk.

As I write this, I keep thinking about Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger’s remark at the company’s annual meeting in 2013, commenting on the then-current state of the global economy: “If you’re not confused, you don’t understand things very well.” A year later the state of the world is no clearer. This confusion Munger talked about means that we have very little clarity about the future and that as an investor you should position your portfolio for very different future economies. Inflation? Deflation? Maybe both? Or maybe deflation first and inflation second?

I keep coming back to Japan because it is further along in this experiment than the rest of the world. The Japanese real estate bubble burst, the government leveraged up as the corporate sector deleveraged, interest rates fell to near zero, and the economy stagnated for two decades. Now debt servicing requires a quarter of Japan’s tax receipts, while its interest rates are likely a small fraction of what they are going to be in the future; thus Japan is on the brink of massive inflation.

The U.S. could be on a similar trajectory. Let me explain why.

Government deleveraging follows one of three paths. The most blatant option is outright default, but because the U.S. borrows in its own currency, that will never happen here. (However, in Europe, where individual countries gave the keys to the printing press to the collective, the answer is less clear.) The second choice, austerity, is destimulating and deflationary to the economy in the short run and is unlikely to happen to any significant degree because cost-cutting will cost politicians their jobs. Last, we have the only true weapon government can and will use to deleverage: printing money. Money printing cheapens a currency — in other words, it brings on inflation.

In case of either inflation or deflation, you want to own companies that have pricing power — it will protect their earnings. Those companies will be able to pass higher costs to their customers during a time of inflation and maintain their prices during deflation.

On the one hand, inflation benefits companies with leveraged balance sheets because they’ll be paying off debt with inflated (cheaper) dollars. However, that benefit is offset by the likely higher interest rates these companies will have to pay on newly issued debt. Leverage is extremely dangerous during deflation because debt creates another fixed cost. Costs don’t shrink as fast as nominal revenues, so earnings decline. Therefore, unless your crystal ball is very clear and you have 100 percent certainty that inflation lies ahead, I’d err on the side of owning underleveraged companies rather than ones with significant debt.

A lot of growth that happened since 2000 has taken place at the expense of government balance sheets. It is borrowed, unsustainable growth that will have to be repaid through higher interest rates and rising tax rates, which in turn will work as growth decelerators.

This will have several consequences: First, it’s another reason for P/Es to shrink. Second, a lot of companies that are making their forecasts with normal GDP growth as the base for their revenue and earnings projections will likely be disappointed. And last, investors will need to look for companies whose revenues march to their own drummers and are not significantly linked to the health of the global or local economy.

The definition of “dogma” by irrefutable Wikipedia is “a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true.” On the surface this is the most dogmatic columns I have ever written, but that was not my intention. I just laid out an analytical framework, a checklist against which we stress test stocks in our portfolio.

Despite my speaking ill of MLPs, we own an MLP. But unlike its comrades, it has a sustainable yield north of 10 percent and, more important, very little debt. Even if economic growth slows down or interest rates go up, the stock will still be undervalued — in other words, it has a significant margin of safety even if the future is less pleasant than the present.

There are five final bits of advice with which I want to leave you: First, step out of your comfort zone and expand your fishing pool to include companies outside the U.S. That will allow you to increase the quality of your portfolio without sacrificing growth characteristics or valuation. It will also provide currency diversification as an added bonus.

Second, disintermediate your buy and sell decisions. The difficulty of investing in an expensive market that is making new highs is that you’ll be selling stocks that hit your price targets. (If you don’t, you should.) Of course, selling stocks comes with a gift — cash. As this gift keeps on giving, your cash balance starts building up and creates pressure to buy. As parents tell their teenage kids, you don’t want to be pressured into decisions. In an overvalued market you don’t want to be pressured to buy; if you do, you’ll be making compromises and end up owning stocks that you’ll eventually regret.

Margin of safety, margin of safety, margin of safety — those are my last three bits of advice. In an environment in which the future of Es and P/Es is uncertain, you want to cure some of that uncertainty by demanding an extra margin of safety from stocks in your portfolio.

personalfinance,Is it ever a good idea to pay off a percentage of a low interest rate with a high balance?,"This may be more of a math question than anything - like the two trains leave the station at different times and different speeds. 

My question is, is it ever feasible to pay off a low interest rate loan with a high balance as opposed to a high interest rate with a low balance - or pay off a high percentage of the low interest balance? 

I figured if you have enough to pay off a chunk of the low interest loan then you obviously can just pay off the high interest loan too, but is there a break point where it might be beneficial to pay a percentage of the lower interest rate to lower its balance? 

I'm leaning on the side of no, never, at least for financial reasons... mathematically speaking though, is there a break even point? 

I'm about to pay a large bulk sum on my loans right now and I noticed my lowest interest which also happens to be my largest balance has accrued the second highest amount of interest which lead me to thinking is it possible to pay a large sum on that low interest to lower the balance which would in turn lower the accrued interest. It sounds dumb, but I feel like I could pay more towards the lower interest rate to a certain point, the break even point, to where it would be more beneficial to then pay towards the higher interest rate plan. I'm currently accruing 3x as much interest on my lowest rate compared to my second highest. Paying off a chunk of the lower interest rate to lower its accrued interest to 1x or 2x my second highest interest rate seems like it could work - but what is the general opinion on this?",finance,1477104747

*****

&gt; ###A flood of earnings, U.S. economic growth and some Fed speakers are set to hit markets in the coming week, and could help add confidence to a picture of moderate growth and an end to the earnings recession.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###About a third of S&amp;P 500 companies are scheduled to report next week, including Apple on Tuesday. Amazon.com and Google's parentAlphabet are set to post quarterly results on Thursday, the busiest day of the earnings season.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""If nothing changes … we would say we came out of the earnings recession this quarter and that the second quarter was the final quarter of this earnings recession,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Financials, materials and technology are expected to show the most earnings per share growth this quarter, Stovall said, while energy industrials and telecom are forecast to be the laggards.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###In the past week, financials were among the top performers after the major bank earnings topped expectations. The S&amp;P 500 gained about 8 points for the week to end at 2,141 Friday.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Next week, ""I think really the big focus is going to be on earnings,"" said Casey Clark, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede. ""I think we're in a situation where investors are focusing on earnings and traditional drivers of equity markets. Part of that is there's more comfort on global central bank policy.""
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###A UBS study in October showed that over the last five years, the S&amp;P 500 moves more in sync with earnings per share than the level of interest rates. The correlation between stocks and earnings was very high, almost 90 percent, vs. less than 40 percent correlation between stocks and interest rates.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###The average year-end S&amp;P 500 target is 2,198, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey conducted in October. But strategists are watching whether earnings growth will sustain further gains in the market.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: S&amp;P 500 on track to complete 3-month losing streak**
&gt; Looking back to 1950, S&amp;P 500 has completed 33 consecutive monthly losing streaks of three or more months. With six trading days left in October, S&amp;P 500 needs to climb back above 2168.27 to avoid a third month. Should S&amp;P 500 fail to reach this bar, it would actually be a positive for November as 20 of those past 33 streaks ended at three months and within one month of the end of all streaks, three months or longer, S&amp;P 500 was higher 100% of the time with an average 4.72% gain. S&amp;P 500 worst monthly losing streak since 1950 was nine straight in 1974. When this streak ended, S&amp;P 500 also had the largest one-month gain, 16.3%.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Week before Election more bullish than week of or week after**
&gt; Election Day is (finally) just around the corner. Next week will be two weeks before and it is also the week after October options expiration. Over the past 22 years the week leans bullish with gains exceeding losses by a margin of nearly 2 to 1 and respectable across the board gains. However, this same week (not always the week after options expiration) has nearly the exact opposite track record in election years. Since 1952, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have advanced during the week only 37.5% and 31.3% of the time respectively. The week before election week has a bullish bias that exceeds election week and the week after.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: 8th Year pattern back in play in an undecided election**
&gt; Whether looking at “All Presidential Election Years” or just “Eighth Years” in the charts below, the market is usually in rally mode near the end of October. Should the election go as polls suggest then the market will most likely track the “All Presidential Election Years” pattern to finish the balance of 2016. Should the election results be too close to call and trigger a recount in a state or possibly more, then the “Eighth Years” pattern would be back in play. An undecided outcome similar to November 2000 (an Eighth Year) would produce great uncertainty and could lead to declines similar to those that occurred then. DJIA dropped 5.1%, S&amp;P 500 plunged 8.0% while NASDAQ imploded 22.9% (tech bubble burst, not likely to occur again as valuations are not as extreme now) in November 2000. In the undecided scenario, it would not be surprising to see the Fed skip a rate hike in December in order to provide some relief to the market.

personalfinance,Which job should I take? I have 48hrs to decide,"I received a job offer yesterday and I'm having a very difficult time making the ""right"" decision. To give you an idea of where I'm coming from. I'm in my early thirties, married, with three young children and was medically released from the military after 13 years. 

After a long time spent unemployed and job searching I managed to land a federal ladder position that will end as a GS-11 in two years but start as a GS-7 at the end of the month. I also had to sign an agreement promising to serve within the agency for additional 3 years. As a GS-7 with special pay rates I will be making a gross income of approximately 47k in addition to a tax free 40k pension I receive for my military service. So my annual salary will equate to roughly 87k with 40 of it free from taxes. After the two years it will take me to get to the GS-11 level I will be making around 60k.

Yesterday I received an amazing offer in a better location as a contractor for almost double the salary. I will end up grossing around 125k if you include the 40k pension. As an employee of this organization I will have nearly limitless career advancement opportunities pending an increased skill set and education. The federal position will not allow promotion beyond the GS-11 level until after the 5 year mark. It also does not offer the same amount of job satisfaction that the contracting position will bring. 

I've read numerous online articles and forum postings debating the topic of public vs private sector work, but I'm still having a hard time making the best decision for me and my family. I know federal work provides great benefits (crazy vacation time, paid holidays, 40 hr work weeks, low medical, 401k/TSP/pension and job security). I will also have the option of ""buying back"" my military time eventually resulting in another pension however, I already receive a pension and nearly free medical for life. 

The contracting position also offers great bennies and 3 day weekends twice a month. The contract is well established with no sight of losing it in the near future, but we all know that can change within a drop of a dime. 

So do I keep the security of the federal gig with low advancement (unless the GS-12/13 retires or dies in 5 years) and walk off from a lot money or accept the offer job for the higher salary and better job satisfaction? If I didn't have a family to support this would be a no-brainer for me, but because of this I'm having a hard time and don't want to regret my decision. My So doesn't want me to decline the contracting position out of fear, but is supportive of my decision either way. 

Any advice or insight into my predicament would be greatly appreciated.",finance,1477139813
personalfinance,401K Loan to pay off student loans for the sake of paying interest to myself question?,"My company has a very liberal 401K loan policy. I have about $25,000 in my 401K and it will be fully vested next summer, which by then should be close to $30,000 (estimate). By next summer my student loans will be down to about $20,000.

I've been toying with the idea on taking a loan out of my 401K, once fully vested, to pay off the student loans that way the interest i'm paying on the loan is to myself rather than disappearing to thin air. This would also take two payments (one private, one FSL) and take it to one. I'm only 30, so I still have plenty of time before I retire to pay it back.

It also appears that my monthly interest rate would drop from 6.9% &amp; 8% to about 5.5% saving me money there too. A few co-workers in passing said they did the same thing and it made their lives easier.

I've always paid my loans off aggressively but this option does sound very appealing to me. Doing some rough math, it looks like my monthly payments would go from $600 a month to about $400 a month and I'll save myself close to $2,000 over the course of a 5 year loan in interest that I wouldn't get back.

So for the convenience of one lower monthly loan payment and paying interest to myself is this a good idea?",finance,1477141713
personalfinance,"First time making money, unsure how to create a budget and how much to use to pay off both of our loans.","I have been reading through posts.

I have 44K in student loans, but interest doesn't start for me until August 31st, 2017 (since I'm technically still a student), and for the first 6 months after that my interest is reduced to just 2.5%.

*My waxing: $30

*Eating out: $150


We both get free gym memberships, health care is free, and we both get benefits. If we have kids (which we probably won't do), they'll have free day care, school lunches, and college. 


Should we pay off his loans right away and aggressively? E.g. $2000/month to his loans, and finish paying them off ASAP. Or, should we put just $500/month to his loans, and save $1500/month towards mine to pay a big lump sum all at once.

We'll have some expenses next year, that we have to travel back stateside, so flight tickets are something we have to save for. We don't know many people in the country, so there's no birthday gifts, or whatever.

personalfinance,[Housing] Best approach to selling second property with bad roof,"tl;dr: I recently moved and am trying to sell my old property. The first buyer tried to get an FHA loan, but the inspector said there was less than two years of life left on the roof and won't approve it unless I pay to put a new roof on.  I have a second party interested in a ""Rent to Own"" deal and they will take care of the roof themselves.  Which option causes the least potential issues?

Detailed Verson:

I am going to try and keep things relevant, but there's a lot of factors that I am trying to balance out here.  It started when my wife's father died and her mother moved in with us.  Our little 1000 square foot house was no longer big enough for my wife. We went looking for a new property, and found one that we all loved that would fit the new size of our household.

I had the original house in my name alone, because I purchased it when I was single.  I have a 15 year mortgage with a low interest rate, and the payments are less than $700 a month.  I have no other debt.  Student loans are paid off.  My 14 year old car is paid in full.  My wife's car is paid in full.  We use two credit cards (one for me and one for my wife) for expenses and pay them off completely every month.  My credit score is great.  With my wife's income and my own (take-home about $4,500), we're fine.  My wife has always spent too much, a relationships issue really, and we had to replace the A/C at the old house so we have no savings to speak of. Yeah, I am ashamed of that.  There was a time when I did have six months of expenses saved up.

Anyway, her mom ""gifted"" us $10,000 towards the down payment.  Officially, this is a gift.  But, it's really a 0% interest loan that we need to pay back.  I went, with my wife, to get financing for the new house and we were initially denied.  Credit score too low.  Credit card balances too high!  Uhm, what?!

Turns out, my wife had credit cards in her own name that I was aware existed but didn't know she had maxed out.  They were supposed to be for rebuilding her credit score and paid off each month.  She'd been hiding it from me and paying them with money from extra she was making on her paychecks.  In total, it's ~$10,000 at a weighted average of 25% APR.  I don't know the full details of this until after sitting down with her later and getting it all out in the open.  But, I push through with trying to get a mortgage.

Fortunately, depending on how you look at things, my income, credit, and lack of debts is enough to get me approved for an FHA mortgage on my own without her income.  I hate the extra I have to pay with this mortgage type, but whatever.  We get the approval and buy the house we loved, knowing it needed about $6,000 in landscaping work to make it functional for our dogs.  Hurricane Matthew tears through just recently, and adds a bunch of tree removal costs to that figure and brings it up to $7,000 total.  The storm does not do enough damage to approach our deductible, so it's all out of pocket costs.

We find a buyer for the other house, at the bottom of what I want to take for it, and everything is fine until the FHA inspection denies the house because of the age of the roof.  Now, we could pay $9,000 for a new roof and lose that much more on the sale of the house, or we can back out.  The other big issue is that we can't even get roofers to schedule their work.  Everyone is booked three plus months into the future because of roof damage from the hurricane.  So, even if we wanted to pay that money, we can't get a roofer.

In steps our landscaper who can only get approved for $100,000 for a house.  He wants to do a rent to own agreement for the house, paying us $1,100 in rent each month and giving us a lump sum of extra from his business profits at the end of the year to bring the total amount of the house down.  He's willing to ""pay"" the current asking price.  If the roof does actually fail or develop problems while he lives there, he trades labor with a friend of his that does roofs and he will just put a new roof on at his own expense and for much cheaper than I could afford to.

It seems like the best solution.  It takes the $700 mortgage and the ~$150 monthly utilities off my current budget.  But, it means we don't get to just pay off all the wife's cards.  We can take the extra and put it towards the cards.  It also means my mother-in-law has to wait for her money (which she says is fine).

Concerns:

* How do I handle the lump sum of extra money he wants to use to bring down the price left on the house?  Putting it on the mortgage itself would be bad if the deal falls through and I need to pay him back.  I am afraid it would be counted as taxable income for me.
* He doesn't like credit or banks.  He will pay in checks or cash and wants to just keep receipts as proof.  This is more risky for him, I think, but I am concerned about it looking like I am dealing with undocumented income.
* My insurance and property taxes will go up, but they should still be less than his monthly payment.  It might not be enough less to contribute towards the purchase of the house, how do I protect myself in that case?
* Could I be getting scammed or screwed here?  I am going to find and speak to a real-estate attorney and have them draw up the contract that represents my desires and protects my interest, but I am not even sure I know all the questions to ask.
* This will cost me more in credit card interest and personal stress (mother-in-law debt), but may save me more than enough money in commission fees on the sale that makes up for those.
* I am currently in contract with a realtor to sell the house.  They are willing to release me from that for the expenses that have incurred and they say I might owe the title agency some money for the work they have done.  My contract says that they can come after me for the commission if I sell the house before the end of the original contract date (Feb. of 2017).  Would this rent to own contract be considered a sale they could demand commission on, since it was entered during that window?

I think that's it.  I am speaking with a real estate attorney this week, trying to find one first, and going to pay them to make sure I don't mess up.  Is there anything I am over-looking?  Would it just be better to find the money and put a new roof on the house and relist it a little higher to try and recoup some (not all) of the cost?",finance,1477147551
personalfinance,Best Online Bank or Credit Union for high yield no effort Checking/Savings?,"Does anyone know the best high yield checking and savings options for online banks? I'm not really interested in the ones that require 10 transactions a month to get 2-5%, but the ones where I can get maybe .5% or more in checking and 1% or more in savings without having to make any effort except maybe direct deposit.

Currently I use ally, but they don't have EMV on their debit cards and still over a year after the liability switch, have made no effort to add this feature. They also only do 0.10% on checking now, which feels kind of low, and limited ATM reimbursements to $10 a month.

I use Schwab for a no FTF debit card that refunds ATM fees, but they don't offer good interest rates to justify parking my money there.

So far the only other option I'm seeing is Alliant Credit Union which is basically like Ally, and but 0.65% on checking, they have EMV on their debit cards, they refund $20 a month for ATM's instead of $10, and they seem to also support multiple savings accounts for the envelope style system of saving that I like.

So my question is, compared to Ally and Alliant, are there any other better alternatives, or are those 2 of the best no effort online banking accounts out there?",finance,1477152455

**Advisory Board**  

**Larry Summers**

- *Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Summers became a professor of economics at Harvard University in 1983. He left Harvard in 1991, working as the Chief Economist at the World Bank from 1991 to 1993. In 1993, Summers was appointed Undersecretary for International Affairs of the United States Department of the Treasury under the Clinton Administration. In 1995, he was promoted to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury under his long-time political mentor Robert Rubin. In 1999, he succeeded Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury. While working for the Clinton administration Summers played a leading role in the American response to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the Russian financial crisis. He was also influential in the American advised privatization of the economies of the post-Soviet states, and in the deregulation of the U.S financial system, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.*  
- *Following the end of Clinton's term, Summers served as the 27th President of Harvard University from 2001 to 2006. Summers resigned as Harvard's president in the wake of a no-confidence vote by Harvard faculty, which resulted in large part from Summers's conflict with Cornel West, financial conflict of interest questions regarding his relationship with Andrei Shleifer, and a 2005 speech in which he suggested that the under-representation of women in science and engineering could be due to a ""different availability of aptitude at the high end,"" and less to patterns of discrimination and socialization.*

- *After his departure from Harvard, Summers worked as a managing partner at the hedge fund D. E. Shaw &amp; Co., and as a freelance speaker at other financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. Summers rejoined public service during the Obama administration, serving as the Director of the White House United States National Economic Council for President Barack Obama from January 2009 until November 2010, where he emerged as a key economic decision-maker in the Obama administration's response to the Great Recession. After his departure from the NEC in December 2010, Summers has worked in the private sector and as a columnist in major newspapers. In mid-2013, his name was widely floated as the potential successor to Ben Bernanke as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, though after pushback from the left, Obama eventually nominated Federal Reserve Vice-Chairwoman Janet Yellen for the position.*

Hernando de Soto  

- Hernando de Soto heads the Institute for Liberty and Democracy, named by The Economist one of the two most important think tanks in the world. In the last 30 years, he and his colleagues at the ILD have been involved in designing and implementing legal reform programs to empower the poor in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and former Soviet nations by granting them access to the same property and business rights that the majority of people in developed countries have through the institutions and tools needed to exercise those rights and freedoms. Mr. de Soto also co-chaired with former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor, and currently serves as honorary co-chair on various boards and organizations, including the World Justice Project. He is the author of “The Other Path: the Economic Answer to Terrorism”, and his seminal work “The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else.”  
- Frequent attendee at Davos World Economic Forum

http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2ytfrs   
https://archive.is/MWKee 
- Criticisms:  
-- In his 'Planet of Slums'[104] Mike Davis argues that de Soto, who Davis calls 'the global guru of neo-liberal populism', is essentially promoting what the statist left in South America and India has always promoted—individual land titling. Davis argues that titling is the incorporation into the formal economy of cities, which benefits more wealthy squatters but is disastrous for poorer squatters, and especially tenants who simply cannot afford incorporation into the fully commodified formal economy.  
-- An article by Madeleine Bunting for The Guardian (UK) claimed that de Soto's suggestions would in some circumstances cause more harm than benefit, and referred to The Mystery of Capital as ""an elaborate smokescreen"" used to obscure the issue of the power of the globalized elite. She cited de Soto's employment history as evidence of his bias in favor of the powerful. https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/sep/11/imf.comment

Emergency savings would be around $15k.

I won't be making future deposits to these accounts- so accounts that stipulate you must add additional funds every month won't work for me.


What do you all use and what would you recommend?

personalfinance,High yield savings Vs. Money Market Account,"I'm starting a high yield savings account with Synchrony bank because there is no minimum deposit to start or upkeep the account and they have 1.05% interest rate. Seems like a no brainer to put about 200 a month or part of my bonuses into that account instead of doing a money market account. If I need to use the money, I can just transfer funds to my bank checking account. So tell me why a money market account would be a better option?  If I transfer money over, will there be a waiting period to use it? They said I can transfer up to $250,000 to my checking to be used. Only thing is I can't just write a check directly from that savings account because the purchase limit on it is $500/day. Any input is appreciated.",finance,1477155890

I am debating between maxing out my 401(k) this year, $18,000 contributed, knowing that i can borrow against my 401(k) for down payment of my first primary residence, OR just continuing my 6% and savings all of the extra cash in my savings account.

This might be trickier and have all sorts of ifs/buts involved, but thought i would throw out a few of my thinking points as to why i am debating this.

1) I am a single male with no dependents on taxes and by maxing out my 401(k) i would save some money on the federal taxes i have to pay this year. Since my 401(k) is pre-tax i would be using pre-tax money for the down payment and pre-tax money to re-pay myself as well. Ultimately this plan seems like it might be my tax evasion plan, a co-worker put the bug in my ear on this.

2) continue just the 6% and take everything else and save save save to just do it all with cash.

Regardless i will have the amount saved i need for my down payment by the time i plan on buying, just wondering if there is a real tax/long term advantage to messing with the 401(k) plan.",finance,1477156031

I'm very nervous about taking on another huge debt when we already have a large student debt to pay off, but renting seems like a waste if it will cost the same as mortgage. If we decide to get a house after saving enough for a downpayment, what are some financial considerations we should know as first time homeowners?

2. 200k on 5.6% interest seems like such a huge number to us. In the long run what is our wisest option for repaying this? A financial advisor suggested income based repayment, but being in debt for the next 25 years sounds crushing. And does IBR mean if you miss or pay late even one payment in the next 25 years, you're no longer eligible to have the remainder forgiven after 25 years?

3. Can you refinance a federal loan like ours for a lower interest rate? Are there any reasons we shouldn't do this?

4. There will be 2 years when he's working and I'm still in school, and the wedding will most likely happen during this time. The price tag on traditional weddings is already making me want to vomit, but it means a lot to both our parents so nor do we want to go completely bare bones and get married at the court house. If anyone has resources for planning tiny weddings (like 20-30 people) please share.

5. Honest opinions: how manageable does our situation look?",finance,1477157495
personalfinance,Question about mortgage and down payment strategy,"My wife and I are looking to buy our first house in the next 6-8 months. We've done some classes and I'm doing a lot of research on my own. My situation is as follows. 

Right now, we don't have kids. We are looking for a place that will comfortably accommodate us for the next 5-8 years or so. Kids are a possibility but not certain, and we don't want to buy a place that's too big and overpriced in the event we don't have them at all. My thought is that, likely, we'll be selling this house within 10yrs. 

On the savings plan we are on right now, we anticipate having about 10℅ of the total home price down in cash. I understand that bigger down payment leads to lower interest rate. However, how big of a deal is that difference (say, putting 20k down instead of 30k on a 300k house) if I don't intend to pay the entire term of the mortgage? 

That is, if we sink that cash in as a down payment, is the mortgage interest savings over the 5-10yrs we actually pay on the mortgage worth the extra cash up front? Or are we as well or better off making a more modest down payment and keeping some extra cash on hand if we just plan to move on in the reasonably short term?

Hopefully that makes sense. Thanks in advance.",finance,1477159919
crypto,"GCM and several other EtM MACs cannot be quantum-proofed. Simon's problem brings down of underlying hash from O(2^n/2) to not O(2^n/3), but O(n)!","https://who.rocq.inria.fr/Gaetan.Leurent/files/Simon_CR16_slides.pdf

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.05973.pdf

This pretty much makes AES256-GCMSHA384 pointless. The 128-bit output in GCM and Poly1305 is proofed against quantum and birthday attacks. However, for GCM the underlying hash function needs to be quantum and birthday resistant (according to BHT this necessitates n*3 bit length; for ~128-bit security this means SHA384).

Now apparently, the underlying hash completely falls apart based on the point in the process where the nonce is used.

Based on this AES256-GCM-SHA384 is pointless because the whole point of AES256 is to be resistant to Grover's Algorithm. The MAC however is weaker than symmetric keys under Grover or even long keys in Shor's algorithm.

ChaCha20-Poly1305 uses a 256-bit key to encrypt (Grover-resistant) and uses the 256-key and a hash to make a 128-bit output tag. In TLS it has 93 bits of security that can't be attacked with quantum or birthday attacks.

The underlying hash for Poly1305 seems to always be SHA256. It is birthday resistant and being keyed it is resistant to extension length attacks (unlike plain MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512). Is it also quantum-resistant in Poly1305? I don't see Poly1305 mentioned explicitly in the documents.

I guess this means there is no point in rushing to upgrade to AES256-GCMSHA384. ECDSA has so many pitfalls with random numbers and setup and not having underlying hash be fixed at a certain value.

Seems like best strategy is to push for AES128-GCM-SHA256 and ECDHE for now and wait for Ed25519 and X25519 and maybe even X448 before going further. Unless I'm misunderstanding this, it seems that we will have enough qubits to crack GCM and AES128 before we have enough qubits to crack the SHA512 in signatures or longer asymmetric keys.",cryptocurrency,1477162038

gaming,"My Minecraft Story, or better put the greatest experience i've ever had while playing a video game","Ive seen a couple posts asking for MC stories so i thought i would share mine. But i think /r/minecraft considers this advertising of a server which is against their rules but hopefully i can post it here. I play on a type of minecraft server known as ""civ"" or civilization building. It is survival with an emphasis on nation building and politics with other players. A few plug ins made this formula exiting,  the ability to imprison other players indefinitely (known as ""pearling"") and banish them to the end so laws of a nation could be respected and upheld, block reinforcements that made blocks take 25, 600, or 1800 breaks before they broke protecting your valuables and buildings depending on what item you used to protect it, ""Factories"" which required alot of resources that encourage team effort to gather that was worth alot of reward and would bring a reputation attracting both good and bad, the list goes on but you get the idea of the server. The potential for drama is unseen in any video game and you cant help but roleplay as whatever position you are in your city be it builder, warrior, politician, explorer, religious, criminal, you name it. 

The civ server known as ""Civcraft"" which invented the genre released a new server, dubbed ""civ 3.0"" and i hopped on after the first couple days of it starting. My story begins as a wanderer, roaming the [desert and swamps](http://i.imgur.com/3M0GGZk.jpg) of this server, but i soon found myself in a giant redwood forest known as [""Tjikko"", named so by the admins of the server.](http://i.imgur.com/PtxL5Ez.jpg) My friend started a city in the northwest part of [Tjjikko](https://i.redditmedia.com/GgBDFf_rEO-3g0-phu3Oz5fLKJ3oZMfvwP9P4262tTs.jpg?w=320&amp;s=299a585e93dc01d18602036b9f2ea20b) he named ""Rockwood Grove"", it already had a handful of citizens and expanding city center so i soon joined. There was a neighboring settlement only 100 blocks or so to the north of us, known as ""The Knights of Networking"" or ""TKON"" for short who we met real early but other than that we were completely unaware of any other cities at the time. TKON was much larger than our town RWG and had more citizens, so we recognized their power and tried our best to be allies with our new friends. Like in real life, the beginning of our server's history was an unlawful wasteland and raiders were an everyday thing due to the lack of civilzied society so having friends watching your back was a huge concern. Like i said earlier, these raiders could rain on your day and imprison you, break all your stuff, leave nice little re inforced greif over your pretty town, and hold you forever until someone broke you out, if they are given the opportunity. A few weeks pass on and the server starts to settle down, the area becomes a little less lawless, maps become published, and claims begin to be made. We soon see that [two cities are trying to dominate large areas of Tjikko](http://imgur.com/rY33q9w), the nation of ""Concordia"" which included many smaller cities, and the settlement nestled between two lakes in the north east, the city of ""Iria"". TKON then responded by posting [their own claims](https://i.redd.it/0mutl7vcbgdx.png)

Before i go any further let me explain another important part to this genre of minecraft, known to players as **SUBREDDIT PVP** it works exactly how it sounds. The subreddit for the server is used as a world chat so to speak, where people from different nations post propoganda and bounties on other players, or whatever needs to be broadcasted globally, like these claims maps... anyway..

Iria posted a response to TKON's claims, [saying they are overlapping with their border claims](http://imgur.com/UGxqu4N) This led TKON to insult Iria, with this post [here](http://i.imgur.com/eTdVjui.png), beginning hostilities between the two states. Irians soon began to look through TKON members history, and found videos they posted of [themselves raiding Iria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8kLyz0tuR4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2h52m17s). This led to Concordia and Iria to immideatly declare war, invading Tkonia, and pearling every citizen in sight. [Here is the joint Concordian/Irian response to the invasion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4w8xq5/the_concordian_siege_on_tkon/) The city was annexed by Iria, renamed to Tellus, and lawlessness returned once again to northwest tjikko attracting raiders to prey on the now crippled war torn region. [Many of the TKON members were permanently pearled but some were offered actual trials in Conordia, a video of one of the trials here](https://youtu.be/vMgtTMiW_mg) The northwest tjikkan region became considered ""unclaimed"" once again despite the towns settled there which included Rockwood Grove, Garundinistan, The Overcast Republic, Fort Visegrad, and Defem.  There was alot of commenting on how the region resembled the [Balkans](https://imgur.com/a/Zjht3#HJXyOr5) or The [Middle east](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4yqo9y/updated_tjikko_claims_map/). The region soon became known as [""Free Tjikko""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4wbgtt/homestead_of_free_tjikko/) to let the server know that despite our lack of claims people do homestead in this region, and people are welcome to. A new problem arose when Defem was found out to be already settled in Iria's land claims. Defem claimed the land by right of homesteading, Iria claimed the land because ""they claimed it publicly first"" and that ""they had plans in the region"" despite Defem already settling the area. This led to this response from the [Defem government](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4wcmua/on_irian_claims_and_the_conflict_therein/). The conflict ended in peace with Iria respecting Defem's claims, but this act left a sour taste in the mouths of northwest tjikkans who saw Irians acting as over reaching imperialists. Iria was annexing northwest lands and claiming them as their own but offered no protection for the local populace. They gave the city of Tellus to a player who soon became friends with the local villages nearby and began to be assimilated into Free Tjikkan culture. The towns of northwest Tjikko began to have an anti-Irian sentiment and decided to unify to make their own government to combat raiders and foreign occupiers. The newly assimilated leader of Tellus succeeded from Iria and renamed his town to ""Cloud City"" The towns who supported the succession included Rockwood Grove, The Overcast Republic, and Fort Visegrad, who all banded together to form the ""Tjikkan Hermitic Confederacy"" or THC for short. [Newly created THC claims were posted](https://i.redd.it/z3841ocmrcgx.png) which immideatly got criticism from Irians who saw ""Cloud city"" succession illegal and responded by issuing a [forced eviction notice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4ymybn/eviction_notice_for_jontiben_and_cloud_city/) giving the secessionists 36 hours to abandon their claims on Tellus/Cloud City. This led the THC leaders to come together and decide that war was the only answer to these demands. 

The war plan for THC was to be a preemptive surprise attack on the city of Iria to have an upper hand and force negotiations. Little did the THC soldiers know that the city of Defem, who was considered a blood brother in the northwest's struggle for independence from foreign occupiers but did not join the confederacy, was feeding information of the attack to Irian leadership. Despite the insider warnings [THC forces soon occupied the Irian capital](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4yq7bz/iria_has_been_invaded_by_the_thc_and_tomo_jo_rey/) and began to make demands with the irian leadership. Negotiations were going smooth at first and hostilities were soon to be dieing down, with the Irian leader meeting with the occupying THC soldiers. The Irian leadership was discussing and seeming to be agreeing with the THC demands, which turned out to be just them buying time so their allies from a far away town called Crocodile Island that wasn't in Tjikko could make it to the capital and help the Irians fight off the invaders. While negotiations were happening the [Croc island forces swooped in on an unprepared THC and pearled the occupying soldiers after a brief fight, THC was assuming hositilites have died down and many of them were AFK during the liberation of Iria, leading to the event being compared to game of thrones' Red Wedding](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4yqkls/thcs_attack_on_iria/). Here is a [victory photo in Iria](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4yqx3b/iriathc_war_ends_with_irian_victory_as_all_thc/). Here is a [news report on the situation if you're curious](https://youtu.be/4NtVPmzcTxI?t=6m25s) (yes an actual news report, i forgot to add that into the list of profession in this game in the beginning of my post) [Here is a civball comic someone made after the event](http://i.imgur.com/gCyI4Nm.jpg) Many of the THC soldiers were leaders of the towns back home in free tjikko, who's citizens were once again subjected to indiscriminate raiding and pillaging, prompting the area to once again become one of the unsafest in the whole server. The citizens of THC who did not participate in the attack and were still free, began to feel [hatred towards Defem](https://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/4ytat2/implying_defem_will_be_remembered/), who ratted out the [THC to the Irians.](http://imgur.com/a/lrQSw) and they were targeted for it after it. A new leader came to rally the people of free tjikko once again and called the area ""Persia"" but that was soon taken over shortly after.

Unfortunately the admin of the server decided to call it quits right after this, ending the server, but the genre continues on in different servers, most of the people from civcraft now play on /r/devoted if you're interested. Well thanks for reading about my experience i hope you enjoyed! Sorry if its more political than minecrafty haha.

One final thing ill mention, since i am speaking as a ""free tjikkan"" in this story and making the Irians seem like bad guys, ill quote a good review posted by the main Irian leader, ""seemywolfeyes""

&gt;Here is some history of Persia and its two thinly-disguised predecessor states.
TKON was founded at the start of the map consisting of its capitol city in the far NE of Tjikko and Rockwood Grove to the east of the capitol. Citizens of the capitol city heavily raided Iria, attempted to annex Irian land claims, and pearled by the Prime Minister of Concordia when he visited the TKON capitol. In retaliation, Concordia and Iria attacked the capitol, pillaging it of its ill-gotten gains, and pearling any guilty residents found. Rockwood Grove was spared as their complicity in their sister city's hostilities were unclear. As the pillaged items did not over our loses and the pearled TKON members refused to pay reps, Iria annexed the old TKON capitol as reparations and renamed it Tellus. Greenble and a few other Irians worked on improving it.
Not long after, Rockwood Grove formed a new state with Overcast and Fort Visegard named THC, some old TKON capitol members joined too. Fort Visegard was founded in former Irian claims which we had freely given to them to foster regional development. THC again annexed Iria's western claims, including Tellus, and also the land around Defem and Garundistan. Defem rejected an offer to join THC when they offered to annex most of Iria's remaining land and give it to Defem if they joined. Defem warned Iria of THC's plans, which included an imminent invasion of the capitol of Iria. THC invaded the Irian capitol an hour later, and proclaimed it to be under THC martial law, and pearled a few citizens who disobeyed their orders. With assistance from Crocodile Isles, the THC invaders were lured into a trap where they were pearled en masse, and Irians celebrated the liberation of their capitol.
The THC invaders from Overcast and Rockwood Grove would be released not too longer after the war due to co-operation, and a peace agreement was made that would see much of THC's old claim given to Iria. However then Xurksice appeared and founded Persia in THC's old claim, and denied to give Iria any of the land that was agreed in the peace deal. Rockwood Grove joined Persia. Persia also claimed a large amount of land and declared all existing outposts and homesteads within their new claim to be illegal builds that must be removed. Iria was provided evidence that Persians were planning hostilities against it in their chat. While Defem won Iria's respect for blowing the whistle on THC's plots, many in THC/Persia resented Defem as a rat. A random newfriend affiliated with Overcast seriously griefed Defem, and possible Persian encouragement was suspected by Defem, this is what they wrote in their report on the raid:
It is possible that Xurksice or another member of Persia may have encouraged ClockworkPie to attack Defem. Persia is largely made up of and supported by members of the former THC. Xurksice was not known to be a member of any constituent nation of the THC, but he has previously pledged to further the ""values"" of THC with the establishment of Persia and is a known associate of pearled THC leader tomokuroki. He has also previously referred to perceived wrongs committed against himself by Defem in the past, although no member of Defem can recall having contact with him prior to the days leading up to the raid. Some individuals have suspected that Xurksice may be an illegal alternate account of a pearled THC member, although this claim has not been substantiated.
And now it seems the saga of TKON/THC/Persia has perhaps finally come to an end, I congratulate and thank Veria and Aegis for disbanding this group of barbarians.
As noted, Iria is annexing Persia's old claim, and we are also declaring any dereliction notices posted on property in the area by Persians to be null and void. All existing outposts and homes in the East Tjikko Mountains constructed by non-Persians will remain the property of the constructors.

In my state, teachers have a public pension, but do not contribute to social security. I am in my mid 20's and I know now's the time to start saving for retirement (since a public pension won't be enough). I thought starting a 403(b) was fairly straightforward, but I'm finding out that it's a bit more complicated. 

I'll say upfront that finance is far from my area of expertise, and honestly the stock market is kind of scary to me. I don't fully understand how a 403(b) works (beyond the basics of, you put money into it now, tax deferred, it grows with the stock market, and you withdraw it when you retire). I thought to start a 403(b) I just had to sign up for one with HR. Well after looking into it, and after reading [this article in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/your-money/403-b-retirement-plans-fees-teachers.html?_r=0), I'm even more lost and scared. I can pick from 10+ different approved companies to handle my 403(b) (including AXA, VOYA, VALIC, etc.), but I have no idea how to pick one. There was a rep at my school recently and I talked with him for a bit, and he made everything sound just dandy, but I now know he was just a salesperson trying to get me to go with his company over any of the others. 

What really concerns me the most is that I could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars in my retirement fund, only to lose it if the market crashes like it did in 2008. Mr. Salesrep assured me that the market always comes back up, but I am not a risk taker. I'm fairly good at saving (I consistently transfer money into my savings account) and while my current savings account has a low interest rate, I feel much more comfortable knowing that my money is there and not going anywhere. I have read a little about IRAs and they sound more appealing to me, but the investment aspect is still rather overwhelming. 

**So my question is**, what would truly be my best option for saving for retirement in the public school system?

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to refinance my home?,"My wife and I bought our first home with a 30 year FHA nearly five years ago. We were under the impression that our pmi would drop after five years, or 20% equity. I had recently been told by a friend that they called their lender and was able to get the pmi dropped early because the market had gone up and they had a good payment history. 

Our loan had just been sold for about the third time, so my wife called to ask the new lender about dropping the pmi. They said we would need to pay the pmi for five years AND have 30% of the loan paid off. This is not at all what we expected and we will be going through our original terms to see what they said because what we recall obviously doesn't match with what we are being told. 

If we find that we can not get the pmi dropped soon, would it be wise to refinance? Here are details of our loan: the original loan was $169,000 fixed at 3.5% for 30 years. We currently owe about $150,000. Our house is currently listed on Zillow at $287,000 and I have seen similar homes in the area sell for around there so I figure that's a good ballpark of its current value. 

I guess I just don't know the pros and cons of a refinance. Obviously, we would be extending the life of the loan, but we want to put the price of the pmi toward the principle of the house to shorten the life of the loan overall. Typically I see people try to refinance to get a lower interest rate but we've already got a low rate. Would we be able to get lower? Are there other things to consider?",finance,1477238973

personalfinance,I've been working 2 separate contract jobs at the same company.,"Staffing company A hired me in 2014 to work a graveyard shift on weekends. I work 2 12 hour shifts and am scheduled 8 hours of OT a week. I'm also usually able to pickup extra hours during the week, usually bringing my total hours close to 40. Staffing company B hired me 6 months ago for a M-F day job at the same location. 

For Staffing company A, I was hired as an SOW employee. Im not sure what that means, but its a long term, revolving contract that didnt have an end date that I know of. 

Staffing company B hired me as an ETW employee. I'm pretty sure that stands for External Temporary Worker, but I'm not sure. I was told I would only be able to work 2 years and would then need to take 6 months off before I could come back. 

When I accepted the job with company B, they told me I would need to quit my job for company A, that I couldn't have 2 contracts at the same company.  Well company A freaked out because they were short staffed and basically begged me to stay, gave me more money and told me that there was no conflict and that I could work both contracts simultaneously. This was confirmed by company B and the site company. All was good. 

Last Saturday, company A had a big meeting with all of the workers. They said that a 3rd party company, separate from both staffing agencies as well as separate from the site company the staffing agencies work for, is moving everyone to ETW contracts beginning 11/1. Okay, cool. 

Not cool. I was told this week that I can no longer work for company A. They said I couldn't work 2 ETW contracts and that my last day working for company A world be 10/30.

personalfinance,[Planning] [UK] About to buy a house and get married. We have a plan - does this sound decent?,"Hi,

Using a throwaway because I'd like to be detailed about my finances and I don't want this on my main account. I hope this post is okay - let me know if you need edits.

My SO and I are about to buy a house in the south-east of the UK (v close to London). Combined income of £90k. We also plan to get married in Summer 2018.

We've planned £40k for the purchase, of a property worth no more than £420k: £20k for the deposit (which equates to 5%, which we have agreed in principle) another £10k for tax and £5k for fees and survey stuff. That leaves £5k for any pressing or urgent house bits upon moving.

The mortgage repayments would be £1.6k a month at 2% interest rates and £1.9k at 3% (these are approximate, with rounding). 

Once the mortgage repayments are out of the way, and bills/utilities/phone bills are covered, we each would have £300pm for fun stuff. At 3% interest rates on the mortgage, we would be saving £1400pm. At 2% we would be saving nearer to £1600.

The first year of savings post buying the house is dead money (it will be financing our wedding - max £20k. will be for the wedding but we'll have saved £24k, chances are the other £4k will also be spent on the house).

A couple of months before we get married, my SO pays off his student debt meaning his effective income goes up net £300. This means post-wedding, we're able to save between £1700-2000pm, depending on interest rates which, what with the current climate, I'm expecting to mean we're near the top end. Our goal at that point is to put £1k every month into an account that we do not touch, short of us becoming unemployed. After 5 years this means we will have definitive savings of £60k. This then leaves £700-£1000pm worth of 'savings' to be spent on regular saving towards a new car as needed, improvements to the house, an annual holiday. We wouldn't expect to use all of this each year (even if we bought a car and holiday every year we wouldn't use £12k) so there's room to add more to the 'untouchable' saving pot.

Come 5 years post wedding, I'm near enough 30, my partner is mid-late 30s.

What have we missed? Does this sound workable? Comfortable? Do you think we're making mistakes?

We've never done this before. We have spreadsheeted our income and future savings to the last penny. We are so committed to this plan as I've outlined - and we feel confident in it - but having not done this, I'm just curious if anyone else can spot any potential pitfalls or has any general advice.

I also would appreciate if people think certain aspects of this plan are good, that they might comment and say so (so we at least know which bits are on the right track). I want to go to a financial advisor but I'm not especially well-researched on finding one that doesn't double up as a salesperson so thought I'd start here for now. Thank you in advance!

financialindependence,FU money and entrepreneurship,"Hi FI,
So I'm going to present my specific situation and question, but I would also encourage a more generalized discussion. I'm a dependent-free twenty-something living near DC and working for the feds, but I am already deeply unsatisfied with my job, despite only having been there less than a year. I'm considering trying to switch to a different agency, but I've also been working on a side project that could be very lucrative and is much more fulfilling, if I am able to put more time and effort into it.


I figure that if I leave the government, I could potentially work on my side project for three unprofitable years before my savings would be depleted at my current burn rate and I would have to take a ""real"" job again. Of course, the goal would be to start making money before those three years are up. This is also based on the assumption that I'm not paying anyone yet and receive no outside investment.


I guess I'm just rather risk averse about taking the leap and worry that I would be falling behind in my FIRE goals if I'm not getting that steady paycheck. But, on the flip side, if I eventually sell this thing for a couple million, I would be set for life.


So, has anyone been in a similar situation, contemplating quitting not because you are already FI, but to dip into your life savings to go completely entrepreneurial? Stories are welcome.
What would you say to my situation?

Edit: I removed some numbers, since they didn't contribute to the discussion. The general consensus seems to be that I wait until I'm closer to profitability before quitting my day job.",finance,1477250452
personalfinance,Roth 401k Taxation Timing,"Hi,
I've googled around some and can't seem to find an answer. This year I changed my 401k contributions to be Roth 401k contributions. I'm curious how the taxes work. I understand that I pay the taxes today rather than when I withdraw the money during retirement. I'm curious if I'm accumulating a tax liability right now or if those contributions are taxed before being invested. 

For example, if I contribute 400 dollars a month, does 400 dollars get added to my retirement account? Or would it be 400 dollars minus taxes? It looks to me like the transactions in my 401k indicate that they but 400 dollars worth of funds every month. Does that mean that at the end of the year I'll pay these new taxes with my federal income tax? Or are the taxes already withheld from my paycheck like anything else?

New expenses after our child is born include $1,083/mo ($13k annually) in daycare costs, of which $5,000 will be paid with pre-tax FSA funds, leaving us with only ~$1,000 to account for other, new child-related expenses and continued saving. Our 401k balance is unfortunately rather low as we did not begin seriously saving for retirement until recently. We are employed by the federal government (me) and state government (her), meaning our employment is very secure, and we have defined benefit pensions in our future. I was recently promoted and am at the lower end of my pay grade, with guaranteed raises each year of about 4% plus whatever COLA we get government wide. Without any additional promotions, I can expect my pay to rise by another $40,000 year, bringing our combined gross salary to ~$210,000/year (including COLA) within the next 6 years. 

With our expanding family, we're looking to get a small SUV/crossover that can hold our child and dog on trips to the in-laws, along with associated child gear. We currently own a sedan ('08), pickup truck ('04), and hatchback ('14), all of which are paid off. We plan to trade in the sedan for ~$3,500 credit. My question for you all is do you think we should just pony up the rest of the money for a ~$23000 car?

Stocks will generally open a little higher than the prior day close, they will reach a high price that is between 0.5% - 5% above the prior day close, and they will will close between 0% - 3% above the prior day close.

1: I currently use a small ""local"" bank in my hometown, which is out of state (and 6 hours away) since I've moved. It is not the center of my financial activity but I leave a small amount of money in it to keep my accounts open without fees because it's convenient for family, as they can deposit money into my account (and if something were to happen to a family member leaving me money, I'd have a local bank branch to work with since there are no CU shared branches in that area). Local to me, I have a credit union which is the main hub of my finances. They're great and their interest rates aren't as low as some; I get .25% on my savings. However, I'm debating opening an account with another bank such as Ally or Alliant for my emergency fund and other cash I may need in the short term so I get a little more interest on it. I'm deciding if dealing with accounts at three banks is worthwhile enough for the 1% interest or not. Paired with my next question, I'm thinking that it's probably worthwhile.

2, and probably the harder one. I'm extremely fortunate in that I did not need to take out any student loans to afford college. I was given a large sum of money and my parents made up the difference. There's no legal obligation or formalized agreement, but they do expect me to pay them back, as they contributed about $58,000. I'm not on great terms with them, but I don't want to interfere with their retirement and I have a younger sister who may be attending college in the near future and I want to make sure that she is able to have the same help that I did if she does. I'm trying to determine the best (and least expensive) way to pay them back. I make a salary where I should be able to do that over the next few years, but I know giving large lump sums of money (I believe over $13,000) to another person is taxable. I'm considering putting the money I intend to pay back into a few high interest CDs with a bank like Ally as I'm able so I can get a bit of a return on it while it's still in my hands.

     2. Bite the bullet and keep the vic with advanced payments (less appealing option)

     3. Do consignment, hopefully get 23k, have 12k in debt after payments and sale, buy toyota for no more than 3k, be in 15k debt, have life lesson. (second most as I don't want to deal with car dealers but i will have to deal with buyers.)

     4. Sell the f150 myself, get hopefully 23k, have 12k in debt after payments and sale, buy a toyota for no more than 3k, be in 15k debt with a life lesson. (most appealing as don't have to deal with car dealers for consignment)
I just want this debt as gone as possible.

Forex,About Fed's Oct 20 13:45 meeting,"hi there,
this is my first on reddit so excuse me if i don't comply to some rules...
i recently started trading with real money after a couple of months of trading the news on a demo account. as i intended to start experimenting with 1500 euros, i set my demo account on Plus500 to 2000 euros and started trading only big news events and had relatively good results (around 35% profit in 2 months, which isn't huge but was higher than my goal)
after switching to real money, i applied my strategy and got around 30% profits in a week and started to get confident. this led to opening trades without stop losses occasionally. 
finally during the draghi speech as i noticed the speculated tapering move wasn't going to take place and there were absolutely no signs of a move that would increase the euro strength i placed a risky short order (around 1/3 of my capital) without any limits. i was expecting that even if EUR/USD got higher it would eventually go down. which it did but after a MASSIVE and very short-lived spike in the upside that absolutely crushed all my capital. 

i know this is a newbie mistake and i had it coming as i didnt place a stop loss and i moved away from my strategy (basically i told myself i'd never place orders during the press conferences as big market movers tend to reach the news before individuals and move the instrument significantly), but i want to really learn about why this sudden spike to the upside then a sudden reversal happened? 

good luck to all in q4 :)",finance,1477308091
personalfinance,Statement Balance vs Current Balance Chase Visa,"EDIT - I understand everything now, and Chase is fixing a discrepancy with my account. Thank you for the replies.   



So, I want to start off by saying I'm not much a financing person, I'm not good with my money and I just kind of let things flow. With that said, I'm a little worried about something and I need to know what's going on. I did a search on this same topic, found a Reddit thread, but it didn't answer my question. I have had my statement balance auto-paying on my Chase bank Visa for about 14 months now. I should slap myself on the wrist and say I never really check my balance and just assume it all gets paid off every month. However a few months ago I noticed that it said I owed about 700 dollars when I opened the mint app. I didn't understand why as I knew I didn't spend near 700 dollars that month. Was going to look into it but didn't have time. Now it says I owe 917 dollars. So I'm wondering what exactly is happening and what is the right thing to do.   

My ""Current Balance"" is 917 dollars. When I go to paycard and I click ""Statement Balance"" it says it will pay 580~ dollars. When I looked at the other Reddit topic, I was told this was the correct thing to have on auto-pay as it would stop interest rates. How is that true wouldn't paying off the bigger number be better? Should I have it set to pay off ""Current Balance"" instead of ""Statement Balance"".   

TLDR;   

What is the difference between Current and Statement Balance? Why are they different, and how did they get different? Finally, what is the appropriate course of action if I setup auto payments and don't want to incure any interest charges.",finance,1477308667

personalfinance,"Buying a house or renting, when young but not sure about long term plans?","Hello everybody,

&amp;nbsp;

I hope I am not breaking any rules here. I just have a dlimena and hoped you could help me.

&amp;nbsp;

Here is the situation: I am 23 years old, I just got a full time job, completed my trial period, and I am getting 43k€/year gross, plus more or less 8k€ gross for bonuses, which is good for a first job.

&amp;nbsp;

My parents think I should buy a flat, instead of renting. I get that it would be a good investment, and I would not ""lose"" the money I use for renting. Also, I work for a bank, so I have very low interest rates (even lower than the current low ones). Moreover, I live in Paris, and the house market is said to be underestimated, especially with the Brexit coming. So the situation is really pro buying.

&amp;nbsp;

However, I am not sure I will stay in this city for more than 3 years. I plan on going abroad in 2 or 3 years. Plus, my boyfriend lives in another country, and does not speak my language, so if we stay together (which I think will happen), I will leave my country to join him. Finally, flats are super expensive in Paris (I have to spend at least 300K€ to get something as nice as I am renting, which would mean a high and long mortgage, even though my parents offered to help me). 

&amp;nbsp;

As such, I am not sure I want to go through the worrisome process of buying something, if I will not enjoy it more than 2 or 3 years. But I'm afraid that I am just being lazy and stupid, and is missing a huge opportunity. 

&amp;nbsp;

What do you think? Is not buying a flat in my situation a huge mistake?

BlockChain,Banks in Europe Making Less Progress in the Blockchain Race Against Wall Street Rivals,"Blockchain was developed almost eight years ago, allowing transactions utilizing the virtual currency to be processed and decided on a public network without the need for a third party.  Financial Institution are searching to apply it to private networks they run, to save costs by diminishing settlement times and automating systems that are still paper-based, like in economic affairs.  About 80 percent of top global banks will have launched blockchain projects by next year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) describing the technology as the future ""beating heart"" of the financial sector.  A survey of 200 top global banks by tech firm IBM last month found that 15 percent will have rolled out commercial blockchain products by the end of 2017.  But there is likely to be a transatlantic inequality in bringing out such products, given the costs involved in developing new technology.  While U.S. investment banks moved quickly to restructure and recapitalize after the financial crisis, European players are still working with cost-cutting and shoring up their balance sheets.

Dozens of patent applications have been filed in total by Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Wells Fargo and Bank of America (BAC.N) for blockchain-based products, but there is a record of only one being filed by a European bank - Switzerland's UBS (UBSG.S).  The European banks are cost-focused, whereas U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are likely trying to generate revenue, because they're in different market conditions.  No leading bank has publicly said how much it has invested in blockchain.  The six global banks approached by Reuters for this story - in the United States and Europe - declined to say how much they had spent. The WEF estimates a total of about $1.5 billion has been invested in blockchain by all industries, including financial institutions and tech firms.  The UBS ""fintech lab"" on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square tower in London's Canary Wharf financial district does not look much like a bank office. Ideas are scrawled onto walls in pen and Post-It notes adorn a see-through dividing panel.  UBS is regarded in the industry as one of the most innovative European banks. It radically restructured its investment banking arm in 2012 - earlier than most of its European competitors - to focus more on wealth management, but it faces the same cost-cutting pressures.

Banks are investing in blockchain in different ways: some invest directly in start-ups or have ""incubator"" programs where they work with start-up staff, others - like UBS - have ""labs"" in which they experiment with the technology. Some take all of these approaches.  They are also working together on the technology in consortia in order to come up with common standards and systems, with the most notable of these being New York-based R3, which includes most of the world's biggest banks.  Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, a San-Francisco-based blockchain start-up that is working with firms like Citi and Nasdaq, said ""it would be foolish for banks to spend too much at this point, as the technology was still in an experimentation phase"".

In Reuters interviews about tech innovation with banks, blockchain consortia and consultancies, the name of one U.S. investment bank came up more often than any other: Goldman Sachs, which posted a 58 percent jump in third-quarter profits on Tuesday.  The bank, which has a history of establishing new platforms privately that it then sells to the marketplace, as well as investing in start-ups, recently filed a patent application for a platform for trading foreign exchange via blockchain.  Earlier this month when Dutch bank ING announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, it also said it would invest 800 million euros in its technology platform.  As Deutsche Bank's portion cost was sliding towards a 30-year low last month on concerns over a fine from the U.S. Department of Justice, it announced that its new ""digital factory"" would be staffed by 800 professionals by 2018.

personalfinance,Student Loans 101,"Many Redditors in this sub have some type of exposure to student loans, whether they are going to be needing them for school shortly, are currently in school thanks to student loans, or are in the repayment period. There are dozens of questions asked about student loans everyday and I hope this answers many of them!

**Preparing for Student Loans**

**Federal Student Loans**

Sticking to federal loans is usually the best choice for most would-be students. It doesn’t matter if you’re 16 or 60 The very first thing you should do when you’re getting ready to start college is to fill out the [Free Application for Federal Student Aid](https://fafsa.ed.gov/) otherwise known as FAFSA. I could write another whole guide on the FAFSA but for now, what’s important about it is that you fill it out to the best of your ability. Just about every U.S. citizen who graduated high school/has their GED, signed up for the Selective Service (males), and hasn’t been convicted of selling drugs will likely qualify for some type of aid, unless you or your parents make boatloads of money.

**Federal Perkins Loans**

The FAFSA will tell you if you are eligible for a Federal Perkins Loan or a Stafford Loan. Perkins loans are doled out by your school (not all schools are in the program) and have a fixed interest rate of 5%. The government is actually moving to phase out Perkins loans with the last available ones being given by September 30, 2017. Your school will apply whatever amount you get to your bill for tuition and boarding. Sometimes, there will be some extra leftover, which will come back to you in the form of a check. Since these loans are being phased out in less than a year, there isn’t much else to say about them until it comes time to repay them.

**Stafford Loans**

These are the loans you may end up with if your parents’ [expected financial contribution](https://fafsa.ed.gov/help/fftoc01g.htm) is fairly low. There are two versions of the Federal Stafford Loan

* Subsidized Stafford Loans - Interest on a [subsidized loan](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized) doesn’t kick in for you until after the 6 month grace period for repayment. Technically, it does accrue but the government subsidizes it by paying the interest for you. These are usually given to those coming from lower-income families.

* Unsubsidized Stafford Loans - Interest starts accruing immediately but you aren’t required to pay it while you are in school. Once you graduate, all of the interest that has building up since you started school will be added onto the principal of the loan.

Interest rates on these loans can vary depending on when they were first given to you and whether you are an undergraduate or graduate student. Grad students can still get Stafford loans, but they can expect to pay a higher interest rate, usually around 5%.

**PLUS Loans**

PLUS loans are taken out by your parents, in their name only, to help you pay for school expenses. Most of the time, they are only taken out when Stafford and Perkins loans aren’t enough to cover everything school-related. You tend to see them more with schools that have a higher cost of attendance.

Unlike those two loans however, the interest rate is 7.9% and your parents’ [credit history](http://annualcreditreport.com) does play a role in whether or not they qualify for a PLUS loan. 

**Pell Grants**

Though this isn’t a loan, your loans through your FAFSA are likely going to be based around how large of a Pell grant you receive. You don’t need to repay this grant and can get up to $5,815 for the upcoming school year. In reality, you will probably receive far less than the maximum, which is usually reserved for students who come from extremely low income families. If you receive a full ride scholarship of any kind (athletic, academic, essays, etc.) you are not eligible to receive Pell grant funds.

Those are your main federal loan options, but you might be able to find some [state-specific](http://www.collegescholarships.org/loans/state.htm) loan options if those aren’t enough. 

**Private Student Loans**

For some students, private loans need to be taken out to cover the cost of attending college. This is usually because their parents make too much money to be awarded very much in the form of financial aid and their choice of college is relatively expensive. You might find a lot of [graduate level students](http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/09/17/should-you-take-a-private-loan-for-graduate-school/#73f627ff23cf) in this same boat, mainly because government options start drying up once you get your Bachelor’s degree.

**Facts About Private Student Loans**

Student loans from a private lender work in much the same way as a government student loan as far as paying for school goes. However, there are also some major differences.

* **Interest rates can vary widely** - There are some private student loans that have interest rates well below PLUS loans. On the other hand, you could end up with a ridiculous interest rate of over 10%. It all depends on a variety of factors.

* **Your credit score is taken into account** - Public lenders don’t look at your credit score, but they might look at the credit history of your co-signers. Private student loan lenders will usually take your credit score into consideration when deciding whether or not to give you a loan, and what kind of interest rate you’ll get. You can find a good baseline credit score at [Credit Karma](http://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-monitoring-services/creditkarma-com-review/) or [Credit Sesame](http://financeography.com/credit-sesame-review/).

* **You cannot (usually) discharge them in bankruptcy** - Like federal student loans, you won’t be able to get rid of private student loans just because you declare bankruptcy. There are certain conditions that will warrant a discharge, which I will talk about below.

* **There are no cancellation or forgiveness programs** - Going into certain professions with federal student loans gives you the chance to have them forgiven or cancelled. This is 100% **NOT** the case with private student loans. At the end of the day, a private lender is out to make money, cancelling a loan because you became a social worker won’t fly for them.

* **There is no income-based repayment plan** - You’re stuck with your monthly payment whether you make $28,000 a year or $228,000 a year. Private lenders [generally will not adjust your payments](https://studentloanhero.com/private-student-loans/the-problem-with-private-student-loan-repayment-options/) based on your income, unlike federal loans which can fluctuate to match what you can afford.

That’s the gist of the difference between federal and private student loans. Obviously, federal loans are almost always going to be the best option since there is a lot of flexibility around who can qualify for them and repayment plans.

**Repaying Student Loans**

Once you’ve graduated or started going to school as less than a part-time student, you’ll usually have a period of time, between 6-9 months, when you don’t have to repay your student loans. This is called your “grace period” and interest can still build up on the time between graduation and repayment.

In a perfect world, we would all be able to make 10 years (or less) of payments after the grace period ends and be completely student loan free. In reality, some people can afford to put much more than their monthly payment towards their loans while others cannot come close to affording their monthly payment.

**Federal Student Loan Repayment Programs**

Aside from the standard 10 year repayment plan, there are a [few other options](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) which can help with your monthly payments depending on your expenses and how much you make.

* **PAYE Plan** - Pay As You Earn - If your first federal student loan was disbursed after September 30, 2007, you can repay your loans under the PAYE plan. With this, your maximum monthly payment is capped at 10% of your discretionary income ([more on that](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/mobile/repayment/repaymentEstimator.action) here) as long as it’s less than what you would normally repay on a standard 10 year plan. Your repayment schedule will stretch out to 20 years under this plan, but you can still have your loans forgiven under the Teaching/PSLF programs after 5/10 years.

* **REPAYE Plan** - REvised Pay As You Earn - Unlike the PAYE plan that requires you to have a qualifying income, anybody can elect to pay under the REPAYE plan. 10% of your discretionary income would be your maximum monthly payment over a period of 20 years (unless part of the loans were used for graduate studies, then 25 years). As with the PAYE plan, you can qualify for forgiveness after 5 or 10 years if you work in certain professions.

* **ICR Plan** - Income Contingent Repayment - This is the only repayment plan available for PLUS loans, though they must be consolidated first. Payment caps are 20% of your discretionary income or what you would normally pay on a 12 year schedule at a fixed rate based on your income, whichever is lower. Anyone can qualify for an ICR plan and your term will be extended to 25 years. Federal forgiveness/cancellation options are still available once you’ve made the required number of payments/worked for a certain amount of time.

* **IBR Plan** - Income Based Repayment - Similar to the PAYE plan for those who receive their first loan after Sep 30, 2014, your payments are capped at 10% of discretionary income but never any more than what you’d pay under a standard repayment plan. For those who received loans before that date, it’s capped at 15% and no more than a standard repayment amount. Loan terms are 20 years for those starting after Sep 30, 2014 and 25 years for those before that date. As with other plans, you can still have loans forgiven under Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).

**Options When You Cannot Repay**

Federal student loans do have some flexibility when it comes to being unable to make your monthly payments. Some of them only take place in a limited timeframe, other repayment options can extend indefinitely.

* **Deferment** - During a deferment, you don’t have to pay principal or interest on a student loan but the interest does keep racking up. If your loans are subsidized, the government pays the interest during a deferment. There are [several reasons](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/deferment-forbearance) why you can apply for a deferment, but the ones that apply to most people are the economic hardship and inability to find employment deferments, each lasting up to 3 years.

* **Forbearance** - Similar to a deferment, you don’t have to make payments while your loan is in forbearance, but it does still accumulate interest. You can request a forbearance if you otherwise wouldn’t qualify for a deferment, but in many cases it’s up to the lender to decide whether or not to grant it. In some cases, they are required to grant the forbearance, usually if your student loan payment would make up 20% or more of your gross income.

* **Consolidation** - There are times when an unmanageable situation occurs that would be fixed if several loans were consolidated. This often results in a lower monthly payment and a fixed rate, but at the expense of having to repay for a longer period of time. The federal government lets you [consolidate several types of public student loans](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/consolidating-student-loans/) into a new loan, but prohibits you from rolling private loans into your federal consolidation. It’s also possible to get a private consolidation loan that would pay off your federal loans, but you lose all the flexibility you enjoy with federal programs when you do this.

* **Bankruptcy** - Discharging your student loans in a [bankruptcy is possible](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/student-loan-debt-bankruptcy.html) but it doesn’t happen very often. In order to do this you typically have to show that your student loans alone would put you in an untenable financial situation for a long period of time. This means if all of your other debt were wiped out in a bankruptcy, your student loan payment would have to be so high you still wouldn’t be able to support yourself. Few people get their student loans discharged through bankruptcy, those who do are sometimes under unique financial stress.

**Forgiveness and Cancellation**

Some people may be eligible to have their federal student loans forgiven or cancelled. Though there are [many reasons](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation) which can result in the loan completely disappearing, becoming a teacher or entering a public service profession are the two most common ways to receive loan forgiveness. 

Perkins loans are forgiven on a [graduated scale](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts#perkins-loan-cancellation) for public service professionals, sometimes resulting in 100% of the loans being forgiven. Other types of federal loans can be forgiven after 120 on-time regular payments while you are employed in the public service sector. Teachers have a special carve-out that only requires them to work 5 years in a low-income school to qualify for loan forgiveness.

**Overpaying Your Student Loans**

If you think you’re going to be eligible for public service/teacher loan forgiveness programs, it’s usually in your best interest never to overpay your monthly payment. You won’t get credit for the extra money you put into the loan when it’s time to have it forgiven. 

[Student loan debt](http://financeography.com/when-to-start-paying-down-student-loans/) usually accumulates interest at a lower rate than most other types of debt. Pay off things like your credit cards first before trying to knock out student loans. Car loans and mortgages can sometimes have rates higher than your student loans, but paying your student debt faster can free up your monthly payment to go towards these other, sometimes larger loans. It can come down to a personal preference if the interest rates are close to the same.

**TL;DR**

Federal loans are much better than private loans because they offer payment flexibility and forgiveness programs. [Say goodbye to Perkins loans](http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/student-loan-ranger/articles/2016-01-06/explore-what-perkins-loan-program-extension-means-for-students), they are leaving us next year. Fill out the FAFSA as early as you can to get a clear picture of how much you’ll need to borrow. Be smart about how you pay back your loans.

personalfinance,"Spouse and I both have student loans, is possible and a good idea to combine them?","I'm going to keep this somewhat general since this is my main account and it's incredibly tied to the real us.

We've both got student loans, mine about 4 years away from being repaid, and hers about 8 years away. Our financial situation is the best it's ever been, partly thanks to advice here, partly thanks to finally settling into kickass jobs in our fields of interest.

I'm really looking forward to the moment when my loans are paid and we can start throwing that money at her loans, but is that really the best way to go about it? The psychological boost is nice, but at what cost?

* Hers: 50k @ 6.5% paying $700 monthly, target Aug 2024

The plan is to throw that $250 at our highest interest rate debt when it becomes available.

Should I visit credit unions and see who can give me a deal on a loan? Can someone better at math tell me what numbers I'd need to get on a consolidated loan to make it worth it? How do they even work? Do they give me 60k in cash to pay the debt and now I owe them?

personalfinance,"Hit by Hurricane Matthew, should I take out a loan to cover expenses? Not sure what my other options are.","Hi r/personalfinance! First of all, I want to thank this entire sub for being so awesome. I've never seen a post that was anything less than helpful, which is wonderful because most places that discuss finances are pretty discouraging. 

Me? I'm not sure how to afford the next few months. So here's my current situation. I currently don't think I'll be able to pay my rent and other bills for December and January. Rents due on the first, and my boyfriend and I are expected a big check in the first week of January. I've read a lot of other posts on this sub that have said to talk to my landlord about it, but in my lease it talks about what happens when I make late payments. While they can evict, I highly doubt they would, but they do charge a late fee of $66 plus an additional $10 for 15 days after. I already can't afford rent right now. I can't handle an additional $216, or more, depending on how January goes as well. 

I live in an area that was affected by Hurricane Matthew. Put the entire city out of power for a few days. Broke the water mains. Flooded my apartment. One county over is still underwater. All the rivers are 3x their normal size and just flowing as fast as they can, but it's still pretty bad. All in all, I made it out pretty lucky. My apartment fixed the water flooding in my bedroom and there wasn't any damage to my furniture where it came in. I did, however, lose approximately $350 in food from the power outage. I'm a big planner, especially when it comes to meals. I shop by sales. I had at least 60 pounds of meat in my freezer. Restocking my fridge, even just to eat for the next two months, took a huge hit to my budget. 

While my apartment made out fairly lucky, the golf course I work at did not. The course switched management fairly recently, and they had just perfected the irrigation system so that the green was always beautiful. Their estimate was that about 200 trees came down, which is going to call for some huge changes. Huge portions of the course also flooded, which is a much more immediate problem for a golf course. Just to get in back in a place where we can actually open and allow people to go out there, we were closed for two weeks, and I suspect there will be more closings in the near future to work on redoing the irrigation system now that the sunlight on the course is going to be drastically different. Which also means less hours for me. This cut my income for this month in half (at least, considering that I may also lose time for work to be done to the course).

My boyfriend also lost two weeks of work; he works at his university, so he lost the days that the university was closed for. He'll still be getting his regular hours, but we were both out of work for 2 weeks. He'll be getting a huge check (well, huge for us) in the first week of January from his student financial aid and for his research at the university he's also getting paid for, although the timing of which we receive the money from the research is much less predictable. 

In addition to the unexpected expenses (restocking fridge and hotels costs from evacuation) and loss of pay from the hurricane, I also got in a car accident about a month ago and used the money I had set aside for emergencies to handle that. 

I also have some odd and ends fees coming up. I graduated with my bachelors in December and my boyfriend graduates this coming May. We're both applying to graduate school programs, but the applications aren't cheap. On average, the application fee is $80/application. On AVERAGE. Isn't that insane? In addition, each application requires a copy of your transcript from every institution you've received college credits from. Since I took dual-credit in high school, that's 2 $8 fees per app. They also require GRE testing scores sent to their program, which is another $27 per application. So for one school, I'm looking at $123 for one application. I would like to apply to about 5 schools, and my boyfriend is also applying to schools, though I'm not sure how many. For budgeting purposes, let's say we both apply to 5; that's $1,230 total for us together. 

So that's where I am right now. I'm thinking that I'm going to have to take out a loan. I don't know what else I can do, really. I was thinking of going on to Lending Club and trying to take out a loan for $2,500 if I can. My credit is fairly good, especially for someone my age, not that that matters to the credit company, but I would think I shouldn't have any issues getting a loan with decent interest rate. Plus, I intend of paying it off as soon as that big check comes in, but of course, as I have well seen by this post, that not everything goes according to plan. 

I wanted to run this by Reddit first, so thank you in advance for your help and your expanse of knowledge and experience. I cannot express how much I appreciate it, especially when times are tough like this. 


TL;DR: I lost a couple weeks at work and at least a month's worth of food in my fridge due to Hurricane Matthew. I also got in a car accident recently and spent what I had saved for an emergency dealing with that. I have 2 months of rent that I'm not sure I'll be able to pay before a big paycheck comes in, as well as grad school apps. Should I take out a loan?",finance,1477326660

personalfinance,"A few quick questions about prioritizing 401k match, PMI, and student loans with an elderly cosigner.","1) My company has a really good 401k match, which causes me a slight issue. 50% match until you hit $8,000 contribution. Sadly I have a semi-low salary at $41,000, which means I would cap their match at about 19% of my salary. How should I prioritize that with paying off other debts? I'm currently contributing 13%. Should I put that ahead of lower interest debts (described below), keep it where it is currently, or maybe back off a tiny bit to get to the rest of our debts even faster?  I know the math points toward getting match first, but feel like this may be an edge case, in part because of...  
2) Wife has a large-ish private student loan ($36,000 @ 5.1% variable) that we're handling just fine. Payments are about $310/mo, but her grandfather is a cosigner and is not in perfect health. I don't believe he's in any risk of passing away in the next year, but you never know for sure. Due to her entering forbearance after college, her lender has made her permanently ineligible for cosigner release. So if we want to get out from under that, it looks like the only way to go is to refinance and most likely take a higher interest rate, which we will be able to afford just fine. But...  
3) We purchased a house in 2012 through an FHA loan, and have PMI (loan is 3.75% fixed, PMI is a whopping $125/mo) that we should be able to drop in August of 2017 if we make a few more extra payments between now and then (about $8k shy currently), which puts it within reach of we really tighten our belts for the next year.  
So my current plan is this: Leave 401k alone, paying mortgage like crazy, and/or refi and make sure we drop PMI in some way by mid-to-early next year, dropping our house payment by that much. Then refinancing her student loan to get her grandfather's name off of it in case the worst were to happen. Then proceeding with her other smaller (federal and lower interest, no cosigner) loans. Is this an okay plan, am I under or over-thinking it?  
Our only debts are down to student loans and the mortgage thanks to some ynab and self discipline, but these older mistakes from before our financial education are dragging us down a little.

personalfinance,Using a 20K student loan to pay off credit card debt + cushion living expenses?,"Hi all, I'm just looking for a bit of insight/advice on a financial maneuver I'm about to make and would like to sanity check it with you wizards. 

TL;DR - I want to take out a student loan to a) pay off $12K (6.5% APR) of credit card debt, and b) make my life a little less stressful.

Relevant background:

I'm a 5th year graduate student, soon to be all-but-dissertation, in a pretty employable field. I'd estimate 12-18 months left before graduation. Starting salary range is $85K-$120K.

I'm in the midst of a divorce, the terms of which are finalized/agreed on and pretty uncomplicated financially (3 yrs, no kids, no house, no desire to drag a very painful process out). 

I have $24K in student loans from undergrad, currently deferred; and $12K on a low interest (6.5% APR) credit card. 

The credit card debt is from a mix of things, including our wedding, recent lawyer fees (irony...), a major car repair, getting set up in a new apartment, etc. 

I make $24K/year in stipend income plus some miscellaneous money here and there from the odd consulting gig and part time nannying. My expenses and income are not quite balanced,  I'm probably a couple of hundred off/month and eating a little into a rainy day fund I put aside after a consulting project. I am conscientious about money/spending but am also in a place where I am not very invested in doing a dramatic lifestyle change or going crazy frugal because a) I am fairly confident in my job and income prospects and b) the emotional toll of a divorce and graduate school are... significant and consuming. I suppose self care doesn't HAVE to cost money, but it often does, in the form of therapy fees, gym memberships, trips to visit family/friends, etc. 

As a graduate student, I qualify for $20K/year in unsubsidized federal stafford loans at 5.3%. I'm considering taking out the loan amount (this year only) and paying off the credit card in full (and then not using it), and stashing the rest to sort of cushion my income/expense balance issue and get me through the next 12-18 months to graduation and grown up work/salary. 

The difference in interest on the 12K is not that amazing, but student debt is preferable to CC debt in terms of credit score, correct? Maybe its not rational since the APR on the credit card is pretty low, but I also feel sort of guilty and burdened by having such a high credit card balance and think it would feel ""better"" to have that same amount in student loan debt. 

Is this reckless/risky? Anything I need to take into consideration and haven't?",finance,1477338204

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt and Assistance,"I'm currently going through a rough time for the past year or so. I've basically been removed from my prior job as an engineer and have had horrendous luck with employment since a year ago. I've been laid off twice in the past year so far due to the company closing.

Currently, I'm unemployed and am drawing unemployment which is not good at all. I'm looking for employment as an mechanical engineer currently, but I've run into some serious trouble with student loans.

Currently, I've worked with the government to maintain my federal student loans and have those taken care of. My private loans are disastrous right now. They will not work with me and won't help me. I've been making payments that were less than 50% of the monthly payment as I worked my way back into employment, only to be burdened by substantial debt upon getting employed, then getting laid off months down the road while trying to recover.

I've currently got the following student loans:

$1,642.42

$21,327.39

$20,086.63

$17,678.72

$15,922.03

My federal loans total just above $50,000, but I can manage those easily. 

My monthly payments currently are 1% of the total balance which equates to roughly $770. I'd owe $2,220 monthly normally while employed.

I've been getting paid $51,000 a year on average (the cost of living here is very cheap), and that has been an absolute struggle for me. I make about $38,000 after taxes and deductions, so $3,167 a month.

My rent is $400, my utilities total $140. $200 for food a month.

I sold my car to help get additional income to afford these student loans while I worked from home. Now I'm unemployed, don't have a car and am massively in debt. Almost all of my loans are defaulted (outside of the federal ones) and I just have no clue where to go from here.

My credit is shot, so obtaining a loan for a car would be brutal and only add to my list of issues.

I really don't have a good idea of what to do. Once I find full time employment, I'm definitely going to look into doing some freelance work to get a bit more of an income. 

Do you guys have any suggestions? Any tips on how to approach this?

I definitely don't feel like this debt is insurmountable, but it is a massive burden because my parents co-signed on these loans and are now getting letters about it. I am very embarrassed discussing finances with anyone because I know my situation is shit, but I definitely need to start getting help and fast.",finance,1477344199

**Introducing RealEst. Coin - The Easiest Way to Invest BTC into U.S. Real Estate**    

*""Real estate investing, even on a very small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual's cash flow and wealth."" -Robert Kiyosaki*

**Who**    

We are located in the heartbeat of California: Silicon Valley. It is a place where the residents have priced themselves out of the real estate market because they have driven the demand up to exorbitant levels. Our experienced team has a diverse background in real estate, accounting, legal, government, technology, and marketing work. We see what needs to be done or can be done, and we do it. We have the Bay Area passion that is required to succeed in this competitive market. We have identified an enormously advantageous opportunity in the real estate market.
    
**What**
    
We are presenting our RealEst. coin to assist you in creating steady, stable income. It is a great way to get your feet wet for new real estate investors, and offers the wise return strategy that seasoned investors will appreciate. Look at how many businesses around you are chains. Have you ever wondered why?
    
Landlords favor chains because they offer corporate guarantees. For example, if Walgreens signs a 20 year lease with you but their sales slump year after year and they decide to shut their doors after year 7, then Walgreens will continue to pay out the remaining 13 years of the lease. Retail, restaurant, medical, technology, automotive, and office are all industries that typically sign triple net leased deals.

Another benefit of triple net properties is that the tenant pays for the common area maintenance, taxes, and insurance. Yield from single tenant triple leased real estate exceeded that of 10-year U.S. Treasury securities by 467 basis points as of November 2012. That difference has only continued to increase over the last four years.

**When**

RealEst. coin is available now. We plan on completing Phase 1 and purchasing the first round of investment properties in Q4 2016. We will begin paying out RealEst. coin rewards on a monthly basis beginning Q1 2017. The sooner we are able to complete funding then the quicker the rewards will be realized. We are at the perfect cusp of the real estate market to purchase some really wonderful commercial properties at great deals, and the demand from national tenants is at an all-time high. Chains are expanding and they are looking for their next location. We are in the middle of the equilibrium now.

**Why**

Bitcoin has its advantages, but it also has its limitations. For one, the volatility of btc is enough to give you the shivers. Also, the fee that btc exchanges charge is down-right criminal. And remember, btc is not tied to any real asset; if the popularity or support of btc drops then so will the amount in your account. Btc is a wonderful tool in the business world, but should not be one’s only option.

**Closing**

We are excited to get this project off the ground. We know there are many different avenues when it comes to crowdfunding, real estate, and technology; this is the perfect synergy of their benefits. It is easy, fast, secure, and safe. There is an abundance of coin offerings, but do you know what your money is really being invested in? Can you go visit that investment or take pictures of the asset? With RealEst. coin, you would be able to go visit the investment. The asset would have a physical address with a national level tenant.

    *Net Leased Investments with RealEst. Coin*    
    **What are Triple Net Leased Investments?**    
    
Many real estate investors become dissatisfied with the management problems associated with real estate investment ownership. In recent years, more investors are becoming familiar with the ease of owning commercial property occupied by a single credit rated national tenant, using the vehicle of a long term triple net lease (NNN). The advantage of NNN leases is that the tenant is obligated to pay for all expenses associated with the operation of the property including property taxes, maintenance, insurance etc. When a NNN lease is executed with a national credit tenant, the investor can be assured of a management free property with minimal risk. Companies with a net worth of over $1 billion, such as Walgreens, Walmart, O’Reilly, Jack-in-the-Box, Barnes and Noble, Winn-Dixie, 7-Eleven, Inc. and Sherwin Williams, are the typical types of NNN leased investment properties that investors seek. Please watch the following video for more information on NNN leased properties.
    
[Net Leased Investing 101 - Video](https://youtu.be/GV8pybbnOCY)    
    **What are the typical returns from Triple Net Leased Investments?**
    
That depends on how you evaluate your investment. Capitalization Rates are the most common way to evaluate returns (take 1 year’s net income/purchase price). NNN leased investments currently average 5% to 8% capitalization rates depending on credit risk, location and value of the income stream. With the ups and downs of the stock market and the recent turmoil in residential housing, more and more investors are seeking refuge in single tenant NNN leased real estate investments. This increased demand, coupled with low interest rates, has produced favorable cap rates over the past 10 years. Internal rate of return (IRR) is the value of an investment over a period of time. Assuming over a specified period (usually 10 years) of income, appreciation, payment of debt (if any), resale value, cost of resale and discounting the numbers into today’s dollars, IRRs for NNN leased investments are usually 10%-14%. Yield from single tenant NNN leased real estate exceeded that of 10-year U.S. Treasury securities by 467 basis points as of November 2012.

    **What is RealEst. coin?**    

The need for financial technology innovation in the commercial real estate industry is the inspiration behind RealEst. coin. RealEst. coin (REALEST) is an application coin based on the Bitcoin blockchain that can be used to purchase net leased real estate. RealEst. coin becomes an immediate, real world asset because its inherent value is in triple net leased properties acquired through the initial coin offering (ICO). RealEst. coin is vital to commercial real estate investing because its ability to be traded offers tax advantages similar to traditional 1031 Exchanges, but with more flexibility to the investor. Tax deferred real estate exchanges are a cornerstone to financial wealth building and RealEst. coin will help both novice and experienced investors achieve returns that are typically seen by well capitalized institutional funds and REITs. Due to the current legal nature of digital currencies, we must disclose that the use of RealEst. coin is explicitly for entertainment purposes only. The following information is provided to explain the utility of RealEst. coin in regards to real estate. However, professional legal, accounting, and financial advice is recommended before proceeding.

    **Why is RealEst. coin on the Bitcoin blockchain?**    

Bitcoin is the most widely trusted and used digital currency in circulation. In 2012, 1 BTC was trading around $50; as of June 2016, 1 BTC is trading just over $600. This is the market performance since 2012 for comparable investments:

[BTC vs. Comps Performance - Chart](http://www.thelegrandgroup.com/files/Returns%20Growth.png)

Bitcoin is the epitome of how a digital currency expands its ecosystem through real world applications, and as a result increases its intrinsic value. RealEst. coin is positioned to follow, and hopefully surpass, the trajectory of Bitcoin because our application is specific to one use; net leased real estate investing. Real estate investing, whether individually or in a partnership, generally takes a significant amount of capital to acquire a property. Net leased investments offer the highest returns and lowest risk of all commercial real estate asset types. They are typically priced above $1,000,000 and available only to accredited investors who have an income of $200,000 annually or a net worth of at least $1,000,000. This financing requirement creates a higher barrier to entry to net leased property ownership. In comparison, RealEst. coin investors can realize the same long-term, stabilized returns as accredited investors because RealEst. coin eliminates the accreditation requirement and leverages a decentralized crowdfunding ecosystem that offers ownership for as little as $10, the opening price of 1 RealEst. coin.

[CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index](http://www.coindesk.com/price/)    
    **What is the property acquisition criteria for RealEst. coin?**

RealEst. coin targets new and remodeled, stabilized single-tenant net leased properties nationally. Value-add net leased multi-tenant properties in California will also be considered. There is an emphasis on medical, retail, financial services, and automotive tenants in primary metropolitan markets with strong economic demographics. Properties and portfolios will be acquired from developers, asset managers, sale-leasebacks, and brokers. Every acquisition will be announced so that investors know what properties are funded with RealEst. coin. All properties acquired will be insured.

The requirement for first year cap rates is a minimum of 6%. All leases must contain rent escalations and renewal options. For single-tenant acquisitions a minimum of 12 years left on the primary term of the lease is required, with a preference for credit rated tenants that will corporate guarantee the lease. This means that in the event that the store ceases operations locally, their corporate entity is obligated to continue paying rent at the location through the duration of the primary lease term. Financially strong franchisees that operate multiple locations may be considered. For multi-tenant properties there is a preference for at least 9 years left on the primary lease term with renewal options. Properties will typically be held for approximately 8 years and then exchanged for replacement properties. In prevailing cases, the tenancy may be renewed with a long term lease at fair market value which would offer a higher return on investment (ROI) than projected in the following examples. The purpose of this management strategy is to offer diversity, low exposure, and sustainable returns during economic uptick and downturn cycles.

    **How many RealEst. coins will be in circulation?**

There will be 1,000,000 RealEst. coins in circulation initially. Pricing for 1 RealEst. coin will open at .02 BTC or approximately $10 USD as of October, 2016. The second phase will include the release of an additional 1,000,000.    

**How will RealEst. coins be allocated?**

Approximately half of the RealEst. coins raised through the ICO will be used to purchase 1 single tenant net leased property during Q4 2016. The remaining coins will be used to purchase 1 to 2 more net leased properties during Q1 2017. RealEst. coin payouts will be distributed monthly starting with the first lease payment from the first acquisition; this target date is between January 1 and February 1, 2017. RealEst. coin performance will be announced quarterly.

personalfinance,Where do I go to get my own Roth IRA?,"Personal finance noob here.  


Goal -- Lower my adjusted gross income on my Year 2016 taxes.  Retirement aside, I can see a bit farther into next year now, and it might be in my best interest to lower my AGI as much as possible.  I read $5,500/year is the cap.  It might work out for me to dump $5,500 into something like a Roth IRA (Do I want Roth?) before this year ends to make that happen.


My first thought was a bank.  They have CDs, so that made sense.  Someone told me it's stupid to go to a bank for an IRA and that I need a finance person, something like ""Vanguard.""  That's where I left off with it this summer.


So where would go to set something up?  I think it's a Roth IRA I want.  I forget what the Roth part is, but I remember it's better than the plain IRA.


And if I want something that's very straightforward, I don't really want to pay someone much or anything.  I believe a bank would set this up for free (but if they're screwing me over for interest rate, that makes more sense).  What do I search for for an in-person...financial advisor?  What person am I looking for?  (Do they need to be a fiduciary?  I saw the Colbert Report....)


And if I'm looking for something that's very cookie cutter-ish, do I really need a person involved at all?  Is it possible for me to make an account on a financial website and set the thing up myself?  There's Turbotax for taxes.... What would there be for setting up a Roth IRA?   (I don't actually use Turbotax.  Not worth spending money on.  I do my taxes myself.) Is this something like a ""Vanguard Do-It-Yourself here"" website?",finance,1477354333
personalfinance,New Overtime Exempt Changes? $40k/yr - Moving From Salary to Hourly [Employment],"Hey PF,

Thanks in advance for your help. With the new federal overtime laws going into effect in December, I'm going from being a salaried employee ($40k/yr) to an hourly one. Apart from the changes I'm going to face in regards to tracking my hours, and sometimes being told to go home if I risk entering the OT range for a week, I'm curious about what to expect. I know my employer is just following the law by making this transition, but I don't want to end up getting screwed - our HR department can be rather inept at times especially when it comes to paying our current hourly employees.

They will have to offer me a new contract to reflect the change from a yearly salary to an hourly rate, right?  How should the hourly rate be calculated? If I don't work 40hrs one week, will I still receive a ""normal"" paycheck? Basically just what questions should I be asking them to make sure everything is done correctly?

Thanks for your help!",finance,1477354656

personalfinance,"Taxes on an Irrevocable Family Trust Distribution (New York, Florida)","So it's been about a year since my grandparents passed away. The estate has moved its way through the probate court in Florida and it looks like I'll soon be getting my inheritance. The trustee (the bank) is set to distribute an annual unitrust amount to me of about $30,000 as well as a one time payment of $350,000. 

My questions revolve around paying tax on these distributions. 

1) First of all is this entire $380,000 I'm set to receive taxed as regular income on the federal, New York State, and New York City local tax level? If so, do I add my other taxable income to this number and figure out the tax bracket I'm in?

Or...

Is the only amount that is taxable the income that the trust generated over the past year? Meaning, if the trust made $20,000 in investments in 2016, that $20,000 is the only part that is taxable? If so, who holds that tax liability... the trust or me?

2) Would there be any benefit to either me or the trust in splitting up the larger one time payment into two smaller payments – one in December 2016 and one in January 2017?

I will of course be consulting a accountant prior to filing my 2016 taxes, but I just wanted to prepare myself mentally for what's to come. Thanks for your help and guidance in advance.",finance,1477362218
personalfinance,Questions about closing a credit card,"Hello! I am in the midst of trying to build credit and I have a few questions.

752 credit score - updated today 
8,500 total line of credit 
9% credit utilization 
100% on time payments
One personal loan of 1900 dollars issued last month.

- I have a year and a half old BoFA card
- Opened a banana republic card March 2016
- Opened a travel card since a travel a ton June 2016 
-Opened a Macy's Card 3 days ago.

*Are the cards being opened so close together something that can negatively impact me?*

I recently was allured into said Macy's card which may be useful during holiday shopping I guess (Black Friday whaddup), but I'm not crazy about store cards given their insane interest rates. I do not need any more cards as a 25 year old and won't be opening anymore.

--

Can I safely cancel the Banana Republic card opened in March 2016 without a negative impact on my credit score? The new Macy's card which is still processing has a higher credit limit of 6,500 vs the 4,800 of the Banana Card which may offset the ill effects of cancelling the other card? Am I understanding that correctly

I am in no other debt. No student loans, no car payments, nada.

TL;DR: Was opening 3 cards in March 2016, June 2016 and October of 2016 something that can negatively impact me? Can I close an 8 month old card without it negatively impacting my score or should I just keep it with minimal use. Last I checked my score was 752.",finance,1477363299
personalfinance,Received 28K gift for student loan repay - Paying principle now vs invest and pay later?,"Ok. Question re: loan repayment strategies. Here's my situation....

I just graduated from grad school in the health care field with $120k in federal student loans. Avg interest 6.6%.Current income about $63000 before tax. 

I also recently received a generous 28K gift from family for paying down loans.  

I am planning on beginning on PAYE plan, which would result in loan forgiveness in 20 years (with amount taxed). While I currently work at a not for profit hospital - I am not sure if I will be able to stay at one for the 10 years to qualify for PSLF

My issue comes down to this...If I think I will follow the PAYE plan out to 20 years. Would I be better off starting an emergency fund and investing the rest of the gift money for 20 years...planning for that large tax bill at the end. 
Or do I pay the a portion of the 28k now for a slightly decreased tax bill at the end. Seems to me I should only pay on principle now if I am going to be more aggressive and try to pay down before the 20 yr mark.

personalfinance,"to consolidate or not to consolidate, that is the question ($45k in debt, payments getting too high, help!)","quick background: 25, living at home, working semi-decent job making around $30k/year after taxes. 

i have approx $45,000 in student loans left to pay and i'm debating whether or not to consolidate them, mostly to lower my monthly payment because it's getting to be more and more overwhelming. i've managed to handle it for a few years now, but it's starting to really wear on me. (btw, i totally understand that i am by no means in the worst situation and that so many people are way worse off, but i'm still struggling :(  

it's a mix of private (approx $30,000 with an interest rate of 5.5%) and federal (approx $15,000 combined with interest rates between 3.5%-4.6%). my payments aren't astronomical (a little under $900/month) compared to what i've heard other people pay, but i'm paying almost half of what i make each month toward loans. add that to car payments, insurance, phone bill, and other necessities (like groceries) and i'm barely getting by. my parents had cosigned on the loans with me originally but are offering virtually no help in paying them down. i've also asked about options for changing my payment for my private loans, but i'm apparently not eligible for any kind of altered payment plan short of deferment. 

i put in a few applications to see what's available and i've either been rejected outright or offered an interest rate double what i'm paying now with a monthly payment that'll maybe save me $100, which almost doesn't seem worth the effort?

part of me is resigned to the fact that i'm going to be paying these things down for a long time, so i might as well just bite the bullet and take an extended term with a jacked up interest rate to save some money in the short run, but another part of me is wondering if i should just suck it up and keep chipping away at them even if it means not being able to move out of my parents' house until i've paid them off (which, according to my current plan, would be when i'm about 32) 

i've been looking for other jobs with a bit of a higher salary to make a bigger dent in what i owe, but pretty much anything would require a masters degree, which could cost me another $20-$40k depending on the program, at least the ones that i've looked into. i'm not too keen on taking on more debt until i pay a bigger chunk of what i owe down, but it is something i'd consider doing...

thoughts? advice? anything would be greatly appreciated!",finance,1477366278
personalfinance,Book renter debt,"Hi. So my first semester at college I rented text books from valorebooks and book renter which I think are owned by the same company. The semester ended and when it was time to return the books I printed off the prepaid return sticker and sent my books on their way back to book renters/ valore books. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks and I'm getting emails from them saying I owe money because I never returned the books. Complete and utter bullshit. 
They began to take money out of my account unauthorized and I got Wells Fargo to reimburse me and to keep them from doing that. 

I think it's been about two years going on three years since then I'm not entirely certain. 

A couple days ago I get a letter from fedchex trying to collect a debt from bookrenters and I'm like here we go again with this bullshit. 

My question, I have a letter asking for them to validate the debt typed up and ready to go but bearing in mind SOL would I be better off doing nothing or sending the letter? If I send the letter is that restarting the 3 year sol period? 

is it more risky to do nothing and let the debt validate itself within 30 days or should I send the letter? 

I have no intentions of paying this as I don't owe shit. So would it hurt to ignore this letter and run out the clock? 


Also, if book renters was taking money from my account before I got Wells Fargo to cut them off, then haven't they already gotten the money for said ""debt?"" 
Did Wells Fargo take the money back from book renter and put it back in my account or did Wells Fargo just reimburse me with their own funds?",finance,1477367009
personalfinance,Reading the loans repayment post and I have some questions regarding my situation,"Hi Reddit,
I was reading the great post on the front page about student loans and wondered how the situation applies to me. I'm 30, married with a baby girl. I'm lucky to have a salary around $350,000 that I will start earning in a few months. I've got around $190,000 in loans, and have been making ICR for the last 4 years since I finished school. Since my salary was actually quite low since graduation, I've basically been paying ~$600 a month with ICR so my total loan amount hasn't changed much since graduation.

Next year I will max out 401k and maybe put some in a Roth IRA and put some away for retirement and emergency fund. I still should have a decent amount of money left over and I wanted to know what to do with it? My wife and I aren't overly frugal; our monthly bills with my current salary is around $8000. Hopefully, we can maintain this level of spending once I get the raise.

My questions:

1. should i refinance my loans into private loans, provided my salary stays constant for the next 10 years for the lower interest rate? I'm in a for-profit company already.

2. should I try to pay down my loans as quickly as possible? I did some calculation on the matter and even with 4% interest, I'd save ~$5000 if I pay back all my loans in 3 years vs 5 years.

3. Or would you spread out some of my income, look to invest in stocks/real estate? I don't own a house, and I don't plan to doing so for the next 3 years as my location may be a bit mobile for a while.

4. How does retirement planning work for higher earners? Do I still need to save 20% of 350k per year, assuming I haven't saved any in the past? That seems a bit excessive.

I feel pretty lost with personal finance, am headed towards a salary that I have no idea what to with, and would like some advice. Thanks for reading!",finance,1477367499

Hi, Reddit! We’re advocates and content experts from Living Beyond Breast Cancer and Male Breast Cancer Coalition, joined today by Scott M Weissman, MS, CGC, of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.

We recognize the unique issues faced by men diagnosed with breast cancer. We will answer your questions about breast cancer in men, including:

* What it’s like to be diagnosed with what is usually considered a “woman’s disease”
* The role of genetics and family risk
* Ways to get emotional support and resources that help you cope with diagnosis and treatment

**Living Beyond Breast Cancer:** For over 25 years Living Beyond Breast Cancer (LBBC) has been helping women and men who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and the people who love them. We work with leading experts in the medical and wellness fields to provide trusted and easy-to-understand information to help people make informed decisions. We bring people together from across the country and beyond through our national conferences, monthly webinars and signature yoga fundraiser Reach &amp; Raise. Learn more at LBBC.ORG. With you, for you.

**Male Breast Cancer Coalition:** The Male Breast Cancer Coalition, a not-for-profit patient advocacy organization, brings everyone together to educate the world about male breast cancer. We are on a mission to build awareness through the wisdom and experiences of survivors. We visit high schools and colleges around the country sharing journeys and educating audiences. We participate in events around the world and attend conferences, so we can become more knowledgeable and advocate. We want people to be informed. Breast cancer does not discriminate and we want everyone to know “Men Have Breasts Too.”
  
Learn more about our advocates and experts answering your questions:

**Lori M. Berlin:** I volunteer with the Male Breast Cancer Coalition because I lost a male cousin to triple negative metastatic breast cancer, and he saved my life. If it was not for Bernard, who was negative for a BRCA mutation, my genetic counselor would not have run any tests on me. I am BRCA2 positive, and because of a previous high risk LCIS diagnosis, I opted for a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and oophorectomy. Good thing, because the pathology indicated I was going to get breast cancer in both breasts. Now I raise awareness of breast cancer in men every single day.

**Josh Fernandez:** I am Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s Digital Media Specialist, playing a primary role in coordinating and growing the organization’s online presence informed by the organization’s marketing strategy, employing web analytics, social media messaging and e-communications. I also manage LBBC’s presence across online channels, including but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and our award-winning blog. I started working for LBBC in 2012 as a writer and web content coordinator.

**Erin Rowley:** I am Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s Writer and Content Coordinator, serving as author of select LBBC publications and coordinating publication reprints, photo shoots and our Ask-the-Expert program in support of the mission, programs and services of LBBC. I also write medical, psychosocial and promotional articles and blog posts for online and print publications. 

**Scott M. Weissman, MS, CGC:** I am a past co-chair of the National Society of Genetic Counselors Familial Cancer Risk Assessment Special Interest Group and a cancer genetics expert. As founder of Chicago Genetic Consultants, LLC (chicagogenetics.com), I bring the science of genetics and genetic testing directly to people who desire genetic counseling. I have more than 15 years of experience, and understand all aspects of the genetic counseling and testing journey. I can discuss everything from the decision to seek advice, the pros and cons of genetic testing, how genetic information can impact an individual and their family, and issues related to insurance coverage, privacy and discrimination concerns. I can also discuss hereditary cancer syndromes and how to educate family members about the potential risk of disease. 

**Carl “Mac” Holmes Jr.:** I spent my career in aviation, first  serving for 27 years in the United States Air Force as an enlisted jet mechanic and crew chief and then as a commissioned officer and Air Force Pilot. I flew T37, T38, C-130 and C-141 aircraft and served as Chief of Training, Chief of Plans, Instructor/Evaluator and Command Pilot before becoming Squadron Commander of the 155 Air Lift Squadron. I retired from the U.S. Air Force in 2001 as a Lt. Colonel.  My second career as Aircraft Captain for Federal Express began while I was serving in the U.S. Air Force Reserves. In my capacity with Federal Express, I served as an instructor, evaluator and line check airman for the company and was an FAA designee before my diagnosis of Metastatic Breast Cancer. I faced early stage breast cancer in 2012 and prostate cancer in 2013. After successfully completing treatments I returned to work. During a regular checkup my physician discovered my breast cancer had returned. Now facing the realities of living with metastatic breast cancer I decided to take on a new mission. I now work closely with the Male Breast Cancer Coalition to raise awareness of male breast cancer, metastatic disease and the need for additional research funding.  I am a graduate from Living Beyond Breast Cancer’s “Hear My Voice” Program and have been selected by the U.S. Department of Defense as a peer grant reviewer for the Breast Cancer Research Program, a program that supports innovative, high-impact breast cancer research.  I also serve on the MET UP advisory council and represents disparities in metastatic breast cancer.     

**Bill Harris:** I was diagnosed with early-stage (ductal carcinoma in situ, or stage 0) estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in June 2012. Five weeks after noticing the blood spot on my t-shirt, my surgeon performed a modified radical right mastectomy, including lymph nodes and the nipple. I learned that I had tested positive for a BRCA2 mutation, which led my family to seek genetic testing. I am very thankful for the support I received from my friends and family, especially my wife and son. I know the challenges faced by men with breast cancer, and as a brother of the Male Breast Cancer Coalition, I'm thrilled to offer support and insight to help other men diagnosed with this disease.",technology,1477395293
gaming,all time most memorable RPG,"As the title implies, Im wondering what every ones most memorable RPG is.

I dont necessarily mean the best RPG you've ever played, I simply mean the one that left the most long lasting impression on you. include an introduction of the game, a small description of the game in your own words (cuz thats the fun of it) and a description as to why it left such a long lasting memory.

to set a decent example:

My most memorable RPG that left the longest and strongest impression on me would deffinately have to be Crono Cross on the PS1

when i first played it, I had never played its predecessor Crono Trigger released on the Super Nintendo, luckily the story-lines don't exactly intermingle but the same concept is there, time travel.

Crono Cross was the story of a young blue haired boy named Serge  and his adventures through time and space. The main plot in the game is that Serge discovers a portal on a beach to an alternate dimension, in this dimension he discovers that he had drowned ten years prior and people in his village may only vaguely remember him if at all. 

This game left such a lasting impression on my childhood because it inspired my creativity in such a way that I would think about the world that Serge lived in while I was in school. I was in 9th grade at the time, a freshman in high school. As a freshman I had little to no friends as this was a whole new experience for me, so video games were my escape. They engulfed my mind most of the time at that age. With all this creativity flowing through me all the time I decided one day in study hall that I'd write it down, out of boredom at first. I started by drawing a map of a random continent and created mountains and rivers, which eventually lead to creating tribes of people, I then created my own language that they would speak. I ended up writing story lines of war, peace, and love based on these people and their languages. I eventually had  20+ pages of either information on the people or basic stories. It was my most massive creation from my imagination I'd ever created in my whole life... All due to the inspiration from Crono Cross.",technology,1477398182

While I am enrolled in classes I do not have to pay off my loans, which are all federal loans... I think. 

To be more specific I make less than $20k/year from my research appointment, and periodically make a few hundred from playing shows with a band I am in, totaling maybe $5-7k/year, split between transportation, repairing/replacing/upgrading gear, and personal fund for stuff like entertainment, travel, etc. 

I rent a house with a couple other guys, and I would estimate my monthly costs to be around $1200/month for rent, food, phone, utilities, insurance, etc... This leaves me with about $300-$400/month that I just kind of let sit in a checking account. This account got drained completely this winter when I replaced my absolute junker of a car.

We owe approximately 40k on our primary residence.

Husband says we should spend the bulk of the money on the mortgage, because it is costing us approximately $140 a month in interest, and the credit cards are costing us only about $82.50 a month.

I've been taught to always pay down either the smallest amount and snowball payments, or pay off the higher interest rate first. Which would mean we should pay off the credit card at 11% before our mortgage which I think is just below 4%. 

We're currently putting $2000 a month toward principal on the mortgage, and 500 a month toward the credit card.

I see his point. But I think we could pay off the credit card pretty fast, and then put the entire amount toward the mortgage.

LOTS. We had some financial struggles in the past, made stupid decisions while young, and are now finally focused and determined to get out of debt. We each had four credit cards before marriage, so combined, we have 8 debts to pay off. Please no lectures on how bad of a situation this is and how stupid we are - we've fully analyzed and discussed the situation and have made sure to take the steps necessary so that we don't get ourselves back into debt like this again.

Here is a list of our current credit card debts. I've just labeled then with letters, instead of bank names, to make it a bit cleaner to read:

* A: $1951.57 at 28.99%, min payment: $64
* B:   $741.21 at 26.99%, min payment: $25
* C: $9743.10 at 20.50%, min payment: $277
* D: $4958.88 at 16.24%, min payment: $116
* E:  $4276.37 at 12.40%, min payment: $88
* F:  $2456.99 at 10.15%, min payment: $46
* G: $3653.03 at 2.30%, min payment: $95
* H: $4345.00 at 0.00%, min payment: $65 (No interest until May, 2017)

We'd like to follow the avalanche method of paying off debt, focusing on the larger interest rates first. I know that this is financially the best way to do it and saves you the most money in the long run. We also have the focus/persistence to be able to do this without getting discouraged (I'm a YNAB addict). This would mean we pay off debt A, then B, then C, and so forth down the list. While this concept makes sense to us, we're wondering if we should start with debt C, because it is such a higher balance. That debt accumulates approximates $165 of interest every month, compared to $16 on debt A and even less on debt B.

So our question is - is it best financially to pay in order of interest rate, regardless of balance? Or should we factor in high vs. low balances when deciding what order to pay these off in? We have about $1500/month we can put towards debt on a normal month, plus more on the months we get our bonuses and such.",finance,1477417810

I am coming to r/personalfinance for advice and help with my student loan debt as I have nobody else that would be able to give me any valid or applicable advice to my situation. I will preface by saying that I was unaware of anything with my loans until graduating. My parents pushed me to go to college after high school and had me take out private loans for my first two years. I then did the federal PLUS loans for my remaining three years. I am now graduate and have a job that makes 40,000 dollars a year.

I wanted to consolidate all of my loans into one and then apply for income based payments and pay roughly 15% of each paycheck into my loans. That being said, it doesn't appear possible. Given that I have private loans, government loans, and PLUS loans that my parents cosigned on it seems I am unable to consolidate. I have over 100,000 dollars in student loan debt as my parents provided me with no assistance and FAFSA gave me nothing as a result of my parent's wages. The main issue is that what these private loans are expecting for monthly payments are wildly out of my price range to the point where I will default the very first month I am due for repayment.

With my story and information out there, I turn to r/personalfinance and ask for your advice as to what my best option is. Every person in my life told me that college was my next and ONLY step after high school if I wanted to be successful. Nobody ever talked to me about other options, especially if you lacked the funding and/or finances. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about my loans and I'm terrified of my future. I have a good job with lots of room for growth, advancement, and increase in pay over time. But I can't help but still be nervous.

I've already moved into a cheaper apartment, I do not have a car, I have no real savings, I spend about $50 a week on groceries, bring my lunch nearly everyday, I only drink one day on the weekend, and I go out to eat maybe twice a month ($150 on food, groceries, going out for the first two weeks of the month, and $200 for the last two weeks of the month). I stopped smoking cigarettes, I stopped drinking coffee, I have a part time job where I get about 8 hrs extra work on Saturdays on top of my 9-6 job M-F.

My rent is about $975 after utilities. My student loan payments are already at $380 (not covering the interest per month cost on the federal student loan) + $150 + $55 + 40 + 138 = $763 in total. I pay $433, out-of-pocket for insurance (soon to be $567 in 2017) because my job doesn't offer benefits (no 401K, no Roth IRA, no health insurance). I have $100 in savings. I have about $60 a month in automatic debits (spotify, identity guard, gym). I take home $1,700 every two weeks because I claim 2 deductions on my taxes (which also means I either break even or receive about $600-900 during tax refund season).

After all is said and done, I have about $400 a month (usually less) to spend on things which usually go toward buying extra groceries so I'm not starving, buying household items, or, most recently, shoes because they had holes in them. Sometimes I spend $35 on a manicure, but lately that hasn't been an option for me.

How can I pay more toward my principal loan amounts? How can I get my head about water instead of just barely breathing? How can I make it work?!

personalfinance,"Graduated: new job, new to real life, and want to run some stuff by you all","Hey all,

I'm a 26 year old Canadian living in the States. 

So aside from whatever may be intuitive, I don't really know much about personal finance. Grew up in a pretty poor family where ""personal finance goals"" meant somehow making minimum payments on maxed out credit cards, so not much in the way of absorbing proper habits while growing up. 

Anyway, in a quest to turn that around, I went to a few expensive schools and built up a ton of debt. But now I have a job that should allow me to handle that -- something for which I'm very grateful. It's made a bit more complicated by the fact that my debt straddles two countries.

My living situation.

LOANS IN USD (all private):

- 18.5k @ 6.75%

- 1.4k @ 6.75%

- 17.3k @ 6.75%

- 17.5k @ 6.75%

- 80.5k @ 6%

- 1.2k @ 5%

- 14.3k @ 5%

- Consumer debt: 4k


LOANS IN CAD:

- 70k CAD @ 3.7% (on 80k line of credit)

- 43k CAD @ 4.4% (public loan)

- Consumer debt: 0



Rent = 1.8k/month (NYC, but roommates) 

Income = 180k USD pre-tax


Generally this seems pretty straightforward -- pay off the high-interest first (maybe knock out the few tiny loans to get them out of the way?). Also, maybe refinance to get lower rates on all the 6%+ loans. But, I just had a few complicating factors I wanted to run by you all:

*Complicating factors*

-I can't refinance my US loans in the US because I'm not a citizen or permanent resident

-My job security is pretty good for 2-4 years but after that it's typical for people to leave and end up taking lower-paying work, so I should probably focus on eliminating this debt pronto before I end up in a job where I can't maintain minimums

-When I do leave my job, I'll probably end up back in Canada. The pay there is much lower nominally and also is in Canadian dollars (so, double-problem there).

-My income is in USD --- while the Canadian dollar is deflated relative the US dollar, maybe it's prudent to throw a ton of money cross-border? Or do you think that's irrelevant and I should just focus on the loans in order of interest rate? 

-Should I take the time to build up an emergency fund or just pay down the line of credit? The line is revolving and could probably save me in a pinch if I needed emergency funds, but lines of credit are always a bit uncertain...But if I want to refinance my Canadian loans down the line, I imagine I could secure a better interest rate if I owe less on my revolving line since its high balance impacting my credit score currently. 

-If I do save up an emergency fund, I don't know what is even a proper amount. People say 6 months living expenses, but given rent+loan maintenance+cost of living, we're talking like a 30k emergency fund for 6 months. That feels like money that might be better spent being applied to a loan?

-Retirement savings -- maybe I should be plopping some money into retirement savings? My work doesn't match 401k contributions and I'm not sure if I'll stay in the US indefinitely so I imagine a pretax 401k isn't exactly what I should be aiming for. But maybe I should? I don't know.

-Almost all my loans are variable rates. It feels like they're much more likely to go up over time than down...So these interest rates are likely going to get worse as times goes on.

- The USD loans are all covered by a pretty decent repayment assistance program if I happen to fall into a lower income bracket, whereby my alma mater makes partial payments on my behalf 

**MY PLAN**

So that all brings me to my plan -- if there are any big red flags here, or if you think I'm making a horrible decision somewhere, I'd love all your helpful advice.

Order of priority with extra $$ while making minimum payments on loans:

- Pay off consumer debt

- Save up 10k emergency fund

- Pay off the 1.4k and 1.2k loan

- Pay down that line of credit until I have ~40k open (so it's only half-maxed)

- Pay off Canadian loans whenever the dollar drops below 80 cents ( or 75 cents maybe?)

- Otherwise, pay off US loans in reverse-order of interest rate

- Basically just don't worry about retirement savings right now?",finance,1477424065

Rent: $1500 / mo
Car:  $600 / mo (will explain why later)
Insurance: $220 / mo
Utilities: $150 / mo
TV and Internet: $200 / mo
Other expenses (food and gas and dog food etc.) Around $400 / mo

All are rounded to the highest possible amount .

I work at a pharmacy and make about $350 a week. (Depending on hours worked.)

My SO works retail and makes about $600 a week.

A little background, I have pretty severe Crohns disease and sometimes have to take days off work or leave early or get in late so I don't have consistent hours a week.  I get in most of the time and $400 a week is average. 

My car was an unexpected expense.  While me and my SO were attempting to build credit, my car broke down and we didn't have a lot to put down, and since our credit scores hovered around 470 at the time, our interest rate is about 18%.  I know it's stupid high but it was the only way to get a car.  I plan on refinancing with a larger down after about a year of good payments and my credit raises.

personalfinance,Planning to use half of windfall to pay off high-interest student loan...What to do with the other half?,"Hello,

Recently, I came into about $12,000 due to my mom being qualified for social security disability benefits, and I was able to get a payout due to being her child. I've been trying to figure out what to do with this money. Here's some background:

I'm a 19 year old sophomore in college and I take out federal loans to help pay for it. Unfortunately last year, I couldn't afford to pay so I had to take out $6,000 from Sallie Mae with a cosigner at 12.375% interest. I've been paying $25/month since then and have accumulated about $350 of interest already. 

Although I do have federal loans, I really would like to knock the private loan out because I would end up paying $13,000 by time I finish paying it off. 

So my questions are: would it be a good idea to use half the windfall to erase the private loan? Also, what should I do with the remaining money? I don't know much about stocks and investing and have been studying savings accounts for a while. I am considering using an online bank like Ally because of the higher interest rates, but I don't know if I should go for IRA, regular savings, or CD, nor do I know how much to put into savings. 

Any advice would be helpful! Thank you.

personalfinance,Relative gifting money to payoff student loan that's not due. Tax help?,"Hi Everyone,

What is the procedure for someone else paying off your student loan debt if that loan is not due? I do not wish my grandmother (or myself) to incur any extra taxes if she ""gifts"" me the money. 

I have not graduated from graduate school yet, so the loan is not due. I have been paying off smaller amounts with higher interest rates since I started graduate school with my part time jobs, but now I'm looking at a large unsubsidized loan of around $16k, interest at 6.21%. This $16k loan is the largest loan I have currently. Once I get that one paid, over a third of my loan debt is gone. 

I would like to ask her for the gift to pay off the debt, and I would be happy to pay her back for the gift like a loan if I needed to. In the long run, it should save me over $5k over the life of the loan if I'm running my math correctly. 

What is the rule on another person paying my loan off early like this? Does it count as a gift? I know that paying off a student loan early does reflect on my taxes next year. Should I accept a smaller amount from her, like $10k, and then just wait till next calendar year to finish off the loan so I'm not getting the two of us nixed by gift taxes?

Any advice is wonderful! Thank you!

I'm entering a field where 85% are salaried. I've been offered a ""hourly"" position (I've confirmed that it is truly hourly and not just a salaried position being quoted in hourly.)

* $38.72/hour, at 2080 hours/year. For someone working 1-4 years in this industry in my region, this is probably around 80th percentile.
* When it comes to clocking in and out, there was an exception for the person who had the job before me.
* The statement of work prohibits more than 160 hours per 4 weeks.
* Could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'd be non-exempt, which is why they don't want me working more than 40 hours.
* General employee benefits listed on the website include medical, dental, vision, life, and accidental death &amp; dismemberment insurance, an employee assistance program, and a 401K. If you waive the benefits, an additional $4/hour (I think) goes into the 401K. (I need to check whether all of those benefits apply to this job.)
* 10 hours of PTO accrued every 80 hours worked, plus 10 paid federal holidays.

As far as I can tell by my conversations with the person who had the job before me (they asked her to talk to me because they admittedly don't know much about what people in my field do, they're just in a contract where they need to provide one,) and the recruiter, the main drawbacks to this job are the location and that it's hourly. The only personal drawback is that I don't graduate until May (they are aware of this,) and it's a bit early for decisions on jobs. That's why I want to be sure.

It sounds like a very good job (high salary, lots of time off, 40 hour work week,) but am I missing anything important? I'm sorry if any of this sounds like a no-brainer, but I've really got no experience with this, so if it is, I want to hear from other people that it is.

solar,Comparing quotes,"So I'm new to solar and have been talking to a few companies. One gave me a quote of $19,500 for a 4.578 kW system that consists of a whole Sunpower package (14 panels, inverter, etc) that comes with a 25 year warranty that includes shipping and labor. I think the warranty is for the panels and the inverter too.

The other one gave me a quote of $14,600 for a 5 kW system using 15 SunEdison panels, and a Solaredge inverter and monitor. The panels have a 10 year warranty, and the inverter a 12 year warranty. 

In my area we get a $1000/kW rebate according to system size, and a 30% federal tax income credit and a 25% state tax income credit. So the difference in cost between the two options/companies after all discounts and everything would probably end up being $2500 or so. Is the cheaper but higher output system the best pick, or is it worth paying more for the Sunpower stuff with the better warranty even though it's a little bit smaller power system? 

Thanks!

Edit: So the company offering the SunEdison panels came out today and measured the roof and everything and found out they could fit more panels than originally thought on the sunny side of our roof.

I ended up with a 6.7kW system planned for just barely over $20k (about $2.90/W) with an extended warranty on the inverter (with the inverter warranty, it made it go to about $2.99/W I believe). After rebate and tax incentives it should be about $2300 cost out of pocket eventually. This system should cover most of our power usage. We're really happy how it turned out.",energy,1477468088

personalfinance,(USA/UK) What's the best way to handle this debt situation?,"Hi! I have a confusing transatlantic dilemma and was hoping someone might have some insight for me. The situation is thus:

My husband and I live in the UK. We earn a little over £45K (currently ~$55K) annually before [taxes](https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates). We live within our means, keep a detailed budget, save a little every month, and allow ourselves one or two small luxuries (no big ones). But.

My husband has about $65K in student loan debt from a four-year degree in the United States. It's our only debt. It was loaned to him by American companies, we make payments in American dollars, and the part we need to worry about right now is a mix of 5 federal and 4 private loans. Interest rates are *ridiculous* (numbers added and rounded for ease of use):

- Federal (see note): $7500 at 7%, $12500 at 6%, 
- Private: $7500 at 11.5%, $11500 at 6%, $14000 at 3.5%

(Note) Currently in temporary forbearance, which I *think* means they still accumulate interest but we don't make payments at the moment. We pay on the private loans because there's no such thing as forbearance.


We know these are terrible loans. (He didn't have a choice; it was take them or leave university.) But what's the best way to tackle them? Should we stop saving altogether and just pay the loans down in order of interest? Should we establish a nest egg of a certain amount and then start paying them down? Should we attempt to consolidate by getting a loan from a UK bank to pay them all off (I have *no* idea how feasible this would be)? Is there something I haven't thought of? Do these interest rates mean we shouldn't even consider saving for other things (e.g., retirement) until this debt is gone?

Corollary: is there any way to reduce this debt burden other than straight-up paying them off piece by piece? I ask because we're in a relatively high cost-of-living area and, although we're good at saving, it will take *ages* before we're able to accumulate $65K - especially if the exchange rate (GBP to USD) keeps plummeting...",finance,1477481859

&gt; Blockstream will struggle because off-chain solutions are not Bitcoin - they are inefficient and add a middleman layer, but do nothing to scale. They just offer a trade-off - for lower costs, you can either lock your funds, or use a centralized hub. Alternatively, you can have instant payments at high fees, or have a shitty time and not use a hub. Off-chain solutions don't improve Bitcoin, they just change its economics. 

&gt; Their magical ""off-chain layer 2 solutions"" were just buzzwords sold to investors as blockchain hype was blowing up. Austin Hill sold some story, rounded up some devs, and figured he could monopolize Bitcoin. Perhaps he saw Blockstream as ""the Apple of Unix"" - bringing an open-source nerdy tech to the masses at stupid product margins. But it doesn't look like anyone did 5 minutes of due diligence to realize this is absolutely moronic.

&gt; So first Blockstream was a sidechain company, now it's an LN company, and if SegWit (Segregated Witness) doesn't pass, they'll have no legitimate product to show for it. Blockstream was able to stop development of a free market ecosystem to make a competitive wedge for their product, but then they never figured out how to build the product!

&gt; Now after pivoting twice, Austin Hill is out and Adam Back has been instated CEO. I would bet he is under some serious pressure to deliver anything at all, and SegWit is all they have, mediocre as it is - and now it might not even activate. It certainly doesn't monetize, even if it activates. 

&gt; So no matter what, Blockstream has never generated revenue from a product.

&gt; Now, VC guys may be amoral - but they're not stupid. The claims of ""AXA bankster conspiracy"" are ridiculous - VCs don't give a shit about ideology, but they do need to make money. These are just VC investors who saw an undeveloped marketplace ripe to acquire assets in and start stomping around. But they're not on a political mission to destroy Bitcoin - they're just trying to make a bunch of money. And you can't make any money without a product, no matter how much effort you spend suppressing your competitors. 

&gt; So I think with 3 years and $75MM down the drain with nothing to show for it, Blockstream doesn't have much time left. We'll see what happens to the high-risk, overvalued tech VC market when the equity bubble pops. Interest rates just need to move a bit to remove credit from the economy - and therefore the fuel for these random inflated tech companies doing nothing. Once US interest rates get closer to equilibrium, companies like Blockstream are going to have some explaining to do.",cryptocurrency,1477486674
personalfinance,28 y.o. and trying to figure out how best to pay off debt/save for retirement.,"Hi everyone! I’m looking for some financial advice.  I’m hoping to figure out the best way to save/pay down debt.  For a little background on my financial situation: I am 28 years old and I have around $40K in student loan debt.  These are currently all Federal Loans that are between 6-7% interest.  I have a loan on a townhouse, which is currently for $128K.  This loan is split between two loans—one loan for $25K has an interest rate of 4.125% and $103K has an interest rate of 3.1%.  

Currently, I have a tenant living in my townhouse and the rent she pays covers the both mortgage payments as well as the association fees ($150/month) but I’m not making any money off her.  I have never been a good saver. I tend to just “short-term save” for a vacation, or something I want to buy.  I don’t carry any credit card debt, but I also don’t have much of a savings account.  

However, now that I have a tenant in my house I live rent free, so I am finding myself in a little bit better of a financial situation.  I’m wondering what the best course of action is with my money each month.  I can probably save around $2000 after normal living expenses.  I was planning on putting most of this towards my student loans--still wanting to travel during holidays, so it wouldn’t be the complete $2000 each month.  But I’m wondering if this is the best thing to do?  OR, should I work on paying down the smaller mortgage loan, which is at a higher percentage, OR should I be putting money into some sort of retirement fund?  Currently I’m not contributing anything to retirement.  I think I have about $17K in an old retirement fund I was formerly contributing to. 

Please, wiser money people than me, tell me what you think I should do!",finance,1477487420
personalfinance,Student loan company is calling us daily. No way of making payments: not sure if they'll ever be paid off.,"First of all, I'm stressed, I'm tired, and I'm not here for a lecture on what path I chose or what money I wasted or what decisions were made or where I could have been. This sub likes to scold people for high student loan debt all the time, and I'm really not here for that. I beat myself up over it every day - I don't need another 30 people adding to it.

Budget:

Monthy Income: 1438
Gas: $100
Food: $130
Phone: $115
Rent: $500
Therapy: $100

$80k in student loans. $20k are federal, at $250 per month on the income based repayment plan. The other $60k are Sallie Mae, at over $800 per month.

Federal loans will probably be doable once I get a new job (which is also in the works, as many of you have told me to do). Sallie Mae loans? I laugh every time they call. I will never in my life make enough to pay almost $1000 per month along with rent and food. The loans were all for a journalism degree that I thought would make me some money, but after two years out of college and no journalism or media related job whatsoever has given me any kind of callback, I switched to what I should've gone into all along - IT. 

I honestly don't know what to do here. I'm working on an associate's degree in IT currently to defer the loans, but the calls are still made and I have been told by a representative that they will *never* stop calling. My parents cosigned the loans, but they aren't in a position to help pay $1000 monthly - they're older, and Dad is retiring, plus my older brother's loans still aren't paid off. Unless I find a way to get some stressful, soul-sucking job that drives me to drinking at $90k per year, these loans aren't going anywhere and I am never going to stop getting dead-air voicemails from Sallie Mae and Navient.

So...what am I going to do here? Start a home business? Work 3 jobs for the rest of my life? I've tried negotiating lower payments, but I consistently keep getting reps that act condescending or snappish, like I'm lying about not being able to pay $1000 per month. Do THEY make that much on the phones, squeezing juice from a dead vine? The federal loans can be paid off pretty easily, but I feel like I'm going to be either stuck with the private ones forever or give up any illusion of a relaxed lifestyle in order to pay them off (and I don't even live lavishly. I'm a homebody).

Is there any way of doing this without completely losing my mind?",finance,1477489181
personalfinance,Which option is best?,"I'm looking to refinance my loans through Common Bond.

These are the options Common Bond has given me. http://imgur.com/4mCEfwH

I'm looking mostly at the 15 year variable or fixed and would plan on continuing to pay at least the same ~$700 a month until I get my credit card debt paid off then will be putting more towards them, I don't want to go much higher than that a month as my budget won't currently allow it. Which would be better of those two in the long run? All of my loans up to now have been fixed rates so I'm not very knowledgeable on variable rates or how good they are for loans the size I have either. Is there something that would be an even better route?

*edit to add rates/terms for loans through Common Bond* The Grad Refinance Loan™ Rates and Terms

Offered terms are subject to change. Loans are made by CommonBond Lending, LLC (NMLS # 1175900).

Annual Percentage Rates (APR) for variable rate loans range from 2.23% (with auto pay discount) to 6.03% (with auto pay discount).

The highest variable loan rate of 6.03% is based on a 1-month LIBOR of 0.53% plus a margin of 5.50% (with auto pay discount). The interest rate caps for variable rate loans range from 8.99% to 9.99%, depending on the repayment term chosen.

Annual Percentage Rates (APR) for fixed rate loans range from 3.50% (with auto pay discount) to 7.74% (with auto pay discount). If you are approved for a loan, the interest rate offered will depend on your credit profile and the loan term selected and will be within the ranges of rates listed above.

personalfinance,I'm being relocated and am not certain what to do about my Mortgage,"I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible.

I'm currently in the middle of a move from Tulsa to Houston for work. As part of that move, I'm being given relocation benefits which are honestly pretty amazing.

One of those benefits is an equity cash advance of 95% of the equity in your home. 

Now, the only way they can provide this is if we have a contract already on our home to 'prove' its value. But since I had a set start date, we couldn't wait for our home to sell to place an offer on a new home down in Houston.

So we found a home in Houston, and our original mortgage structure for the home was 5% down (because we didn't have 20% liquid), and then the plan was that once our home in Tulsa sold, we'd use the equity we received to make the full 20% to remove PMI. 

Well our home in Tulsa sold about a week after we had our offer accepted down in Houston, and now closing is on November 16th. 

I was hoping to use the equity cash advance to alter the financing to put the 20% down now because I'd like to avoid any PMI payments. 

So I emailed our relocation person and had this conversation: http://i.imgur.com/9NJ31e3.png

Basically she just tells me that yes, they can get the equity advance to me very quickly.

I then forwarded this conversation to our Mortgage lender asking them how I should go about this with following conversation: http://i.imgur.com/GN1Ak4a.png

Also worth noting that my napkin math in the email isn't exact, but is very close because part of the relocation package is covering the cost for our agent.

So questions:

1. Could I get an explanation for my Mortgage lender's response? What does it mean to be locked in? Why can't I be ""unlocked""?  
2. Does the amount or percentage I put down on my home affect the interest rate that much? Assuming that the change is from 5% down to 20% down.  
3. Assuming we are ""locked in"" and can't be unlocked, can we change lenders if we signed our sales contract two weeks ago (March 12), and have a closing date of November 16th?  
4. If we can, what are the implications of such a change?

Our stated rate is already very good at 3.375% because both my wife and I have ~760 credit scores and another relocation benefit is that they'll reimburse a point on our mortgage (although I'm not quite certain what this means), but I mostly want to know if that rate could be lower.",finance,1477489406
personalfinance,Would it be stupid to turn down a job offer related to my degree just because it makes me unhappy?,"Hello, personalfinance. I need your advice. 
I've spent the past year working as an intern in a federal office and I now have the opportunity to get hired on full time in a technical position related to my degree with a 40k start. It seems like a perfect transition into the professional world but I'm thinking of turning it down and I need a second opinion. 

Relevant details:
I have a BA in biology with ~$45,000 in student loans and $8,000 left on my car. 
I have a retail job that pays $10.25 an hour for extra income. 
This internship was my first ""real"" job outside of college and it's given me a lot of great opportunities and I've learned a lot of useful skills. But this accounted for maybe half the time I worked there. The rest of my time was spent without a real objective, trying to find things to do, feeling that I was wasting my time, and trying to justify staying. It made me really depressed and I was happy when the internship ended. 
The internship is designed to lead to a full time job and provides a small scholarship ($5,500) for completing a 52 week term to help pay for loans. That's been the goal that kept me there. I knew that it would likely end in a job but I couldn't help being excited that I wouldn't have to be there, even if only for a transition period. 
I haven't been able to afford rent on the internship stipend and am still living with my parents, so the job is a grueling hour commute that's really worn me down over the past year. The new salary would help me afford an apartment nearby but I don't know that I want to continue living in this area.
I don't like working in an office. I got the degree that I did so I could work with animals. I want to justify spending more time volunteering at an animal shelter to gain experience for this type of position in the time that I would otherwise be working at this new job. 

The baseline is, it makes me unhappy to be there but I don't want to make a bad choice if being practical is the better option.",finance,1477491039
personalfinance,Savings via Foreign Currency Deposit Scheme,"Hi Reddit, 

Am a Long time lurker in this thread, and have learned a lot from it. Thank you all for your comments! So, First time, I want to open up and ask a Question:

I live in Singapore and have recently made the decision to move to Australia. I have a job offer in hand and the company is willing to also sponsor my 457 visa. The process is going to take about 2 months max from now and I shall be moving to Perth. When I am there, I have also decided to go for an Aussie PR and later on settle down in down under fully with my family of 4. Over the 7yrs working in SG, me and my wife have made combined savings of upto SGD 250k and once we move to Aus, We want to buy a house for good after 12-18 months. 

What I have observed recently is that the AUD is getting stronger and stronger as compared to SGD (an year ago, SGD was stronger or equal to AUD or only a marginal diff). As I have made plans to buy a house there, I am thinking to convert the SGD I have now into AUD and see some benefit from the conversion rate, by using Foreign Currency Deposit options from banks here (like ANZ Bank), I am hoping that the 2% interest rate they are giving and the stronger AUD might give me some extra buying power (even 5k is still good).

To me it seems a decent idea, however, I am just very new to such Foreign Currency Deposit. While risks are omnipresent, I wanted to know if any one has done such thing before? and is that a good idea in the first place?

This is my first post here and I hope I follow all the rules correctly.

To give a quick rundown on where I am in life:
I'm in my senior year in Highschool
I'm starting a job within the next month for $12-13 an hour (Have not been told my starting salary yet)
I have a joint checking and savings account with my mother
Ex-military family

I'm quite confused on where to begin. I've read a few of the ""beginner guides"" and am still trying to grasp what I need to know. I understand an emergency fund is always good to have even at a young age and I'm just confused on where to save it. My current savings account is with a bank and I'm wondering if I should save in a credit union instead.

I'm also wondering how to go about budgeting.
My goals are to have around $1000 for emergencies, save for a community college, have money for prom, and have spending money for (bi)weekly outings. 

I guess my questions are:
Where to save my emergency fund?
Where to save my college fund?
Where to hold my general spending money/prom?
How to gain a sense of budgeting?
How to pick a Credit Union? (If needed)

I've looked into Pen Fed but there's a lot of horror stories. I've also looked into Apple FCU, but haven't looked into Navy FCU yet.

btc,"AMA request: Adam Back, new CEO of Blockstream after Austin Hill left. Remember your 2-4-8 MB blocksize proposal? Those were the days! You don't talk to Bitcoin users much anymore. How's it going? What's going on with Blockstream? There's a lot going on with Bitcoin. Are you free to talk w/us a bit?","Now that you're not only working on Blockstream's latest flagship product (the Lightning Network) but you're also CEO of Blockstream, then it would seem reasonable for the community to expect you might reach out to us once in a while - particularly at times like this when so much is going on with Blockstream and with Bitcoin.

I know I have lots of questions. I tried to group them into half a dozen sets of related questions below. I think many people would really like to hear what you might have to say on these issues.

---

(1) [A recent top post on r/btc](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59hcvr/blockstream_is_just_another_shitty_startup_a/) questioned whether Blockstream will ever be able to manage to deliver a ""legitimate product"" to show for the $76 million that the ""VC"" venture-capital guys from finance companies like AXA and PwC invested in your startup. 

From a business point of view (which supposedly is now your area - as CEO), the following excerpt is perhaps the most interesting section of that post:

&gt; [Blockchain's] magical ""off-chain layer 2 solutions"" were just buzzwords sold to investors as blockchain hype was blowing up. Austin Hill sold some story, rounded up some devs, and figured he could monopolize Bitcoin. Perhaps he saw Blockstream as ""the Apple of Unix"" - bringing an open-source nerdy tech to the masses at stupid product margins. But it doesn't look like anyone did 5 minutes of due diligence to realize this is absolutely moronic.

&gt; So first Blockstream was a sidechain company, now it's an LN company, and if SegWit doesn't pass, they'll have no legitimate product to show for it. Blockstream was able to stop development of a free market ecosystem to make a competitive wedge for their product, but then they never figured out how to build the product!

&gt; Now after pivoting twice, Austin Hill is out and Adam Back has been instated CEO. I would bet he is under some serious pressure to deliver anything at all, and SegWit is all they have, mediocre as it is - and now it might not even activate. It certainly doesn't monetize, even if it activates.

&gt; So no matter what, Blockstream has never generated revenue from a product.

So... None of your proposed scaling products are actually ready - and nobody even knows if they'll realistically be ready even a couple years from now.

Meanwhile [a competitor's scaling product](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=bitcoin+unlimited&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) already *is* ready.

In fact, your competitor's scaling product is not only *ready* - it's also being *used* by a small but significant and growing [(and intelligent and outspoken and articulate)](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin+btc/search?q=viabtc&amp;restrict_sr=on) percentage of users - humming along quietly and compatibly on an increasing number of nodes on the Bitcoin network.

And this competitor's scaling product is so simple and so easy to deploy that it could literally gain consensus on the network at any time now. 

That's right: at any point in the next few months, the whole network could ""flip over"" to your competitor's product - and the whole ""flip-over"" could happen in a mere matter of *days*.

And this isn't just some remote possibility - it's actually highly likely, the way things have been going lately.

I wonder what your investors think about that. Have they reached out to express any concerns to you? What have you said to them? 

Are we even allowed to be privy to some tidbits from these conversations (just to give us some idea of what you're planning on doing next with Satoshi's reference client which people have entrusted with you)?

What are your priorities now? Who do you regard as your constituency/constituencies? Who are you responsible to - legally as CEO of Blocsktream, and personally, as ""Adam Back, Individual""?

Are you under any kind of non-disclosure agreements which would inhibit your ability to speak openly and freely about your plans for Bitcoin with the Bitcoin user community (miners, holders, on-chain transactors)?

You've probably noticed that Bitcoin has been rallying (perhaps on the recent news of Chinese currency devaluation) - but Bitcoin users have been getting a horrible experience, and [some have begun complaining rather loudly about it](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59hxp6/graph_mempool_transaction_count_the_number_of/d98p5cs/).

People are experiencing massive congestion, delays, and unreliable delivery using the software which *your company* refused to upgrade (even though you yourself proposed a one of the many simple obvious upgrades which would have solved the current congestion: your 2-4-8 MB proposal).

How do you feel about this?

Do you recognize the role you have played in helping to bring this situation about?

Do you have any ideas on things you might be able to do to improve this situation?

---

(2) Your competitor's upgrade (already running on part of the network) would easily solve the current congestion problems - with no change to the existing network topology, with minimal impact on the existing software ecosystem currently used by the major wallets and exchanges, and without the need to do any further blocksize upgrades in the future (since it makes the blocksize an emergent phenomenon continuously adapting via consensus on the network).

Meanwhile, your proposed scaling product isn't ready yet, might not be ready for months or even years, [doesn't have a defined working network topology (no routing)](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/59ifir/lightning_without_routing_is_like_a_car_without/), and would massively impact the existing software ecosystem - requiring thousands of lines of code to be re-written (and re-tested and re-deployed).

Do you have anything you would like to say to users and your fellow developers who would be heavily impacted by your proposals and your delays?

What are you telling your investors about how this current situation is likely to play out?

What kinds of plans does your company have if its products fail to materialize - or materialize but fail to be adopted by users?

There have been ongoing concerns and objections regarding your company's decision to deploy your upgrade using a methodology which many people believe is needlessly over-complicated and thus less safe for the network: ie, your insistence on upgrading via a *soft* fork

Many developers (not directly associated with your company) have pointed out that *hard* forks are signficantly cleaner and safer because they're simpler and more explicit.

Why are you continuing to insist on doing a soft fork, over the reasonable objections of your fellow developers in the community?

What do you have to say to [allegations](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/search?q=author%3Aydtm+hard+fork&amp;restrict_sr=on) that your company is putting its own interests ahead of the interests of the Bitcoin community (because hard forks are better for Bitcoin but soft forks are better for Blockstream)?

As CEO of Blockstream, do you have anything you'd like to say to the *community* about these issues regarding the differences between your company's technology, upgrade path, and timetable versus the competition's?

And again, what are you saying to your *investors* about all of this?

---

(3) Austin Hill was CEO of Blockstream before you, and he recently left. The community is putting its own various spins on his departure. Do you have anything you'd like to tell us about why he left?

Blockstream was basically created by you and Austin and CTO Gregory Maxwell.

What kind of relationship did you and Austin have? At the beginning, and towards the end of his tenure as CEO?

What were your and his understandings of Blockstream's business plans and prospects? 

Did these change over time?

What kind of role do you see yourself playing now - as a cryptographer who now finds himself CEO of a company that claims to be custodian of the ""reference client"" of the world's leading cryptocurrency?

---

(4) Regarding the ""reference client"" - do you have anything to say about the recent statements from prominent developers criticizing your dev team for taking the unusual approach of trying to pass off your reference client *implementation* as some kind of ""de facto"" *specification*?

In particular, how would you respond to fellow prominent cryptocurrency researchers ([Emin Gün Sirer](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5999d5/lack_of_a_spec_and_alternative_implementations_is/) and [Vitalik Buterin](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5979iv/vitalik_buterin_on_twitter_in_2016_does_anyone/) who last week publicly criticized your team's unorthodox claims that ""the reference client is the specification""?

As a mathematician and a programmer and an academic, surely you have a deep understanding of the relationship between a specification and its implementation(s) - in particular, the Curry-Howard isomorphism which states that this relationship is equivalent to the relationship between a theorem and its proof(s). 

Are you going to also tell us with a straight face (like some of the junior colleagues associated with your company already have) that ""the implementation *is* the specification"" or that ""it isn't possible to write a specification for this implementation""?

Do you realize how silly this sort of thing sounds to the actual computer scientists involved in Bitcoin - who understand quite clearly that you're saying ""we're writing a proof without a theorem"" when you say ""we're writing an implementation without a specification""?

Do you not feel compelled to engage with at least your fellow crytocurrency researchers who made these kinds of public criticisms of the very mathematical foundations informing your company's view of its role in the standardization process for the Bitcoin protocol?

Are you still even at liberty to participate in these kinds of spirited debates on mathematical foundations with your peers in the community, given your other commitments and obligations as CEO now?

---

(5) Now you're CEO of Blockstream, and Greg Maxwell continues as CTO. 

We all know that this is probably the first time in history where the CTO of a major company has previously publicly called the new CEO a ""dipshit"" - but we're all adults and people say things. 

Beyond that moment of friction in the past: What are you and Greg working on these days, and how do you work together?

Given the current events and controversies in the Bitcoin space (the ongoing congestion problems, the rise of Bitcoin Unlimited, the growing rejection of your products such as SegWit by ViaBTC and other major users), how are the devs and owners of Blockstream reacting to all these ongoing developments?

Do you and Greg agree on the course your company is taking with Bitcoin?

---

(6) Since its founding, we've come to discover that the cornerstone of Blockstream's strategy has been to try to prevent other development teams from providing ""level 1"" scaling solutions for Bitcoin.

There have been several examples of this: 

- censorship of on-chain scaling proposals on r\bitcoin and at conferences; 

- statements by miners from China implying that they cooperated with your goal to *stifle* your competition - although you stiffed ended up *stiffing* your ""collaborators"" on that deal, when you broke the Hong Kong agreement

Meanwhile, Blockstream's much-hyped proposed level-2 scaling solutions are starting to look so flawed and faraway and *incomplete* that serious questions are being raised as to whether they will ever come to fruition - not only several months from now, but even possibly several *years* from now.

In light of the above (Blockstream's failure to deliver its *own* proposed level-2, off-chain scaling solutions - along with its efforts to prevent *other* parties from delivering their working, level-1, on-chain scaling solutions) - as well as your well-known calls for people to ""collaborate"" - what kind of collaboration do you envision we could work on together at this time?

In particular, you are well-aware of the community's urgent need for simple and safe on-chain scaling solutions at this time - and indeed you were the author of one such solution at one point, your earlier 2-4-8 MB proposal.

How did we get to this point we're at now - where multiple, obvious, easy on-chain scaling solutions have been staring us in the face for ages (Bitcoin Unlimited, your 2-4-8 MB proposal) - and yet today here we are today with Bitcoin network performance being degraded before our very eyes, users publicly complaining, miners rejecting your proposed *future* scaling solutions, and no *current* scaling solutions from you, after all these broken promises and missed deadlines?

How did you let things drag on for years like this, with Blockstream continuing to fail to deliver *your* proposed scaling solutions, while simultaneously preventing anyone else from delivering *their* already-implemented scaling solutions?

How can you claim to want to ""collaborate"" with the community if you've let the situation, and the communication, deteriorate to this point?

personalfinance,Federal tax bracket question- right on the cusp between 15% and 25%,"I've worked 2 jobs this year and it's hard to calculate exactly how much I've made this year because at my previous job there were some part time periods, and OT periods. At my new job I make $45k, so I understand that for all of 2017 I'll be subject to the 25% bracket. However, it really pains me that I may be taxed at 25% for 2016, especially if I'm barely over it, at like $38k, especially when my state income tax makes it even higher. I'm wondering, is there anything I can do to move some money around to reduce my taxable income for 2016? I don't have an IRA or 401k but may be able to get them through work, I don't understand it super well honestly. I also am attending school full time and have paid some of the tuition out of pocket, I don't know if that affects anything.

I'm currently on unemployment benefits of £395 per month (28th of each month).

I lost my job due to moving, thanks to a situation I won't go into. My expenditure for this month is higher than normal which I'll demonstrate below. In future it won't be this high.

**October**

* £106.50 Communications bill
* £70 Internet Bill
* £50 Wedding Deposit
* £30 Loan repayment
* £15 TV License
* £10 borrowed from a friend
* Total payout £281.50
* Total remaining funds £113.50

This is due to going on benefits and accruing some arrears. Bills normally won't be this high.

**Predicted future expenditure**

* £85 communications bill
* £16.50 Min-Wedding Payment
* £39.84 Internet bill
* £60 Loan Repayment (Previous bill was 2-weeks worth)
* £22.40 TV License
* £10 borrowed from a friend (ongoing until £50 is cleared)
* Total payout £233.74
* Total remain £161.26

Wedding payments are until either March 2nd, or £149 total is cleared. Whichever is easiest/happens first. £10 to friend is until £50 total cleared. £60 Loan is until £300 is cleared. All of these can be repaid sooner, but only the loan could work out cheaper in the long run, as per interest rate/time.

These bills don't account for food costs. This is due to having a lot of food in the cupboards currently. But avg £30 per fortnight based on previous spending.

Given this information, how much could I save per month? What is the best method? How much is a good target for ""rainy day money"" or ""emergency fund"" etc.

My current situation is seriously screwing me over, based on not being able to catch public transport or attend important hospital appointments. Up until Friday when this money should be paid, I've not even had £1.50 for a bus. 

This is without mentioning my broken oven not being covered by warranty, and having to pluck £95 minimum out of thin air, just for a call-out by repair people. People seem to think that not being able to afford things means £100 in the bank but earmarked for a bill etc, but to me it's ""I don't even have 100 pence physically available to me.""

Please let me know what you think, and I'll respond as best I can in the comments.

I know Utilities haven't been mentioned. This is because I'm on a quaterly bill and don't yet know what these equate to. Currently I'm £140 in credit with British Gas. Council tax is £40something per month. Again I'm not sure what's going on here as this is being re-assessed as per going onto benefits.

personalfinance,Is driving for Uber profitable for me?,"I've started  dabbling with Uber driving on the side to make some spare cash. I've done 19 trips thus far and have averaged ~$8.46 a trip driving an average of ~7.56 mi per trip (not including the travel to the pick-up location or the travel after the drop-off). My vehicle is a V8 truck that averages right at 13 mpg city/16 mpg hwy. Gas isn't too terribly expensive at the moment ~$2.10 a gallon in my area. I do live in a pretty urban area where there is frequent demand including frequent times of ""Surge"" pricing.

Taking into account what I'm averaging a mile of actual driving (which doesn't include paying for my time) which I think is ~$1.12/mile, the gas mileage I get, the miles driving to pick-up/from drop-off locations, the time spent, wear and tear on my vehicle, and the fact that I will have to pay federal and state taxes on my earnings when I file my taxes as Uber does not take out taxes, is it even profitable for me to Uber drive?


*Edit*: Based on multiple responses, I think I was able to make some calculations that make sense.

AAA estimates the cost to drive a 4WD at ~ $0.68/mile. My average (based on 19 trips) was getting paid $1.12 a mile. If I put aside 25% for taxes ($0.28) that leaves $0.84 minus the $0.68 leaves an estimated $0.16/mile (just for distance). If I drove the average 7.56 miles per trip, that pays $1.20 a trip. The average trip across the 19 took ~14-15 minutes (lets say 15 for easy calculations, so .25 hours) So $1.20 / .25 = $4.80 per hour of just driving. 

So for the actual trip mileage and time earnings after cost to operate the vehicle per mile comes out to $4.80. I would estimate that the time it takes to get to the pick up and to where I need to go after drop off is easily at least half the time of the trip itself, so lets say an extra 7 minutes per trip. So ~22 min per trip. the original $1.20 per trip / the time of .37 hrs (22 min) = $3.24 an hr. Again, this doesn't factor in the mileage to/from the trip itself, just the time to/from, the time of and mileage of trip.

$3.24 an hour is pretty slim when I could use that time more productively elsewhere and help preserve the life of my vehicle.

btc,Why I am not worried about blockstream/core stopping on chain scaling.,"I have been watching, reading and investing in Bitcoin for two years.  I know, a relative newbie.  At first I was upset about the blatant conflict of interest of Bitcoin core being controlled by a small company, blockstream, in order to force scaling to be off chain in a complicated, unproven vapor ware called lightning.  It's so plain and obvious I was also gnashing my teeth and beating my chest and pulling my hair.
Eventually I realized I didn't need to worry at all.  Bitcoin has its own built in release valves.  Yes this will be a temporary diversion and waste of time but blockstream will fail.  Eventually the block size constraint will reach a breaking point.  It's plainly illogical to say the solution to a backed up mempool is higher fees, duh, once everyone goes to higher fees we are back where we started, too many transactions and not enough room.  The fees are irrelevant.  The whole Bitcoin ecosystem will be forced to deal with the problem.  Miners especially. Eventually We all have an economic interest in solving the issue of scaling.  That is the fail safe valve that will pop when the time is right.

Core's grip on Bitcoin is actually very tenuous.  One indication is how fervently /u/nullc spends his time arguing his position on Reddit.  If he was in control and acting from a position of strength he wouldn't bother.  He needs to maintain the fragile consensus that exists.  I have been relaxing and watching as he wastes his time.  

The reason I am relaxed is that eventually blockstream will completely fail.  They will not deliver.  Their inane arguments will be exposed for what they are.  Reality will intrude on everyone's plans and assert itself as it always eventually does.  It will happen slowly at first then very quickly, just like bankruptcy. “How did you go bankrupt?"" Two ways. Gradually, then suddenly.” ― Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises.  Which is where blockstream is headed.  They will burn through their cash and be snuffed out.

Because Bitcoin can hard fork with a new group of developers when the time is right, Core really has very little long term control.  Bitcoin unlimited looks like a promising alternative, I am not a coder and don't really know for sure.  Maybe it's another iteration of the same concepts.  Maybe someone will think up a better solution.  At a minimum I am comfortable the solutions are available and unstoppable.

Should we do nothing and wait?  No, I think we should be refining our alternative solutions.  Expose them to criticism, put them out there for discussion.  Take the feedback and improve them.  When the the valve pops we need to be ready with options that make the transition smooth.  

I do not think we should push for a break too soon. Wait for the rest of the community to come to us.  If we are as right as I think we are it will be a matter of months maybe a year.  When the time is right it will be obvious.  The floodgates will open and blockstream will be swept away.

after 25 years of trading commodities I have seen a lot of flood gates open and a lot companies be swept away.  this is not much different.  I have seen a lot of people like Greg Maxwell, intelligent, smug and completely wrong.  I have made great living trading against them.

personalfinance,Low on funds and might not be able to make it through the week. Any advice is appreciated.,"I'm 29 and have been self-employed for over four years. Sadly, my work pays me just enough to get by, and I haven't turned a profit for a while. Lately work has been slow, and today I just realized that I might not even have enough money to pay rent or utilities. It's the end of the month, so this might be it, and I'm scared out of my fucking mind right now.

Right now, I'm holding about $900 cash. My rent is $1700 and my electric bill is about $2000. (I grow indoor cannabis for a living). One pound of product sells for about $2200 wholesale, which is all well and dandy, except I'm looking at my last harvest and it looks like maybe 1.5 lbs, 2 max. For anyone not following, I'm looking at a possible $3300 gross for a business that costs me $3700/month.

If you grow cannabis, you're most likely looking at this like ""What the fuck did you do to only hit 1.5 lbs?"" I'd rather not get into how this happened, and honestly, I feel like a complete and utter failure right now. I have about $6k in debt and I can't get a loan, so I've been doing some freelance writing on the side for extra money (not going well). The only other thing I could really think of was to ask a family member to pull out a loan in their name to cover my expenses for the next couple of months until I can get back on my feet and start making some profit again. This loan would have to be around $8k to cover two months of rent and utilities while I prepare for the next harvest. 

I'm confident that I could pay back the loan over a 60-month period as long as the interest rate isn't sky high, but I'm worried about what this could do to their credit. To be honest, if I can't get that money, I feel like I'm pretty much done, I'll have to close up shop and I have no idea how to transition my life into anything else.

If anyone has any advice on what I should do right now, I'll all ears. I'm basically cornered here. Thanks in advance.",finance,1477575516

personalfinance,[Advice] Vanguard RothIRA,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

I recently (about 20 weeks ago) started a RothIRA through Vanguard online. I did it myself in about 5 minutes, after spending about a year lurking here figuring out my best moves. The only thing is, once I set it up (auto-deposit $100 every other week) I just left it and never specified anything to invest into.

 - By default, all of my deposits have been put into the ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund (Settlement fund)""

I have read around that this is okay for shorter term investing, but I am looking for something where I can split it up between a couple different long-term options (Bonds and Stocks) rather than this fund it is currently in. 

 - I am thinking 40% in Bonds, 40% in Stocks, and the remaining 20% left where it currently is, if you would all think this is a decent idea?

  - Only thing is, I have no idea what I am doing once I get to this part. I have a 401k through my previous employer with Nationwide, and I set it up as if I were retiring around 2050. (High Risk/Reward for 1st 15 years, Medium Risk/Reward for 2nd 15 years, Low Risk/Reward until retirement) and I would like to do something similar, but I am not sure if I will need to pay to get an advisor through Vanguard to do something like this, or if they have options like this built into their system.

I am 25 years old, currently making $40k.

 - Based in USA 

 - I have about $900.00 in my IRA at this point, and about $2,300 in my 401k.

  - I haven't put anything in my 401k since early 2015, before my new job. Should I just roll it over from Nationwide to my Vanguard RothIRA?

Also, it was at $100 every other week, and I just changed it to $100 every week. Not sure that really makes a difference, but I know some IRA's have minimum yearly requirements.

Looking for some perspective here, we have a singular student loan that is right around $103,000 with 25 years remaining at $650/month and an interest rate of 5.69%. As we (wife and I) establish ourselves in our careers, with our income now around the $150,000 gross income mark, would this loan be a candidate for refinancing somewhere down the line, after some more pressing, smaller debts are paid off, or would it be sensible to leave as is and make extra payments on it as cash is freed up?

&gt; **Highlights of limitations that remain unchanged from 2016**

&gt;* The contribution limit for employees who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans, and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan remains unchanged at $18,000.
* The catch-up contribution limit for employees aged 50 and over who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans, and the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan remains unchanged at $6,000.
* The limit on annual contributions to an IRA remains unchanged at $5,500.  The additional catch-up contribution limit for individuals aged 50 and over is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $1,000.

&gt; **Highlights of changes for 2017**

&gt;The income ranges for determining eligibility to make deductible contributions to traditional Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), to contribute to Roth IRAs, and to claim the saver’s credit all increased for 2017.

&gt;Taxpayers can deduct contributions to a traditional IRA if they meet certain conditions.  If during the year either the taxpayer or their spouse was covered by a retirement plan at work, the deduction may be reduced, or phased out, until it is eliminated, depending on filing status and income. (If neither the taxpayer nor their spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, the phase-outs of the deduction do not apply.)    Here are the phase-out ranges for 2017:

&gt;* For single taxpayers covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $62,000 to $72,000, up from $61,000 to $71,000.
* For married couples filing jointly, where the spouse making the IRA contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $99,000 to $119,000, up from $98,000 to $118,000.
* For an IRA contributor who is not covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to someone who is covered, the deduction is phased out if the couple’s income is between $186,000 and $196,000, up from $184,000 and $194,000.
* For a married individual filing a separate return who is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

&gt; The income phase-out range for taxpayers making contributions to a Roth IRA is $118,000 to $133,000 for singles and heads of household, up from $117,000 to $132,000.  For married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range is $186,000 to $196,000, up from $184,000 to $194,000.  The phase-out range for a married individual filing a separate return who makes contributions to a Roth IRA is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

&gt;The income limit for the saver’s credit (also known as the retirement savings contributions credit) for low- and moderate-income workers is $62,000 for married couples filing jointly, up from $61,500; $46,500 for heads of household, up from $46,125; and $31,000 for singles and married individuals filing separately, up from $30,750.",finance,1477589681
personalfinance,Effects on lower end houses during the coming recession.,"So I may or may not be right but I believe we will be effected by a recession sometime in the next couple years. I feel like it's a good time I'm my life to to buy a small home for my family but am worried if it's the right time as far as prices of real estate right now. These are the factors im looking at
1. Prices are high as everything has been selling well all this year while ive been looking.
2. I'm guessing lower end houses will be more resilient to economic turmoil but I'm not sure exactly what the effect will be.
3. I'd like to get a good interest rate now before things change so that is making me want to buy now even though I feel prices are high.

I'm not asking for anyone to predict the future I'm just asking for advice on these thoughts and if they make sense in the case that yes the market drops 10 to 20 percent a year after I buy this home. I've been looking in the 150 to 250 thousand dollar range where the very cheapest houses sell for around 120 thousand. I would plan on living there anywhere between 3 and 10 years.

personalfinance,"I spend more than I earn, please help! How to budget my income / spendings?","Hello PF peops,

After discussing about my budget in another thread, I decided to make my own post. I have a spending problem, and that is really clear to me. But I can't seem to stop that habit. I need a budget that allows me freedom, but also help me clear my debts.

Please do note that everything is in Canadian dollars.

Here's the breakdown :

* Credit card: $12,500 (10% interest rate)
* Loan: $3,000 (14.5% interest rate)

The $3000 loan is a new investment I made (I'm starting a project) and I'd love to pay it first because of the interest rate)

My monthly spendings:

* Rent: $570
* Cellphone: $100
* Internet: $45
* SAAQ (driving license): $23
* Bus/metro pass: $125
* Viki (similar to netflix): $5
* Water, electricity, etc.: averages about $75
* Life insurance : $57
* Car + apartment insurance: $75
* Loan payment: $100
* Bank fees: $10
* Food: ~$300
* Restaurants: ~$100
* Gas: ~$75
* TOTAL: about $1660

My salary is $1730 per 2 weeks. I get about $1150 after all deductibles (taxes, RRSP, insurance, etc.). I get about $100 per month from the government (but I don't count it as it's not a reliable source of income). I have a 10% group RRSP set up, and it's automatic so there's no risk I spend that money.

So that leaves me with at minimum $2300 per month so that should leave me with at least $640 remaining per month. But I never see that money. I spend too much.

Just this month, I spent $800.

I'm considering 3 things :

* Having a spending fund (opening a new account for this) and only buy stuff I want from the cash in this account, $200 per month
* Having an emergency fund (I'm thinking of using my CELI for this, $150 per month)
* Pay my debts with the rest (that should leave about $250 minimum)

Both with automatic payments. But I'm wondering what I should put for both automatic transfers, and also what to put on my credit card and my loan. Are the numbers above viable?

Please help!

Thanks!

I went into the Subaru Dealership last weekend to just test drive the Crosstrek and Forester. While I was there they offered to take a look at my current car to see what they would give me for it. They actually said they'd give me ~$5,000 for it. I might take it to a few different places to see if it's a fair price. Like my local CarMax and Chevy dealership.


I'm planning on buying the 2017 Subaru Forester and keeping it 10+ years or until the tiers fall off. I'm a member of 2017 Subaru VIP Program, so I get 2% off the invoice price and it's supposed to  ""take the negotiation and stress out of the car buying process. "".




I took some time and threw the number into excel to compare:


**Down payment vs. Lease Length vs. Interest Rate**



   

I know Subaru is offering 0% loan until the end of this month, but talking to the Sales guy he said that they might be able to offer it for 48 month and 60 months ""depending on our credit score"". 


But I'm also approved for a 2.49% 48,60, and 72 months loan from CapitalOne because I have my CC through them and also my online banking too.

Don't know where else to ask for help so i figured this might be the closest sub that can help fix my issue. If thats not the case, i apologize! any input will be greatly appreciated!

**Background**

Im on Windows 10, new Asus laptop. I hadn't any anti-virus installed yet and i was browsing around late last night looking to get a free full version of Photoshop, surfed around looking for legit links. You can pretty much guess what happened next. As soon as i finished extracting a file I downloaded, BOOM! Computer starts doing stuff on its own, ads begin to pop up in the middle of the home screen, music starts playing, browser opens and closes, new shortcuts added. At this point i freaked out. Immediately disconnected from the internet and opened ""Control Panel&gt;Uninstall programs"" and began uninstalling the usual suspects. 

I then tried scanning my laptop with windows defender but it got turn off due to group policy. i later found out through research one virus disabled it and i had to go into ""regedit"" to delete the entry it added (sneaky fucker). After re-enabling defender, full scanning, deleting whatever it could find, and rebooting... i expected it to go back to normal. I opened up google chrome and whatever websites i typed just wouldn't load, saying i was ""disconnected from the internet"" even though my WiFi was perfectly fine.

After more researching on mobile, i found out another virus screwed with my dns settings. A forum user suggested a change in the internet IPv4 to google's public ones ""8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4"" and it temporarily fixed the internet issues.

Opened chrome again and the same problems persisted only now i had a browser hijacker that kept redirecting me and changing my settings. At this point i was beyond frustrated. After some time passed i managed to get the internet pages loading again. 

I took this chance and immediately went and downloaded an antivirus free 30 day trial (Kaspersky)
 hoping it would pull me and my precious laptop out of this hell hole. It worked pretty well, full scanned and deleted tons of shit EXCEPT for a couple ones. When it tried deleting them i got an error (cant remember what it said). after multiple reboots, i thought i was finally going to make it across the finish line...

**The issue**

 Virus causes laptop to refuse internet connectivity even though the Wifi Network is displayed to be connected online. it's an on and off thing. I went through OS&gt;Programs (x86) (and other folders) and deleted any suspicious recently added files. Maybe this was this problem.

Also, Guenfy.exe &amp; Hemkajdoa.exe viruses show up on Task Manager. As soon as i end the process for it, it pops back up again. I opened the file location and tried deleting it from there but BOTH say it CANT be deleted because its open in another program called ""Noije"". 

I went into ""Run"" and opened up ""services.msc"" where i found the so-called Noije. Right clicking on it gives me no options to stop/pause the service (greyed out/unavailable). Also went back and tried stopping it in Task Manager but i get an error. 

Im stuck. Don't know what else to do. How do i get rid of these fuckers? Since Kaspersky detected them but couldn't 100% delete them, it now just lets them through saying ""no threats detected"" which is BS!

EDIT: Downloaded Malware bytes antivirus as suggested and it did the trick! Found over 75 undected threats that Kaspersky was overlooking. Computer works normally again :) no sign of viruses anymore! Thanks guys!",technology,1477598019

More Info:
Since we are clearly above the income levels (and have been for years) for any IRA deductions, we have just kind of been letting our cash sit in a pile.  We got busy with kids and never took the time to fix that, until now.  What I'm wondering about is if a backdoor Roth IRA is worth the hassle at this point.  We aren't planning on dropping our jobs anytime soon, plus we haven't locked all of our cash up yet, so is there really a benefit of doing it?  We have some smallish IRAs that are a mix of deductible and non-deductible, so I'd just roll those into the 401ks to keep it simple if I went that route.

&amp;nbsp;

My wife is very risk averse, hence all the cash, and the extra mortgage payments.  I even had a car loan until recently at 1.89% that just bugged her, so we wiped it out (happy wife, right?)  The cash is at least in a 1% savings account, so it's not completely stuffed in our mattress.

Aside from the lack of budget or defined savings rate, and the stupid amount of cash I have, am I doing things right?  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!",finance,1477600389

I'm a recent college grad and I was hoping someone could give me their opinion/advice on my financial situation to make sure I plan for the future accordingly. My parents were never the best at explaining how to properly finance/budget/save, and I'm stressing myself out right now. I'm concerned I took out too much in loans and I'm in over my head a little. Maybe I'm not, but I don't really have a frame of reference here.

**Income:**

* $60,000 a year. 
* $1,679.58 bi/weekly after taxes/company benefits (Health, dental, vision) ($3,359.16 monthly)
* $5,500 in my savings account.

Two $20,000 fixed interest rate loans. 

* First: 10.365% interest rate. $4,349.41 accrued for $24,349.41 total.
* Second: 9.740% interest rate. $1,900.95 accrued for $21,900.95 total.
 
My payments are deferred until November 13th this year. I believe my monthly payments will be around $400/$450.

**Bills:**

* $349.99 car payment (lease. 3 years)
* $98.90 car insurance payment.
* Currently living at home. Girlfriend and I are looking at apartments together. Shooting for rent to be between $1000 and $1200. So $500/$600 a month per person. Planning on moving in together in January.

**Additional Notes:**

I got hired at my job about 3 months ago. I'm still living with my parents so I don't pay rent. Because of this, I try to put in about $500 into my savings every paycheck. Unfortunately I've been a little reckless this month with travel and luxuries. My girlfriend is working in Florida until she gets back moves back to Chicago in January so I spent money to go and see her. I didn't hit my goal monthly savings goal of $1,000. My next deposit will be Nov. 15th to get me up to $6,000.

I feel like right now I'm in an okay place, but once my loan payments start coming in, as well as rent for the apartment, I'm worried I'll be taking on too much.

$349.99 (car) + $98.90 (insurance) + ~$600 (rent / util) + ~$450 (loans) = ~$1500 a month. 

$3,359.16 - ~$1,500 = $1,859.16 spending a month.

Wow! Okay. It's easy to see the big picture once you type it all out. I guess I was just thinking ""payments here, payments there, make sure I'm putting into savings, make sure I'm not being too reckless"" but now that I see it all spelled out, I don't think I have too much of a problem. I'll probably through some of that extra monthly income into paying off my student loans.

Fortunately, I intend to live with my folks for 1-2 years, maybe 3 depending on how much savings I can save up which means I will pay no rent/utilities for the duration of my stay with them. I am single and have no kids.  

**Employment**:  
I just landed a full-time job with a base starting rate of $26.91/hr (36hr work weeks or more) but will incrementally increase until it's $28.41/hr after about 1 year (I don’t start for another 2.5 weeks though). I also expect $3k in guaranteed bonuses for the first year of the job which I am considering turning into my emergency fund. There's a shift differential of $5 more per hour whenever I work weekend nights (I will try to work as much of these shifts as I can - at least for the first year). I plan to match my employer’s contributions to my 401k/403(b) which is up to half of 6%. However, I’m playing with the idea of increasing that to 10%. I don’t know if that’s a smart move while I’m paying off my loans though…  

**Monthly bills**:  
I have monthly car payments of $396/month and more or less $500/month in credit card bills for misc. purchases (I’ll try to lower this through frugal spending). My health insurance including vision/dental are taken bi-monthly from my pay – rates are shown below.  

**Breakdown**:
* Total Loan: $78k  
* Total of loans under my name: $38.5k @ 4.415% (weighted average)  
* Total Parent PLUS loans: $39.5k @ 7.9% interest  
* Annual Gross Income: ~$53k  
* Current Monthly Loan Payments: $875  
* Monthly Car Payments: $396  
* Monthly Health Insurance: $93.30  
* Monthly Vision + Dental Plan: $18.64  
* Estimated Monthly Credit Card Payments: ~$500  

**The Plan**:  
I have been researching a program called the Nurse Corps. Loan Repayment Program. In a nutshell, they offer to pay off 60% of qualifying loans in exchange for 2 years of work commitment at an approved hospital. I have done the research and my hospital should be approved. They also offer an optional addition of 25% if a 3rd year is worked. The thing is, the only qualifying loans they would be obligated to pay off are the loans that are under my name. Parent PLUS loans are not eligible for this program. The program also carries serious financial repercussions should I, for any reason, not be able to fulfill their requirements (working full-time, taking too many sick days, etc). I am not really worried about not meeting these requirements. Applications for this program open in January.  

As for the Parent PLUS loans, that 7.9% interest is what I'm most worried about. I plan to refinance these loans into my name (SoFi I hear makes this possible) to get that rate as low as I can get it but as a consequence, I will lose the loan benefits offered under its ""federal"" type. The way I see it, the only way I'll take advantage of those said benefits is if I will struggle to pay the monthly minimum and need assistance. I don't want to jinx or sound over-confident but as a nurse, I highly doubt I'll be out of a job anytime soon or have a hard time paying the monthlies. I think this is merely a matter of budgeting.  

**Concerns**:  
* I need an alternative plan for my half of the loans if I end up not being able to get into the Nurse Corps. Program. Maybe refinance?  
* What should I do with the $3k bonus (emergency fund it? Or put it in my loans?) I currently have nothing in my emergency fund.  
* Should I increase my contributions to 10% or wait to do that after the loans are paid off?  
* Besides SoFi (can anyone recommend another refinancing option for me?)  
* I’m worried that I won’t have enough after all my bills to save enough money after year 2 or 3…  
* Do you guys see any other options I could take to pay off my loans as soon as possible?  
* Am I doing anything right?  

My goal is to pay off these loans as fast and as efficiently as I can. I refuse to pay the minimum and have this debt around for 10 years. I am lucky enough to have parents that want me to stay with them but I am getting older and I want to move out. My best friend is offering me a place to stay for around $300-400 but I declined. Not until I have paid off a big chunk of my debt and have sufficient savings will I consider moving out. Any comments or advice about my current plan will be greatly appreciated!",finance,1477605092

I tried refinancing through BOA they said no immediately.

My current payment isn't hurting me at all, but would like a lower interest rate. Based on my fico scores I should be able to get a great rate.

My girlfriend has about $15,000 in credit card debt that's on moderate interest rate cards (~15%).  This kills me and I want it gone.

Her American Express has something called a FICO Score 8, have no idea how this correlates to a real FICO score.  Either way it reports a credit score of 771.  Should I have her apply for a credit card with a 0% interest rate for 21 months and balance transfer, or would I be better off trying to have her apply for a 36 month personal loan (I want it paid off faster than 36 months).  My fear if she applies for a credit card, gets denied (or is less than the amount needed) it will subsequently hurt her chances at a decent interest rate on a personal loan for debt consolidation.

Thank you.",finance,1477624256
personalfinance,Parents willing to pay off my closed accounts; wondering how this will affect credit score,"I have about three closed credit card accounts which were closed by the creditors because they all went delinquent for some period of time. They haven't been charged off according to my last credit report in June 2016, although 2 collection agencies did collect payments under payment programs for 2 of them before I guess handing it back to the creditors. The credit report doesn't seem to say anything about them having been in collections or anything. I've been making on-time payments for the past year on two of them and for the past year and a half on the largest one.

All together about $8500 in debt, along with federal student loans that are about $28K and a private student loan that's currently about $1.3k. My FICO score was just under 660 recently.

My parents are willing to pay off my credit card accounts and the private loan and have me just pay them instead, which is fine by me.

How will doing that affect my credit score? My dad is insisting that I can write good will letters to the card companies and try to show the bureaus that I paid them off so they can remove the negative accounts, although I don't think it'll happen until the 7-8 years pass. I'll try it anyway, but I wanted to see if anyone had any ideas on what this will do for my score. I don't really have any other accounts open though.

Also, for my federal loans, they're listed as installment accounts on my last credit report, but it also says my debt to credit ratio exceeds 100%, I'm guessing because I actually haven't made payments on them in the past year because of my income-driven repayment plan (I did not make enough in 2015). I'll have to start paying them again in the coming year though under a recalculated IDR plan. Does this affect my credit score a lot too?

That's a lot to dump on here, but my parents were hoping to get a home loan and had to add me in their attempts, which resulted in all of this kind of being revealed to them. So they're hoping to help repair my credit quickly, but I'm not sure how quickly this can be done.

personalfinance,Windfall of 40K and student loans of 50K. How to maximize potential?,"Received a windfall of $40K. 

Student loans (all subsidized, none accruing interest yet):

* $10,000 @ 6.0% (deferment ends in 2017)
* $5,000 @ 4.5% (deferment ends in 2017)
* $5,000 @ 3.4% (deferment ends in 2017)
* $30,000 @ 5% (deferred with no interest for next 5 years)

What I have done so far: I took $10k and put it in a taxable VTSAX account. From reading the Boglehead's Guide to Investing book, it looks like stock index funds such as the VTSAX are the best bet for taxable investments. Emergency fund $2k. Bonds $0. No retirement accounts yet. I do not have a job/income so no IRA.


What I am planning: 

1. Pay off the $10k 6% loans before they start accruing interest. 
2. Pay minimum payments on the $5k at 4.5% and $5k at 3.4% and allow them to accrue interest since I am likely to beat the interest rate in the long term. Don't touch the $30k at 5% interest for the next several years since no interest is being accrued.
3. Bring up emergency fund to $10-12k
4. Invest another $10k in a taxable account, either VTSAX again or something else (international?). No bonds yet until I get proper retirement account set up next year due to taxes.

So in total, the breakdown of $40,000 = $20k invested in Vanguard taxable accounts, $10k used to pay off high interest loans, and $10k to put away in money market/savings as emergency fund. *Does this seem like a good idea, or would you guys do something different?*


A friend suggested I wait until next year when I'm earning to put money in a tax-advantaged account. However, I plan on maxing out my $5,500 IRA contribution from my income next year, so not sure if I should still go this route over taxable stock index funds. *Thoughts on his strategy?*",finance,1477650180

* $16,000 in federal student loan debt @ 6.8% fixed interest.  Minimum payments = payoff ~May 2021.  Unable to pay more than minimum with current net income.

Considering dropping 401k contribution from 10% to 3% in order to quickly pay off student loans.  The extra income says I could pay off the $16,000 within 22 months instead of 54 months and interest saved on loans would be ~$1300.  Once paid off, I would contribute 10% to 401k again.  
  
It seems to make sense in the short term, but I'm worried about the long term impact.  Contributing 7% less for two years might have a huge effect on compounded earnings over time...?

Our finances right now are pretty good. My wife and I both work full time.

We are in our late 30's/early 40's. Healthy (knock on wood). No kids (and not having any).

So, the situation is this: I'm inheriting some money from a friend who recently died. AFTER paying off my student loans, the cars, and planning an elaborate, non-work related vacation for me and the Mrs., I should have about $100k left, but I'm at a loss for what to do with it. I'm planning on starting an IRA with the money I'll save in student loans/car loans, so I don't want to put it there. CD's and savings seem secure but with interest rates so low it seems like a waste. We're happy with our current house and don't want to spend the money on upgrading (though we might do a few improvements like windows, etc.). And we're already saving for retirement and our long-term outlook is pretty reasonable.

personalfinance,Protecting myself from spouse's student loans (community property state),"Using a throwaway since family and friends know my regular username, would rather them not know details of our finances. I'm not sure if this is the best subreddit to post this in. I'm typing those on my phone, so hopefully the formatting is okay. 

My spouse just found out he has been accepted into his dream graduate school program (pharmacy). I am very excited and proud of him. To attend this program, he will be taking out anywhere from $150k minimum to $200k+ in student loans. Hopefully most of that will be covered with federal student loans (Direct Unsubsidized and Grad Plus). However, it sounds like students are also having to take out some private student loans as well to cover the costs. We live in a community property state (Nevada).

His starting salary as a pharmacist will probably range from $100k-$110k. Median for the profession is around $122k.  Our plan for paying off any student loans he takes out is to pay it off within 7 years. 

My question is - is there any way to protect myself from these loans if he were to die before completing the program or before the loans would be paid off? I know federal loans are automatically discharged upon death. It is harder to find ""death discharge"" clauses for private loans.

If we cannot find private loans with a death discharge clause, would it be helpful to take out a life insurance policy to cover the student loan debt?

Extra info that might be helpful:

We currently do not have dependents (no kids), but it's possible we could have one before he graduates from this program. 

I will be working while he is attending school, and we should be able to cover all of our bills and expenses on my $42k salary. 

The $150k in loans would be for tuition only. Other fees, books, health insurance, and possibly needing to contribute to living expenses could increase the loan amount to around $200k+. 

- No credit card debt by the time he starts school next August (paying it down aggressively)
- One car will be paid off by the time he starts school (also been paying this down aggressively)
- Other car has $17k left on loan at 0% interest (monthly payment is $333)
- My student loans are around $50k (3.2-6.8% interest). I know, not good. Will have to start making payments next May at around $500/month for 10 year plan). 
- Rent is $300 right now (roommates). If we have a kid, would need to move and would go up to around $950 at the lowest. 
- Health insurance for him is $47/month (mine is $0 - covered by job); his will probably increase to around $210 month soon
- Cell phone $90 for him and $0 for me (parent is paying for it, despite me telling her she doesn't have to); once his contract is up, we might switch to Ting or another cheap carrier
- Car insurance is $300 for both cars, might go down to $200 next year
- We have $1k emergency fund (been paying down debt like crazy)
- I have a good credit score (720+). We have been working on his (650+); should be a lot better by the time he starts school.",finance,1477682870
personalfinance,Has anyone heard of greenlink financial I'm looking into using them for a loan to pay off debt?,"Greenlink Financial sent me a letter in the mail saying they would give me a 35,000 loan at 5% interest rate to pay off my debt. I called them they said they would do a soft pull on my credit score and email me options for the loan. Then send the money directly to my bank account and I'd be responsible for paying off my credit cards. Sounds to good to be true.




I owe about 20,000 in credit cards with stupid interest rates and this would really help pay them off but I'm scared cause it sounds like a scam and they have a lot of mixed reviews on google.

each paycheck they take about 120 bucks out and the returns he got for last year totaled to about 750 bucks. it DEFINITELY didn't go to him. but they checked and show ZERO payments. where the hell is the money going?! it is seriously concerned, we have lost like thousands of dollars to the IRS and they insist there has been nothing since 2011.

personalfinance,Trying to build credit,"Good Afternoon,

Here is the situation. My brother is 23 and is in school full time living at home. He is in the Air National Guard so his school is paid in full. He has no credit. We added him to my card as a authorized user but it has not affected his score. 
He is deeply concerned about not having credit due to being 23 and wanting to move out at the age of 25 once he finishes school. 
He asked what is the best way for him to start developing credit. 
We came up with 3 ideas. 
1.	He opens up a credit card with me as a co-signer, as of now he can’t get approved on his own.
2.	He takes out a small federal loan of 3,000 that will eventually be paid to him since his school is already paid for. He would then pay the 3,000 off while he in school paying no interest since he would get a direct subsidized loan.
3.	He takes out a loan from a bank and buys a car with me as a co-signer so that he can make payments.
Just to clarify, I am only for option 1 as buying a car right now is a horrible Idea. 
Any ideas or concerns. 

Thank you for your time.",finance,1477691455
personalfinance,Question about an interesting letter I got today.,"Hello PF,
     I have been active here for a few months and i'm working towards paying down my debts, and my wife's. Right now we have various student loans, 2 car payments (1 with 1k left on the lien), a mortgage, and ~ 16k in credit cards that have built up over the years.

We make about 6k/month after tax and i just started using YNAB to track and pay off the major items like the CC's and cars before moving onto the student loans. Right now I am making progress but its a slow slow journey.

Today i got a letter in the mail from Discover about a personal loan (normal junk mail) but this one caught my eye. they are offering loans for debt consolidation with a lower interest rate, possibly as low as 7%. Right now our cards are all around 19-21%. I also read into the fine print and there is no penalty for an early payoff of the loan. 

I guess my thinking goes like this. Take a personal loan for the amount that would cover my CC's and the one car with a low balance. this would take away 650-700$ of minimum payments each month and put the balance into one loan that would require ~300 minimum. The gold here is that i can just start dumping money into a single account and save on interest.

Is this a good idea? I'm skeptical of junk mail but this kinda makes since unless i'm missing something, am i Missing something?",finance,1477692056

I have a disability and while I was requesting Total and Permanent Disability disbursement for my loans, my loans (which were to be disbursed) became late.

personalfinance,Should I refinance?,"I bought a home ~2.5 years ago, in the last few months i've been getting calls from my mortgage company telling me I should refinance because interest rates are lower. They offered me an interest rate a little bit lower at no cost to me, but I figured I would get a quote from the broker I originally bought the house with. 

I have attached images of my current mortgage statement as well as the quote I received from my broker. I have excellent credit and no debt besides the house. I plan to be in the house at least 4 more years, and when I move I plan on keeping it as a rental property. The 20 year quote attached has the payment going up $90 which isn't an issue as I always pay $100 more a month on my current plan. I do not want to get stuck with a mortgage that is a lot higher than this in case me or my fiance get laid off/ come across hard times etc. Any help or suggestions are appreciated. thanks! 

Should I refinance? 
Should I pay the total estimated reserves prepaid costs out of pocket up front, and then as I understand get a check back from all the money in my current escrow. As I understand it this would basically be a wash. Or should I roll the $7,000 into the loan and ""pocket"" the money i get back from the current escrow? 
Is the rate 3.375 decent? I have looked online a little at lending tree etc. and their estimates are a little bit lower. I'm a little hesitant to do everything through a website versus someone local whom I can sit down with at their office.

personalfinance,How does my budget look? Seeking advice on managing my debt,"25 year old white male living in the US. I graduated college two and a half years ago and have since been gainfully employed, although my credit spending has gotten out of hand and ballooned to over $10K, in addition to my student loans.

Here's where I'm at:


**MONTHLY BUDGET**

* - How does my budget look?
* - What's the best strategy to pay down my credit card debt?
* - A family friend just gave me $1,000. What should I do with it?
* - Should I reallocate my IRA/savings/emergency contributions to my credit card debt instead?
* - How bad is my situation, bigger picture? Some reassurance would help me sleep and calm my nerves. I am panicking.

politics,Megathread II: FBI / Clinton Emails,"##[Link to Megathread # 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/59vuny/megathread_fbi_reopens_investigation_into_clinton/?st=iuuh0p4m&amp;sh=b03249d7)

FBI Director James Comey has announced that the Bureau has discovered new emails that they believe pertinent to their previously closed investigation into fmr. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and her use thereof.

*****

**Text of the memo from Director Comey to Congress**

&gt; In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton’s personal email server. I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.

&gt; In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agree that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether the contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.

&gt; Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete the additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.

*****

**Statements from Secretary Clinton at a short press conference Friday evening**

&gt; We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes.  Voting is already underway in our country, so the American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately.

&gt;So we don't know the facts, which is why we are calling on the FBI to release all the information that it has.  Even Director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant, so let's get it out.


&gt; We’ve heard these rumors.  We don’t know what to believe. And I'm sure there will be even more rumors. That’s why it’s incumbent on the FBI to tell us what they're talking about.  Your guess is as good as mine and I don't think that’s not good enough.

Please use this thread rather than the subreddit at large to share relevant articles. Remember that all conversation must be kept on-topic and respectful of one another.

personalfinance,Credit card help,"So I'm in a bad situation....

A few years ago I racked up about 5,500 dollars on two separate credit cards, one through Wells Fargo (my bank) and one through Synchrony Bank (AEO store card, stupid I know) 

The Synchrony Bank card has an extremely high interest rate 26% I believe, so I was only able to make the minimum payments, my debt was going nowhere as the minimum payments pretty much only covered the monthly interest... flash forward to a few months ago, I had to move into a new apartment, on my own as opposed to having a roommate, and nearly doubled the rent that I was paying, thus.... making it impossible to pay my credit card bill...

I'm now 3 months in and I have been paying my Wells Fargo credit card, but I haven't had the money to pay the Synchrony Bank card.... I'm getting the usual debt collection calls, but I have been avoiding them because I'm so embarrassed and I don't know what to do. I'm at a loss and I'm really scared they'll repossess my car or sue me or something. 

I want to do a debt settlement/consolidation program, but I'm unsure of how they work and have heard bad things about them on r/personalfinance and on here... what are my options?!",finance,1477702811

It was all the rage even 5 years ago when people debated it on the Steam forums. The problem engulfed me so much, that I emailed David Kircher, who did the main work of ""Portal physics [and] Portal graphical effects"". Here's what he had to say.

**tl;dr at bottom**

&gt; First off I want to be clear that Portal's physics aren't even theoretical, they're entirely fictional. So there's really no right and wrong.

&gt; I have not read the entire thread, but I've got the gist of it.

&gt; In my opinion of what would happen. It really depends on how fast the crusher is moving.

&gt; We know that the cube sitting on the platform (referred to from now on as the orange side) has no velocity in world space.
&gt; We also know that as it emerges from the blue side, it must have speed equal to that of the moving orange portal. If the cube were a two dimensional object such that it transitioned all at once, it would necessarily fling at exactly the same speed as the orange portal.

&gt; The momentum of the blue side would be ""created"" as discrete portions of the cube's mass teleported and were instantaneously at speed.

&gt; The conundrum comes about while trying to determine what happens between the two states since the cube has to transition from one state to the other over some nonzero amount of time.

&gt; The key to my own understanding of what would happen during that transition is to think about what would happen if the crusher were moving extremely fast and then instantaneously stopped halfway through the cube. The orange side would have no momentum (well, a little, I'm getting to that) and the blue side would have a lot. At the point the crusher stops, the blue side's momentum would tug at the orange side. It would actually do this during the entire transition (the orange cube would lift off the ground before the crusher fully engulfed it). Which means that even in a zero gravity environment, some of the orange side momentum would only get redirected to the blue side and not ""created"" by the moving crusher, resulting in a slowed exit speed. In a gravity environment, said gravity on the orange side would bleed off velocity from the object, further reducing the exit speed.

&gt; So, if any of that makes sense. If the crusher were slow, you'd get a plop. If the crusher were fast you'd get a fling with a speed less than that of the crusher.

&gt; In the above text, I mention that momentum is ""created"" but it's not really. It must necessarily result from whatever energy goes into warping space such that a portal can not only exist, but move. It's just easier to imagine the result if portals have zero energy cost and energy can be created from nothing.

&gt; 

&gt; Again, entirely fictional and just my opinion.

&gt; -Dave

**Tl;dr: ""So, if any of that makes sense. If the crusher were slow, you'd get a plop. If the crusher were fast you'd get a fling with a speed less than that of the crusher."" - Kircher.**

Momentum WOULD be transferred (The ""B"" outcome). If the portal smashes onto the cube as shown, the amount of momentum would not be 0 (The ""A"" outcome). The real issue is figuring out how quickly it would be transferred, and how much would be transferred overall. In the end, there's no real right answer, as things are quite theoretical.

personalfinance,Which of these options are best for paying off my student loans?,"So I got a notice today that for lord only knows what reason, my student loan payments are going up fair significantly, in the range for about $90 a month. The good news however is that A. I owe relatively little (around $15,000) and B. I only have 4 years left to pay on them. All my loans are federally subsidized, ranging in interest rates between 2 and 6.5 percent. Even though this all sounds fine, my finances are already stretched pretty thin as it is, and that $90 is going to make a difference to me. So my goal for next year is to pay them off for good come hell or high water. So as I see it, I have a few different options for doing this.

1. Refinance and consolidate. I know very little about refinancing as it relates to student loans. Will this even benefit me? The loans I have the highest balances on are the ones with the highest interest. My credit score is about as close to perfect as you can get, so might I be able to get a better rate and end up with a lower payment?

2. 401k Loan. I currently have 2 401k's, one from a previous job with ~ $6,700 in it and one from my current job with ~ $21,000 in it. I know I need to roll over the old one into the new one, but assuming my employer allows it, would I be able to take a loan out for the balance of my student loans, and then pay it off at what would probably be an even lower rate than if I were to refinance? I know the potential pitfalls of 401k loans, but I don't think I will be leaving my job in the next couple of years, and see no reason to think I have any problems with job security. Is this sensible or just a really terrible idea?

3. Rid myself of my earthly possessions and live like a pauper which I chip away at them. After all my bills are settled each month, I generally only have a couple hundred dollars left in my account for luxuries like eating out or entertainment (yes, I do have an emergency set aside). I also have some side hustles going (legal ones), which add maybe a grand or two a year to my income. I do have some assets I could in theory get rid of if I absolutely positively had to, but they are things that I'd miss, video games, toys, various memorabilia from my earlier days running a movie theater. If I liquidated this stuff, I estimate I could raise in the range of $6000 - $7000, which would cut my outstanding debt in half. I really don't want to do this though.

So what do you think would be my best option at this juncture for ridding myself of my student loan debt?",finance,1477714167
personalfinance,"Me and the fiance have combined CC debt of $20,000, is debt consolidation for me?","I won't sit here and make excuses for the mass debt I've racked up, I got my first credit card when I started working at 18, and where before it was a ""go-to"" emergency card,  I began using it to buy the stuff I really wanted but couldn't afford at the time, then pay it off completely when I had the money. I guess in a sense you could say I did it the right way because by 21 I had a credit score in the high 7's and financed my first car, but here I am at 24, completely ignoring what I was taught about paying off my debts in whole or big chunks, and instead balance transferred my debts to lower interest/higher limit cards. I'm sitting at a 583 score, I personally have 12,000 in CC debt (I ONLY have CC debt), and because both me and my fiance took lower paying jobs to follow our careers (because we thought we could afford to at the time) I'm now experiencing the feeling of suffocation that is being in debt without feeling like I have a way out. I currently have one card in collection (biggest balance of 4800) with another one probably on the way (second highest balance of 4200) and all I wanna do is consolidate my debt. I can't make these payments all at once at different dates, plain and simple, if I would it would amount to over $400/m in payments across my 4 cards, my fiance isn't in as bad debt, and is managing her debt really well, but at the end of the day all of our money comes out of the same account, and her payments alone amount to ~275/m, combined it would be ~700/m is we actually made our MINIMUM payments on time every month, it's my understanding that consolidating my debt via a loan, while maybe  not the best idea for everyone due to the high interest, can pay off all debts and focus it down to one payment that (is probably) less than 700/m at (possibly) a lower interest rate. For me I feel like this would work best because of the fact that it would be just one payment, vs 7 payments throughout the month not including other bills (rent,car,utilities) I feel like one payment of one chunk amount would be better and easier for me, but I was hoping that you guys could give me a fresh perspective on what other options I might be able to pursue. thanks.",finance,1477715046

litecoin,"Uh, I’m Marketing Specialist (Guerrilla)","Uh, I’m Marketing Specialist (Guerrilla)

I’m so glad you brought this up! It’s the one thing that LTC lacks in and it’s ironic because LTC is the only coin deserving of a full-time marketing team. I think people are starting to finally realize that it’s all about the marketing, word of mouth and branding in crypto. To put this into perspective as a self-funded/semi-retired internet entrepreneur, I’ll tell you exactly what caused my successes and failures. Initially (when I was young), I would launch a service or product in which I used 90% of the budget for development and 10% left over for marketing resulting in failure. At this point if I ever launch a new product or service online 70%+ of the entire budget would be allocated towards the marketing, so I can’t stress the importance of this. 1 million CNY ($150k) applied to a dev team is absolutely incredible, but LTC desperately needs a monthly marketing budget as well. It would be fantastic if these Scrypt mining manufactures or farms could consider that expense the cost of doing business. $5k a month starting budget could really do wonders for creating awareness.  

You can see here that we desperately need to address this issue: (sleeping giant)
https://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=litecoin

There’s really no need for a DM regarding the marketing unless someone is brought on to manage a campaign, but I would like to give feedback publicly on what I’ve seen so far (since I’m all about community/transparency and appreciate feedback). I can be very direct and hurt people’s feelings, but the only thing that matters is the success of LTC for the sake of humanity (financial freedom from total economic enslavement), so here are my thoughts below. 

1.) Current Slogan. I’d like to first go over the silver analogy since Xinxi mentioned it earlier in a reddit post. Right off the bat there are pros and cons that I see with this association. 

Pros: During a BTC pump breaking ATH’s it is very beneficial being known as the Silver to Bitcoin’s gold as we’ve already seen demonstrated with the pump in late 2013. People feel that they missed the BTC boat and turn to an alternative that is underpriced and somewhat similar to BTC. Bitcoin paves the infrastructure path while Litecoin trails behind receiving all the benefits, such as the hardware wallet support. It positions Litecoin as a “non-threating” alternative to Bitcoin and acts as a logical trading pair. If you like BTC, then theoretically you should like LTC as well. The Bitcoin association to a digital gold is very powerful because many cultures still understand it as a monetary metal throughout history. I remember in 2011 the BTC community was really pushing that deep psychological comparison. In 2013, Bitcoin hit parity with gold reaching $1,200 and LTC at $48 which is also very similar to what we saw with physical silver. That was not by accident, but now that BTC has hit that objective I don’t hear thought leaders comparing it too gold much anymore and they claim one Bitcoin will be worth 1 million dollars feeding into that gold fever hype. The other issue with changing silver analogy is that Coblee literally designed LTC to be the silver to Bitcoin’s gold and produced 4x more inflation. LTC is also deflationary similar to gold, silver and Bitcoin so logically I guess it only makes sense. PM comparison takes a very complicated concept and helps simplify it for your average man on the street. 

Cons: What I don’t like about the silver association. So I believe most here will agree that Gold feels like it’s more important/sought after than Silver. Considering historically kings have access to gold and commoners have access to the silver. I do believe it’s hard for people to chant and cheer, “We’re #2, We’re #2, We’re #2!!!”. Do you see what I mean here? It’s hard to get Excited about that for people and the same goes with hoarding LTC vs BTC. It also creates a dependency on Bitcoin for eternity and keeps LTC under the thumb of the BTC overlords (I know some of them and they hate LTC). The association should be more like Pepsi and Coke or Ying to Yang and one could technically still operate without the other. If LTC dies (I doubt this), then people will forget about the silver association and just continue chanting for Bitcoin #1/Gold2.0/21 Million/I’m Rich Bitches. If BTC dies or is bottlenecked to death it would be nice for LTC to still exist in the minds of the crypto community and that dependence is also dangerous for LTC (as we keep seeing Bitcoins lack of scaling). You’ll notice every time BTC bottlenecks transactions that the price rally gets cut short again which affects the potential LTC rally. This is also a big part of why hedging out of BTC into alts such as LTC is important, but many think why would I hold LTC when I can just hold BTC so they invest in something totally different like ETH as a hedge. The other issue is the ratio and stability of LTC when the ratio both snaps back (short-term) and is suppressed (long-term), so it doesn’t make for the most stable currency when this occurs (although a 40x gain in value again would be nice). Many precious metal bugs will state that the physical gold/silver ratio should be around 1:16 ounces and technically if BTC/LTC had identical network-effect the value ratio would be closer to 1:4. Right now, we’re nearing 1:200 which is absurd. Not only that, this association is not so accurate because the gold and silver volume/ratio of atoms on this earth is unknown. While the tokens to exist currently and in the future are precisely known with BTC/LTC (1:4) which means LTC is actually even more undervalued than physical silver to physical gold. It would be nice to talk about LTC without ever having to mention BTC and I do feel it’s a setback, but at this point maybe necessary especially considering this next BTC pump. 


2.)  Slogan Suggestion. As you can see I am really on the fence about the silver analogy, so maybe we can just leave it as an unspoken association as we seen Bitcoiners mentioning gold analogy less and less. The funny thing is Coblee and Xinxi totally changed the game with LTC while nobody noticed. It’s so different that I almost think this one change alone has put the silver branding into question. By adding CT transactions and Segwit it provides enough differentiation from BTC to make it a more worthwhile hedge for wealth storage (This is important and helps maintain a higher per coin price). For those that want to save their earnings in a more private blockchain they now have a reason to transfer some BTC over to LTC or bypass it as a means of storage and we already know it’s much better for transfer. Coblee states fungiblity reasons, but I already know people will be taking a second look at LTC after this is implemented because I personally don’t like when people can see all my transactions at a particular address, so having both a fully public and private blockchain is a must. Not only that he knows about the censoring of coins for associations with the dark web even if you weren’t directly involved and that hurts fungibility, so once again the right decisions are being made. 

With that said, I would personally prefer LTC being considered the “The Swiss Bank of Money”. Money and Currency are actually two VERY different things by the way while gold/silver being money and currency being a derivative of that money. Obama was recently at South by Southwest and gave a speech mentioning crypto directly. It would be hilarious if we embraced his terminology of crypto. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsDijAoxG9g 

“It’s like having a Swiss Bank Account in Your Pocket.”

Another interesting point is the ironclad privacy that Swiss Banks were known for has been completely undermined by the US probing and global FATCA compliance for all other banks globally. There is no safe haven anymore and in a subtle way this almost alludes to LTC being the last bastion of financial freedom. Picture this, but instead LTC: http://i.imgur.com/yrQYmxO.jpg (The financial system is being completely turned upside down with some countries going to negative interest rates… AKA you pay them for holding your money, so that picture is very accurate.) 

3.) Litecoin Constitution or Oath. I will eventually get to the marketing aspect, but this all ties into everything, such as word of mouth. Every great company has a motto, a country a constitution or religions with commandments. It is important because it condenses down why we are here, our beliefs, what we are fighting for, our principles and what is out of scope of the vision or deemed acceptable. We’ve seen glimpses of this from Coblee like when he mentioned after an altcoin forked due to a theft that LTC will never hardfork due to a theft (So, let’s outline it for everyone). This is so important that I could even see a URL being dedicated to it so the world is clear as too what LTC is and stands for. 

An example of what this would look like:
Litecoin Beliefs/Oath:
- LItecoin will strive to be as transparent as possible in all aspects of development, marketing, future updates.
- Litecoin will strive to remain as decentralized as possible while maintaining a pristine blockchain. All aspects of management for social media and other platforms will also remain decentralized. 
- Litecoin will never reverse or roll back the blockchain or fork due to a theft or unauthorized transaction. 
- Litecoin will strive to operate the most financially fair network of wealth storage and transfer as possible. 
- Litecoin will always strive to bring modern financial access from the richest to the poorest and most remote people on earth. 
- ETC ETC. 

Something like this needs to be in place in the event Charlie goes MIA or anyone else in management so we have our guide stone in place. A wealthy individual looking to speculate in LTC and store his wealth there would feel much more comfortable if he knew what LTC stands for. The examples I gave above are how I perceive LTC but writing it in stone would make everything clear for everyone. 


4.) Enthusiastic Keynote Speaker. While I love Charlie to death and he’s fighting the good fight it would be nice to see someone like an Andreas equivalent for LTC (English/Chinese speaker would be incredible). When I hear Andreas speak about BTC I literally get goosebumps and my faith/passion is restored in crypto because sometimes we get beat down when our family and friends can’t see the “lite”. While I believe Charlie should never stop spreading awareness at as many events as possible he doesn’t come off as being very confident and a bit shy (which is fine). What I would like to see is high energy, passion, excitement and a confidence in LTC that is unshakeable. Assume the sale man! Charlie observed BTC operating in the wild, made a few tweaks and somehow made a better version of it capable of more yet incredibly stable/functional (without the suspect Satoshi early miner stash). However, I do understand it being difficult to hype LTC when there is not much to talk about since BTC hit all the talking points and LTC was no different other than 4x. For the future we really need to stress the scalability and fungibility improvements.  


5.) Thinking out of the box. Xinxi’s paper wallet suggestion if done on a grand scale could be quite massive for adoption despite how primitive it sounds. This is the type of thinking we need to bring LTC functionality/awareness to the masses. Get creative/think outside the box and reach out to the appropriate companies/visionaries or start a business (we need more entrepreneurs and now is the time to get involved and solidify your spot in the industry).

Some examples:
a. In previous posts we discussed the paper wallets for LTC. If I were to walk up to any person on the street and explain to them that I had one LTC paper wallet in my hand worth $4 and I would be willing to sell it to them for $5 and explained it was rare and similar to Bitcoin (second largest), in addition hit $48 in the past and could happen again and BTC is currently at $780.. I guarantee I could sell them on the spot. That could literally be turned in a business model and scaled as one idea that seems silly, but with awesome potential. 

b. Tonight I watched the unveiling of the new Tesla solar home roof in addition to the PowerWall 2 unit. Seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRqSkR4ENAg Who’s to say we couldn’t contact Tesla and integrate a Scrypt Asic chip into their future PowerWall 3 unit and offset homeowner’s extra battery power into the form of crypto. I mine BTC, LTC, DASH, ETH/ETC and LTC is by far the most profitable to mine, so maybe this actually could be viable. It’s out of the box and worth looking into from a technical standpoint. Coblee literally lives down the street and could meet with them. 

c. Another idea could be a sidechain mobile mining concept. I’ve thrown that idea around with the LTC devs, just to see what their thoughts were. It would have to be structured in a very particular way to work, but I believe there could be some merit there as well to draw in new users. I would really love some feature to be offered through this additional hash/computational power via a sidechain and potentially something like a Dash masternode for the monthly yield since for some the simple buy and HODL method doesn’t work for them. LTC is supposed to be “money”, so monthly yield is inappropriate similar to how gold doesn’t produce monthly yield by its very nature. 


5.) More Accessible Scrypt Miners. It looks like Alcheminer is gone and Titans are no longer obtainable leaving really only Innosilicons terminators older ones and the newer ones coming. It would be nice if we had more affordable smaller miners for your average joe. GPU dominates the word of mouth aspect because of accessibility. Any gamer can get involved, he gets a few coins and then tells his friends being that there is also financial incentive for him to spread awareness. It would be great if we could see more scrypt manufactures producing something to fill this niche. 

6.) Localbitcoins.com equivalent. I don’t want to offend anyone again, but the litecoinlocal.net website really does need work. Aesthetically it doesn’t look as visually appealing as LBC and also does not function as well. The .net extension is also not so favorable, so maybe they could acquire a .com equivalent and 301 it. In addition, I see little to no available trades which also does not bode well on the psyche of potential LTC investors. LBC is really a major backbone to Bitcoin adoption considering its functionality for the community and allows people to buy BTC in a more anonymous fashion. Plus, the owner of LBC makes great profit so there is much incentive for running a high caliber local exchange. 

7.) Marketing. There really is no marketing for LTC and I’ve never seen any marketing efforts on behalf of the LTC association other than maybe some sponsored ads on reddit (which is fine). This really does need to change because when we saw Dogecoin doing the Nascar stuff or Jamaican bob sled team, I was thinking my god why can’t we get a budget going to spread awareness. While I believed even at the time that their particular choices were foolish I was impressed that they were actually trying to bring about public awareness for Doge. We can maintain interactions on all the social profiles we want in the world, but we really need to be paying for ad placement on networks such as YouTube, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc etc. A/B split testing with a test budget would be wise and gauge interaction via a landing page. 

Side note: It’s funny one of my first projects when I was a kid was a penny stock newsletter site accessible via monthly subscription. We ran ads that were very professional and reasonable such as “Join our newsletter and receive monthly returns up to 20%-30%”. At the time that was very reasonable and realistic based on our track record/advice. The only problem was the ads performed horribly, but then eventually we said screw it and ran ridiculous ads like, “GAINZ of 30000X, GET RICH, GET BITCHES, LIVE ON BEACH IN PARADISE”…. And it worked almost too well. This tells me humans react off greed and dreams of grandeur. I see these claims with altcoins that get pumped which claims of “next Bitcoin” or will “overthrow Bitcoin”. I think that’ more sensational for most people and fills their dreams of becoming rich overnight. There’s those types of people and then there are the more ideological type like we see in the BTC community such as miners that will continue to mine at a loss because they believe so strongly in BTC or the HODLRS that won’t sell even when BTC loses half its value in 48 hours and people are shitting their pants. It would be nice if we could appeal to all demographics. 

I keep hearing about the LTC Association meetings. Why don’t we publicly post the meeting day/time do it via Google Hangouts so we can all listen in on the conversation. We really need to build a sense of community and that’s lacking as well. Outreach programs could also be a very inexpensive form of marketing. Such as contacting Twitch.tv for potential integration of LTC. If the fundamentals were explained I’m sure there would be successes in furthering adoption of the technology. 

If the Litcointalk.org website is not going to get fixed can we at least 301 it to the litecointalk.io address for now? Seeing ""Hacked"" at the top of the site doesn't instill confidence again... Not so great for branding... lol 

… to be continued. 

I’m starting to ramble. It’s 3am here and I’m half asleep. I’ll continue writing more on potential marketing efforts/ideas I’ve had (tomorrow). 

In the meantime, I’ve love to hear feedback on things I’ve shared so far.",cryptocurrency,1477740912

# **WEEK AHEAD: The presidential election has finally become the big threat for markets** - *[(CNBC.com)](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/28/the-presidential-election-has-finally-become-the-big-threat-for-markets.html)*

*****

&gt; ###The presidential election's final days could present new headwinds for markets and overshadow what are typically major events — a Fed meeting and the monthly employment report.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###The Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday is expected to signal that it is close to raising rates if the economy and financial conditions are right. It could even adjust the language in its statement to point more clearly at its next meeting, in December, as the time when it would hope to raise interest rates.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###The employment report Friday, always important, is expected to show that 175,000 jobs were created in October, and that the unemployment rate was a low 4.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. There are also dozens of earnings, including Facebook, BP and Pfizer, and other important data, such as Tuesday's auto sales and ISM manufacturing data.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###But in the last week of campaigning before the Nov. 8 election, the market could also be vulnerable to headline risk. Markets have been comfortable with the view that Democrat Hillary Clinton looks set to win the White House and that Republicans would likely hold onto the House of Representatives. That would create a status quo situation where there would continue to be gridlock. Wall Street has viewed GOP nominee Donald Trump as too unpredictable, and he has been trailing in the polls.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Friday's revelation that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is reviewing new evidence in connection with its investigation of Clinton's email server shook markets, sending stocks lower. The emails were found during the FBI's investigation into former Rep. Anthony Weiner, husband of a senior Clinton aide. Weiner is under investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit messages to a minor.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###""The market has gotten pretty comfortable with the thought of a December hike which de-emphasizes some of next week's Fed meeting and jobs report, but this election is now turning into a situation with the potential for Brexit-like volatility,"" said Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. Brexit is used to describe the U.K. vote last June to leave the European Union, which led to a temporary market sell-off.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Art Cashin, director of floor operations at UBS, said if Clinton wins, the investigation will be hanging over her. ""It certainly means that probably before the inauguration if the Republicans hold the House, there will be an investigation that lasts four years,"" said Cashin.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###Redler, who follows short-term technicals, said there were already some warning signs for stocks without the added election uncertainty. ""Breakouts are failing. Stocks are losing upward momentum, and the indices make it seem as if everything is fine and dandy. It's a push, pull,"" he said.
&gt; &amp;nbsp;
&gt; ###The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,126 Friday, a decline of 0.7 percent for the week, but also below a key support level of 2,130. The VIX, the market's fear meter, jumped 5.4 percent to 16.19 Friday, and was up more than 20 percent for the week.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: November Top Performing DJIA Month in Election Year**
&gt; November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&amp;P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-three DJIA and number-two S&amp;P 500 month since 1950. Since 1971, November ranks third for NASDAQ. November is best for Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 second best since 1979.

&gt; November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. The month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://66.media.tumblr.com/97712ebe99fa522efbadafe3e3ef8ca7/tumblr_inline_ofo8m3YX4i1spdppr_400.jpg))

&gt; November’s is a mixed bag in presidential election years. DJIA has advanced in 9 of the last 16 election years since 1952 with an average gain of 1.5%. Significant DJIA declines occurred in 2008 (-5.3%) and 2000 (-5.1%). For S&amp;P 500 November ranks second with a similar record to DJIA. NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 are not as strong ranking #8, #6 and #8 respectively. Fewer years of data (11 for NASDAQ and 9 for Russell indices) combined with sizable losses in 2000 and 2008 drag down rankings and average gains.

*****

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: Election Day: Bullish Day Before, Less So on Actual Day**
&gt; Looking back at the last sixteen presidential elections since 1950, the day before Election Day has a clear bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have declined just three times and average gains of 0.41% and 0.33% respectively. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 are slightly weaker, but still bullish. Election Day (or the day after prior to 1980) leans bullish, but with a greater frequency of losses. Incumbent party victories are shaded in light grey.

# **STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: NASDAQ performs best on November’s First Trading Day**
&gt; Based upon data in the now available 50th Anniversary Stock Trader’s Almanac for 2017on page 86, the first trading day of November is the sixth weakest of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been up 12 of the last 21 years on the first trading day of November. NASDAQ has the best record, up 15 times with an average gain of 0.37%.

gaming,[Rant] How modern technology ruined creativity,"Like all criticisms of things nerds like, this will probably be met will full blown denial and aggressive attempts to defend a company that gives zero shits about what I write. 

I've modded, developed and played video games for my whole life. Starting as a young boy with his first ever copy of Pokémon Stadium for the Nintendo 64. Which quickly became Mario Cart, which and Banjo Tooie, and Playstation, and Time Splitters and Call of Duty and PC, and Battlefield and Grand Theft Auto... as I grew up, so did video games, and they changed. 

I'm going to use Bethesda Softworks as an example. I know criticising them is the gaming equivalent of drawing Mohammed, but why should I care? 

Starting off with their Magnum Opus, namely Morrowind. 

Some of you might not have played it. Which explains why so many people enjoy the sequels. But Morrowind was something else. 

Morrowind wasn't just a game. It was a world. With history, culture, arts, literature, religions, politics, and the kind of full blown intrigue you'd expect to find in a well written novel. First and last time I ever saw this be depicted in such immaculate detail. 

Morrowind could be played two ways. Either you did quests, skipped dialogue, killed people, took their shit, sold it, levelled up, spent money on trainers, did more quests, and so on. The World of Warcraft approach. 

But for people who enjoy DnD and the R-aspect of an RPG. Morrowind offered a second, and very rare playthrough. It rewarded exploring, and talking to people. No two actors ever seemed the same. Hours of books to read, hundreds of topics to ask about, plethora of geographic diversity and fascinating details that just yearned to be examined. 

And if you did the latter, then Morrowind would become the kind of place you would never really forget. Ashland tribes were being compartmentalised by colonial interests of the Empire and the Tribunal. Their history was revised for political interest. Their people marginalised and alienated. You'd see a rural upper class enjoying the benefits of slavery, with a virtually non-existent abolitionist movement trying to stop them. 

You'd go to Vivec, a place that was praised as some kind of grand metropolitan paradise, with order and stability. Good business and progress. Well, that was just the surface, anyhow. The real Vivec became more obvious when you visited the St. Olms Cantons, and found a subjugated lower class living in squalor. Just about everyone was a criminal. The shopkeepers offered you rewards for sabotaging other shopkeepers. The Ordinators had a troubling habit of making people disappear, or end up getting tortured. Equipped with absurdly priced military gear that could feed the poor and the starving for years on the price of an Ebony Mace alone. In spite of the fact that the entire doctrine they supposedly reinforce is built on the notion of ""feeding the poor, educating the ignorant and caring for the sick.""

You'd find state sanctioned murder writs, quarrelling noble houses, rival gangs, and a chaotic underbelly that the Tribunal and the Empire conveniently overlooked for the sake of their own political interests. 

Everything about Morrowind was contrast. Moral gradience and authoritarian hypocrisy. It conveyed the governing forces as good guys through dialogue, and bad guys through subtext. It showed common knowledge that slowly turned into mass manipulation as you got further inside the large institutes. It presented the naive player with awe-inspiring rhetoric and principles if they joined as faction, that they were then forced to violate to move further up the ladder. 

Morrowind had its own history books, and even dissident criticisms of those books. It used the medium of eastern culture to depict western hypocrisy, and drew historical and political parallels at every conceivable avenue for the player who took a moment to look around.  

Morrowind was a game that didn't assume its primary consumer was an idiot, which is why its still a hundred times more entertaining than modern titles. 

Now let's look past Oblivion since while I do enjoy it a great deal, it is kind of underwhelming compared to Morrowind and Skyrim. 

So let's talk about Skyrim. Which tries to do what Morrowind does, but fails. For two reasons. Reason number one is that Bethesda was fairly mainstream at this point, and as a result, a lot of editorial policy for marketing purposes. Dumbing things down basically become a marketing law when things are popularised. 

But even so, they did try, and the compromise shows. We have the Stormcloaks. A bigoted populist movement who despise ~~Arab~~ Dunmer immigrants due to the ~~Syrian~~ Red Mountain refugee crisis. You have the Thalmor, a rhetorical greater evil to justify their presence. The Empire, a sort of cosmopolitan federation that remains morally tonedeaf and commonly despised by all the various populations it claims to represent. Might as well call it the Empire Union and drop the subtext entirely. It's all very on the nose this time, but at least they're making an effort. 

And then there's the whole Talos thing which is basically a historical juxtaposition in which the Nine Divines represent Protestantism, and the Eight and One, or whatever they call them, is Catholicism. Yawn. 

What Skyrim failed to convey were the motives, the undertones, the key figures and events. If Morrowind was inspired by historical literature, Skyrim is more along the lines of a series of News Broadcasts. A series of current events sort of stitched together with little analysis of its own big picture. 

Morrowind built an entire society with an underlining theme of autocracy. Both economic, political and theocratic. There was no singular issue, but rather a portrayal of injustice as a whole. Skyrim doesn't do that. 

And why? Well, like I said, there's a second reason. It's because for some idiotic reason, we value 3d graphics over good gameplay. They're following that demand. Meshes that could be modelled over a weekend, now takes the entire week. Time spent researching, writing and creating the world is now spent making the world look good. 

The dynamic topic system that allowed them to write entire novels worth of character development was thrown out, to be replaced with voiced dialogue. Which means that every single actor you made, and every single line they spoke, took a dent in the budget. When you're all complaining about Fallout 4's limited dialogue system, remember that. 

All in all, we've totally forgotten what makes an RPG great. And it's not the fucking high definition specular maps that coat the landscape as though someone coated the entire damn place in Crisco spray. It was the world itself that they now spend more time polishing than they do developing. 

Even so, it's not over. Because the gaming industry is changing. Ubisoft, Electronic Arts and all the other big publishers are slowly becoming dinosaurs. It's the indie market that's coming back. And why? Because indie devs don't really give a shit about next-gen graphics! Instead they use the same creativity that made the aforementioned dinosaurs so successful in the first place!

personalfinance,Invest cash out from a refinance or stick with no cash out option.,"We are in the process of refinancing our house to get rid of PMI as we now have more than 20% equity in the home. We have the option to take out up to $23358 within the 20% equity limit. I am under the impression that we should do this and invest it in passive low fee index funds because the interest on the loan in 3.75% and investing should on average achieve a higher return. I will include details and initial calculation below.

Aside from a straight investment perspective, we would have this invested in an account where we could convert it to cash if we needed it in an emergency. At the moment we do not have the proper amount in an emergency fund. So this will not be in an IRA. We will be continuing the contribute the same amount as now to our retirement accounts. 

I would like to know if I am overlooking anything or making any incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions. Is expecting at least a 4% average yearly return on passive S&amp;P 500 index funds with low fees reasonable?


-------Scenario One – No Cash-Out

Initial principal: 208900

Interest rate: 3.625%

monthly payment reduction: $275 (this is coming from lowering our interest rate, and removing PMI)

28% equity in the home


--------Scenario Two – Max Cash Out 

Initial principal: 232000

Interest rate: 3.75%

monthly payment reduction: $122 

cash out to invest: 23358

20% equity in the home


---Total cost of loan calculation (long term):

Using standard mortgage payment formulas I calculated the total cost of the loan if we paid it off by year in the first column. This won’t be completely accurate because for the first couple of years we won’t be paying substantial amounts of additional principal (if we ever do, given the low interest rate).

+----+--------+--------+-------+--------+

| yr |     No    |  Cash  |      4%   |   6%    |

+----+--------+--------+-------+--------+

| 15 | 271124 | 303688 | 42519 |  57323 |

| 20 | 293999 | 330120 | 51915 |  77320 |

| 25 | 317958 | 357835 | 63388 | 104293 |

| 30 | 342969 | 386794 | 77397 | 140675 |

+----+--------+--------+-------+--------+

Five scenarios are given for average yearly return on the 23358 between 4-6% for 15, 20, 25, or 30 years.  It seems for the assumed minimum 4% the investment route always makes up for the increased price of the mortgage. I am aware this may not happen and understand we could lose the money we are investing.

I haven’t taken out taxes on this amount, but from what I understand if the investment or underlying assets in the index fund are held for over a year they are taxed as capital gains at 15%; otherwise, they are taxed at the normal income rate.

personalfinance,Buying a new car and wanted some advice on insurance and other things,"I have bad credit. I have a repo and some miscellaneous medical debt. 

I had been working on getting the medical debt removed and not planning on buying a car this weekend. But the dealership roped this dope. 

The car is a 2016 Dodge Charger SXT and includes the blacktop, and  travel &amp; navigation packages. 

The sicker price was $33,080, but I got them to knock the price down to less than $29,000 (before taxes and what not) by walking out on their other offers.

The interest rate offered was 12.xx% and monthly payments $605. I'll be putting $4,000 down.

Everything has been finalized, just waiting for the dealership to get the car in as they didn't have one on their lot.

My first question is: did I do gud? Seriously, this is the second time I've bought a car. And while I feel like I'm doing a better job of things this time around, I crashed and burned pretty badly last time. So that doesn't really mean a whole lot.

My second point of concern is this: The interest rate is garbage. It's crazy high. But that's because I have bad credit. In the future is refinancing an option? If so, when should I look into it?

If I were to pay an extra $400-$600 a month towards the principal, how would that affect my refinancing options in the future? Would it be a positive, negative, or neutral? 

I make roughly $1200/w gross on average and I basically have no bills ATM. So paying the extra is NP. I can do that and still save up for my future plans.

My third concern is insurance. I checked Geico, State Farm, and a local third party agent. All three quoted me the same thing, nearly around $250/m. Simply ridiculous. I spoke to a State Farm rep and she said it's largely because I've gone so long without insurance coverage. Which is insane if you ask me. I'm expected to have insurance even though I didn't have a car! What insanity is this? 

But I digress, I realize a part of that is also my car I chose is apparently an expensive car to insure. Whatever. 

I don't really expect to be driving my car very much at all. So I'm going to ask about low usage discounts. Anything else I should ask about?

Somehow, Capitol One decided to send me a pre-approved credit offer at a high interest rate (over 20%), but no annual fee.  I'm actually confused why - my credit score has always been a thin file.  All I can guess is that my wife's good credit was a factor, or that I have enough in various accounts that I'm good for it.

So I'm game - lets play the FICO game!  I applied and got approved in five minutes.  The card arrived a week later.  I set it up to autopay the full amount each month, transferred my cell phone bill to it, and tossed the card in a drawer.  From what I've read, this should be enough to build credit.

Now what?  I have no foreseeable need for credit.  Another house isn't in our plans.  We're not ever buying motor vehicles with a car loan.

What I'm saying is that short term, I don't really need great credit.  But as a tool, I'd like to establish it in the long term.  So what should I do?

I made a throwaway account so it won't be linked to my usual account.  

I'm about to graduate from college with a degree in Engineering soon. I'm actually graduating with about $8K in savings, and no debt. I've worked during school and overtime in summers to manage this, plus large scholarships are nice. I took a small loan my first year that was subsidized, I think it was $1500ish, but I paid it off that summer, before any interest needed to be paid, but that is my entire history with debt. I've actively avoided anything related to debt, I have no credit card, just a debit card. No other loans and the such. I have been very fortunate in this regard.  

I'm graduating in about 6 months, and I have an engineering job lined up. I'd prefer not to disclose where or how much it is, but it is engineering wages, I'll say that much. I'm currently looking at buying a condo right away when I graduate (the town is large, even if I get cut from the company, I have no worries about getting a new job without relocating). This is because I save the money from the rent I'd pay is essentially going towards paying for something I'd own. I'm not looking for a house, just not what I want personally. The range I'm looking at is ~$150K, plus or minus. Going off of that, and my wages, and some rough estimates of what my expenses will be, and based on the estimates websites are giving me not knowing my exact info (giving me standard interest rates), I can easily make payments for a 10 yr loan(including association fees). Yes, I'm aware, I could probably make money from interest in investment more than what I'd pay in the interest for a longer loan, but I'd prefer to get it out of the way.

I guess I told you this whole story to ask, with no credit, fresh out of college, am I still able to get reasonable loans? Does a shorter life loan request look better to the lenders, or do they not care about how long my loan is, just how much credit and money I have? What about the fact that I graduated with no debt? To me, that would look good, does it to a lender, or do they not see that? Any other advice?

It seems as though Origin has been updated since the last time I tried to fix this, but its still giving me the same run around.

Its advice 'if my account is linked to the wrong account' is to - 
Step 1: log in to Origin, go to the friends bar, then ad a friend... which friend? It comes up with a search bar saying ""search for friends"". 
Step 2: In the import friends menu, you can choose to ""connect""... What connect? What import? Im still not out of fucking step 1 yet.

What EAGames SHOULD do, is simplify this shit. You should be able to login to the EAGames website, and choose MANAGE ACCOUNTS, which follows with 'linked accounts'. This is the way most companies do it. Hell, even 2K just simply gives you a generated code to enter to their website when you want to upload logos and gamefaces, without even logging in to anything.

financialindependence,How fancy lunches could be costing you a year of your life,"Most of you here are competent with the ideas of personal finance and the road to FI/RE, and don't need to experience a condescending regurgitation of ""don't drink a latte from Starbucks every day, try to make your own lunch, don't put gold leaf on your cakes and caviar in your salads"", but I ran these numbers myself and they're extremely shocking to me. This means that I am obligated to make a reddit post about them, of course.

Let's take an extreme example. Let's say you are (and let's be honest, if you use this subreddit you probably are) a software engineer living in - can you guess it? - the Bay Area. Let's say you make $150k total comp, which is reasonable as we're not guessing your experience and it's the Bay Area. The following example can be extended to any high COL, high salary area. I am assuming you are single.

After Federal taxes, State taxes + FICA, you are left with $98,620 take-home pay (in California). Let's say you are off of work for the equivalent of five weeks each year, giving you 226 working days each year. 

Because you don't want housemates to see you masturbating over FI blogs on a daily basis, you decided you wanted to live in your own in a humble studio apartment. Because this is the Bay Area, this costs you the low, low price of $2,800 a month. Let's then say you enjoy some luxurious grocery shopping, so you pay $300 for groceries each month for yourself. Health insurance is $300 a month too. Entertainment, well, let's use $300 a month for that also. Utility bills, including electricity and gas? You know what, let's use $300 a month for that also. Obviously these numbers may vary but they will do for our little example, I'm averaging to $300 a month for each section. You may spend, for instance, more on entertainment and less on groceries, but this is our wiggle room.

This gives you a monthly expenditure of $4,000 a month, coming to a nice $48,000 a year. Subtract $48,000 from $98,620 and you're left with $50,620, and a savings rate of *51.3%*. Networthify thinks this will allow you to retire in precisely *16 years*. Not bad! And that assumes you have precisely 0 in assets and experience no wage growth over those 16 years.

But what if one day, just after crunching those numbers and making these plans, your colleagues invite you out to a lunch and coffee with them? After all, it's just one. It can't make a big difference, can it? So you go with them, and after sales tax is included, your little fancy lunch and coffee comes to $15. 

But then this doesn't just become a one-off. What if it becomes a routine, and you do this - say - three out of five working days? Or perhaps four, spending a little less but maintaining the same overall spending on lunch each week?

226 * 0.6 rounds to 136 fancy lunches each year. At $15 a lunch this  is *$2,040* of fancy lunches a year. I hope you're going somewhere nicer than McDonalds with that amount of money spent.

Let's subtract $2,040 from $50,620, giving us *$48,580*. This brings your saving rate down to *49.2%*.

Doesn't seem like a big difference, right? It's only 2.1%, it can't hurt too much? Actually, that 16 years just became *17 years*.

You lost a year of possible retirement or financial independence due to your fancy lunches. That's not as attractive now, is it?

Keep in mind this already assumes quite a high spending on groceries, and you could easily make quite a nice lunch for yourself each day with that kind of spending!

You may ask what the point of this example was. Everyone has different incomes and different expenditures, after all, I averaged multiple sections out to $300 a month and you may spend more or less. But the same principles apply to everyone. Earning less means it's even more of an issue. And earning more may make it less of an issue, but you still need to weigh up whether the many months or possible years you will be losing are worth not having to make your own lunch.

And besides, making your own probably tastes better anyway.

I am a 26 year old male and DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipient which gives me a work permit to work in the U.S.

In April 2016 I started working for a school district in southern California. This job, compared to my job history is high paying and offered medical benefits, is my third job putting me at a whopping 56 hours per week. 

Unfortunately, I have a huge problem. My new job has a union, the union contract apparently requires me to either A. Have health benefits through another job or purchased privately, or B. Purchase their health benefits.

Having NEVER had health insurance of any kind, I did not know any of the procedures and paperwork required. HR contacted me on August 31st  and told me that I was to come in and fill out paperwork to start my health benefits, this is when I also found out I could not decline the benefits due to my union contract. 

Long story short I could not deny the benefits and I was forced to fill out the paper work.

I am now paying $525 of health insurance premiums which are all deducted from only ONE paycheck per month. I went from making $1,641 per month at this job to making $1,116 pre tax. 

My circumstances and budget are so bad right now that even if i wanted to take advantage of these health benefits I do not have enough money to pay the co-pay for the visit.

Now, since I am a DACA recipient I am exempt from the Affordable Care Act's mandate of requiring health insurance. 
To the same extent I am not eligible for Federal Assistance and I have been denied when I use Covered California due to my residency status.

I have tried reaching out to my Union and they cannot help me stating that I MUST have health insurance elsewhere before they discontinue my benefits from the district.

I have tried reaching out to HR and they cannot help me stating that the union contract is to blame.

I have tried applying to [Medi-Cal](http://www.iibayarea.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/How-To-Enroll-in-Medi-Cal-DACA-v1.pdf) but apparently my income is too much. 

I am married and my wife stopped working in February to start nursing school. 

Buying insurance privately is too expensive from what I have shopped around for, not to mention most don't offer coverage until January 2017 by which time I would be several months into collection on many of my bills. 

I know $525 might not be much to some people but when you are living paycheck to paycheck for the last 8 years on minimum wage, those $525 are about one paycheck at a part time job. 

Any suggestions are of big help. I'm falling behind on bills at an alarming rate and I feel desperate.",finance,1477879898

personalfinance,[Help] 30+yo. No retirement savings yet. Got $25k in the bank.,"Hi!

Foolishly, I've reached my 30s and don't have any retirement savings. The good news is I also don't have any debt. I either pay my credit card in full each month, or only ever leave $1k or less recurring (which, I know is still not perfect). I have about $25k in savings. Part of this I could consider my emergency fund, maybe $12k, and the rest I plan to use to support myself in an upcoming career change. I'm going to be switching from a reliable, well paid job, to being an artist who works a bar job and tries to get paid for art. 

What I'd like to do is:

1. Set up an IRA or a Roth IRA via Vanguard. I've already paid tax on all the cash in my bank so I may as well put that into a Roth and open a Traditional for future earnings as an artist(?)
2. Start putting 10-15% of anything I earn toward my retirement. Probably just in a target-date retirement fund that has about 80% stocks for now, I guess(?). 
3. Put my $12k emergency cash in there in an investment that's pretty safe and pretty liquid but gets better results than the abysmal 0.03% interest rate in my savings account. Is there anything specific you guys recommend that would make sense? I could put in $3k in a 12 month T-Bill or something and another $3k in 3 months, and so on, until I have $3k that matures every 3 months and I can put back in to a 12 month, so I'm never more than 3 months away from $3k—if needed. Thoughts?

Would it make sense for #2 and #3 to all go into a Roth IRA so I can take money out of that when needed? Or is that silly?

Any and all advice, and specific funds/accounts/amounts I should consider would be most appreciated! I have the desire but also a bit of analysis paralysis, and at this stage I want to just start taking action.

I've recently been appointed to a senior government role focusing on energy policy. This role will be overseeing energy policy (not alone) for one of the largest sub-national administrative regions in the Western world.

I get briefed by the experts in our field on a lot of different policies - nuclear energy, energy storage, electric vehicles, cap and trade, carbon taxes, renewable energy, distributed energy resources.

I'd like to seek this forum's advice on other materials that may be helpful to me in providing advice and shaping energy policy, particularly focusing on emerging or pioneering trends/innovations in energy infrastructure, policy or technology.

These recommendations can be books, articles, papers on the latest trends in electric vehicles, or electrification of transit systems, or the development of energy storage.

For the sake of this request, assume I am a layperson and not an expert on energy policy. What journals would you recommend I subscribe to? Are there energy experts who have podcasts or online viewing materials?

So it's my first time playing solo and I'm quite nervous because I haven't touched this game in years. I don't remember any controls, tactics or ANYTHING.


Here's innocent 'ol me- I spawn by the water and walk to a barn, the barn has nothing so I find this pretty decent sized town with a few houses and another barn up the road. I think, ""Alright, I'll check this one house out and leave so I don't get caught in case someone is in the area.""


So I go into the house, find nothing and leave. I'm walking near a tree outside when I'm prompted to look for apples, so I do so. Next thing I know I look up and there's a man in swat gear aiming a rifle at me from behind this nice white fence. I am very nervous, so I crouch and stand, hoping that he will take this as a ""truce"". The man walks past me and back again. I didn't even notice he handcuffed me. He tells me to follow him to the barn down the dirt path, so I do.


*cut to 3 Russian men staring at me from different places while I walk down a dirt road, handcuffed*


I get to the barn and he gives me a blood transfusion (which is supposed to make me faster after a certain amount of time?) I'm then taken along the main road to walk to the next town and sift for apples and recover remains of bodies. Along the way I'm asked about my life, about my teammates (which I never had) and he tells me brief moments of his in game life. He also asked if I knew about Hillary Clinton's email scandal for some reason, but that's beside the point.

personalfinance,Critique my budget?,"Hope this isn't an annoying post. For the first time in my life I'm fairly financially stable (aka not in school and accruing debt) and I've been tinkering with how to deal with my budget. I make about $52,000/yr before taxes, which ends up being about $3500/mo after taxes and 403b/insurance deductions, conservatively. Housing is about $850/month including utilities, with a roommate. My current student loans are about $19,000 federal at 4.66% and $25,000 to my parents. I have about $10,000 in combined savings. 

Currently I've been putting 6% towards retirement, since that's how much my employer matches at 50%. I put 11% of my paycheck toward my emergency fund, 10% towards federal student loans, and 9% towards my loan to my parents. At the end of each 2-week pay period I usually have a few hundred dollars left over, which I usually split up between savings and federal loans. 

My short-term goal is to have a comfortable 3-month emergency fund, which I should reach around January/February. At that point I plan on upping my 403b contribution to 8%. 

My longer-term goals are a 6-month emergency fund, and a house fund. This is where I'd like some advice. I want to buy a home (probably condo) within a few years, since owning a home makes more sense than renting in my area. This means that I'm not putting all my extra money towards my loans, but I don't think it makes sense to wait 6+ years before I even start saving for a home considering how rapidly rental prices have been rising every year. (Five years ago I paid almost half of what I'm paying now to live more centrally.) So I've been trying to strike a balance between saving and paying off loans, and I'm not sure exactly where the balance is. Currently I throw a little money into my house fund from what's left over at the end of each pay period. My sense is that once I have a 3-month emergency fund, I'm going to start putting more of my money towards the house fund. Is that a reasonable plan? Am I balancing my savings/loan repayment goals well?

Currently, our mortgage is ~148k at 4.125% (minimum monthly payment ~1350).

My student loan is at ~36k at 3.760% ($558 minimum monthly payment, but paid ahead until late 2018).

We have talked with a refi company, and we can currently refinance our mortgage at a rate of 3.513% for a 20 year mortgage (1327 minimum pmt), or 3.263% for a 15 year mortgage (1510 minimum pmt). These are a significant savings for our current mortgage over the life of the loan. Plus the interest rates are a good discount on the student loan as well. I am considering asking the company if it would be possible to roll the student loan into the mortgage - which apparently can be done. This would allow us to capitalize on the lower interest rate, and it also allows us to budget for a single large bill each month. 

However, it would prevent us from paying off the student loan as early as we had planned. It would also mean losing out on the tax credit for the student loan interest. It could also have an impact on the offered rates for the mortgage.

Before I begin, I just want to say that I realize how much of a long-term mess/hole I've created for myself here.  I feel so stupid that I've let this happen.  But at this point, I want to confront this as best I can and develop some kind of strategy to at least try and fix it.

By way of background, I am 28 years old and just finished law school.  I start my first lawyer job next week.  My salary will be $70k per year, which, after taxes and deductions, should be about $3,700 per month (I also plan to keep looking for higher paying jobs).  I'm wondering how I can most efficiently use this income to fix my current financial situation.

To outline my financial picture, I currently have about $10k cash in the bank, which I saved working this past summer and during the school year.  This money was intended to be my emergency fund and I'd like to avoid touching it, if at all possible.

My primary financial problem is that throughout college and law school, I've accumulated about $225k in student debt ($125k private and $100k federal loans).  It looks like my minimum monthly for all loans combined will be about $1500 per month (though they are currently on the longest repayment plan).  My other current liabilities include: $10k in credit card debt (on two cards -- the minimum payment each month is $100 on the first card and $150 on the second), rent is $750 per month (after dividing with my roommate), $150 per month car payment (about two years left to pay it off), $85 per month car insurance, about $250 in groceries, and about $200 in utilities, internet, cell phone, etc.

Now, calculating all the monthly expenses against my monthly income, I will be cutting it very close each month.  I'm wondering -- what is the best way to make this work on a month-by-month basis.  Also, what would the best strategy be for paying down the student debt and my credit card debt?  Should I take the $10k in my bank account and pay off the credit cards off the top, or should I maintain the emergency fund and pay as aggressively as possible going forward?  How would you handle this situation?  What would my options be long-term to start to resolve the student debt?  Also, any suggestions for supplementing my current income?  It would be nice to bring in an additional $10-20k per year, if possible.

Not crushing debt like some people here that are inspirations when they get everything together, but enough to make me have agitta and stay up at night.

I was married with a child. We got divorced, she got the house. After staying with my parents for a bit, and getting a bit ( a lot) spendy, I moved out and got an apartment with shared costs. 

I take home $1466 every other Thursday from my job, which I have been at for 4.5 years. Also, I am going back to school to finally finish my Associates Degree, with plans of getting a Bachelors in Heath Information Management (Haven’t nailed that down yet, still need to finish the associates).

Here is where I stand. My credit card debt is at $18,465. I do have two cards that are currently at 0% interest and I can pay those off quickly, if I can free up some money monthly. So I am looking at a nut of $11,723.39.

I have set up a payment plan to do a snowball payoff for the cards, but I am at the point where just from financial obligations (Rent, child support, car payment, insurance, and minimum payments on cards) I am getting squeezed to the breaking point. 
Its not that I can’t afford it, and I have started making strides to resolve the issue, but I am squeezed to the point where I am getting nervous that if something were to happen, I have no wiggle room at all.

And then the idea of a 401(k) loan floated past me. 
So I understand how the loan works, I pay quarterly, with 4.5% interest. My average interest rate at the moment is 17.33%. My payment on the $11,723.39 would be $657.86 a quarter, or $219.28 a month. I can up that per month rate with the freeing of the minimum payment obligation, and start an emergency savings account.

I was doing some reading and got mixed opinions on doing this. Dave Ramsey, is not for it. Nerd Wallet is good with it. 
I just wanted to get the opinion of PF to see if anyone else has done this, or if there are any arguments for or against it. 

If anyone needs more detailed information, please let me know, I can provide. Just wanted to give the minimum amount of information pertaining to the question.

She just got a part time job and will now be making about $20,000. She doesn't start until December. I'm trying to stay optimistic but, frankly, this last year has turned me into a shell of myself.

- $300 monthly car payment, plus $125 for insurance. I have $8,000 left on the car. That's exactly what it's worth. 4.5% interest rate.
- Internet and phone bills that are not bad. Cut the cable years ago.
- Okay, here's where it starts to hurt: two credit cards with $10,000 each on them. Both at 18%. Paying the minimum on both currently, but interest charges mean I'm basically never paying them off. I recently rolled $4,000 (the max I was allows) of one card onto a Chase Slate card. So now it's 10k, 6k, 4k.
- The house needs work. I'm trying to ignore that. The utilities are... expensive. $400 estimated, probably more but I'm scared to do the math.
- $3.50 in library fines.

- $21k sitting in my old 401k (Vanguard 401k)
- $2k in an old roth IRA (Betterment)

Should I be focusing on paying these off all at once, or should I wait and pay them off on the regular schedule and just invest the rest. My employer matches 50% up to 8% (I put in 8%, they will put in 4%). 

Just looking for ways to get out ahead of this before I graduate.

Edits: I will be living in Michigan, by myself. I have a car that is paid off completely and that I expect to be useful for at least the next 3-4 years. I plan to get an apartment, and hopefully get a roommate. Day to day, I tend to live pretty 'frugally', but once every couple of months i like to enjoy a nice get away (spending less and $600 each time, about 4 times a year).

personalfinance,"Worked half a year, unsure of how a marriage affects tax return, current insurance, etc. (xpost from /r/legaladvice)","(Was hoping to get an answer there about whether my marriage would affect me at all if I never did anything with it.)

I'm 18 and still with my parents (on very good terms, part of the family, going to college at home, took a gap year to work full time for a bit) and I'm thinking about getting married for sentimental reasons. I'm going to pick up another full-time job soon and plan to attend school jobless in fall 2017.  A few questions:

Will the marriage have any bearing on my position if I don't report it? Should I file with my parents as a dependent or, since I'd be married and technically no longer a dependent on paper, would it be wise for me? Would getting married affect my application for federal aid and how I would report income? (Yes, either my or my parents income is still low enough to qualify me for federal aid)

*at /r/legaladvice advice, I was told a marriage would mean I wouldn't be submitting an application as a dependent. Seconds on this?

At the end of the day I can still afford school without debt or aid; I'm looking to get a better picture of my circumstances and their implications. I would also be fine with reworking my current situation (getting separate insurance policy, filing independently, etc.). Mostly I just want to know if change is an option. I remember stories of people not even finding out they were legitimately married from a cheap wedding until they tried to get married for real... fact or fiction that a marriage certificate doesn't actually have any bearing unless reported?

I'm also thinking about how it's odd to be married and not immediately living with each other, going to school separately.

Generally, all avenues are open to me financially and wouldnt mean disaster. I just wonder about what the best move is for us as a couple.",finance,1477944570
personalfinance,Small business owner needs help with investing,"Hi r/personalfinance! This may be inappropriate to post here, but I need some advice. I am a modestly successful business person. I didn't attend college but managed to start and grow a small B2B consultation firm to a point where I am more or less comfortable and mostly financially stable for the time being. I own two homes and owe 150k on one and 250k on another with interest rates at 4.5 and 4, respectively. I have no other debt.

Over the last ten years growing my business, I have managed to save around $200k in cash that is sitting in a savings account. While I am self taught in my industry, I have no investing experience or knowledge to speak of. I'm aware, though, that folks that do have knowledge in the area of investing consider that much cash in a savings account to be a complete waste.

My question to this community is, what would be the best and safest option to invest the cash I have on hand? My lack of knowledge and subsequent fear means that without direction that cash will continue to sit in savings. I have talked to a financial adviser or two, but find that I'm uncomfortable with the idea of trusting them since I have such limited knowledge of the markets they seem eager to help me invest in.

Any advice you guys could give would be very appreciated!",finance,1477946878

investing,stockAday: Livin' DaVita Loca? $DVA,"# Key Stats for Davita Inc

It's one of those Healthcare companies that's indispensible to its clients, delivering kidney dialysis services. But should it be an indispensible part of your portfolio?

# Description
DaVita Inc is primarily a provider of kidney care services (62% of sales) though they also have an integrated health care delivery and management company (38% of sales).

&gt; Our U.S. dialysis and related lab services business is a leading provider of kidney dialysis services for patients. As of December 31, 2015, we provided dialysis and administrative services in the U.S. through a network of 2,251 outpatient dialysis centers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, serving a total of approximately 180,000 patients. We also provide acute inpatient dialysis services in approximately 900 hospitals and related laboratory services throughout the U.S.

* That's 180k of the estimated 470k+ patients in the US.
* 66% of these sales are paid for on US Medicare / Medicaid.
* They do have 10k patients outside the US, but that only equates to 1% of sales

Next to the HCP division: HealthCare Partners:

&gt; As of December 31, 2015, HCP had approximately 807,400 members under its care in southern California, Colorado, central and south Florida, southern Nevada, central New Mexico and central Arizona through capitation contracts with some of the nation’s leading health plans. Of these members, approximately 317,400 individuals were patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage, and the remaining approximately 490,000 individuals were managed care members whose health coverage is provided through their employer or who have individually acquired health coverage directly from a health plan or as a result of their eligibility for Medicaid benefits.

So it's an HMO, right? (Sorry, as a foreigner I don't really understand paid healthcare ;)

## Recent financials 

So the toplines done well over the last 5 years. But there's been trouble recently on the margin front. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $14bn | $13bn | $12bn | $8bn | $7bn|
|EPS | $1.25 | $3.33 | $2.89 | $2.74 | $2.57|

As management explained:

&gt; Dialysis and related lab services operating income for 2015 decreased by approximately $378 million as compared to 2014, which includes a settlement charge of $495 million in 2015 and a loss contingency accrual of $17 million in 2014. Excluding these items from their respective periods, dialysis and related lab services adjusted operating income for 2015 would have increased by $100 million. 

So perhaps it was a one off? Plus there was a similar set of charges to the HealthCare division in 2015.

With forecast EPS of $3.76 it does seem like Wall Street thinks the worst has past!

## Competition

The competition section is curious. As they refer to Fresenius and themselves having a combined 70%+ market share. Though Fresenius and Baxter are also equipment providers. i.e. their competitor Fresenius is also a major supplier of theirs.

On the HCP unit side it's local managed care organizations, hospitals, medical groups and individual physicians that are the competition.

And looking at the numbers they are fine on the margin side, though a little weak on the returns.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Davita Inc | $14,358M | 18% | 7%
Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co. (ADR) | $17,572M | 18% | 12%
Baxter International Inc | $10,121M | 14% | N/A
Humana Inc | $54,531M | 5% | 9%
UnitedHealth Group Inc | $180,904M | 8% | 19%

## Cash / Debt?

Davita Inc has $7,423M of net debt. That is 2.9x it's latest operating profit. A little high for my liking, though I suppose this is a business with pretty stable contracts and a large part of the revenue is coming from Uncle Sam.

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $74.73 for Davita Inc and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 35% to their target.

# Valuation

Clearly, equipment / services firms like Fresenius and Baxter are at a premium to HMOs like Humana and UnitedHealth, but does DVA really deserve a discount to both groups?

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/dva/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
DVA | $11,413M | 15x | 13% | 0% | 10%
FMS | $25,005M | 21x | 11% | 1% | 9%
BAX | $25,672M | 25x | 14% | 1% | 0%
HUM | $25,499M | 18x | 14% | 1% | 6%
UNH | $133,668M | 18x | 15% | 2% | 8%

# Dividends
Davita Inc is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. Why?

&gt; We have not declared or paid cash dividends to holders of our common stock since 1994. We have no current plans to pay cash dividends and we are restricted from paying dividends under the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our senior notes. 

Though they are happily spending over $500m a year buying back stock.

# Catalysts
In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by -28% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -5%. That's against a backdrop of sales up 9% in the last 6 months. Odd eh?

Well, on the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they spoke of the HealthCare Partners unit:

&gt; Unfortunately, year-to-date we have financially underperformed relative to plan and we expect this gap to increase in the second half of the year.

Sadly the impact is not short-term but long term. 

So, is the bad news priced in? If the Kidney services business strong enough to carry the HMO?

In terms of the bad news, you should probably not forget the [one-off charge](http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/04/davita-will-pay-495-million-to-settle-atlanta-whistle-blower-case/) in 2015...

&gt; DaVita HealthCare Partners said Monday it will pay up to $495 million to settle a whistle-blower lawsuit accusing the Denver company of defrauding the federal Medicare program of millions of dollars. The company, which said it does not admit any wrongdoing, has now settled its third whistle-blower lawsuit since 2012, with payouts totaling nearly $1 billion.

May be this is the real reason the stock's at a discount?

personalfinance,Credit Karma is adding a binding arbitration clause to their terms of service,"Credit Karma is a very popular app here on /r/personalfinance. I was personally a big fan. Unfortunately, Credit Karma has decided to add a binding arbitration clause to their terms of service.  

In effect, what this means is that by continuing to use Credit Karma, you waive your right to file a civil lawsuit against Credit Karma for damages or participate in a class action lawsuit against Credit Karma.

For example, if Credit Karma's security were compromised and resulted in your personal data being stolen, you would not be able to sue them in court. Nor would you be able to join a class-action lawsuit against Credit Karma.

Instead of a trial, you will be directed to undergo arbitration. Although an arbitrator is supposedly ""neutral,"" data show that such arbitrators overwhelmingly rule against consumers who bring forth complaints. For example, [the New York Times found that](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/business/dealbook/arbitration-everywhere-stacking-the-deck-of-justice.html) ""Roughly two-thirds of consumers contesting credit card fraud, fees or costly loans received no monetary awards in arbitration."" As [The Economist explains](http://www.economist.com/news/business/21690054-handling-disputes-between-companies-and-their-customers-done-better-europe), such outcomes occur in part because ""arbitrators have an in-built bias towards corporate defendants, because they bring repeat business.""

To their credit (ahem), Credit Karma is being pretty up-front about this instead of burying it in legalese. You have until November 14 to delete your account and uninstall the app if you do not want to agree to binding arbitration. Unfortunately, there is no way to opt-out aside from deleting your account.

These arbitration clauses have proliferated into virtually every sector of the economy. It will likely require federal legislation to undo the damage done to consumer rights. In the meantime, however, your best recourse is to end your relationship with businesses which employ such clauses, particularly when your relationship with the business is discretionary. 

Oh, and go fuck yourself, Credit Karma.",finance,1477955553
